rating,review
good,it is an okay place to work but not the best. treat you okay normal call center work 
good,A typical day at work is answering phones from 6:30 am until 3:30 pm.  Must be flexable for constant changes and proceedures.
good,"Acceptable work experience, paperwork driven, wirind and installation of uverse components."
good,"As a self-starter, I was able to excel at all tasks given and go beyond average expectations. The hardest part of the job was getting the right people to follow through to get the work completed. The majority of employees were complacent unless they were told to do their job. Gratification came from the knowledge of a job well done."
good,Typical day included taking incoming calls regarding cellphone and accessories. The hardest part of the job was converting customer inquiries into sales opportunities. 
good,work here for 9 months love it but the hired people temporay need a full time job
good,"Work is pretty much routine. You come in, assist customers, constantly upsell, and solve problems for customers. "
good,I enjoyed working face to face with customers to resolve thier service issues. . Coworkers were great and helpful. The hrdest psrt of the day was the commute home. I worked the second shift so i did not get stuck in the rush hour traffic very often.
good,Long hours no time for personal life and Thats about it. nothing else to say about it.
good,ok job got paid per job plus benefits were not good at all.  had to work 6 days a week like 12hour days
good,"Create trouble tickets with the customer, to have internet service restored quickly as possible. "
good,"- sales calls"
good,"No discrimination to anyone "
good,A typical day felt like a chopping block call center. You felt like you were under quota scrutiny. It was all about the sale and not about the customer. There were only a few good managers. The job was not enjoyable.
good,"muy mal manejo de personal"
good,"I have been here 16 years.  It has paid very well, but the job is very difficult & stressful and they continue to add work to the load without compensating for it."
good,"worked really hard in different area enjoyed working here"
good,these company cares about one thing...at&t.  they won't even give their techs free services.
good,"I enjoy what I do, I love working on computers and Customer Service. I am looking for a career not a job. There is no consistency or moral uplift.  A typical day at work is getting on the phone and helping customers get the best value for their money. I have learned not to take the angry customer personally. They are mad at the situatuin not me. My acting manager is involved, asks questions and is always available when a question or concern arises. Hardest part of the job is calming a disgruntled customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I helped a customer and did the best job I could."
good,Good I loved this job!!!!!!!!! Lost this job when they outsourced to right to work states.
good,Working for this company allows you to learn that hard work pays off while having a good time working with the friendly staff. 
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a team meeting at the shift start and approximately 8 hours on the telephone with customers. I solved issues ranging from equipment replacement, technical problems, billing and payment resolution, adding/changing/removing features, adding new lines of service, contract renewal, and selling add ons. I learned how to listen effectively before attempting to solve a problem, how to gauge a customer's frustration level, increased my customer service skills, and how to efficiently solve problems in a professional manner. The management was very helpful in continued training and feedback for job performance goals. I picked up several helpful tips from my coworkers who were more experienced. The hardest part of the job was performance measures concerning 24 hour and 7 day callbacks. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I solved a customer's problem, reassured them that I would do everything that I could to help them, and great satisfaction when a customer gave me kudos to management or in a customer satisfaction survey."
good,"Upper management didn't care about the front line employ's unless they made them look good. My fellow employees were great and I learned a lot, The hardest part of the job was just being yourself. The company wanted you to lie to customers to meet the bottom line. The money was great but you compromised everything about yourself. And god forbid if you are sick or have a medical consididtion"
good,"A typical day on the floor would consist of assisting customers with their accounts, informing them on new exciting services/products, and other service related tasks. Other essential tasks during the day were tracking metrics, coaching from upper management in relation to sales, and calling other departments for extensive periods of time in order to resolve certain issues which couldn't be resolved in store. Working for a company always at the cutting edge of technology helped improve my knowledge with technology, develop great time-management skills, and taught me a lot about customer relations through firsthand experience. This is a great job for any young adults looking to get their feet wet in a fast-paced/high quotas sales environment. Co-workers were all terrific, helpful, and were quick to help one another out in any way possible. Work/life balance is not a value for the company which clearly is portrayed through the overtime hours each coworker/manager had at the end of each week. Management will strive to help your performance, do their best to help you out with issues out of your hand, and will make their pressure from upper management extremely evident through their frustration. The most enjoyable part about the job was helping out grateful customers, learning new technologies, and the income."
good,"Company has really good benefits, unless you are located in one of the headquarter cities (Dallas and Atlanta) there is not room to advance."
good,Assisted potential and existing custmers in purchased of phone equipment and other services. I learn that your custmer must have your full attention and make sure you understand the customer by repeating everthing back to them. Iwork for a couple of managers but they never seem to stay around log enough to really get to know them due to them being transferred to other locations. My co-workers where great to work with they actually became part of the family because i would see them more than i would see my actual family. The hardest part of the job was to keep up with your sales goals when we where at our slowest months. The most enjoyable part of the job was be around your co-workers they would make your day to be a great day
good,Fun place to work as far as co-workers and daily games etc.
good,This is a very stess induced job which require a lot of patient and adherence to their schedule.
good,Answering calls is a typical work day.
good,High pressure office environment. Access to training and network information.
good,I am contracting at a major software company in Redmond WA. You can pretty much make your job here.
good,"As a Supervisor monitored calls and reported results, evaluated employees’ performance with scorecard and coached them one-on-one and in team meetings."
good,"Typical day at work- Meeting via commute or by phone in the am along with prepping leads for the day, door to door contact and presentations in the afternoon. Learned- widely applicable sales consultation and presentation skills. Management-relentless on numbers while giving insufficient and distant territory to acquire sales goals.Co-workers-everyone was awesome and supportive. Hardest part-door to door constant cold solicitation, residents are dominantly hostile. Most enjoyable part- fairly flexible schedule, meeting people, and the product."
good,upper management don't care about the worker bees. Very technical job and your knowledge will be tested by customers and upper management everyday
good,Field sales
good,"Managed a team of 7 in all aspects of Forecasting, funnel management and Technical sales."
good,"The people there were nice, but the training could've been better and the actual job wasn't bad, but it wasn't something I enjoyed doing."
good,"new challenges daily,no job is the same,not done until last custmer is visited and installed or repaired,management is company oriented,coworkers present a business/ family atmosphere, no job was too hard, it may have presented new challenges but always do-able. the most enjoyable part was the accomplishment of satisfying the customer and completing the job."
good,"Ambiente laboral bueno,Salidas en grupo de venta"
good,un día típico en el trabajo: abrir el puesto de trabajo orden y limpieza y vender con mucho entusiasmo hasta el fin de la jornada .
good,Job for somebody in school. Good money but could be better.Great co workers. Management is ok.
good,"era un lindo trabajo lastima que el salario como mencioné anteriormente no era el adecuado, al comienzo dijieron que el salario iba a ser jornada completa, y que los 3 primeros meses para prueba nos iban a tener media jornada, paso 9 meses de trabajo y seguía con media jornada, y no solo eso hacia hasta viajes, terminé dejando por que huvo una desilución de que no me cumplan con lo pactado en la entrevista laboral.-"
good,"This job was a great learning experience, fast paced and fun environment."
good,The job is not difficult. Demands placed by management makes it difficult. Working as a team is good experience.
good,I enjoyed working for Directv but they have a big turn over rate for laying people off.
good,"Compensation was decent. Sales oriented workplace, where daily goals are made and have to be met."
good,"the most enjoyable aspect of the job are the relationships you develop whether it be customer, peer, or colleague."
good,Easy to get into retail but very hard to get promoted to corporate. I wish it was easier
good,"Each day upon arrival, I was to immediately log into the phones and start taking calls from my first customer."
good,"its hard to work in a call center, you are micro managed. Great pay but very little room for advancement"
good,They pay isnt bad. It can be very stressful. Its all about luck and skill and your people skills. Expect to work MANY hours because they usually ask for mandatory overtime. Some managers are very helpful and some just dont care.
good,"Very nice company to work for. Extremely fast paced, extensive contact with customers. I've learned to be extremely empathetic with our customers. My coworkers are very pleasant. The hardest part about the job is short break times, days off and not being able to use the rest room when you really need to. Some people can mess it up for everyone."
good,Large company with strong benefits and secure employment.
good,"Travel to cellsites with shelters and outdoor cabinets, up hills, through farms, and in downtown."
good,A typical day would consist of back to back incoming calls/or chats from internal and external customers.. My multitasking skills were inhanced because it was neccessary to remain productive.. Management was fair and the majority of my co workers were team players. I can't pinpoint the hardest part of the job because im a fast learner and didn't find any of it to be hard..I most enjoyed learning the the different programs that were often put in place to help make us more productive.
good,Typical day at work was coming in hitting the phones and hitting your numbers.
good,Assisting customers with technical issues on daily basis.
good,"The pay was great,and benefits were awesome. The job was actually kind of extreme. more timely breaks. Job could get stressful"
good,I enjoyed most of what I did at SBC. Should have stayed and retired from there
good,"great pay with exceptional benefits. however, no concern for a family life. always made to work overtime by needs of the business. high stress made from management to lose job if workers do not meet quotas."
good,"Training was excellent, especially considering that this was my first step into the telecommunications industry. Trainers were very patient and helpful."
good,"I learned a lot about management and sales from this job, there were also a lot of great people working there. Hardest part to deal with is work-life balance."
good,a typical day is pretty much the same everyday making sure all thing are together for the audit such as money and paperwork
good,"There were many positive things I gained from working for AT&T and it afforded me opportunity to live a normal scheduled life while being a single parent. However, the management and mentality of the company created a very negative work environment, unfortunately. Being able to service my customers and make a positive difference for my customers and co-workers is what gave me drive to perform my job to the best of my abilities everyday."
good,I fail pole climbing that was a requirement of this job. I had applied for a inside technician but this was offer to me.
good,"Great place to work. Well organized. I was allowed to work from home. This had both pros and cons. Most days I worked well over 10 hours per day, meetings were held for home, but no home phone service was provided."
good,"Speaking with customers, managers, tech, enternal employment and knowing they are please with the service I have provided."
good,No eran buenos los dias se trabajaba con mucha presion no te reconocian nada.
good,"AT & T was known at that time as Western Electric. They made modems. This was way before any of us had computers at home. I had just gotten out of trade school (for electronics) and this was a great job to get. In those days all electronics was discrete. It was just after tubes and before the first microprocessor was available. I worked on analogue and digital electronics. We actually used an inverter to turn an AND gate into a NAND gate. This was a large operation with over 300 technicians working 3 shifts. I didn’t know what I was doing at first but I sure learned. We would teach each other how to troubleshoot. It was competitive to see who was the best at troubleshooting. We had scopes, signal generators, counters and the like to test the boards. I spent all day – every day for 13 years troubleshooting electronic circuits. Our company was likely the very first to use microprocessors. We used the original 8080 with 64k of memory. Only our ‘computer’ board had 8 chips with 1k of memory – one bit wide. It took 9 memory chips for our 1k of memory. Instead of one chip with everything on it (like today) we learned how a computer really worked down to the data and address lines. Can’t get that kind of training today!"
good,I loved working this type of job but the management had their pick of favorite workers
good,helping customers with their mobile phone needs
good,loved the work but the schedule wasnt very accomadating when needed
good,They say the 2 best days in a boat owners life is the day he buys it and the day he sells. I feel the same way about my time at AT&T.
good,"If you like retail, then go for it, training was fair, working in a retail store was not for me, they are union, they really don't help they just take your money. benfits were fair, there pay went down in 2007"
good,att will allow you to stay on top of technology and try it all.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is my customers and my employees. Between the two types, my job is always entertaining, challenging and interesting"
good,No job security what so ever just not a company that values there workers
good,"As part of the Enterprise Incident/Problem management team, our daily work was to investigate all current mission critical outages and to implement MTTR and MTBF improvements."
good,its hard work you may think talking to customers on the phone would be ease but i did for 4 + years and it is not ease. If you can meet the average handle times and save rate goal you can make good money and they will not fire you but drop below goal and you can get fired quick
good,"Working in the call center was the most stressful job i've had. I have never been so stressed out in my life. I had a hard time not being able to provide the level of customer i desired because this was such a large sales driven position. Once upon a time this company cared about the customers. Not anymore, this job pulled at my personality. And the turn over rate was wild. Its like it was revolving door. Lastly, the management were hilarious in the sense you'd have to sale your to them for them to not ride you like they you are wild bronco. Pressure! Not for me."
good,provided up to date training. took inbound calls and worked with management to mantain proper call handling the day was pretty easy once you have been trained and acustom to doing it.
good,Responsible for the installation and repair of phone lines connected to
good,"Enjoyable atmosphere, co-workers turn into friends fast. Customer base is wide and you have an opportunity to make some great money."
good,"I manage the retail stores stores for the Hampton Roads area. I was continually learning new ways to motivate and keep sales managers engaged to achieve sales goals. The job is very challenging, but rewarding at the same time."
good,"The job is good, however the amount of time available to family and life is not sufficient."
good,"I liked the job because it was a do it yourself job and most of the time the employee worked alone with the customers unless they needed help of course. Management was not the best... I learned the whole technical aspect of installing AT&T U-Verse TV, Internet and Phone services. I loved working with customers especially in their homes and also customers at their businesses. Good experience"
good,"Loved working at at&t just not in the store I was in :-) Awesome people to work with, loved working in customer service with some pretty awesome customers as well."
good,"On a typical day at AT&T, we will assist customers in their wireless needs. We will set up wireless personal accounts as well as small business accounts. We sell accessories and rate plans along with cellular phones to our customers. I have gained a lot more experience in customer service. I received my small business certification and have learned a great deal more about technology. The management is great. They are involved in sales are committed to helping us succeed in our sales goals. My favorite part about this job is my co-workers. We really get along great and help eachother co-sell. The hardest part of the job is to hit every metric required of us. We have targets that we have to hit, as well as things we have to pitch to every customer, every time. It can get difficult to hit every single thing."
good,"Great customer service, not enough pay for experience. To much of a turn over rate as well. Customers see new faces every few months."
good,A typical day at work is very productive. I have learned patience and the true meaning of respect and competitiveness within management. My co-workers are mostly female so it demands the ability to accept multiple personalities and moods. The hardest part of the job is also dealing with multiple moods but is also be the most enjoyable as weird as it may seem.
good,"Great people, lots of fun at work"
good,Cold calling appropriate size businesses from 100 employees to 500 set up appointments and do demo's of the technology that AT&T had to offer for large size businesses. Not only communication but data services as well became a big part of the executive level sales that I was in. Hardest part of the Job was that many parts of the territory were rural and didn't have the best service on the AT&T network at the time which was Northeast KY so that made it difficult to sale to some companies where the data service required the best service possible to communicate effectively.
good,"Review work for the day. Respond to e-mails, attend meetings if planned. Management is pretty much hands-off. Encouraged to work independently. Co-workers are the best. Helpful and very skilled. The hardest part of the day is to navigate through multiple databases to complete one task. The best part of my job is seeing a project thyat started out on paper / as a thought and seeing it to completion. Great satisfaction"
good,"I enjoyed my job and going to work everyday, I was a morning person. I enjoyed my coworkers, and we all worked together as a team in all we did. I learned so much while I was with the company, and the hardest part of the job was when they moved our department out of state, and I was unable to follow my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to find and solve a billing problem where we were able to save money for the company with lots of research and investigating. I really enjoyed all my managers I worked for except for one that really harassed me and made me very unhappy."
good,"Make good money and have great benefits, but there is no job security at all and is very high stress"
good,"Working at AT&T during this time included many changes. AT&T had just bought into the local cable company, kept it for a couple years then sold it to Comcast"
good,"Corporate culture focused, job is very high stress - high reward. Company always finds a way to lower incoming paycheck and reward dishonest behavior."
good,Management could really care less about the customer or service always want you to short cut installs or repairs.Company is not the same as it was when it was SBC.
good,"I worked here for a year. There is no work/life balance. They schedule you for 10 hr shifts and never give you a weekend off ever. The commission is really good if you can make it, however it depends on your location."
good,"Overall pretty good company to work for but lay-offs occur maybe twice a year. Great benefits, and pay."
good,"Sales position with great pay, Schedule always changes because it is retail. If you like sales than it is the job for you! If you are more about customer service than I recommend not applying. At&t treat all there employees like numbers and tell you you are replaceable. They claim to care about customers but there scores show other wise. Oh, you can get fired for poor customer service scores."
good,"I encountered 3 managers while working for At&t (formally Cingular). The last manager was not qualified and often made sexist comments. When contacting HR to report the manager, the lady knew the manager and stated 'he wouldn't do anything like that' and never filed the claim."
good,"It was a really rewarding job, in terms of compensation. However management at the time would push the sales team to scam customers into getting more than they need. Would often force employees to do things that were against policy, maybe even illegal."
good,Ni bueno ni mal salario... Piden mucho por poco...
good,"AT&T comprou a empresa que eu trabalhava, ""Directv."""
good,Different situations at every job site challenged me to use all areas of knowledge and experience and keep me on my toes.  It was rewarding to address and fix customer issues to supply promising service along with building a Professional relationship and trust with the customer
good,"Enjoyed my tenure with the company. If not for the lay off of my position, I would still be there.  The job teaches you the definition of being flexible."
good,"There are plenty of opportunities for collaborating. You would have the opportunity for self-training. There are free training opportunities within the company's library. "
good,"Working was good and had space for private activities and games when leasure like ping pong and basket ball."
good,Over the years the expectations to perform vs opportunities to see customers are unrealistic and the company has lost its values. There are good people here but the leadership is so far removed from realism because though they say upward coaching is accepted it’s not given nor is it received well.
good,the company was all about the dollar. they never took care of the employees and they considered the employees a number. they were easily replaced with someone else
good,"AT&T It is not an international company, it is more a domestic one, and the lack of international knowledge of other countries, culture in business, customs and personalities minimize their ability to integrate others."
good,It could have been more structured and professional. Overall it was not a bad job to have. There are just certain things that need to be improved in leadership.
good,This place is demanding and rewarding. great benefits. not so good work life balance. Dont have much more to say other than its am okay place to work. they are planning a lot for the 2020.
good,It’s a great place to build a name for yourself but if you want more make your self marketable based off what you learned from working here and applying that to your next position
good,Be prepared for constant changes and being told different things from different managers. It can be a great place to work if you are in the right store on the right team. Benefits are awesome.
good,"A day starts with meetings with calls from offshore regarding the updates on stories. Check clarifications on business specific questions, have meetings and document it. Implementation work (CODING). Have lunch and go for a walk around campus. Get back to the work reply to clarifications from offshore and provide the update on the implementation. Wrap the work around 6 PM."
good,People value their internet.  The product was also very reliable.  It helped me make some extra cash and it paid the bills. I can't complain.  I reccommend it if you like sales.
good,Working at AT&T is a great overall experience but it comes with many sacrifices that may entail losing some of your social life due to the hours required to work.
good,Every couple of years you have to do mandatory training to learn a job that has nothing to do with your own just in case a strike happens and all of a sudden you have to know how to work in a manhole or climb a telephone pole. Also you wonder if you're going to be in the next round of layoffs which seem to occur way too often.
good,A company I have worked at for over 20 years.  The company is changing but there a lot of opportunities.  The company has mentoring opportunities to help groom employees.
good,Great benefits but the job is repetitive and un-fulfilling. Very little room for corporate advancement. New duties added constantly without a change in compensation.
good,"AT&T Mobility was a wonderful company to work for when I was hired in 2005. The benefits package was not very expensive and for a single mom with 2 teenage kids at the time, that was a plus! We had lots of fun with the different activities we held throughout the year, but everything we did started dwindling away one by one. Before I left in 2018, they were sales driven and sales is not my strong point. Glad I'm  no longer there."
good,It a nice experience working in this company.Management is good. facilities are not that great. even you cant get a coffee in pantry. Where I worked it a old building.
good,Good company to work for overall. The only downside is pushing items that didn't necessarily meet the customers needs. Out of five stars I'd give it a three.
good,Overall it had it's good days and bad days. Long hours standing up but well worth it. This job was a quick temp job and got over after the holidays but it did help me.
good,We got transferred to this account because the original account that we support did not renewed or was discontinued. We supposed to have training for the account however it was not continued as well.
good,Probably one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Started out great but then quickly went downhill. I did door-to-door sales and that was the most challenging thing I’ve done.
good,Decent pay with added commissions. You get what you put in so it's important to be on top of your sales to add to your take home commissions. I found it best to actually know wat im selling by taking the time to know each phone and the benefits of it.
good,"A great company to work for. Retail involves strenuous hours. If you cherish work life balance, consider a different position outside of retail sales."
good,It’s ok but not a long term. Need to be able to transfer to make money. They push sales hard. Have to use vacation to get 40 hrs. Put up with angry customers on a daily basis.
good,"It was a good place to start learning the phone business. Although I had my problems with management, I met a lot of great people working there. It is not a place I regret working for."
good,"The pay isn't bad whatsoever for this type of position but there isn't much upward mobility outside of the sales org. If you're sales oriented, and a shark, you'll do great here. If you want to use this role as a stepping stone to a career outside of sales, good luck. The company values stockholders far more than employees and often advises employees to use unsavory tactics to secure the sale."
good,This company provided a good chance to continue your education in the communications field.  There are opportunities for advancement from the customer service career level to management.  Health care is provided.
good,It was a good job just the management wasn’t all that good. If I could do over again I would with different managers. A lot of things was fast paced..
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new customers and places every day. The discounts are really good too. No house is the same. Management will not bother you as long as you are making customers happy.
good,"productive work environment, incentives, fun environment, growth opportunity. starting pay scale should increase. additional training, and additional supervisor coaching"
good,The work environment is fine. Work culture is also pretty good. It is good learning experience. You get to work on the latest network devices and applications.
good,"The company does a lot of shady things and the employees end up getting fired for it even though we do what management tells us. Managers don’t prioritize work environment just sales. They favor people with good sales and give them whatever schedules they want even though it’s based on señority."
good,"it is a fun place to work, but the sales demands are almost impossible to meet. the people are great. it is very competitive and team oriented. the a majority of the calls that came did not come in as sell calls, we had to convert them."
good,Too many Chiefs in the kitchen giving directions about things they don't understand. This sets a poor expectations that the teams are going t fall short of unfortunately.
good,I was hired through a contracting service and was told it would be long term. After almost a year we were told the contract was ending and we would be hired in through the company but that didn't happen. We were advised later that company changed their mind. AT&T is a good company to work for if you can get your foot in the door.
good,If management and tech could work together and not against each other the company would run alot better. They   are losing techs because of management
good,"Worked for around one and half year,  work environment is not so perofessional there but is manageable. Would recommend it but have expectation that job will be ok...."
good,Muy buena compañia.Se trabaja sin presión alguna. Buenos jefes.
good,"es buena empresa para aquellos que no tienen compromisos económicos, que no tengan familia."
good,"ATT is a good place to work with good Job Work/Life Balance, compensation/Benefits"
good,"Constant change to the compensation structure made it hard to have a steady high income as a high performer. The compensation structure changed about 5 times in the years I was employed here. As a top performer, over time it became difficult to keep pace with higher raising standard quotas."
good,"I loved everything about the job, except their focus on Directv. That is all they care about. They don't care about the phones, or your customer service skills handling upset customers about their cell phone bills. They only care if you sell Directv, which is a dying product, that they keep raising the prices on."
good,Solo tuve media semana de capacitación en una sucursal y posterior a eso me movieron de sucursal y el gerente no tenia buen trato con el personal y malas practicas en lo laboral.
good,"- Every client that opens that front door is a sale"
good,I can not answer this question as I did not work for AT&T but for a third party branch of AT&T. This question is not applicable for me and not resourceful in order to help others seeking a job with them
good,"El trato en la empresa es demasiado competitivo, siempre innovando."
good,"At least one annual lay-off every year. Sometimes location-based, sometimes something else, you never know. I'm tired of old school management and a lack of accountability for where cash is spent. So much turnover is happening at the VP level to think anyone is safe. Lack of stability at the moment with cash savings being the goal of the company. Wait a few years and it might be a little more stable. Don't count on a proper matrix structure or your boss to respect a product manager's role. Don't expect the UX team to exist where you are so the right product gets built the right way. Will build tools, not products. Taking something to market is a dream that won't come true."
good,I had a fairly good experience at AT& T.  Except that they had a practice of letting people go at the end of the year unexpectedly.  This is why I would be concerned with going back to work for them
good,"You began the development program with a large group of college graduates, which was an easier transition to the work life. Typically you will answer emails, make ""x"" amount of outbound calls, create appointments with future prospects from the outbound calls, and close deals with current and new customers by understanding and solving their needs."
good,"Company lacked Managerial control, and not much assistance when needed. There was not enough training for the products, therefore we had to learn from each other."
good,Too Big to fail but lack of overall directions.  There is always enough work to go around but many red tapes to overcome.  co-workers are nice and helpful
good,"Employment at AT&T was Great Until the company Changed Management with people that no nothing about the job or what they were doing,as well as hireing nephews or brothers as managers that knew nothing of how the services work.working on the Services has always had its rewards."
good,I worked in a support department which was probably why I didn't see much opportunity. Perhaps it would be a bit different in a department where you wouldn't be constantly called and abused by customers.
good,Understanding the culture is important. Financial compensations varies upon contractual agreements. Wide ranging Job requirements which are frequently adjusted
good,Me gusto haber participado en desarrollar controles internos
good,The company itself is a great company to work for. The position itself not so much. Constant downsizing makes for a very uneasy career. The company does not seem to see the importance of this current position. They do however have a great product. Great benefits very good pay.
good,Answered customer inquiries. Management was somewhat supportive but its just a regular job. Do your hours and go home. Nothing too special about it but its an honest living.
good,"I’ve worked for AT&T for12 years in which I have experienced success in several channels of the company. AT&T is an innovative company that is constantly seeking to connect customers wherever they work and live, therefore, the company assures that their employees are thoroughly trained year round on all of these innovative changes."
good,Good pay and rewarding work. DIRECTV technical support and billing. Was also Case Management for DIRECTV correcting issues for customers that the front line technicians could not correct.
good,Very talented people around to work with  and you shoudl be really challenged with technical knowledge and details and at your best always all the time to keep with the space. Very mush job satisfaction.
good,"Dejaron de Pagar Comisiones, Subieron las cuotas y me cambiaron de tienda a una peor"
good,The job is a good starter for retail experience. I learned a lot of different behaviors and what I learned here I use in my everyday life. My team has been great to me since I've came on.
good,"Empleo con pocas prestaciones, aunque buen ambiente laboral"
good,"There is a cultural problem for women of color, so it is imperative to take advantage of the tuition reimbursement for personal growth. Additionally, network building and community partnerships are helpful."
good,I saw the contract going away and I bolted.  The employees were not treated well especially by the full timers who were being downsized due to the recent acquisition.    Tensions were high and It was time to go.
good,None to say it was along time ago .I really have nothing to say about this job. All I remember is at the call center it was a stressful job. Expectations very high
good,Had to call customers go to house and sai box to hook up service had to run lines if customers didn't have lines put up satlite dish for direct tv also had to do work on setting up tvs write reports of what I did on the each job the job also had to deal with customer service working in all weather and many overtime hours
good,"very busy and  challenging work., A lot of training.  I would work again at AT&T. Many differeent job apportunities to enhance your skills. Retired after 40 years."
good,"AT&T purchased Direct TV whom I worked for .After about a year there was  "
good,Depending on where you end up this is a company that is big enough to allow for growth over time.  You can move up within the company and experience new opportunities
good,At&t cut a lot of their benefit programs and went through budget cuts causing much more stressful and unbearable working conditions. Worked there for 3 years and decided I didn't want to be there anymore for these reasons
good,"A toxic work environment. Honestly I loved my job until I was ready to transfer back home and my management team tried to talk me out of it, once they couldn’t talk me out of it I was written up for all kinds of things like “not following sales flow” with customers I had built rapport with, and worked with numerous times. I was targeted, and forced to stay at a store that no longer made me happy. So I quit. When I quit I found out I had multiple write ups that I don’t ever remember signing, so I can never go back. I wish things were different because overall it was a good company to work for, but I’m glad my managers got what was coming to them."
good,Good pay and benefits however they were not focused on their employees feedback and or recommendations related to job duties. The work culture was mixed depending on management.
good,"Great coworkers, interesting internal projects, good exposure with customers. Overall nice place to work especially for someone who is half way in their career. Limited growth opportunities though."
good,AT&T was a good company to work for.  Great training programs and mentor programs.  There are opportunities to advance.  I would recommend working for this company.
good,It was a nice environment....met people from all kinds of cultures. Troubleshooting was our main job with mobiles and cable tv.  We also accepted payments from customers for their accounts
good,"The pay and benefits is excellent. The job environment is okay, but once management don't like you and don't want you there. They will do anything to get you fired."
good,"Att has a bunch of good benefits, however its a very corporate mentality and the management is alot of the time very micro.  if you can handle that, its not a bad place to work."
good,Good 1st job.  After a couple years you will be in a good place to move on or move up in the management ranks.  Most people stay but your skills can be used for any new job you apply for.
good,i would not like to talk about my experience with this current company at this time just note that is was a learning experience and i would like to keep growing as a tech
good,"Every day is a challenge, but lots of knowledge growth within the Cisco voice world. Employees are great people at this company, but like many giants in the tech world there is always a disconnect between upper management and the actual engineering/customer support level."
good,"A typical day would consist of dispatching on work tickets, whether installs or repairs. Assessing the needs of the ticket to perform the appropriate installation or repair tasks. Then trace or test for the repair location go to and fix the damaged wire and gain or regain services to the customers. Assist the customer in understanding and registering their services. Be available for questions until the customer was completely satisfied with their experience. Maintain a positive demeanor and professional attitude while representing the AT&T brand. Respond to customers questions when they call your company issued cell phone. Maintain your issued equipment to include company vehicle so that they are in highest functional working order. Restock vehicle at the end of the day to prepare for the following days work."
good,"they offer decent and competitive pay, downside is that it is still a call center. everything is built around metrics and you have to deal with customer's screaming in your ear."
good,Positive comments include good bonus plan and shift bid options. Improvement needed on temperature of the building and less micromanagement. More positive feedback and encouragement.
good,"upper management pushes products that are currently difficult to sell and does not offer enough help or guidance besides asking ""What went wrong?"" Compensation is good though."
good,company is good to work for. good benefits and the classic telecom work environment. Management could use some field training. Work based on a numbers spreadsheet was quite ridiculous.
good,"In the beginning, there was a lot of promises for advancement and growth.  After five plus years, was still in same position.  Nothing wrong with work, people are great, but became stagnant and repetitive."
good,No tengo evaluacion para dicha empresa  por lo tanto seria todo
good,I am a very hard working standout guy who likes the get the job done right. I am very goofy but always get my job done right. I am team player and always find the rules
good,"It was fine, I had a semi-private office, I could work from home, Management was supportive. There were too many meetings. Good movement to Agile and SAFe."
good,"They want you to work 50+ hours without overtime pay. They have no sense of work life balance. They have no desire to upgrade everything to fiber optics. They refuse to get rid of DSL or speed it up. They lie about the service speeds they offer. Every single customer complains about the speeds, especially DSL. They have a monopoly on service in so many counties, it's needs to be looked in to."
good,El ambiente dentro de la empresa y con los compañeros es bueno.
good,"workplace was relaxed by traffic was slow, pay was standard but commission structure was good, wish they would promote within more, my store had high turn over"
good,This company was interesting to work for. I gained some new experiences and tools as well as made some new friends. I’m just grateful to have had the job.
good,Good place to work. Good management. Good environment. All around a good place to work  you would enjoy it there if you like customer service and fast pace
good,"My experience at AT&T has been mostly positive, good company, good benefits, and good people. My challenge has been with the internal process to get things done, and the level of effort it takes to accomplish tasks. At times I felt like I would languish and felt like I was on an island."
good,Good benefits and competitive pay.  Flexible work schedules.  Opportunities to move between departments.  Unfortunately the possibility of layoffs is pretty high and frequent.
good,Environment requires being adaptive to change in schedules and everyday work life. Patience and ability to adapt to multiple personalities. Competitive learning experience.
good,"The benefits are good for this area, time is great once you have been employed for a few years. Can't really complain too much. Sales are a requirement now."
good,"Lots of calls, but can be good with the right attitude.  If you work hard, you could go far, just exceed goals and you have that chance.  Hours aren't easy to cope with, as seniority rules, but acceptable."
good,Constantly changing vendors leads to lack of continuity in workplace.  There are a lot of changes going on at AT&T so direction can be confusing as leadership changes.
good,"I loved my experience was able to learn "
good,Learned different skills with customer service issues while there. Processing orders in timely fashion was required and met by me on day to day basis. Even exceeded quota needed per day and assisted other groups with their needs to help entire team.
good,Job was decent but centered on commission and made it difficult to hit your numbers. Week to week numbers are hard to hit when it is necessary to sell multiple services.
good,att was a good company to work with but over the time I was working there the company found ways to decrease the ability for a sales rep to make money. got to the point where I wasn't able to continue on with them.
good,"Had a good experience and learned a lot during my time there."
good,The job was cool. A lot of different stuff and unrealistic goals just to make the smallest paycheck but the culture was nice and the workers really become your second family
good,The customer service rep position in the call center became more difficult when they acquired Directv. I wanted to be a true customer service rep but they were heading into a duel role of customer and sales. We were given certain sales quotas we had to reach in order to succeed. It was a very stressful environment.
good,Managers under intense pressure to bring in tv and internet subscriptions is unhealthy for the work environment and customer experience. Ease up on the pressure
good,Have to be mentally and physically strong to be a wire tech. There will be a lot of six day work weeks and a lot of long hours worked every day. Have to be organized and be able to work on your own.
good,"Not bashing AT&T but It defenitly is not the same company it used to be.  It's a big company trying to find it's way since the sharp decline of the  home phone, and cable service subscriptions"
good,"Fast paced sales job, demanding customers, no work culture and no work life balance if under ~6 years with the company depending on location. Met a lot of talented and good characters while working here."
good,"No matter how much you sell, it was just never enough. Job was centered around only store numbers and there wasn’t much work/home balance. Management not very sympathetic to problems happening in personal life saying,”I don’t care what’s happening at home, we’re adults that have to come to work and do our jobs.” I was told this after my relationship had ended and I was emotional at work."
good,I had to work 12 to 14 hours daily which was good sometimes but not all the time. I had Tuesday and Wednesday off which is terrible when you have a family and are involved in church. Then I was laid off within a year of being hired.
good,"Learned processes. Applied myself. Advanced in the job.."
good,"It was cool. Nice experience for college students, decent pay. scheduling was pretty good as well. standards for commission was reachable depending on what location you are working at."
good,AT&T paid pretty good (not good enough for what the job called for). Very fast pace environment and if you couldn't keep up you would be gone. Managers were cool as long as they were making their numbers.
good,In a typical work day you would take back to back calls and managers now have to stay on you about selling products. The hardest part of the job is trying to sell non wireless related products.
good,Hard work to life balance. Lots of driving and basically surprising customers. Sales are hard and the market is flooded. Good idea but the have too many people doing it.
good,"AT&T had its ups and downs. The culture is not great, but the work experience is a great way to start coming out of undergraduate. I believe they have become more modern and have a better culture since I left in 2014."
good,Buena empresa estaría mejor si pagaran puntal y a tiempo
good,"Good job, not micro managed depending on your manager.  Lots of travel. work with public in their home and business.  Technology based company that changes as technology changes. Greedy CEO"
good,I felt like a criminal every time entering building. Too many lies told to employees and customers. There was too much pressure to increase data usage for customers that did not need it. Customers were so dissatified with plans but had a hard time lowering bill.
good,"Management needs a little work, customers can be ridiculous at times, but if you like sales then this is the job for you. Uniform was comfortable and shifts were doable."
good,Was not a huge fan of the commission structure or tactics used to hit goals. Stayed for the people more than the company. Was a good supplement to a school schedule that allowed for full time money working part time hours.
good,"The overall experience was OK when I worked in AT&T. The work load is fast paced, sometimes have to work on weekends and overtime. People are diversified and generally nice."
good,"Because they surplus my position, and could have moved me to another department as big as the company is, there is no need for layoffs. Was very disappoited."
good,"call center environment, salary was not good, management did not care about their employees. the most enjoyable part of the job was was the relationships that i built with my co workers"
good,Great Bennifit’s and compensation room for advancement and growth .very goal and metric driven it’s been okay .hope this answer suffices you’re need to know
good,Love my job. The company began to be all about the numbers. Sometimes it seems as if you as a person didn't matter. It is a good company to work within.
good,"Hard work with a lot of elements to deal with "
good,"This job can be very competitive depending on where your located at. The managers have to work as consultants and tried to get paid multiple ways. They took away Assistant Manager positions and lowered it to Manager-in-training where you get paid the same. They pay is based on experience. If you're looking for a decent commission based job, this could be it. I just wouldn't stay long term."
good,The company has good benefits but you will struggle with a work/life balance. It’s very important to make sure you work with a good team along with great managers as well.
good,"Working at AT&T was a normal retail working experience.  Goals were set for everyday, every week and every month.  The company was very focused on reaching these goals no matter the cost."
good,"I enjoyed working with different team members, however the turn over rate was very high.  They tend not to hire for management positions with in the area team.  Working for A T & T was always a growing experience.  With the upgrading of technology,  I always left work feeling well accomplished and knowing that I provided the best customer service experience for my customers."
good,Fun fun fun fun fun fun exciting exciting fun fun fun exciting no longer there training training worked every weekend no weekend or holidays off closed every day during the week
good,"A typical day at at@t was very very very stressful. I did learn alot about technical support, but not in training from the production floor (other agents)"
good,"-Led solutioning and planning the execution of 16 ($75K to $700K) cloud transport infrastructure/feature projects for global datacenter expansions using waterfall and agile approach. "
good,"good job to work for "
good,"project manager"
good,I don't want to complete this section and it should be required. I thinks it's ridiculous that I need to review by employer to submit on a job.  You need to
good,I'm a Directv legacy employee and things are constantly changing.  Since AT&T took over 3 years ago there have been several lay offs and more to come.
good,"Fine experience overall. Would recommend, but have to understand how an organization like that operates.  It takes time to move things forward and with its size can become frustrating."
good,I moved down here and accepted this job for a better future for my family but yet I am stuck between either striking for the company because they won't negotiate to make a better work environment for employees .
good,Company is okay but can use improvement in regards to how it responds to customer's issues. The approach taken to resolve a large customer is only adequate enough for part of the customer base and often leaves customers not wanting to continue to do business with ATT.
good,If you do your job well you get treated well and you have opportunity to move up in the company. You are paid hourly plus commission but commission fluctuates.
good,"Once the merge of Cingular and At&t happened, it has slowly but surely went downhill. At one time it was the BEST place to work, employees felt appreciated and valued.  Not the case today."
good,"Bueno ambiente de trabajo, pero mal capacitación general."
good,"It’s a good company to work for. Has lots of benefits, growth opportunities and career paths. Tuition reimbursement to support your education as well!"
good,"Directv was a great place to work, people worked together. AT&T bought the company everything changed, hundreds of people were laid off. "
good,Very fast paced and sometimes stressful environment. Great perks with the company such as free DirecTV and discounts to restaurants and concerts. Management was subpar.
good,Doing tech support was really fun and getting to watch sports while you worked. But when AT&T bought Direct TV they started sending a lot of jobs over seas and made you sweat if you were still employed
good,"They have great wages starting out.  There is quite a bit of opportunity for advancement as long as you are able to sell.  Everybody knows everybody in the area so it’s easy to become comfortable with your higher ups.  But in the store, management changes frequently which alters what the store is focusing on and what new standards are put in place.  Selling phones is not the difficult part or the focus really.  There is an overemphasis in selling TV service which can be very difficult because it’s a dying industry.  You work with many disrespectful people on a daily.  If the store is dead, you are going to sit for a long time.  If you have good coworkers, it makes it easier.  There is a union and good job security."
good,"Attendace point system sucks!!! When i worked there, you were only allowed 6 points for the whole yr. That's not even 10%. You do the math! Some managers are reasonable while others act like they aren't humans themselves."
good,"Too sales pressure driven. AT&T used to be a company that created a positive work environment, but now you are just a number and it's all about what sale you just landed. Some managers are not personable with you, you are just another replaceable number if you are not top 5 in sales."
good,ATT is a big company that you can find different activities over there. you will find good but old people at att. notice that there is no job security for any one at ATT
good,The higher ups werent too bright. Didn't treat employees too well. Probably why the store I was in closed. Drove me out of retail. Wouldn't work with your schedule at all.
good,Very high pressure sales job.  Daily goals need to be met or possible discipline can be received.  Manager work with sales reps and coaching is done on a daily basis.
good,"I went through multiple transitions here. I can say that at large companies like this, there's always a surplus at some point. So, be careful, or ready to move to a regional or main headquarters at some point in your career with them (DFW)."
good,Es un excelente trabajo con crecimiento laboral y buen salario
good,"Es pesado trabajar ahi, los horarios y los descansos no estan equilibrados. Buena Empresa para hacer una carrera, buen sueldo pero un 3 de 5 esta en lo correcto."
good,Work at AT&T as a technician is a wonderful start to a persons young career it provides plenty of benefits and above average pay however the work hours are very stressful and managers come and go you have to be a self-starter
good,"It was a good place to work. But it wasn’t for me. I was not crazy about having to try to sell 5 different products on every call I felt as if it was insulting to the customers "
good,"This was before the merger, but I had good overall experience at DTV. Main thing was lack of other opportunities. I was stuck in the Huntsville site, and on site leadership lacked direction."
good,"Like most jobs, it has its plus and minuses. The pay is incredibly good. It's a union based job so the pay has to be good. In my opinion, management is okay as long as you do your job."
good,I’ve been here for awhile I started off being on the phones I was a retention specialist so I helped save the customer then I got off the phones to move up and help out more it is a good job
good,I didn't even work for that company that long. I can't tell much from this company since it's been over a year from working on another company that drained my mental sanity.
good,"Company is in a transition phase right now. Management makes the biggest difference.  If you are fortunate to report to a good manager, you will have a good experience."
good,"If I was able to enjoy a call center environment, I would not be looking for a new job.  Incentives are paid on three separate goals each month.  Goals are subject to change without notice.  To get paid the most, have a low disconnect rate (retain all AT&T services, get satisfactory customer surveys. low customer callbacks and sales.  "
good,Flexibility with work schedule but work load is fine for a een balance for work and home life. Average job with Average pay. I do enjoy it. But always looking for advancement
good,"There are some great people that work there. Work life balance, well close to non existent! It is who you know and not what you know. It starts off great, as you progress in sales you are identified and awarded for you achievements.  But, as you climb the ladder it changes drastically. The smile you would come to work with dissipates and the culture is based on the mood of you leader. This company is hard on personal relationships, they often ask you to do things outside of work like team builders and dinners, taking time away from family."
good,Formal business with not much work life balance. try to make friends with workers in your department for a better work experience in the office spaces.
good,Loved the people I worked with. They had a great setup. Did not always agree with some of their rules. Was not able to continue to work due to being sick so was let go.
good,"lots of hours available and flexible schedules to work makes it easier for the employee to put in hours for a good salary. incentive program is great, and good to have a little something extra to work harder for."
good,"Buena compañía pero deberían de mejorar el trato al personal , sin embargo, en términos generales es una buena empresa"
good,Buena empresa para iniciar tu experiencia laboral pero con prestaciones muy bajas
good,i loved my job at AT&T i learned Alot and met like long friends i wish i had more time but i was unfortunately let go after a work injury that was not my fault but i would work there again if i had the opportunity .
good,"Job is very demanding,  inform you one thing and on the production floor you are only prepared for half of what you need to know. Poor training,  upper management is dysfunctional,  no one knows what goals are needed, how to reach them until to late,  policies change every month,  to fast for management to know and the blame always fall on the rep.  Okay pay good, people ok, but job sucked"
good,The job itself was enjoyable and taking care of the customers was the priority of the front line employees. There is beginning to be a mass exodus among field employees and management due to the fact the job security is no longer there. There have been so many surpluses recently employees are scared for their jobs.
good,The company offered a lot of training and core classes to keep up with the technology.  They also offered the ability to work remotely in certain job roles.
good,Based on never knowing what time of day you will be getting off work. Only one full weekend off a month. Very stressful keeping up with performance numbers that is out of your control. Management is very poor
good,"Company had strong employees in its begining. Employees were fortunate to work with Illinois Bell, other Bells and ameritech. However somewhere after ameritech their ceos mismanaged that company terribly they began to loose revenue and that resulted in yearly layoffs. Millennials were hired and the company has been going downhill."
good,"As a part time sales associate I made $31,000 my first year. With the commission there’s opportunity. I think it’s easy to get burnt out at this job though. You deal with a lot of angry customers. AT&T is always changing the commission structure and their products and services as well. There’s always going to be something new to learn or sell."
good,I encourage you to go to work everyday in something comfortable and to also be prepared to deal with people whom are upset about their devices as well
good,"drive to each customer house be efficient, provide great customer service,"
good,"Working here was one of the most stressful times of my life, and yes the job was most of the reason why.  Yes, you over compensated for the work you do but you'll be selling your soul in the process.  The people you meet are under the same circumstances, so you build strong bonds towards each other. I love and miss all of my co workers at AT&T, but wouldn't work here again if it was my last resort! Just my experience though, some people may feel differently. Drinking the cool-aid is easy to do in an environment like that one."
good,"Very active, interesting and rewarding job. I loved this job, I loved being outside and feeling like my own boss. The weather was the best and worst part about the job. Company benefits and perks were outstanding."
good,"Pros: Competitive pay and benefits with on the job training. "
good,I did not like the culture. Difficult to get the job done.  Several layers of redundancy.  Negative management style. Co-workers were reluctant to assist for fear of competition.
good,I Like my job fun place to work great environment with great co-workers and management overall love working for the AT&t as a whole company. But have to look elsewhere.
good,I loved being an AT&T employee. This was a great company to work for. The hardest part of this job was deciding to move on. AT&T has a wonderful workplace culture.
good,"Management is okay at the technician level, but When it gets to staff level is where it goes to bad. Pros: Top pay 26.09. Company pays for everything. Company vehicle, gas, tools, half off att everything. "
good,It was a super good experience. but very challenging. But overall it paid off and ended up being a good experience that I don't regret at all. I wouldn't do it again but it was cool.
good,It is a competitive environment. Work day consists of selling and handling customer issues of customers. Management can be inconsistent. Hardest part of job is dealing with poor communication and expectations of managers as well as inconsistency on type of people promoted or favored.
good,nothing i need to discuss Buys other companies then lays off their hourly employees in order to pay for them and make sure corporate gets there million plus yearly bonuses.
good,Office was closed and forced to take buyout or move. While working there supervisors we're not the best communication between management and employees was horrible
good,"Possibly the most stressful entry level position I've ever had. But it all depends on your direct manager. If your direct manager is ok with letting you work your own sales process it probably won't be that bad. If they are not it can be very stressful to continue working under them. The pay and benefits are good but if the unnecessary stress of a forced and fixed sales process doesn't crush you, then you could probably do well here. Unfortunately I had only 1 of the three managers I had at that time who were willing to allow my own process to be used."
good,Many of the first level management were very interesting on helping out. I got several customer service awards and learn many technics in dealing with the customers and how operations work in order to make a positive workplace culture.
good,"The lay off threats for certain job positions is a very stressful existence there. Outside of the, the first level of management was good, the second and third levels very untrustworthy. The union is useless, and seems to let the company do whatever they want to do."
good,The pay is excellent however they have to many Layoffs. You can't work for worrying about being surplused. Favor is shown to certain people if you are
good,While working here I was one of the top sales associates and I enjoyed my job. There were many times when corporate would be unsatisfied and we were told that we were replaceable. That personally never happened to me but it was not motivational for many of my coworkers.
good,Productive company good pay and great management. Will definitely recommend to anyone needing a new job. A lot of area to grow in the company. Just have to want it
good,AT&T was a call center environment where superior customer service was a MUST! There I learned to help customers resolve billing discrepancies and suggest new products and services that would help the customers based on their current services.
good,"No Job Security. Company is changing so fast, long term employees are being let go at a rate of about 1000 + per year. only concerned about the stock price."
good,The work environment was fun and the people were great. Unfortunately the training was entirely too far to go to and payment for training was not accurate.
good,"Get your foot in the door, get your sales experience and get out. Most managers lack ethics and morals, most the time I would consider a rep to be a server. The only time you sell is when you’re selling Direct TV or DTV now. The managers will teach you to up sell, but the MAJORITY of the time they will want you to scam customers. (EMPHASIS ON SCAMMING). It’s VERY easy to be consecutively a top rep (cough), these are viewpoints and perspectives from someone who had mostly a  a good experience at the company’."
good,"It's a good place to work if you're not interested in career advancement.  Personnel that start in a certain position tend to stay in the same position.  If you're looking to move up the corporate ladder, this is not the place for you."
good,AT&T pushes their employees too hard to reach impossible goals all because people push for sales bonuses. The goals are set at a high standard that makes it very hard to succeed
good,The company had a lot to learn. They put their own needs first and customers second. The management lacked experienced and had to much personal things going on.
good,"att is constantly moving people around and laying people off, in the current environment there is no room for advancement into management or a higher paying job"
good,I worked for 15 years in one office although the job paid well and the benefits were excellent the stress level was at times to much. You were required to maintain a 100% or higher score on monthly scorecard and less then 50% of the office maintained this
good,At&t looks into everything you do in the system & if one person makes a complaint about you then you get investigated & ultimately lose your job! It doesn't matter if your a top seller or not the company doesn't look after you what so ever
good,job not secure sales quotas must be met quick to fire. hrs are long mandatory overtime weekly. management not very helpful at times but seem more concern with their bottom line
good,Great culture while still Directv everything changed after AT&T took over. Pay is good and benefits were good after att took over my site stopped hiring from outside of the company which killed morale
good,Not a lot of advancement opportunities but good while finishing school or exploring other options...the health insurance benefits and service discounts were enjoyable
good,"The benefits are great, a bit on the expensive end for families. There is a lot of micro-managing and you will be called out for lack of meeting goals. Management in the store I was in sucked!! They hired management based off of the relationship the upper management had with them. On a better note, having the support from the union was a great feeling. I did enjoy the raises every 6 months and the 2 weeks of vacation every year."
good,"If you love working overtime and don't have family, this maybe good job for you. The pay is decent if you don't have college degree and not much working experience."
good,"Customer Service/Sales"
good,The company is headed in a good direction as far as media content is concerned. More focus appears to be on that and automation than actually taking care of the field workers and customers. The direction the company is headed in is truly the goal and the goal has been transparent. Benefits and employee discounts are good. If you are willing to move to a hub city and are an IT or media person a great company to work for
good,"When I first started AT&T I loved working there. The company does not care about their employees and they micromanage your life away. They are terrible when it comes to sick time as well. Everything is a point system with them, even if you have a hospital note."
good,"I worked here starting with a great Vibe. But there are too many politics that rejected my full time application as I pointed mistakes in the current BI processing unit. I was hired through IBM and several other Vendors passed all the interviews. But, the final round of interview never happened because they knew that I am the person who pointed all the mistakes in BI process."
good,At first the company was good to work for but the longer I was there the more they seemed to keep pushing the people who had been there the longest out and bringing new people in.  I found a new career and new it was time to leave.
good,"I worked at AT&T for 11 years and saw its decline, favoritisms and politics.  Its an ""about me"" or ""about my career"" company who cares little about the ones at the frontline."
good,I loved my job at AT&T and was given the autonomy to both grow professionally and in my daily responsibilities. All that changed with the re-org and managerial change. Morale nosedived and I left for another company.
good,there needs to be less favoritism and they also need to balance out the hours worked versus compensation.
good,Good for a stepping stone to a different career but I didn't have the best experience in the sales position. There was a lack of traffic in the store in general.
good,"The company overall is not bad, but the system is very complex and it take you over six Months to learn it."
good,muy buenos beneficios generales y un lindo lugar para trabajar.
good,"8 - 5 work hours, less flexible work hours,"
good,I enjoyed working for the fast placed company. They taught me a lot. We would open the store up and then we would wait for customers to arrive. Upsell them on newer devices and accessories.
good,Truly a great place to work if willing to sit in call center. Was able to learn from great employees. Super competitive if willing to work hard. OT was there.
good,"Many years working in and leading teams of computer systems developers, especially in areas supporting Human Resources. In recent years focused on the budget, governance, and priority of HR systems and planning."
good,"It is truly a large organization with a storied history and to be able to interact with customers was a unique experience which strengthened my character. Management could be both a great source of information and guidance, but also a challenge to meeting deliverables. Overall, these challenges made me a better employee and stronger person."
good,"This was a highly stressful customer service/sales job, with the main focus on sales. Metrics driven, micromanaged, repetitive culture. The people you work with are actually great, but the sales  objectives come from people at the top who would never be able to live up to the unrealistic goals they themselves set."
good,"The wrong people lead this company. We have to compete against our other store, our customer service , online, and other departments and the goals get hiigher and higher every year."
good,"Ever since the company's last CEO retired, the new CEO and company leadership has a  lot to be desired. It's sure not the company I started with almost 30+ years ago."
good,After 19 years with no negative appraisals I was laid off just to cut costs.  CEO is just about making money and does not care about his employees.  Direct management are great people to work for but upper management does not care if they affect peoples livelihood.
good,Great company to work for if your interested in technology and innovative products.  AT&T is a diverse company with opportunities for growth and career advancement.
good,When I first started working there it was cool and all. I really only liked one of my coworkers and the others were kinda rude. You made decent money.
good,"Working in a call center you are just a number to managers. All they care about are your numbers each week. Not all managers check in with their team or take time to see how one is progressing. Company has a terrible sick policy and they don't accept a DR's not to excuse you even if you are highly contagious . Pay is decent and you get a discount on company products, about the only good thing about working there. You also get split days off which not one person mentioned in any interviews with the company."
good,"Working for AT&T (BellSouth) pre merger, was fun and felt fulfilling. The focus was on the customer's needs and the technicians were given the tools necessary to accomplish that. After the merger, AT&T was focused on the shareholders and individual production ratings. The focus on the customer was completely lost and workplace morale completely fell by the wayside. The company is very big and has a lot of great training and innovations. But without customers, it has nothing. If you don't care to feel accomplished, like worrying about your job security and only want to be constantly reminded that you're not doing as well as they want you to be, then this is the company for you."
good,"Doing Door-To-Door sales is an experience you'll never forget. The people you meet, the things you see, and the stuff you have to deal with. It can also be extremely hard for some people, a big risk giving that you're putting so much time and effort into something that doesn't always pay off 100% of the time. Running in a suit in the hot sun, the wet rain, the blistering cold, just to get ignored, yelled at and almost beaten by phony tough guys who've just started hitting the gym. But, there's also a lot good, great - beautiful people that you meet that you'll never forget. A great opportunity if you have the goods and you know how to deliver and make sales. They invite you to parties, clubs, concerts, they have you travel, and in all that you're making money, but if you close you ain't doing none of that. They put you in such close proximity with others (your co-workers) all the time. Chance are you're not gonna like all of them, some of them are gonna straight tick you off. They have these super unnecessary, annoying challenges that you have to do, and there ain't nothing you can do about. Humiliating you, weighing in on your soul, for no reason. So, in conclusion you either hate it or you love it. Me... I don't really know how I feel about it looking back on it now, but would I do it ever again?l No."
good,"I loved the doing the job itself, but hated the micromanagement. Management was more worried about trying to catch you doing something that wasn't 100% by the book versus if the customer was satisfied with the work that you were doing."
good,A typical day at work starts off with reviewing emails and completing any outstanding work from the previous day. Being assigned designated queues to resolve or forward to appropriate departments for further research.
good,They look at quotas for Premium Video and business leads/CRU based on 20 percent increase year over year but they don’t take into account there numbers are based on accounts that were created because of false churn and then to hit new quotas you are forced to commit the same fraud that got you there which isn’t a big deal because everyone makes money and hits their fake quotas EXCEPT ATT lol this is pretty much done on a wide scale throughout the country (probably why they are billions in debt) and everyone is in on it from installers for premium to area managers for ATT and they all want to hit their quotas so they keep their jobs but all the reps are risking their own jobs by doing so it’s a system that’s going to fail unless widespread restructuring takes place coworkers were great though and this is just one aspect of the job that is terrible others include horrible Star8 calls and declining commissions
good,"Good pay, but the way they want you to treat customers is shady at best just to meet numbers. The company also does all of its marketing to get people to go online for purchasing, but require you to meet the same numbers in store. Seems to me they're phasing the store locations out eventually."
good,Over all I enjoyed my experience. The work hours are overwhelming sometimes and the commission is the other down to that job the emphases very friendly
good,"It is a good company. good colleagues, good salary, good boss, good environment, good trainings, good leaders, good workplace, good benefits, overall good ratings"
good,"Get ready to work a ton of mandatory OT on short notice. There is tons of pressure for sales!!! Management is constantly walking around asking their employees what sales and upgrades have they done throughout the day. Weekly meetings of stack reports, it's all about numbers. One week after completing training, we all assigned mandatory OT, this started out as 1 hour per day to 2 hours per day. If you're single with no kids this is the ideal job for you.  As a mother to 3 kids and working Saturdays, getting out of work late, I felt this job was not for me. The pay is great, plus all the discounts you'll receive are absolutely amazing!! While taking a call, if you place a caller on hold you are to status them every 1 1/2 minutes, if not there is management who monitors your calls and will plug into your call and listen, or they will message you through work messenger asking what are you doing, same goes for after call work, you better have your account and noted before taking the next call. ACW is frowned upon!! If  you're late from any break they will go looking for you and or be waiting at your desk for an explanation."
good,work was slow paced. everyone did job required. job did not require much math or being attentive to details. breaks were set appropriately according to start time.
good,"You work a ton of hours and are treated as a second rate person. one 2nd level manager even stated "" Any monkey can pull cable"". "
good,"Typical workday consist of sometimes having a morning huddle or meeting to give us information on whats going on or whats coming up in the field. The job in itself is rewarding because every customers house is different and creates a challenge to put your own stamp of approval on it. Meaning if you have a customer that has nothing but issues, numerous senior technicians come out to keep passing the job to the next tech, but you are the technician that takes the time to dissect the problem, fix the problem, and create a positive moment for the customer to regain the confidence in the company. Unfortunately, there is no work/life balance at all. The workload is not balanced which creates home life issues and the company does not care to understand that there is life outside of their workforce. Dispatch consistently putting more jobs on you unexpectedly, and its completely on you to complete all jobs placed on you."
good,"Required overtime, never know what time you will be off work.   constant change in management, sometimes you are forced into a crew with poor managerial skills."
good,"At&t is a great company and has many great employees working there. Having spent many years with them I learned a many skills sets that I was not only able to use at work but also in my personal life. The culture overall can be great,  but just like anywhere can be soured by a few ""bad eggs""."
good,"Discussion with stakeholders"
good,Working in a call center environment you encounter all types of people on any given day and you had to stick to adherence. Getting paid time off sucked.
good,Love going door to door helping customers. Closing deals and making lots of money was a motivator and that's something that kept my employed at AT&T. Good place to work.
good,"i worked here so long ago, before the iphone came out."
good,"ATT has so many layers of management, it seemed nearly impossible to get the same answers from any 2-4 people. It is a bureaucratic mess. But the pay is good and work environment is good."
good,"Work environment is good "
good,received each job via iPad with work flow.  followed work flow with each job checking off each task to complete install or repair in all weather conditions.
good,"I had a great manager, worked with amazing people. I've did sales before so I thought this job would be great.  After I had been on the floor for a while, I was informed I needed to be ruthless. They truly do NOT care about their customers.  I had to try to sale no matter the situation. Son in the hospital on life support, I had to make the offers at least 3 times. Just lost your job.....still had to offer. The list goes on. There is no empathy for anyone. The benefits are awesome. So, if you can be ruthless, you will probably do great. If you have a big heart who cares about people, look somewhere else."
good,I would have loved for the company to take some advice from the technicians and let the techs help the company save more  and profit. It would have also been good to train all the techs properly before they are released in to the work load
good,"Clock in the phones, reschedule customers that were not available when the technician arrived or leave a voicemail for the customer to give us a call back to reschedule their appointment."
good,It is a great overall job if you don't mind dealing with complaining customers. The hardest part is saving them from cancelling when their mind is set. The pay and benefits are great but they will let you go for just about anything without warning. You also have to pay for parking.
good,Very stressful for middle management.  There is a lack of communication from the top down.  The Union CWA creates a lot of issues when you are attempting to hold employees accountable.
good,"I love the company - I do not like the employee lay-offs, contract completion and no-hire, managers can be more knowledgeable, no training, the fact that contractors are more knowledgeable that most long time employee's, contrators do more work by far than employees."
good,I was with AT&T for almost 10 years.  During that 10 years I had 7 different positions and 10 different managers.  Each year the commissions got smaller and the targets got bigger.  Its a good place to start a career because they have a lot of training.
good,Los resultados no dependen de la gestión propia y se es medido con respecto a estos
good,"ATT is a desirable place to work, although it can be slow moving at times.  I came with the Directv acquisition in 2017, and it has been an acceptable place to work, but nothing special."
good,The commission goals are difficult to meet in small towns and the don't hire enough people for the store. Overall it's a fun place to work if you have a helpful team
good,This job was fun because of the social work environment. You can make a lot of friends. There is room for growth in the company after working at least a year. It feels like the company only really cares maximizing profit and limiting liability at all cost.
good,Great job and location. I really enjoyed the culture. We had so many different nationalities. It was a melting pot. I learned alot about myself and others at this company.
good,"Working at AT&T can result in above average pay given the hourly/commission structure. Typical day includes greeting customers and providing complete solutions for their wireless and home needs. Management is inconsistent, mostly from top down. Workplace culture is generally okay, though there is a lot of constant changing that leads to less than ideal work culture. Hardest part of the job is being held accountable for things out of your control, such as missed installations (technician fault), and poor service quality available to particular areas. Most enjoyable part of the job would be the ability to legitimately help a customer,the company, and yourself when presented with the opportunity, and given the tools necessary."
good,"The work environment was very stressful, the office environment was great but the management was less than great. The culture for achieving is less th"
good,AT&T was an OK gig. It's a true sales minded organization. The higher up management had a lot of rules for store employees that they didn't necessarily follow themselves.
good,The company is truly taken a turn for the worse. a lot of lay off happening since last year with very little advancement as a tech position.no certain time of getting off work u work till the work is done for the day.
good,"One of the biggest companies in the world, ok work environment, management team ok, fast-pace, can be stressful at times, promote from within and good people to work with."
good,"It was a very stressful office environment, harsh micro-management of the staff. The company supposedly was a good company to work at other than the local office location."
good,A typical day at the store start for myself at 12pm and can end anytime after 9pm. Management reviews the daily goal and then we hit the floor running. I would say that the most enjoyable part of the job would be the smiles you see on the customers face when they have achieved everything they wanted to
good,It is not the worst job in the world but it could be better. The training is very vague and they kind of just shovel you out as quick as possible because the turn over rate is a little high
good,"As a Leveraged Service Rep my job was to retain customers and keep them from cancelling any service they got from AT&T (Cable, Landline Phone, Internet). The commisons were awesome, they basically added $20,000 on top of my salary in 2018. When possible I loved to convince the customer to let me help them resolve whatever their issue was when possible. This was not possible many times due to not being in the position to actually help the customers with their need. I feel that if I'm the last line of defense, as managers often framed the situation, things like trying to get me off the phone with every customer in 10-15 minutes is not realistic when you want me to not only save the customer from cancelling but also upsell them into other services. Not impossible when working with customers who had simple issues to resolve, but for those with complex issues (usually a few of those daily) that others at the compny have bungled through already, it often meant having to follow up with customers; and this was complicated more by only getting two 30 minute periods in the 40 hour week for call backs."
good,You can always know that someone is always there when help is needed. You have a questions just ask and they will try their best to get you the answer you are looking for
good,Most of the time people you deal with day to day are fun to talk to and to help them try and get what they're looking for in a new phone. Any position within ATT is subject to layoffs.
good,Good company with a new focus on entertainment.  They are outsourcing much of their customer service which more pressure on the account manager and takes away from selling time.
good,"This is not AT@T but rather West Corporation who works as a contracting company for AT@T. The compensation was to low for the line of work that was being done, the culture isn't great but it was alright"
good,Overall company provides good to excellent opportunities for careers and career advancement. The daily pace of work can be exciting and draining at times but overall you can make what you want of your career if you apply yourself.
good,all of your pay is from sales and commission. So if you're into sales this job is the best for you. There are alot of great people to work with.......
good,Probably the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to meet with people from different ways of life and places from around the Twin Cities Metropolitan area. It's very fulfilling to meet business owners and other people and sell products to them to try and simplify as well as benefit their lives with services that I firmly believe in as a salesman.
good,One thing you can count on is layoffs and management change. Too many chiefs and almost no Indians in the labs organization. Lots of folks that have no working experience in design and architecture roles.
good,"I worked at AT&T full-time for more than 6 years."
good,When it was SBC it was fun. I looked forward to going to work. Now that we are AT&T there is no more fun and the only item the company cares about is the bottom dollar. AT&T will do anything to make the bottom dollar.
good,"Enjoy the work day, travel to different locations. Hardest part is commercial installation. Workplace culture is encouraging, tries to enhance teamwork"
good,"The workplace environment was very subpar. Once a change in upper management occurred, everything became very unprofessional at the hands of management. It was so much backbiting and arguing between the different management levels. As weeks progressed more members of the management team started to leave and employees were driven out due to the hostile work environment. The company itself has no problems. It's the location I worked at that was horrendous to the point that so many employees and management left that it was unnecessary to keep the location open. Bad management can drive a business into the ground. By the time it was realized, it was too late."
good,"this basically was a process verification establishment. The processes changed regularly so staying up to date was a constant challenge, Learning all sorts of new equipment was the best part."
good,It’s all about the number. Make your numbers and you’re good but you are set to fail every day. Pay and benefits are good but you still have to put up will the numbers game. Wish it was easier to leave but at the rate of pay with 20 years it’s almost impossible to leave.
good,Never worked with AT&T directly but instead has a contractor. This review would not apply to their work environment since I didn't work with them directly
good,there inst much to say about att. the job is stressful and management doesn't help with that. on the plus side the pay was good and as were the benefits.
good,"everything was great but company as the years progress gets greedy, and when that happens things change for the worse. making money just got harder and harder"
good,"wasnt to good, i didnt like it, i wouldnt recommend  management poor  and the experience is something i dont want to experience again  do not work there"
good,This company could take a some time to identify training opportunities.  There are many leaders that are put through a college for hire program and are thrown into important roles.  They arrive and have little to no management experience or people skills.  This effects the moral of the team.
good,Became a nightmare to work micro management  all about meeting numbers no matter what at the expense of customers and employees. Force to speak and respond to customers the exact same way no matter what the situation is even if the response makes no sense.
good,Its been so long since I worked here I can even tell you what it was like. A call center job in which you sold phones to incoming calls. It paid the bills and wasnt so bad.
good,"I was hired in as a temp with the expectation of getting hired on with the company after a period of time I was employed through a temp service with them for 5 years unfortunately the company iAt& t tself decided not to go ahead with the contract from what we were told I have nothing but Great thing's to say About the experience I appreciate the opportunity being that it gave me nothing but Great customer service skills that I've taking and applied to other jobs & allowed me to get job offers in that field,"
good,"Sold full suite of Yellow pages advertising products. Sales quotas and incentive programs. Training provided to help achieve sales goals, "
good,Performance testing at AT&T was enjoyable. The projects were changing with short timelines. The co-workers were helpful and always ready to work together as a team.
good,"Worked over 20 years for AT&T with competitive pay & competitive benefits.  The culture is good, my peers were great people.  The ONLY negative was the lack of job security.  Over the past 5+ years there were force reductions 2 or 3 times per year that we had to live through.  Unfortunately the force reductions finally caught up with me and over 7k others on January 28th of this year."
good,"With the growth of the company & it's products, the expectancy grew & the culture of the Company changed. Like most large Corporations there is a lot of pressure that flows downhill. Unlike some competitors, they were reactive & not proactive."
good,"AT&T is so large, there are hundreds of opportunities to change careers, learn about a new part of the business and do new things. In 8 years I've had about 6 different roles. If you are willing to try new things, there are tons of opportunities."
good,"My direct managers are great to work with. They have always been supportive and very knowledgeable. Company leadership causes uncertainty due to employee layoffs. I have been with AT&T for 18 years and was notified that I will be ""surplused"" in March. This layoff was due to my work location but there was no offer to relocate even though my job is currently work from home. The separation package is good and retirement benefits are fair. All in all it is a great job but the security is always in question even if you are a top perform as I was."
good,"It was ok, fast paced but if you dont get your sales number get ready to be put on a coaching which will eventually lead to dismissal. Its a good company if you can get the ball rolling."
good,"Directv technician is a decent job.  you have to deal with customers all day, but as long as you are respectful there is usually no problems.  The supervisors can sometimes get annoying but they are usually not too bad."
good,offering all new opportunities to stay up to date with the latest tech. great place to find fun items to make your home a smart home. building a foundation for future clients.
good,"call center work is draining mentally. The metrics to achieve every month get harder and harder to achieve.  Attendance is a priority, be always be prepared ahead of time is you need time off. A lot of managers play favorites in the workplace. "
good,"This company is good in paying you for your experience, I love that about the company, but as far as working my goodness very stressful,micromanage, rude managers just a company about quanity and not quality."
good,Company is transitioning into an entertainment model and with it growing pains. At times the company is too large and the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. Company does try to enable employees to succeed.
good,Has great pay and benefits but no job security.  Constantly laying people off as the needs of the business changed.  Was always in fear of  being layed off and did not feel hard work and excellent yearly rating factored into decisions during the surplus events.  I saw a lot of good people loose their jobs while I was employed there.
good,It was a great place to work.  The call taking environment was what you would expect being in a call center.  The management team was always looking to improve morale and customer service.
good,They change the pay constantly and raise the sales goals to unattainable levels. The culture of the store that I worked at has also suffered and team moral has gone down.
good,i learned alot from at&t and  and the hardest part of the job was the customers. it was an experience worth while but never enough to stay away from the family as long as i was out working
good,Podías ir a cambacear hasta en el df o fura del distrito
good,"It was a job, i got paid for my services. Door to door salespeople just arent appreciated anymore. It was an unfulfilling job, but it was by no means a bad job."
good,"When AT&T absorbed our company the most notable difference was their attempts to save money and cut costs at every possible opportunity. This included annual lay-offs, changes to PTO policy, removal of catering for workers on holidays, and even the emptying of the medicine cabinets."
good,Very good company to be part with. Expect long flexible working hours stretching into weekends. Cost cutting effort going on all the time. You should have close contacts to retain your job.
good,My role does allow me to work independent if there was consistent work.  Ongoing leadership changes delay my productivity until the new team can figure out a new path for the department.  I have reported to 14 different managers in 4 years and gone through 4 rounds of lay offs in 4 years.
good,It was a great job when it was Bellsouth. However since AT&T took over the management of this company went down sharply. The customer service has been completely left out and the customer and the company has suffered terribly.
good,"Experience depends on location, product and customer. Individual experience might differ. Expect long working hours and weekends. Best to keep to latest technologies handy in resume. Cost cutting is the main focus now a days."
good,This was a massive company and as such there was not much communication flowing to the management team. It was difficult to see nchange in such a large company
good,Outdated work atmosphere with heavy manage layer. Top Leaderships outlook for a future path appears to be growth on a crumbling foundation. Many good people in a tough environment trying to justify there existence.
good,"Customer service representative."
good,"Wish the job would have never downsized. Liked the money I was making & was able to live comfortably. Overall, I enjoyed the employees I worked with & feel that I have gained tons of experience as a result of working this job for more than 20+ years."
good,My most enjoyable part of work was my coworkers. The hours all go based on seniority and was a great place to work part time. If you are a parent or student and want to make decent money good place to start. Possibility to move up through the company highly likely through hard work.
good,•	Negotiated and consulted with Business customers to resolve request and leverage sales opportunities
good,"I enjoyed my time at the company but lately it's always been about who is getting laid off this time."
good,"average- stretching employees, particularly management too thin. not a positive work environment. continuing competition taking more share. executives not affected."
good,"Company was great. Loved working for AT&T. My time while working for AT&T was both interesting, as well as educational. I met many new friends, and learned many new things."
good,Lack of support from management with escalations. Customer service lacks professionalism over the phone. All they do is transfer the customer to different departments until the customer gets frustrated and gives up.
good,looks like this company is okay if you are new n the job field but not good in the long run. need to find better place eventually. it is just getting start within the business field or the technical.
good,"Job can be fun, training is well done. Expect to be challenged. Work by yourself a lot, and a lot is expected. I dont know why this jobsite thinks i need to write a book for them when it comes to filling out these boxes."
good,Pay was good back in early 2000s but has dropped for anyone new who applies. New CEO Bad changes and poor management.  Intense micro management.  Which is why I no longer work there
good,get 4 to 5 oders a day. rages from installion to repair to second opinions on pervious cancel jobs. goes to customer home and evaluate if they can get directv service.
good,Show up get your orders. call customer and fix  there phone. out on the the field most days. rain or shine. climb pole or under ground we would fix the lines
good,I worked as a repair customer service rep.  This job was very faced paced especially after any major storms were we had a lot of customers without phone service
good,Repetitive work.  Underpaid.  More responsibilities as time passes without proper compensation.  Micromanagement.  Random layoff to raise profits to meet expectations.
good,God job. was a nice location .  location was on the NW side of OKC. They based shifts on seniority and not performance.  The training was thorough. Room for advancements.
good,The people that work there are great the company however is always laying people off. There is a lack of structure internal procedures become major bottleneck.
good,"I really enjoyed working for AT&T Mobility, it wasn't until the move to landline services did the culture change. As any other job location, there were good managers and those that were not so good. "
good,"* Achieved monthly sales quotas, sold company merchandise, provided excellent customer service, trained new employees, consistently improved selling methods, obtained and closed business leads within surrounding area."
good,"No room for improvement.  Company has been stripped and no longer gives employees advancement or perks like it once did.  Instead of advancement, they tend to ship jobs overseas and lay off employees."
good,"After working 30 years, I have been deemed surplus.  The company is downsizing every quarter and unsuccessfully ""automating"" job functions.  The company will continue to shed employees."
good,It is a good starter company if u are single and young. If you are married with children then the cost of living outweighs the salary or pay you received.
good,"It's another call center, you worked on you worked them all. There really is no down time. Some of the managers let the job go to their heads, the ones that were bullied in high school will try to degrade you while you are on the phone with a customer. They really only care about numbers. They expect you to lie to the customer."
good,Good opportunity to learn sales at the entry level. Lots of hours and commissions can be small but add up quickly through volume. Discounted phone plans helped!
good,company was a tpr business which had certain locations management who were very inexperienced causing me to resign. Left that company to further my sales career with tmobile
good,Great benifets but only because of the union. The company its self did not have their stuff together. Too quick to replace good employees. Work odd hours that are never consistent
good,"Advancement is heavily dependent on seniority rather than skills and results. I do not know how they currently run their organization, but I did know many career employees who left voluntarily due to lack of opportunities."
good,"supporting level 3 customer, I learned to work with multinational company, the management is not very helpfull, workplace culture is very good, the hardest part is dealing with new problem of network and you have to learn each day"
good,"Good job working with everyone. Learning a new industry was greatly satisfying."
good,"If you work here you have to be dedicated to the job, taking work home is sometimes necessary and salary is based hourly and on commission. Prime Communications has great incentives and benefits."
good,"The days were long the pay was decent. The training they put you through for your first three to six weeks was fun. The managers were easy to talk to and knowledgeable."
good,"Typical day consisted of several meetings to plan project milestones/goals, review status and issues, or investigate logic/coding defects.  When not in meetings, programmers create, enhance or modify code based on client application requests to meet customer needs.  I have learned to use multiple development tools and coding languages in my time with the company.  The most enjoyable part of the job is coding to resolve problems/issues or meet client requests.  The hardest part of the job is meeting tight schedules while limiting overtime where I am not paid and to work with non-specific client requirements.  Lower level management is generally fair and consistent."
good,"Long work days."
good,concern was based on getting the most customers answered than getting them the assistance they needed. wasn't concerned on anything other than getting their money.
good,Good place to work and the environment had a good atmosphere overall. I would recommend this employer to others interested in working in the call center.
good,"I had an overall good experience working here. The typical day of work was repetitive to some extent, but the resolutions were challenging. I would recommend this position to someone else."
good,A t & t was a great place to work. Trust was given with little supervision.  Supervisors were always willing to help when needed.  Training at the beginning was very thorough which gave us the confidence that we could do our jobs well.
good,"Good company, could be better. Needs to improve in their training & development. Needs to hire more qualified professional individuals. Manage the process & train their management team."
good,"I work as a contractor not an employee, I am not in a position to provide an accurate review of a company I am not an employee of. This should not be a required field"
good,"This job in AT& T is no longer open because 411 is all automated. It was a call center environment that was 24 hours handling 411 calls, driving directions and movie information."
good,the hours were there for you to work overtime.  They would let you know a few days in advanced if overtime was mandatory.  Great job for someone with older kids or no kids at all. Hard for a person with a family.
good,"Year over year declining moral, business outlook, sales pressure by all means, and FMLA and leave abusers killed it for me. No amount of sugar coating could make AT&T sweet. It is what it is."
good,Att retail offers great job security   There are a lot of product and services to sell.   The benefits are good and they give frequent raises in retail.
good,Started off as a very fun environment. the last 2 years I was there was a decline into not being able to do anything fun due to lack of budget and tightening of policies and procedures.
good,I have not been at att for almost 5 years but its overall enjoyable minus the stresses you would expect from a retail position. Salary is competitive and their benefits are top notch
good,"Due to being one of the only new hires my store had I was low man on the pecking order.  That meant that I had last choice on the schedule when it was time to bid on them.  I was stuck working 12pm-9pm with my days off being Tuesday and Wednesday.  Really hard to have a decent social life with a schedule like that.  If that does not bother you then this could be a good fit for you.  They provide excellent training(they flew me to Dallas, TX for 3 weeks), they provide solid benefits(you part of a union), and the commission opportunities are good."
good,I worked in the business to business department. Upgrading businesses cellphones. It was a very competitive environment where the bonuses were excellent.
good,"AT&T is a great place to work. It offers great benefits. I worked processing all the reports for the director and upper management for their daily, weekly and monthly meetings."
good,"A typical day at work - Mostly meetings and attending reviews."
good,check phone lines and connections to be able to connect cable lines and or internet. have to be good in customer service must of what you do is interacting with the home owner
good,"if you were not partying or kissing up to upper management in ""various"" ways then you will never move up in the company.  if you love technology then it is a cool place."
good,"Recently i have worked for AT&T as a contractor while earlier I was an employee.  As contractors, there are not many leadership opportunities presented, if any."
good,The company has great name to add to your resume but unfortunately that's where it stops. Much of the company is run by unions which unfortunately have their own self interests in mind when   negotiating contracts
good,Fun place to work and I like the culture. Coworkers are willingly to help so a project can get completed. A lot to learn and the company provide the right resources.
good,It was good working there for the time i was there but it never felt as if it would ever become a career but was a good reintroduction to working full time again.
good,"No career path for software engineer to management."
good,Decline to answer as i do not to wish to dis-way or discourage any persons from applying to this particular company. My experience was unique and does not reflect the company over all.
good,"It was a good job but making about 4200 a month was usual , the management needs help. The hours are retail so you always work don't expect any days off besides christmas and thanksgiving."
good,"Depends on the location and management.Collected client letters and assorted them according to details"
good,"I worked for AT&T when it was directv. Like any call center cable provider job it requires patience, stress management, meeting metrics the ability sale and willingness to step outside your comfort zone."
good,The company is great to work for. The culture is team oriented and collaborative. Management seeks the best. Projects include evaluating new opportunities and project ownership.
good,don't have any comments regarding at&t they didn't pay me enough I need a job that I can have benefits and have a great pay to survive in society today
good,DBA's activities daily. workplace culture is fine. company's  Benefits are better than most of my previous companies. The hardest will be job location for me.
good,Manger fired me over install instead of help me learn how to better do my job  and copper network is unstable and slow  many repairs took several hours and didnt work because infastructer was reallr really bad
good,Money and benefits are great but the work life balance leaves something to be desired. They did have contests and incentives for employees. The breaks were ok.
good,"poor management. they target people for termination just for kicks great job working outside and many different challenges. great co workers and enjoy perfoming the duties."
good,"While the store manager left much to actually help the team, the team itself was good and made numbers per quotas regularly. The hours were much more desirable than other locations since we were not in a mall and  location make the drive to work for the most part painless."
good,Back to back phone calls from customers via phone. The company pays great money just got burned out from all of the high sales goals that became unrealistic.
good,"Working for DirecTV was an awesome experience till AT&T took over.  Then it was more about numbers than it was about customers.  Now instead of doing what it takes to help the customer the focus is on following flows that don't always resolve the issue and leaving any thought out of the process.  The reduction of process to scripts that are sometimes broken is ridiculous.  Coachings are given for going outside flow regardless if it is best for the customer.  I will say that the educational opportunities, pay and benefits do make it worth the struggle but it is demoralizing to see how far down our customer service has fallen since the buy out."
good,"managers are put in impossible positions but they also do a poor job in who they decided to manage. that confusion spills over to the ones who make this juggernaut run, the sales consultants. but great benefits and hourly"
good,Hours and work conditions are great.  You are in just in constant fear of being laid off.  The  benefits are ok.  The products are wonderful. It used to really feel like you were working with family.
good,"AT&T is a solid company with industry standard benefits.  I enjoyed many of my work relations and my own team was top notch.  The opportunity to improve professional skills was very good and AT&T provided very good in-house training in management, project management, coaching, etc.  The C-level leadership was outstanding and provided excellent motivation.  I was unfortunately shackled to a horrible mid-level manager who was the antithesis of servant-leader.  I believe the emotional investment to coach and correct bad behavior is too much for most managers at AT&T - it is just too demanding.  This is unfortunate as managers like this are allowed to continue their poor management practices."
good,"It used to be a lovely place to work, but then they bout out Direct TV and became more sales driven then customer service driven.However they do have great benefits."
good,Leaders are there to correct you when you are wrong but do not try to help when you are overwhelmed. Subjected to constant observations and coachings. Management does this instead of trying to help other customers who are waiting.
good,"Good work enviorment but management is not that good  , "
good,not applicable. nothing more to tell. don't go there unless single and can handle stress with un reachable goals. pay great not worth the headache. stressful.
good,"It is an ok company to work for. It is long hours, and management is always watching every step you take. Not a lot of training on the job with someone for long, was doing it for about 1 week then thrown to the wolves. Would not recommend anyone work here."
good,at&t has great potential to be one of the best company to work for. They have excellent benefits. I have nothing more to say about att. Make the best i
good,AT&T has been downsizing since I joined in 2000.  It used to be once per year but has now become a rolling process with multiple downsizings per year.
good,"I can’t complain much of my time here. Steady work with a decent wage. I strongly disliked the lack of benefits or opportunities for advancement. No vacation or sick days, the monthly bonus system is the only good thing."
good,Stressful at times. Calls could either go short or long depending of type of call. Lack of supervisors/shift leads. Really busy when there is an outage.
good,"At&t can be a decent paying job but the hours are hectic, they ask for too much, and overall its just too much stress. they do have a sort of fun and competitive attitude but for me it just wasnt worth it."
good,"Really disappointed about the lack of care for you as a human that AT&T seems to dismiss.  You are nothing more than a number and if you don’t like that environment, they will tell you to leave and that you can be replaced.  This was never stated towards me, however, I witnessed this behavior as a supervisor on several occasions.  It’s very demotivating."
good,"The job is not hard, but they put more work on you then there is hours in the day. When problems arise, management is not very helpful most of the time. The good thing is the pay is really good and the benefits are also good."
good,"High pace, high stress.  wasn't being paid quite adiquately for the job being done.  Great people to work with.  Great manager.  Some customers were great to work with.  Others were a nightmare."
good,The pressure to sell to angry customers everyday was very stressful. Customers would call in to complain about their cell phone bills and the employees were required to sell ATT home services.
good,no review do not work here ever horrible horrible place no respect no home life no job security only plus is the discount on phone service and accessorues
good,"I retired from AT&T after better than 30 years. AT&T was a great place to work with Whitaker was CEO. With the new CEO the company took a dive into a dark pit. I was no longer happy working there but then was laid off, thus, early retirement"
good,I thought the company was more customer service (customer oriented) but instead its about owning the whole house whether they want it or not. I hate trying to force someone to take products and services they don't want or need.
good,Life at att was long and you never know when you would get off but the local moral was good. I have enjoyed the advancement that i have been allowed to undergo.
good,"can be long work hours and a lot of work but good environment "
good,"This job gave me the best possible job experience I could have asked for. To this day, I am still complimented on my telephone etiquette. It was a stressful job, but the compensation was excellent."
good,"Latest network technology, good work culture, . the hardest part of the work is to communication with developers out of the country."
good,"Aprendí mucho en esos 3.7 años en la empresa, sobre todo en relación al trabajo en equipo y a dar mi mayor esfuerzo para lograr los objetivos; desarrollé una buena capacidad de análisis en mi atención con el cliente para poder ofrecer soluciones personalizadas, dejando satisfechas las necesidades de los mismos. Lo que más me gustó fue poder ayudar a los clientes con temas de tecnología y servicios; la parte más difícil era trabajar a veces hasta 12 horas al día y no tener tiempo para convivir con mi familia o para actividades personales, sin embargo, valió la pena ya que me dejó mucha experiencia."
good,"Was a vendor this. But people I worked with from ATT were friendly. "
good,This is a good employer if your planning on being in the Telecommunications industry. Its very stressful but can be very rewarding. As long as you stay driven you are able to be successful.
good,"Working there was fun at first, but it get tiring if you want to deal with people coming with cell phone Bill's. Theres all benefit of working here, but I dont think is worth dealing with it."
good,"The company is a strong revenue driven firm, but due to budget constraints is not currently looking to expand its management footprint.  The firm is also prevented from providing exceptional customer service due to time constraints placed upon the technicians."
good,Great people but inconsistent management and leadership. The company will always look out for the better of the company rather than their employees. Typical expectations for major corporations.
good,"AT&T is a good place to work, I work on DSLAMS, running stress tests for data, voice and video, attend meetings, its a good place to work, we do get images every two weeks and product is released every 4 months"
good,"I worked when it was directv over 12 years ago so this is not the best review to use, things can change over a period of time so I cant say what is or isn't good"
good,work environment could be better pay and benefits could be a little better but pays the bills . Also could be better relationship between management and tech
good,The company is so large you can move into different business units every three years and learn a new business. Constant change drives a continued education.
good,"Corporate structure is impeccable.  As a low-level worker, this means very little, but you know what to expect coming into work.  Pay is fair, and excelling at this position opens the door for many other career options."
good,"Typical day-may  involve paying attention to the day-to-day details of an office – things other people might overlook, such as answering and keeping track of emails, tracking appointments,answer phones, write memos, and greet clients and customers as needed, create flyers for upcoming meetings and do mail outs. contact vendors and request quotes for items needed for the department. Go into SAP and create requisitions for purchase orders. Follow up orders and secure invoices for payment. and so much more"
good,"Back in the late 1990's and early 200's  AT&T was a great company to work for, I thoroughly the benefits , the camaraderie and leadership. During the above era AT&T cared about their employees. I'm not confident this still exists."
good,none I was a subcontractor for the company and the stress of the workplace was too much for me and I decided to no longer work for the contractor there
good,"My experience and background align with this position.  I am enthusiastic, energetic, and highly driven, with skills and tenacity to solve problems by implementing creative solutions.  I have extensive experience in leading IT Technology projects/transformation initiatives."
good,not a bad place to work although work and schedule is demanding and travel is required on a regular basis.  Discounts offered on services are very helpful.
good,AT&T was a descent company to work for and provided me with good experience and new skills. I worked on many migration projects to move out on-premise infrastructure to AWS Cloud infrastructure.
good,"Tough to face customers when the customer service phone representative led the customer to believe false pretenses. Spend more time on phone with modifications getting work orders corrected, than actually earning a living installing."
good,"Att was one of the best paying jobs I had for someone with no degree. However, it was super stressful and the work-life balance was garbage. If you like a high-stress, cut-throat, commission-based sales environment then this is the job for you."
good,"I never workedfor AT&T.  I sold there products. I worked for a third party vendor called, ""Altitude Marketing"" where I was a senior Sales Representative selling multiple products based on customers location."
good,"Answer inbound calls, place orders for directv and at&t services. The people where great. Good sales environment. Co-workers where very helpful. The training for the computer system needs to be up dated."
good,A great place to work!  The people are very professional.  Often times you may go through growing pains but they really care about their employees.  The contract position is not good because once the time is over the positions are over.
good,"i worked at a call center that serviced at & t uverse. overall it was a good work environment and friendly people to work with. i didnt like that we had to ""bid"" for our schedule. if we didnt keep our stats up, there was a possiblitly of getting a schedule that wouldnt work for us"
good,"Challenging work environment. Upper management has a tendency to set goals that are very challenging to attain, resulting in perverse incentives to potentially lie to customers."
good,Nothing to say. Was happy to work there until I was let go due to workforce reduction. Learned new skills and worked with great folks. Like I said nothing else to say
good,"AT&T has great benefits. Employee must be willing to follow all the rules and exact protocol."
good,The bonuses were great but once we really started doing well they took the jobs to the Philippines which i could only assume were to save on payouts..
good,"no work life balance, too much micro managing, hard to get help among other departments due to micro managing, customer survey weighs too heavily on job security"
good,"The management is not all that good, I understand at&t/ Direct TV have management classes to increase knowledge however it doesn't seem to stick. The managers I feel have to much Power over the Employees and should be subject to a third party's guidelines as suppose to at&t/Direct TV's in house reps. The advancement is dictated by the store manager as well so if the person doesn't appreciate you/ like you then advancement can be prolonged and denied."
good,They lay tons of people off every year right before Christmas.  I liked my job and I liked the people I worked with but was just constantly worried that I would get laid off.  They lay people off then either bring in new contractors that they have to train to do exactly what the previous employees were doing or they hire off-shore.
good,"overall just ok."
good,"The pay is what attracts you to the job but the environment is very stressful. They get every dollar out of you. They dont care about morale, they even said it at one of our meetings. The way they see it  is, if you dont like your job, quit."
good,AT&T is always having employee surpluses that highly effects  workplace morale. They do pay well and have good employee benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job is the other employees.
good,It was okay. the pay was good and commission was awesome but the hours were not fantastic and the customers were horrible to deal with. management was actually really great.
good,"You have the opportunity to make a lot of money, and as a sales rep in a retail setting, you will have a hard time finding a job that pays you better. It is unfortunately a sales job with a what have you done for me lately kind of mentality."
good,its like any other job with good and bad days but closer to my resignation time it got absolutely ridiculous with product shortages and work flow errors
good,very cut throat company co workers were nice for the first months to feel you out and when they decided if they liked you or not you would never see them or they wouldnt come help if needed. company only cares about money to the point where they halfass fix vehicals that break down in a week.
good,prefer not to bad mouth a business. it wasn't the greatest experience I have had but it wasn't the worst either. I suggest it if you need a job or form your own opinion.
good,"Surpluses every year"
good,"hours were flexible but cut short. could not reach 40 hours a week. sales were good which meant commission checks made up for fewer hours. however, sales fluctuated at times."
good,"was okay job dealt with really dumb people most of the time who got angry about things when they just couldn't understand what was going on. chill, boring"
good,"while working for At&t the pay was great as well as benefits, trainings were provided as well. lacked job security , always wondering if we were gonna be laid off"
good,"A typical day at AT&T as a Manager you are required to attend numerous meetings typically double or triple booked. In between meetings it is a typical day working through personnel disputes, escalations, budget reviews. You have to consciously remember to get up and take a walk, go to lunch, maybe if time permits go to gym at lunch. Otherwise you will find that you are sitting at your desk for 9 hours a day jumping from one call to the next, and one issue to the next."
good,"Company promised one thing then territories were changed, more sales reps brought in, so less accounts were available to choose from. I felt the position I was sold on was a lie."
good,"The culture of this company is great and everyone I worked with was amazing.  The only issue I had that being a call center environment, it was a bit difficult to get noticed even after a year of being a top rep."
good,"Watching over your shoulder and nitpicking. The company has a union, but tries to skirt around the deal at every opportunity. The union has no backbone to do what is necessary to win a contract. They get worse every time"
good,"No weekends off, working 6 days a week, they want you to meet numbers that are out of your hand. Working on holidays...Christmas, Thanksgiving. Some managers only care about numbers. Best part of job is making an older person happy with AT&T and not take advantage of them."
good,fast paced call after call speed was the key handling a call in 30 seconds or less. Management was fair and the culture diverse the hardest part was the scheduling split shifts where the worst.
good,"About 50-75 calls per shift."
good,"As a customer service representative you are faced with many difficult phone calls daily. The position to include culture is good within the company. However, the continuous and back to back phone calls with strict rules for being on and off the phone make this a high stress job."
good,"It was a great job, i work with them for 6 years but is ready to move on to a better job with more opton, when i work for att i work at the call center an in there store"
good,"A typical day at work:  Quiet, laid back & self sufficient. What you learned:  I learn some new & different monthly.  Management:  Majority of the First & Second level managers are great to work.  Workplace culture, there's a variety of ethic groups within the company.  The hardest part of the job: dealing with upper management & the union.  The most enjoyable part of the Job:  completing my tasks for the day."
good,"most customers customers come in for service issues, it's your responsibility to try to sell them something in that store no matter what they came in for."
good,Working in a call center at ATT can be financially rewarding and the medical benefits are great.  The only concern I have with the company is the ability to advance outside of the call centers.  Your exposure to other parts of the company is very limited which hinders your ability to network within the company.
good,During the time that I was at Directv there was no room for advancement and when it was it was too much favoritism going on in the workplace. So I had to find advancement else where
good,"Laid off after 21 years of service despite being a dedicated,exceeding expectations employee. Would not work there bc laid off after 21 years of service with no place to move to in the company."
good,I got great pay and benefits with this job but i did not like it. Needed a career change. I was unhappy with what i did there. I sat on the phone all day and i wanted something more
good,The few months I worked at AT&T were good.  I was hired on term and after 9 months I the project was completed and I was laid off before having an opportunity to apply for a perm position within the company.
good,Good solid job. You stay busy and people are great to work with.  I didnt like union based company. My stats didnt count for the shift changes.  As well as for advancements.
good,Good place to work everyone worked well together and management was good with communications.  Relaxed work environment and always new learning experience.
good,"If you would like to work alot for very little pay, You are all set. Working for a retailer for AT&T is probably worse than working direct for AT&T, but I would think there would be more,  but it is just retail."
good,The company was based off of sales. There were many pros and cons and the money was god but it always came back to bite them. I only quit because I got pregnant
good,"Manager at the specific store I worked for was not the best at communicating. Other than that it was not bad. Commission is good, training program is great"
good,You work a lot. Good pay but the job is tedious. A lot of little things you have to pay attention to in order to be successful. Chatting in for assistance when equipment or software isn't working can be a real pain as well. A lot of freedom that most jobs do not provide. Have to be self-driven.
good,"On a typical workday, I would log into the network and give a cursory review of mail messages to see if I had anything urgent to handle. I would next complete any routine tasks assigned to me. There was a focus on teamwork, so I learned to work well with others. The upper management team was helpful and supportive to the extent that they could. The workplace provided me with the support I needed to perform the tasks assigned to me. I enjoyed the comradery and support of the people I worked directly with as well as those I supported and those that supported me."
good,Nice place to work. Loved traveling with this job. Just what I needed at that time in my life.I would recommend this job to friend that have experience in cable
good,"The job itself was not hard, the pay and benefits were great. The shift options on the other hand were nothing to get excited about. You get an hour for lunch, which was great sometimes, but it also meant you were at work for 9+ hours. Shift options are seniority based and when given a shift like 1pm-10pm working weekends, where is the family time? Especially when your kids are in school."
good,At&t was a great company to work for although I wish they had better opportunity when it came to leadership programs. At&t job culture was great and work life balance was great as well
good,Large complex organization with multiple contract support organizations.  Software development lifecycle is stated as Agile but is not pure Agile.  Waterfall model is still widely used.
good,Aside from my immediately management making unnecessary changes to our locations and not knowing how to treat anyone.... I LOVED my job at AT&T.  I never would have left if they would have just put me back where I started closer to home.  It is a long story!
good,It was a fun job to work however the leadership could use some best practices to help with promotion and not play favorites. I think it's a great company but leadership could be better.
good,A typical day at work with At&t was very stressful. The most enjoyable part of my day at At&t was working with my coworkers. And I enjoyed giving authentic customer service.
good,"Most management was awesome, but some was horrible. When i started at job i was guaranteed job security, however, after the 3rd year i discovered our company was going to close my dept. I really enjoyed job and team even though some management was horrible they were tolerable. Wish this job didn't close down."
good,"Work lots of hours,as a salaried  employee very little work/ life balance .This is an entry level position,outside cold sales.High pressure from company and management for results pay is not that great for the expectations ,good benefits (medical/vision/dental)."
good,"ATT changed their commission structure so often, it was hard to maximize on commission some times. no room for adancement, and no leadership to get me the next step in my career. I was an awesome salesman but I feel thats the reason why they didnt want to advance my career. I feel if you can make a company a lot of money just by doings sells, that exactly where they will keep you. Even though your goals are higher than just selling. They will keep you at the position you came in at. And I have a problem with that. I wanted growth but I wasn't given the opportunity"
good,i really do not have anything to say about this company because things are changing at a fast pace they fired my boss and my boss boss right after i got hired i don't think they care about the people in the madison market
good,"I work at Directv before it converted to AT&T.  pay raise where 1 year and the most that was seen as a customer service rep was 25 cents.  The managers where not helpful when there were problems with co workers or supervisor you worked under.  One hard thing at this type of job is the customers that are unhappy with their billing, they are mean and nasty and only 30% of the time they will let you explain.  Call handling they expect you to handle issues in under 6 min and most of the time you can not fully resolve or explain what is happening."
good,"they had a strict ""glued to your desk"" policy and used a dumb survey metric to determine how well they thought you were doing. They're training was phenomenal though and I would recommend that to anyone."
good,The environment was nice. A typical day included answering phone calls and helping customers purchase products or answering any questions they had. It was an overall good experience.
good,Commission based employment for ATT to give customers the opportunity to appreciate the differences that Uverse had to offer in their particular cities
good,"I enjoyed working for AT&T.  I cut my teeth in Sales and Marketing at AT&T.  I would recommend anyone serious about advancing their knowledge and skills in personal growth, development, team building and Power Sales, join AT&T, first!"
good,unprofessional had problems with one supervisor who was later fired due to known reasons very unprofessional workplace was underpaid for various duties i performed
good,Its a high paced retail environment that is open on Sundays and most USA holidays. You will be dealing with customers face to face and high sales numbers
good,"I choose not to because i am transitioning into a new career field.  This was a technical job at AT&T.  I am interested in working in a sales, marketing or promotions career field"
good,"Not a lot of forward thinking, just follow the plan as it lays. Limitiations on freedom to work on building customer base. Hard to advance from the call center."
good,"The company had a difficult time adapting to the changing world when it came to its employees.  They never could seem to get on board with the thought of putting employees first.  There struggle lied in a lack of focus.  They had 5 key points for 2018, and only one focused on it's people, and it was the bottom of the list.  They seem to lack the ability to take input from their employees when planning ideas."
good,Good carrier to work for as a vendor. Always fare the the vendors. Hard part is getting deliverables to match up with time line. Hardest part is work/live balance.
good,"A typical day at work was rewarding, and challenging, loved working with customers over the phone. Had opportunity to get involved with co-workers and customers with fun, value, perception, it was all about team work. i have no downfalls at the job and the most enjoyable part of the job was all about customer satisfaction, along with innovation."
good,"As a Marketing Manager, I was responsible for a varied set of business services. It was very fun to stay up to date with the current trends in technology. However, the overall telecommunications industry became boring to me, something that eventually affected my enthusiasm for the work. Working there for years allowed me the chance to gain a wide range of experience, skills and discover talents that I never knew I had. After moving on to other companies, I realized that my views of AT&T were pretty much what you can expect in most corporate environments. There is always sweet with sour. You must make the most of an opportunity. Learn as much as you can in a position. Then move on from the nonsense. "
good,"It was call center work. The pay and benefits were fantastic for not requiring experience or a degree. Management at my site was a big unreasonable, I don't know if that's a culture within the entire company or only my site."
good,"Good place to work if it was AT&T. Good management/PMO teams. "
good,"I loved working with AT&T, we fixed customers bills and sold phones. There where no problems. Night after night we worked like bats in the night, call after call, which didn't bother me a bit. the night went by fast and we had each other."
good,"Productive, fun place to work. Great benefits, good training and opportunity to grow. Schedule fluctuated- no work life balance during time of employment."
good,"Good place to work. I have enjoyed my time with the company and my opportunities for growth. Good benefits, particularly 401k and vacation, and great people."
good,I couldn't handle the stress of having to deal with all the people with in the office and having to actually work for what I was getting paid. I am use to having everything handed to me.
good,Working in ATT provides a platform to learn different modern technologies and the team coordination and availability is good. Always on top to exceed the expections
good,"Great place to work for a single person who is okay with working copious amounts of overtime. Not great for people who have a family.  Good benefits, good pay, no real respect for the employees. The job itself isn't terrible, usually problems arise due to upper levels of management. Not a terrible place, just not right for everyone."
good,"My work day in itself was never an issue.  I enjoyed the people in my store and enjoyed interacting with the customers to get them into what they wanted but still providing what they needed.  The hardest part of the job, in a managerial position, was not getting the development that I needed an wanted to grow within the company. This was the main reason for leaving the organization."
good,"was a good place to work at the workers were very nice, and the staff was willing to go the extra mile we worked very hard to help every cutomer i learend to be very curtius to my customers even at times when customers were very up set it was a good with them"
good,"Although the job allows you to spend quite a lot of time on your own, its constantly stressful. When some jobs should require two people, you are basically forced to figure it out on your own. The management aspect needs work, managers are constantly pushing techs so they can receive bonuses but often ask of techs to overcome obscene obstacles to do so."
good,"This job was a popularity contest. If you are a rockstar at your job, on time, great customer surveys and all the other performance matrix's  are met, you will still get fired if your manager doesnt like you."
good,overall past 30 years working for at&t it was better then other company in the same field .i was able to move in the company from east coast to west cost .
good,"AT&T Business Collection Center is no longer in Charleston, WV.  The office hours were good and the work/family time was also a good fit.  There was a union that protected the employees, whether one chose to be a member of the union or not."
good,El cambio constante no dan un ambiente laboral constante.
good,"My typical day of work has some flexibility but in my role as a coach I have to help managers that feel as if they are in a no-win situation, which is actually the case in a lot of the instances."
good,The pay is good but working for the company is stressful. It seems like they want you to do way more than they are willing to pay you for. the Union contracts have seemed to declined since first unionized in 2016. Support and morale for employees has declined since AT&T began implementing policies
good,"was a good company to work for, just not anywhere to move up and grow with the company. I love policies and procedures so it was a good job for me...."
good,"great place for selling phones and accessories can be busy at times, but mostly slow days. Low level of security and half an hour break. usually happy customer may or may not have customer who disagree with services."
good,If you enjoy high pressure to meet sales goals and dealing with that monthly this would be the job for you. If you enjoy exposure to and hands on use of the latest technology this would be the job for you. If you enjoy interacting with the public this would be the job for you.
good,"If you want to grow in BPO industry, this company is your best training ground because they offer toxic accounts. You will experience all the worst possible."
good,"management doesn't really care about anything, best retail hours available, comp plans have been severely cut over the last couple years, rsc's went from making 70k a year to 40ish."
good,"AT&T is very focused on sales and less about the customer, sometimes the ethics involved are thrown out the window. A lot of it depends on your management, some managers make you fear for your job and others will try to genuinely help you out. If you can sell you will be loved and get promoted, if you can't sell it probably isn't a good fit."
good,"I worked for AT&T for a long time, first with Ameritech then as AT&T direct.  My first positions in the company were good and they gave me a lot of opportunity to advance, but when I moved into Outside Sales, it was very stressful and high demand.  I was glad to have left there for another company."
good,"I worked for a dealer for AT&T and even though the money is good, the headache is not worth it. They do not care what you have going on in your life, they just want you there."
good,"Lots of meetings and over-communication required given the sheer size of the various orgs"
good,I like it but it is a little bit tiring. There really isn't flexible hours. I have to work more than I signed up for and really don't have a personal life anymore.
good,"This was the AT&T warehouse so they pretty must didn't care about you there, they only cared for the business and their jobs. i feel if i were to work at the actually At&t store i would'e been treated way better with benefits and more. They also lied to is about being hired permanent when they already had who they wanted on the time and weren't looking for people at all."
good,Lots and lots of contractors and project managers.  Not many employees.  Contractors are expendable and released in a moment to manage expenses.  I need 6 more characters.
good,"AT&T is an established name. However, the company is in the process of changes that are drastically reducing its workforce. Part of this is centralization - closing down of the smaller ""hub"" areas and moving to more centralized work areas. Part is also AT&T's movement to being more of a software company. Which is interesting, as they are the first or second largest IP network in the US."
good,"Customer Service over the phone just wasn't for me. But with the right personality, it could be really nice. I worked at an Alorica branch in Terre Haute, IN."
good,Not what people think. It is a very large company and the main focus right now is growth. But not within employees just in their pockets. The great perks with the company is the discounted service.
good,Although your job is labeled as a Retail Sales Consultant it is rare that you are offered full options of Sales. Customers are more likely to buy over the phone and only come to the store to have you solve their billing issues.
good,Be able to work by yourself. Be on time from job to job. Make sure that you can get along with people. Have a good driving record. Have a smile when first meeting customers
good,Repetitive job. Good advancement opportunity for the right person. Good work environment. It is a sales position so if you don't like quotas this is not the job for you.
good,No two days were the same.  There was always a new technology to learn that kept the job exciting.  Work days would vary from 8 to 12 hours depending on service calls.
good,Workplace culture has taken a hit as the bottom line has become more focused on. Layoffs are a huge part of this. It depends on what channel you work in on how happy you may be.
good,"too many changes, lack of high level vision and directions. people are professional and easy to work with. working culture is good, have work and life balance"
good,"It was ok"
good,"Working there technically through a contractor, but pace is closed down there now. That being said it was a typical place to work with good atmosphere if you had friends or made them. Had coffee room/break room. Nothing impressive or long term to work for or progress. Contractors getting promoted to employees was a bit of a challenge as it seemed like you had to be buddy with someone/managers to get any kind of advancement. i was in the first and second bracket for stats and still did not manage to make it. closed down now so i hear."
good,"I have been with the company for 18 years. The pay is good. The insurance used to be great, but now it is good. Job security is not what it used to be."
good,"A good company to work for. The type of work habits are different from the pass, need more advance for the this area not willing to relocate at the time."
good,It was productive and fun to work there. Taking in bound calls for the passports. Answering questions about the passports on when they are going to get them.
good,"AT&T is okay, but be prepared to be in queue all day. You have metrics you have to meet and/or beat. Customers can be difficult so you need strong service skills."
good,They would not compromise when I informed them I had finals coming up and I needed at least 3 days off to write a 21 page paper. Also would not compromise or work with my school hours.
good,Working for a large company is good and frustration.  Support was sporadic and scattered across a large region.  commission plan is complicated but the base of accounts help.  I could not prospect for other clients.
good,The life in AT&T is pretty good as i'm working from one year.But need a change due to location.so if i get any good location i'm happy to work peacefully.
good,"Thought the company would be good, but was told that after three months I'd start making commission. Three months later I had to fight to get my commission and after my first check, they changed the commission structure. They paid me horribly."
good,It's been a long time since I was with this employer so I can't remember much about them. I'm such my experience was fine and there isn't much more I can say.
good,my time was 9 months working here however in that time I felt the employees were a great group of people.  Everyone worked well together and seemed to enjoy their job.
good,"Buen Ambiente de trabajo, pero con cosas por mejorar"
good,"Answer phones, resolve customer issues with billing, network service, devices. The hardest part of the job was stats. Stats seem to be more important than customer resolutions"
good,N/A I worked for Convergys for AT&T. the hardest part of the job was dealing with some very rude customers.  the most enjoyable part of the job was helping out customers that was very appreciative
good,"No encontre una estabilidad laboral, ya que es un sector algo variable y aun estaba en proceso de crecimiento cuando entre."
good,"Not a bad place to work, the calls are easy come customers are rude, the facility was clean but upper management was a little corrupt. I would give them a 4 out of 6"
good,"•	Provide Hardware and Software support services to remote users nationwide."
good,prem tech is a descent job that keeps you out of the office and behind a desk. You meet good and bad people and work on your own often. The work can be tedious and long hours but other days are short and constantly changing.
good,I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend. It is not the job that is stressful it is the management that are not properly trained that makes work hectic.
good,My time there was awesome for the first few years.  I excelled for the first year faster than anyone else.  Went from csr to training to team lead within the first year.
good,I enjoyed the hour lunch. The managers were curtious. I enjoyed the training here. The parking lot is easy to move around. I learned new ways to promote sales.
good,My point of view for this employer. They wanted you to do too much work for not enough pay. They wanted you to be a customer service rep and then try to sale different products as well but with no additional compensation or bonuses for the sales.
good,"If you are a single candidate with no children or sick family members, this is the place to work. Great pay, yet little free time. No steady shifts(they are always changing). Very strict and unrealistic stats to succeed at monthly."
good,typical day at AT&T very pushy and management don't care about their reps only cares about their ranking and promotions. The only thing i have learned about working with the company how to be make decisions on my self and not depends on management
good,"typical day-on the phones in coming call sales"
good,The company needed better management in the Environmental Group. Upper management had difficulties adjusting to new Environmental Federal and State laws.
good,"At&t coworkers were fantastic to work with"
good,Typical work day is stressful.  We have to take all frustration and anger from customers when it is not even necessary.  We are attached to a computer and phone 7.5 hrs a day.  Promotions aren’t really easy
good,AT&T taught me everything I know about sales. A tad bit too focused on the bottom line but overall a pleasant experience all and all. Tends to promote within.
good,AT&T Analyst working for several different contracting firms. Telecommunication engineering project management. Various projects from Uverse management to  assisting with roll out of order system changes.
good,My typical days work was assigned to me by another group that monitered all aspects of the regions. It wasn't very flexible but I had great co-workers.
good,"There were reorgs that often lead to surplus activities, which made it difficult to enjoy the job because you were always concerned about losing it. Made it difficult to appreciate the job fully."
good,"My ARSM/district manager was a horrible reflection of the company. I won't say the entire company was horrible because the pay was great, my team was great and I know other managers from other districts whom excelled."
good,There is a lot of unease related to force reductions and change of corporate direction. Employees are nervous about volunteer retirement options and contractors are concerned about contracts being cancelled.
good,"If you like pressure pressure pressure, they are ok to work for.  Management was good to work with, and the people are great, just a lot of pressure to get extras from customers."
good,Jobs are getting outsourced to Brazil and India. IT jobs are getting scarce and hard to hold on to. Management is looking for every possibility to send work overseas.
good,"meet your quota"
good,"This job pays excellently, but this comes at the expense of your work life. A typical day at work is coming in, sitting at the desk and remaining sitting at your desk for the next 10 hours."
good,"Overall it was a great experience where I learned a great deal about retail sales, management, inventory control and people.  The biggest contributing factor to anything negative at AT&T was the upper management in the Southern California region and the bad management practices they expected around managing our people and extorting customers with poor tactics. I watched many great leaders leave or get let go thanks to poor upper leadership. It was a shame to leave my career at AT&T after having such a great start."
good,"Overall, great people. Some orgs more hectic than others. However, everyone is always under the impression that they could be let go at any time. The recent merger with Time-Warner exacerbates that feeling. I would like to stay, but so much uncertainty makes me feel that I can do better somewhere else."
good,"Worked for Directv prior to the merge with ATT, was released from my position because of the acquisition "
good,"Same as all call centers it is all about the metrics and call times, hold times, etc.  They do not take into consideration the customer might need a little more hand holding to ensure they understand and have a good experience.  They don't value customer advocacy."
good,"The Team I worked with was good, motivating and fun. Was working remotely  and had to commute to work for few days in the week. The Management vision was good and very directional."
good,"- Great team atmosphere"
good,Worked as a service technician in the southeast part of North Carolina. Install and repair for residential and business for land lines and internet services
good,"AT&T provided a great team atmosphere.  Each person assist other members whenever they needed it.  Work environment was casual and warm, so employees wanted to do a good job.  Only negative, was that you were 'silo' into your skill set and available to learn new things was limited."
good,SWBT was a pretty good place to work until the reconciliation of the diversified Bell Operating Companies. Competition for turf and power took it toll.
good,"Commission was terrible"
good,"I work outside in a very demanding job.  It can be rewarding at times and also trying.  I am an individual that gives my all to any situation that I find myself in.  "
good,"I really enjoyed my time at AT&T. Even as a contractor I was treated well, and worked on some phenomenal programs that were massive in their full scale."
good,"The company has changed over the years.....The company would like for you to sell the company, entertainment, wireless, business and streaming.....in return, low pay out and low performance managers that CAN NOT lead!"
good,"globally recognized communication company with vast departments to grow into.  offers employees a lot of benefits as health, life, and dental issurance, 401k and other saving packages"
good,"lt's a stable place to work but with a lot of politics."
good,There was a lot of personal development and corporate training available. AT&T places a priority on training their employees - both online and in person with a lot of material available to offer personal growth.
good,"Great work environment, really enjoyed my coworkers. Training was done okay. Unfortunately for me, when I started there was no type of manager at all so training me was difficult."
good,You had supervisor standing over you talking with you were talking with customers. Yelling at the team while I was on the phone customer could hear the abuse.
good,the sales is very competitive and will cause you job lost and the attendance schedule and work scheduling isn't family friendly the pay is pretty good
good,No room for growth but great sales and customer service experience. Know your promotions to stay on top of your game and make sure that you follow up with previous customers.
good,"This corporation has multiple leadership issues from the top all they way down to the frontline managers. Each department is currently rated on different metrics and results that drive in opposite directions, how can you overall exceed in that environment? System issues, tier 2 support and the overwhelming roadblocks to resolve issues break down the moral and drive to succeed. Bottom line is that you are setup to fail unless you can get around process or have a sharp pencil."
good,They have great benefits but is very hard to get promoted. It does not matter how much education you had. Is always how you know. They do offer continues  training.
good,"Call center jobs suck. Hated it. Rude customers, sitting in dirty germ filled chairs and computer tables all day. Managers just care about themselves."
good,The best thing working at Teleperformance is the people you work with. The people are approachable. The willingness that each trainers. They also offer great feedback on what you can improve on.
good,"Connect Wireless with AT&T can be a good place to work if you are planning on using the experience as a springboard into other ventures. However, the opportunity to advance does not offer very much incentive or compensation."
good,"You get great benefits for working here, but if you have a bad manager, going to work can become stressful. You don't get a lot of time off, but the hours aren't bad. Overall, I would have liked this job and stayed there if I had a better manager and more of an opportunity to advance my career."
good,"come and go employees, lack of communication with management and staff, no supplies to conduct a proper day, location is bad and the customers complained daily."
good,"The job was fast paced and required attention to detail and at times a team work effort in order to reach certain goals for that week. incentives were provided to the employees that were able to meet the sales quota given by management ,"
good,There are so many great aspects about this company but the assistance once you start taking calls is minimal and the people that do help you are not sure themselves
good,It was a summer job that I took because I was in-between jobs and needed to make a living for the summer months until I started my new job for the Wayne Township Board of Education.
good,"A typical day working at AT&T was a bit stressful. We came in 10-15 minutes before our scheduled shift to be able to hopefully find a computer/computer chair and log in. When your scheduled shift is starting, you have to be able to accept calls, not just log into your computer or you will be considered late. "
good,Typical retail environment.  Emphasis on coaching and development of the sales team.  Daily inventory and sales calls.  Not a lot of support from corporate.
good,"Typical day consists of monitoring, coaching and feedback with an occasional meeting. "
good,I  worked as a call center representative for 411 calls. I handled in-bound calls and assisted the caller with requested information. I was able to gain experience dealing with difficult customers
good,"Unlimited overtime, incentives, bonuses and 1hour lunch breaks. Plenty of free parking. Cafeteria downstairs plus every Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays the company buys all of their employees food"
good,My time was with DIRECTV. I have no opinion of AT&T as that management was totally different for the world I was associated with.Nothing to comment on.
good,My day(s) consisted of coaching/training new hires to take phone calls and utilizing their resources. I had 1:1 developments with agents to help build leaders of the future and to maintain a level of professionalism when interacting with customers. I also aided in projects that were geared around building new hires proficiency with systems and confidence when dealing with customers.
good,have to do to much for the pay have tp take pictures off everything u do mangers are rude and allways slow u down when trying to get your job done have to call your sup eveeytme u get done with a job
good,AT&T is a good place to work. The benefit package is great! The company is consistently growing. The two issues with being employed with AT&T is the constant change; and lack of job security.
good,I designed and implemented software. I came up with means to test complex circuit switching systems in order to created new services that could be sold to phone system users.
good,ATT is a global company with vast name recognition.  Network speaks for itself.  Post sales is the weak length with ATT.   Clients perceive network strong but post sales weak.   ATT has perception of the big guy in town and treats clients accordingly.
good,Average workers with average expectations and average manegement. Some older workers seem bitter and un enthusiastic. Manegement old and uninspiring. First class training. Average benifits and salary
good,"- Daily 1:1, Coaching and development, constant deliver the AT&T message. "
good,"Some of the managers would try and hold you back if you were a minority."
good,"Enjoyed the work, the people, and being busy throw-out the day. Were driven to excel each and everyway, each and every day. Goals for ourselves and for the company."
good,Good compensation if you're there to get the sales. AT&T spends a lot of money training their employees which is obviously a good thing. They have a good workplace culture
good,"I chose not to provide a review of this company that I worked for.  I don't feel comfortable providing this information at this time.  Therefore, I will not provide a review."
good,This was a fantastic place to work and hard to get in until the Company purchased Directv and started it own security system  (Digital Life). The focus of the company is on those two things and the seem to not care about anything else.
good,"to long ago to remember much, this alot unions in att and last time  i remember if you wanted to transfer to wire line from wireless you would have quite and reapply"
good,Must have an a willingness to succeed to be successful within this company. It's competitive and the incentives are great. Do not miss a day or a few hours because you will be penalized over and over again.
good,"it was a decent place to work, high strung managers with little to no experience that were working there.When I was giving that title I changed a lot for the better which showed that I performed well."
good,"You will be inundated with a constant stream of internal micro measurement spreadsheets that, legions of middle management create ad nausea to justify their existence. Management is completely out of touch with their customers, and don't really care, as they are 100% focused on their pensions and internal career tracking. If you aren't connected with the Dallas based Good Old Boys, you are just a number and disposable."
good,"Really bad atmosphere.  They force selling Uverse to people having issues with their cell phones.  I got the job to help people, not hard to sell them."
good,"This was a great place to start my IT career.  I learned a lot from business standpoint as well as IT.  "
good,Very stressful job face paced. i was there during the beginning stages of u verse the services was very buggy and customers would complain a lot. lots of overtime.
good,"The great thing about AT&T was that there was not a typical work day.  Every day was exciting and challenging. "
good,"For an employer that hires people straight out of high school, the pay and benefits are more than fair! The people at the bottom don't get their voices heard though."
good,"Not a bad place to work, scheduling need to be better to accommodate everyone . Same staff gets the same holidays off and that needs to be balance out better ."
good,"High stress, to go along with constant micro managing.  All accidents are pretty much your fault. Company stance is you are automatically guilty til proven innocent whether it be a traffic accident or personal accident. Pays well, but management is always to quick to rub it in your face."
good,when I worked there in 2013 it was an ok place to work because of the schedule and the the management.  The busiest times are the beginning and end of the month.
good,this job is cut throat and only the best will survive. you will not have time with family and will be required to write your managers paycheck and it will be difficult to meet those needs required by management
good,Management is paid significantly less than reps and have tp deal with alot more. Upper management had extreme favortism with respect to reps and job resppnsibilities.
good,"I worked alongside some intelligent people, but management relocated our team to another city, decreased our telecommuting privileges, and imposed restrictions that ultimately drove people away."
good,Calls back to back and got stressful sometimes especially when customers were unhappy. I’ve lesrned how to manage time and the best way to keep customers happiest. My managers have all been great and willing to work with me on any issues.
good,"Long hours in places with limited or no cellular service to complete work orders. Constant driving from different place, no safety equipment. was able to eat when no work had to be done."
good,"Its best to work on small projects with small teams of people.   "
good,att is just an okay company to work for. The benefits are ok. However I don't believe att value the reps opinion. The constant layoff. But the pay is okay especially in Texas
good,"- Good benefits and PTO"
good,A typical day at work is what i learned as a manager in the workckplace as the hardest job and the most enjpoyable of course. well thats just great  only 5 more chars
good,The job was pretty great and i loved my coworkers. The main problem was that the company expects you to work off the clock.  You will be told by your managers to answer your emails or their version of groupme. You'll be asked to follow pretty much all day long even though your not salary.  They also say they'll pay for tuition except they won't guarantee your days off to attend classes.  As an assistant manager you will be asked to do almost everything because let's be honest the managers at AT&T are just there for show.
good,It has been several years since I was employed by AT&T.  I know that there have been several changes and I do not feel competent to comment on the current environment or make recommendations one way or the other.
good,Managed the relocation of Washington Mutual employees and infrastructure devices from nine Seattle downtown remote sites to the new 55-story Washington Mutual Center.
good,"The culture change shifted when AT&T took over. Massive layoffs, general morale went down. It used to be a thriving campus where it was filled with people and towards the end felt like a ghost town."
good,I enjoyed the work variety and freedom of the job.  Always learning new technologies.  Training was hands on and very educational.  The only thing I did not like was not having set hours.  You never knew what time you would finish for the day.
good,Good big company. AT&T is a large company with many layers to get things done. It's more about working with the right resources internally than with customers. Learn their process and you should be fine working here.
good,"Productive fun place"
good,They are forcing me to write review with at least  150 thats one hundred and fifty characters ... .....................................................
good,"This was a very large company experience in all aspects, from hiring to benefits to culture and decision making.  It was a well oiled engine and you can do fine if you stick to the plan.  Very little risk/reward compared to other organizations I have been a part of or know about.  Lots of expertise to draw from but influence is the critical currency needed to excel."
good,The workday can be stressful because some managers like to micro manage their direct reports. I learned that the job required a lot of patience. The environment can be fun as management run different contests to keep employees motivated.
good,It was a good job had to relocate and work for s company that contracts for at&t. the company I currently work for is awful. never have I worked for a company that takes money away every year.
good,My primary focus was sales.The atmosphere was very competitive which I enjoyed.I also liked working with existing customers on there accounts because occasionally they would add more service if you examplified good custmer service.
good,"My manager was very helpful and understanding but due to lack of pay and how much work was being asked of, he left and resigned."
good,"Fast pace work, have to be very detailed oriented, costumer service and have full understanding of all products and services. Great part time job for college students at the call center."
good,Good overall environment with excellent training to provide me with the tools I needed to succeed. My only negative was the instability with changing of management happening more often than a stable working platform should allow.
good,Day to day was tedious due to performance-of-metrics focus. Benefits and perks were excellent. More than made up for bureaucratic state of affairs. Pay was competitive due to Union presence (Thank God)
good,"When it was DirecTV they took good care of us, but when ATT bought us out we lost that personal experience and became just numbers. The compensation and benefits werent bad, but the schedule was horrific and could change day to day, so planning anything outside of work was impossible."
good,"Too many meetings"
good,Was sent to another project after ATT moved away from Convergys as their contractor after 20 years.  Training was adequate but the company obviously knew of a possible end to the ATT contract with Convergys when I was hired.  The contract ended only after the first several months.  I was then put on the DirectTV project.
good,"This position was very laid back, a straight 40 hours with overtime as needed. It was not a micromanagement position you came and did your job. These things were important to all who worked there and made it a very easy to go to work everyday."
good,i worked here when it was pacific bell internet. i helped with the internet side of dsl. good workplace. good pay. good people. i enjoyed my time here.
good,It was a fine job but super stressful and not worth it to me. This whole survey thing is ridiculous and I do not want to write this much about AT&T. I do not work there and do not plane to work there in the past.
good,Start-up business culture before purchase by Cingular
good,"I love to help people. Building rapport as well as having empathy is extremely important. Your job not only consists of making a profit, for the company, but also gaining trust from the customer. It is critical that the client feels comfortable in order to maintain service with them.I love it when a customer tells me that they were dreading calling in, and then thank me for making it easy."
good,"Made promises they didn't keep after merging with Alltel, such as benefits, pay scale and commission structure. Decent work environment and good products."
good,"Micromanagement is a big factor. the managers are so constricted to meet their management goals that they do not listen to problems in the feild. you are a  robot paid to do things the att way, not necessarily the correct quality craftsmanship required."
good,The compensation was decent but the hours and days were not great and inconsistent. I wanted to be able to spend time with my family and this job did not allow for that.
good,"Its a good place to work and have work life balance. I learned a lot working for CHC Consulting, and ran AT&T operations. It was a great learning experience."
good,It was fun at first but it gets repetitive and gets boring. Easy sales job if you're looking into getting into sales. The pay was ok. There are higher paying sales jobs but if this is your first it's not bad.
good,"A typical day of work is normal, occasionally intense to very intense WFH helps to manage it. "
good,Leading a team to high performance and watching your development style lift the spirit of your team to even greater performance.  The people are awesom
good,"A typical day at work, is answering the calls coming in from customers who need help with their DIRECTV billing, technical issues, or just general questions. The workplace environment is like family, because of course, you see your co workers more than you do your own family! The most enjoyable part is the relationships you make with your coworkers and managers."
good,"Although pay and bonus was good, there was constant downsizing every six months.  This made the work culture very stressful.  It became a way of life at the company"
good,"the job is easy, the people were great. The higher ups continued to increase required production numbers all while lowering the amount of compensation received for achieving your goals."
good,I am a contracted worker so I don't feel comfortable rating ATT. I enjoy working under the ATT contract. The job gives me an opportunity to make a difference and help customers.
good,"Things could have changed since I worked there, but I applied for a Customer Service job and it ended up being a focus on Sales. My technical abilities were overshadowed by my lack of sales. Was not for me."
good,"....the stress level is not worth any of it. Tenure means nothing to them, the happiness of their people means about as much to them as a cheap bag of chips for thanks."
good,Was a good starting sales job. AT&T was fine as a company to work for. I do not have any complaints or any need to write a negative review. AT&T Uverse.
good,Miner was a short-term contract.  The working conditions were fine.  My coworkers were fine.  The work itself was fine.  No complaints.  Left for a new opportunity elsewhere.
good,Working here at AT&T is pleased to learn new things and look at bigger organization like this and their process and technology adoptions.  but not the place where you can enjoy the work and take care about family.
good,It was a fast paced situation. Not a lot of on job training. I was a contractor so I wasn’t aware of their benefits. A lot of moving parts. It was an experience.
good,It was a good place to work with.  AT&T offers very good healthcare benefit and discount prices on the company products  but there are too many outsource activities going on so often.
good,"The workplace is very strict with time. Working in a call center, you are expected to be on time and be doing what you are tasked to do, when you are tasked to do it, without having to be told. Management style varies, yet most are very hands-off."
good,Job served its purpose for income however would not recommend to someone. Stressful without sufficient pay to compensate for the work. Long hours.....
good,"AT&T was nice place to work, but it was not my favorite, I think at the time II was employed, the management team was a little weak, in it's ability to train effectively. I may be because I was a manger and most of team leaders were a lot young than me."
good,"At&T is very successful and a leader in wireless and now the entertainment business however after so many megers and acquisitions it has become very difficult to navigate how to get things done.  Numerous re-organizations have caused a lot of confusion yet the company stresses need for collaboration amongst teams to create design develop, etc.  Seems the simplest tasks have become weighted down with so many processes.  I find it frustrating.  I am a full time teleworker so I don't have the benefit of tapping into office talk or conversation that might bring some clarity.  We have so many internal websites and social media sites, wiki pages causing information overload.  The training provided is top notch but if have trouble learning from a talking head or via video feed, you'll find it difficult to keep up with the new technology that's being rolled out.  There are very high, you might say impossible demands to complete the training courses laid out for each employee.  It requires a huge commitment that would include logging on after work hours just to attend & complete training courses."
good,"Good place to work but can improve in how management handles critical situations. The company also needs to provide better benefits especially year end annual bonus and merit increase. Overall, challenging atmosphere to work in, but can improve."
good,AT&T use to be a great place to work but over the years the morale has declined due to constant surpluses and decrease in benefits. Management that is rarely able to handle the demands of employees as well as customers.
good,At and t provide discounts on tickets rooms hotels and attractions. Greta customer service managers and staff. this company is not competitive but is very structural company.
good,"Handled customer service and sales call"
good,"If you're a shark, this is great. But if you're in sales and like building relationships with your customers, look elsewhere. Turn and burn was the name of the game."
good,"Paid training. Wasn't as boring as I thought it would be. At the start, we all had set schedules, which was great. Later, our start and end times would change day to day. Eventually, pretty much everyone had a variable type schedule. If you asked for time off, they forced you to use your PTO instead of using your regular two days off for the requested days."
good,"ATT did not own Directv when I worked there so these answers cannot pertain to ATT."
good,"The culture was a good company - I just outgrew the company and needed a change. I was very happy while I was there, and was encouraged to come back at any time in the future."
good,AT&T provided great experience as a BA and project manager. The management team and co workers were very helpful and supportive on training the AT&T culture
good,Initially the job was fast paced and was very enjoyable.  Once you proved that you had a higher then normal skill set some of the management team became concerned for their position.
good,"Typical call center job. You are expected to meet weekly and monthly quotas. It is very easy to bonus, but the work becomes tiring and the burnout can really take a toll on you."
good,"This is a company that is constantly in flux. Telecommunications and entertainment is a rapidly changing industry, and AT&T is one that will always change to remain competitive. Pay and benefits are best in the industry, Difficult to maintain a good work/life balance."
good,a learning experience and time of great growth  especially in how to preserver. found myself able to achieve goals i didn't think i could .............
good,The constant fear of layoffs and ever changing job description; turned what was once a fantastic career into a nightmare. I wouldn't recommend this job for anyone concerned with stability.
good,"Challenging fun work as a Systems Engineer at AT&T Broadband reviewing, analyzing, and test systems for use in supporting AT&T Broadband customers. AT&T Broadband was bought by Comcast."
good,"while i worked at At&t it was still directv. we answered and returning phone calls, walked customers through troubleshooting techniques and set up appointments with service techs."
good,"no comment, I do not wish to comment, I am not happy that I lost my job, pay and benefits were outstanding, I enjoyed my co-workers and the work hours"
good,AT&T is has no view on the frontline employees as well as level 1and level 2 management. its great company and you do learn how to meet deadline and set a structural plan behind sales and operational goals.
good,"I good place to start you career, get experience working in global ISP, get hands on experience on networking equipment from many vendors. Good atmosphere and team spirit."
good,"very competitive, The days were very monotonous and tedious, Goals were very hard to hit making it difficult to provide for my family. The people were very nice and had no issue with management."
good,"I have worked at the same location for 18 years. I enjoyed the camaraderie, the structure of daily of business, and independency. Morning safety and daily instructions were some-what consistent."
good,A typical day would be taking 20-30 calls or more. Assisting in technical support and billing etc. I learned a lot about the business on the inside. The hardest part was the customers being rude.
good,A typical day at work would be replying to emails and answering voicemails.  Weekly conference call was also always at least 3 times a week. .........
good,"AT&T offers some amazing benefits and PTO flexibility, but there are a lot of politics as you can expect with any large company. Including red tape that keeps sellers from progressing."
good,"The organizational culture in B2B was challenged, and in need of some adjustment. This heavily impacted employees throughout the organization. There was a great work-life balance."
good,"AT&T was a nice place to work at. I enjoyed my time there until they kept changing the commission structure of the job. They said that it was easy to make money under the new structure, but what they really meant was the market was saturated."
good,IBEX had a contract with AT&T. The systems were always down and I felt our training class wasn't ready to be placed in A Bay. So much more information needed to be covered.
good,i had a great career journey with att/ 15 years as a Technician and 15 as a manager. Responsible for the installation and Maintenance of att wire line products
good,"AT&T, one of the largest corporations on Earth, would save money on hiring American citizens by instead hiring foreign employees who were willing to work for very little, under the guise of contract employees."
good,"Outside work, in all conditions.  Rain/Snow/Sun.  High expectations from customers.  First line management is awesome, 2nd/3rd line managers are out of touch with the field."
good,Stressful job never feel like they keep asking more and more always getting question about goals and number push sales just to stressful of a job good job if you want the stress
good,the company has changed since i last worked there. Uverse was not unionized and managers were abusing their power and enforcing rediculous hours and demanding productivity higher than what was required by the company. It is part of the union now so i cannot say how things are now
good,Management needs to hop off the high horse get on the sales floor and actually help the reps when needed of course that was just my manager I can’t speak for others In the company. The reps turned into family and I loved that
good,Started off as a great company to work for but they started to over promise and under deliver. Lack of leadership in the upper management. Very backwards way of thinking in at corporate headquarters.
good,"I'm writing this as a legacy DirecTV employee (Denver call centre), and DTV was an amazing company to work for: clear open communication, room for advancement, management cared about polishing and helping their employees with their career and personal goals. There was a reason that DTV was rated in the top ten employers to work for in Denver something like 7 years running. Things have definitely changed with AT&T though. The fun, lighthearted environment now feels oppressive and almost gloomy; management is reviewed for surplus (layoffs) every quarter, causing the employee development to have gone out the window, not that there's really any room for advancement anymore. The call centre hasn't hired new agents in almost 3 years (writing as of early 2018) and the total staffing is down to around 125 from about 500 a couple of years ago. Any time there's a major acquisition or merger things change, I know, and I know that I was spoiled at DTV. In reality, taking the experiences I had at DTV out of the picture, it's really a good call centre to work in and could be so much worse."
good,"It was a stressful and sales driven environment, but I managed to last a couple of years.  Made the job unbearable at times. Because of that experience, I try to steer clear of call center jobs. This experience was nothing like the previous call center I worked at."
good,Staff on the account is a constant up-n-down. Currently seeking jobs elsewhere because I got caught in a down-swing. Especially unstable if you are in upper pay brackets.
good,I care not to share my opinion. I appreciate my experience and time with AT&T.  I was in a sales and customer service environment. I have nothing else to share a this time
good,I had the pleasure of working for a great group of management.  I learned a lot during my tenure with AT&T and the culture was great.  Lots of great friends were made.
good,"No review can be given as it has been many years since I worked for this company. I did assist with creating new departments and training materials, but no recognition was given"
good,"Once the company sold, the culture and environment took a downturn. It became an environment where people were just waiting for ""their turn"" to get their letter of dismissal."
good,If you like dealing with people on a daily basis and hundreds of calls daily this is the job for you. What could be better than building raport and servicing others needs.
good,My position in collections was fast-paced and stressful. The culture was excellent with a collaborative workplace environment and focus on customer service and teamwork
good,"It was terrible thanks to the obsession with numbers and poor management, benefits were great though. So you'll be happy at home and dreading work constantly basically."
good,"Typical day is an 8 hour workday spent making sure your projects are following the AT&T process.  This doesn't necessarily mean progressing the project closer to delivery but rather making sure all ""relevant"" forms and approvals are filled out.  Overall the people you will work with are pleasant, however, the SLAs to complete each step of these required processes is so long that your projects will easily fall behind.  With the acquisition of AT&T and the planned acquisition of Time Warner budgets across all departments is tight with many urgent projects getting green lit only to be put on hold 3-4 weeks later.  As a foot soldier this can be very frustrating, communication why certain things are being done is not clear.  Just seeing the waste of time and dollars spent on starting, pausing, resuming and then ultimately cancelling projects is crazy."
good,Job was monday thru friday 37.5 hours per week.  Vacation time and benefits were excellent.  Union based so everything was decided on seniority.  Vacation days and rate of pay etc.
good,"answering calls nonstop all day, management was great, the culture of the work place was great and diverse, hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the unruly customers, I enjoyed the people I worked with"
good,They care more about numbers then the actual employees. Poor service all over the place.No one knows what going on at all but after things does not get done they blame the bottom people. I'm sure its more stressful then ever now that I left. I rather deal with less stress then this place its RIDICULOUS and will never change at all.
good,It's concerning that a Firm or Organization has change to fit the culture of the environment witihin the south as it has. I would recommend this if you have no aspirations to move up within the company. Due to the changes they are reducing the work force.
good,"During my time at AT&T morale was not very high. After many budget cuts and layoffs, employees felt very insecure. The division I worked for had little room for advancement and raises considering years of service, and high performance, we still low."
good,"AT&T is a public company.  Like any public company, it only considers the stock holders.   AT&T is popular for outsourcing.  The employee would have no job security,"
good,Pros:
good,ATT was a good company to work for. The pay was good and the benefits were okay. Management could have been a little better. It was a good starter job.
good,"the work place is great, you can wear short on  saturday and sunday and can even wear flipflops. the people are great and fun to be with. a lot of freebies"
good,No comments to make as it has been over 20 years since I worked here as a consultant so I feel that anything I mention will not be accurate. The company has evolved over this period of time.
good,"Not the environment I thought it would be, very competitive and they are too forceful to customers about purchasing their products. I feel like I had to be a pushy salesman and I didn't like that."
good,"Busy, made sure we had busy work whether it was painting walls. Moving pallets, moving offices, they did send us to training for security plus. Direct management was cool."
good,"collaborative and healthy work environment. Exposure to latest tools, good learning platform,  work life balance, opportunity to hone one's skills, people are supportive"
good,"It was a decent company to work for. I disliked the amount of hours and scheduling because of its inconsistency, other that that the job was pretty decent"
good,Working in the Digital PMO typical day could vary contingent on the project/program you're working on.  We had the flexibility to work from home 3 days a week however the onsite manager micromanaged. Also consultants/contractors work harder than employees. Some  AT&T employees often spent less actually working.
good,"Buen lugar, buen sueldo, horarios pesados buen ambiente"
good,"Good work/life balance, very old and complacent workforce, mix of old and young employees is way off balance. New hires if hired outside the company get poor work-related training."
good,"face paced environment, very competitive noisy a typical day at work in a call center. The hardest part of the job was trying to up sell customers.  Enjoyable part if sells are great your pay would benefit from it."
good,Fast pasted day typically. Learned customer service skills. Management was okay. workplace culture was competitive due to commission sales. Hardest part of job was selling DirecTV
good,Company will not allow you to go and do your job without micro managing every aspect of your job. If make a decision on your own it's not the right decision unless your manager says it ok
good,"I was hired in 1997 when the company was still operating as Pacific Bell.  At that time, career advancement and development was highly encouraged and the leaders of the business were actively engaged in helping you do so.  I was fortunate enough to work for some tremendous leaders who really helped to groom me in the professional world.  "
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with very much. The company makes many billing errors that upset customers that are difficult to deal with. Pay for the work put in can be a little short.
good,The direct managers and coworkers are great great pay union but overall the cow is worthless should be sent packing he is nothing but a  megalomaniac in a cheap suit
good,This is a good company to start out a new career with if you are coming out of high school. The opportunity AT&T gives for the new generation is fantastic for them to learn about the wireless industry.
good,"Great company as far as service goes, but their pricing is high from a consumer standpoint. "
good,My time at ATT was extremely beneficial. The volume of work during certain seasons was extreme volume at a fast pace. I learned how to triage tickets and vendor dispatches from most critical/severe to less threatening in a timely fashion to ensure all trouble tickets were promptly dispatched to appropriate persons to evaluate and diagnose issues pertaining to all cell towers.
good,"Se brinda libertad para trabajar. Hay absoluta autonomía para llevar acabo las acciones que se piensa, nos acercan a los objetivos."
good,It was a productive place to work and work life balance was not good. I dont recommend working here if you have small children. There lots overtime.You are also micro-managed
good,I was doing a project through a temp agency for AT&T for State Farm. I have nothing to say in reference to AT&T because I really didn't work directly with them.
good,Large company with typical issues such as departmental silos and  frequent reorganizations causing layoffs.Great opportunity to work with many cultures and expand skills and knowledge depending on direct manager.
good,"AT&T, as far as the call center is a job that will be whatever you make and depends on if you enjoy this type of work. They have good fringe benefits such as: free or discounted internet, TV, phone, and cell phone."
good,it was a good company to work for the only reason im not there is because my office was surplused and I was laid off after working there 26 years but I hear now there is no pension
good,"This was a fast past work environment, with long hours. However, the option to work remotely is a plus. I learned a lot about Agile project management as our team transitioned from a Waterfall to 100% Agile environment."
good,I worked for this company for over 18 years. You have to be able to handle the high stress from both the customers and the management and to be able to multi task. This type of Company is always changing and advancing and you must be able to keep up to survive.
good,"great supervisor"
good,"Just like any other telecom, they go from good to bad to worse to horrid."
good,"Company paid well and offered good job security. Due to its size there were inefficiencies and utilization of personal, which could stem growth and learning."
good,AT&T has a fast paced environment and is in the process of a large cultural change with a focus in entertainment. Overall it is a good company to work for with great benefits;
good,I worked at AT&T for 6 years and at first it was a great company. Within the last year the company has gone downhill by performing unnecessary layoffs just tom be able to hire only part time positions at lower salary and less commission
good,"good work life balance, learned to manages offer short on site teams."
good,Sales environment. Competitive. Weekly pay. Quarterly bonuses. Room for advancement. Good Benefits. No complaints other than no changes in schedule bc it was based on seniority
good,ATT is new to the cable business and management is very difficult to work with.  It can be fun and excited work day if it was staff properly and mandatory OT is not demand everyday.
good,Various network translations tasks assigned during overnight maintenance window.  I learned to perform over twenty different work activities which are listed on my resume.  The management style was hands off most of the time  but there is also a great deal of micro-management due to monitoring of all activities performed on my PC.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with activity timers that must be started and stopped with each job.  The timers are also used to judge performance more than the actual quality of work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is learning a vast array of activities and the camaraderie of working with a great group of engineers.
good,"I have had far worse jobs, been paid much less, and been treated worse, but the corporate culture can be depressing and or irritating.If you do your job well, are where you are supposed to be, and treat the customers well, management normally leaves you alone. Working outside in all weather conditions, crawlspaces, attics."
good,"Great learning experience.  As technology changes so does the job function and expectation. Technologies are continually being advanced everything is faster, sleeker, better looking, equipped with greater data memory, however these products look almost the same externally.  The challenge is learning the products features and benefits and being able to sell intelligently."
good,fast paced but not enough room for growth and not enough hours. looking for something more comp and more growth. also something with more hours and better management
good,Very similar to other large companies. Processes and procedures dominate the work environment. Difficult to change directions. Overall a good company to work for.
good,"This is the same company I previously reviewed.  Please see review for the company previously rated in the first section of this form.  December 27, 2018"
good,"-the most enjoyable part of my job was helping our customers. Most calls were about customer issues with their billing, product, or service. I t was thrilling having the customer know I understand their problems, and being able to solve them within a timely manner."
good,"my days consisted of sales support/ financial representative so i spent a lot of time with inventory, money management, and countless backend work. Came into work very earl and leave late in the day. very little time for a personal life due to schedule auto populating and based on seniority. Management changes from store to store. my last manager was a complete nightmare but our previous managers were positive, drove sales and encouragement  and made work less stressful for every role"
good,"learn to be very professional and neat,got the chance to meet different people management was okay very strict the hardest part was dealing with customers"
good,The high pressure sales make it stressful but the pay makes up for it. Definitely not a job for parents with small children because of the hectic schedules.
good,Commission slowly declining do to them buying so much other stuff but overall good job depending what age you are I guess hours are crazy if you have a family
good,"this is a huge company and as such you are treated as a number not a person, and they do not care about the employees. they only care about pleaseing the stock holders."
good,"customers call in with multiple concerns and complex ones. A good thing a bout it , is that it is challenging. Training wise, we were all unequip of as to what will happen on the calls or what not, The company itself is good. But the third-party company is very political."
good,Good Company and good benefits enjoyed working with the different customers everyday. Enjoyed how company was always doing new things for customers and service.
good,"No opinion Of corporate AT&T, however, if we’re talking about spring mobile. No I would not recommend them. Not a good company, poor management and for treatment of employees."
good,"Managed a services team.  Learned to align daily activities with metrics.  Culture was friendly and family like, a carryover from the Bell System.  Hardest part was constant downsizing."
good,"You have to have a thick skin to work as a Customer Representative.  Most of your calls that come in to the center are from customer's that are upset over bills . It is a very fast pace enviroment ,so be prepared to type away."
good,It was the over all environment. People complained about everything. It was hard to keep upbeat about anything when everything was nit picked apart. It was mainly the employees.
good,"I was only there for a short time. My experience was not the best, as the manager that I supported was the most difficult person that I have ever worked with."
good,ATT was a difficult environment due to the many changes the company endured over a long period of time and the unfair competition they faced from MCI at the time I was there. I have faith that the many good aspects of the corporate culture that have always been a part of the company are still present there.
good,"Corporate companies are the worst, its about the dollar you put in their pockets instead of the value of the employee. We are not replaceable and neither are our children. FEML is a joke it is a system of hoops to jump through just to be denied. Family first is the only option, At&t is not a family friendly company."
good,"I appreciate working from home, but the hours you have to work get the work done is not really fair.  If you do not work the hours, it is hard to get the amount of work completed"
good,every other week is a different priority you need to be quick to adapt or you will be written up and let go. be cautious about you ambitions as managers sometimes have a tendency to take advantage
good,Okay place to work but they do not take in consideration of people that are sick or have been hopitalized due to surgery and cannot make it in to work.
good,Good Team to work. Lab environment Large team across the country. Great and technologically advanced products and System. Learning opportunities. Flexible work hours..
good,"I have learned that Everyone really does not like the "
good,Company was a good place to be before it was taken over by a CEO that's concern with padding his pockets.  Many of the things that they were known for has been cut out
good,Management is lacking sometimes.  Union was overall void and effective.  Not always understanding of personal issues that may effect your work. No real complaints.  Go along okay with everyone.
good,"My employment with AT&T ended 30 years ago.  Much has changed in the Telecom industry since then, including Divestiture of the Bell System's assets into discrete companies."
good,I liked working there as the it was my first call center job but I was just learning how to use a computer and not fast enough. I was not able to reach quota so it was decided by both that I should practice more then try getting the job again
good,It was an okay job.  Don't really know what else to say it was a long time ago.  Just your typical call center job taking calls from customers about their cell phones
good,call center job selling and setting up dish television services was great work environment but was very fast paced and supervisors unavailable at some times.
good,AT&T provides opportunities to explore different business units. The work is pretty casual and stress free. Salaries are much lower than at competing employers.
good,"Nothing extraordinary on the other hand, nothing too negative."
good,As a customer service representative its easy in call center to get burnt out fast I don't know anyone that worked the phones at call centers that loved working the phones. Its basically complaints all day coming back to back usually without stop until the end of your shift. Most people last at these jobs a year maybe a few depending on your tolerance. I would suggest these jobs only for a brief time and then find something else.
good,i had an car accident and it caused me to lose the job i was out sick for a while and when return the manager wasnt very polite or understanding i dint know if the manager is stioll emoloyed but she made it hard for me to return
good,Could be better just really do not care of employees all about numbers. Can treat employees better win in health related issues and have compastion to personal needs
good,"Start work at 7:30 in the morning.  Short morning meeting.  Grab supplies and load up your truck.  Get ice water.  Jump in your truck, get gas, and head off to your first job of the day.  Usually do 2-3 jobs for an 8 hour day.  It varies...sometimes ONE job can take the whole day.  Troubleshooting faults in the cable, isolating and repairing those faults.  Sometimes there are multiple faults.  Both aerial and buried faults.  So yes, sometimes it can get a little stressfull.  If its buried, then you have to do your best at locating the fault, marking the area, and then have a dig crew come out and dig up the area that you marked.  If your trouble is not there, then you have to relocate and remark and have another dig crew come out and dig up that location.  There's a lot more that goes with this job.  I can go on for a while."
good,Being able to work at home was a major benefit especially during the winter months. it was easy dealing with customers and their issues. Very relax being able to work from home.
good,I get to work and begin getting on calls and meetings for at least 5 out of 8 hours a day. The other 3 are to execute marketing tactics with cross functional partners and teams. Hardest part of the job is probably time management. There are only so many hours in a day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that I get to work with the entertainment industry and working with adoption and retention marketing allows you to really appreciate the customer. The workplace culture is very diverse. You meet folks from all walks of life with many different experiences and perspectives. I can recommend the people and the management. There is a human aspect to the company I can appreciate in comparison to other companies I have worked for in the past.
good,AT&T ranks everyone sales performance on a curve in 4 quartiles. The top 25% is typically in the 125%-200% which makes it every competitive against our peers to out perform each other.
good,"this job was okay, the environment was not too upbeat.  workers are friendly.  management is cooperated with flexible scheduling. employee discount is no too bad either."
good,"Day started at 6:30AM PST due to east coast calls. As a whole work was ok. People I worked with were great and very smart. Although most releases were long, the team I headed up were up to it and this made the releases complete in a timely manner."
good,A typical day at work was fast paced and easy to do. Worked with a lot of great co wokers and learned a lot about handset and many other divices. Hardest part would have been trying to convience a person to love a phone they never ever used before.
good,"Nice job security and commission on top of the hourly pay. The job is pretty good, but the commission will change based on the needs of the company......."
good,"I Loved my Career with ATT as a Sales Manager.  I managed a team of Telephone Sales Reps (6-12).  Selling Yellow Pages and On-Line advertising programs-  However, ATT Sold the division to YP, who later closed our office and then sold to Dex Media."
good,"AT&T might be a powerhouse company, but they don't care about employees.They care more about making money than making people better and helping them out."
good,I worked as a phone tech support person here.  Handled all phone tethering and data connections at their call center.  Hours were typical for office work and everyone was in a cubicle.
good,"Maintain up-to-date knowledge about ATT products and services."
good,"Virtual environment. Must be self-disciplined. Challenging industry, but rewarding when you put in the effort. Company is transforming itself into a business software company, in hopes of replacing lost advertising revenue"
good,You wake up have to be onsite for your first job by 8 am you are not allowed to receive more than 50 hrs a week and you work 70 hrs. lot of mismanagement
good,"working as a store manager is great if you don't have a life to live.  you are constantly under pressure to have employees meet certain standards.  if not, the best thing to do is fire them"
good,great commission. great peers and mangers. DirecTv was a company that not only challenged my costumer service skills but as well as sharpened them. Very resourceful and helping company.
good,The work here is fast paced.  It is almost like production work yet they want everything done perfectly.  Never had a problem with management though. Customer service type work with labor involved
good,I was in yellow page sales which became extinct and as a new employee i was one of the first to be laid off.  It was a great job but unfortunately i started at a bad time.
good,"The hours of the job were long, pay was horrible, benefits average nd this is for Prime Communications. I would recommend to a first time employee for this job."
good,"It is not a job to take if you are young.  They haven't hired anyone for a decent paying job in 10 years.  They used to have a balance between profits, customers, employees and the community.  Now it is 5% customers and 95% profits."
good,"This was a fun place to work with great benefits. But due to the internet and changing time, the yellow pages marketing lost it's value and it became increasingly harder to succeed here."
good,installing cable you should know what to expect good time bad times easy work hard work contractors usually get the bad jobs in house gets the good ok
good,"Some good managers some not so good.  Bid on shifts, business side is Monday through Friday.  Good access to resources to do your job which is nice.  Friendly people, overall good work environment."
good,"Working at ATT was a fast paced office job. It is located Downtown Minneapolis, so parking was an issue. The benefits were great. It is a lot of time spent on the phone."
good,"Good place to work, but changes in company's direction made surplus a yearly thing.  Company was relaxed and productive, but the job was never felt secure."
good,Enjoyed a multi-tasking fast pace environment with the ability to and grow with the company.  Many position in the company gave me the opportunity to expand.
good,"The company was first Media One cable which had good benefits and even gave free cable, a decent place to work.  Then AT&T Broadband bought the company and as many buy outs & mergers many employees were laid off which is was not needed - but that is what happens."
good,"I worked as in inbound call customer service. What I did was to answer incoming calls from the customer, who inquire about AT&T service. "
good,"My job was eliminated after several years in that position, I was compensated nicely however of course the job position was always subject to being cut"
good,Es bonito  pero el clima con los jefes es muy tenso y eso de deja desarrollar las actividades de buena forma
good,"AT&T always talked about work/life balance but my job didn't seem to have that.  After yearly cut backs, the work load just seemed to grow and grow. Not only was there stress to get the job done but there was constantly the stress of whether or not your job would be eliminated."
good,"Company provides consistent work hours, training on their customer service etiquette and rewards employees with bonuses. "
good,"The company overall is a great company , the benefits are the best ,the pay can be more ,work scheduling can be variable never will have a stable work schedule, can change often."
good,If you don't like change this is not the company for you.  You have to have great selling skills.  Customer service is a must and working in a team oriented environment is a must.
good,"nice work environment, had a verbatim sheet to read from when calls came through customers would call in and you would help them place an order for direct TV services."
good,"My manager is great, but the workplace morale is bad.  Impossible objectives while the company promotes ""integrity'.  What a joke.  AT&T has no integrity."
good,"constantly changing procedures, some team leads who shouldn't have been, shift bids were atrocious. Benefits were very good including freee DTV service for everything they had"
good,"I really likes working there, however I was not paid enough for what we had to do.  They are also about quantity not quality, I was not allowed to take 15-20 mins to educate the customer.  Certain supervisors would want you to put the job in no matter what knowing in two months the customer was going to have problems.  It was all about locking the customer in a contract and dealing with it later."
good,I do not want to write a review as this is specific to Synchronoss/Sequential Technologies/CoWorx and is really reflective  of them not AT&T. I believe it would be awesome to work directly for AT&T.
good,The environment and people i worked with were up to date and friendly. The need to sell home security became the main source of commission income in the very end
good,"From the moment your walk in and sit at your desk, you feel like you are being controlled. No much room for initiative\free thinking. Compensation is barely adequate with low chance of salary increases."
good,"Great company to work for, but if you have family it's tough to be able to make time for sports and other activities due to working weekends and some times late nights."
good,AT&T is good place to learn and develop in the wireless and communication business. AT&T helps you to focus on little details that results in being knowledgeable about products and the business. The most enjoyable part about the company are the training classes to help your growth.
good,I would recommend this company to all installation techs. I felt very good about the company from the very start. The conditions working there were very helpful to advance further in the company
good,Always a new promotion monthly. Loved seeing what new products we could sell to customer. Company phone was a great way of seperating work from home..
good,"Worked as consultant on contract,not full time of aTT"
good,"I would load up all machine with ice, My be four station. So my team would would have Ice for Soda or Water. As a vendor I would make sure station had what it needed. Everything we would sale for that day.. Next count my money for my cash register. "
good,This was a good place to work.  At this point I am just filling up space to finish this review.  Why do I have to do this for every company.  I have worked for 5 major companies and this is really annoying.
good,AT&T provides opportunities to advance fairly fast and there in no limit on what you can earn via commission. AT&T offers full reimbursement for continuing my education.
good,It was a great career.  I enjoyed my job because I enjoy helping people.  I would work there today if I had the opportunity and if the location was nearby.
good,"not a very transparent program, ""play the game"" to get through the program on the managers good side. focused solely on sales, no focus in learning about other departments within at&t"
good,"Decent workplace but, very unprofessional. Low on pay, and cut back on bonus. Good with hours but, not good with PTO. Somewhat decent benefits but, not enough for a family."
good,"Califico como un buen sitio para desarrollar competencias y adaptarse a los cambios de una industria dinámica."
good,AT&T was a great place to work when I started there.  When I left it was going downhill and now it's not good at all.  They outsourced and offshored everything.
good,AT&T as a company is good but the division I worked for was mismanaged and was not a good division to work for. They never cared about the worker just the work.
good,worked there during a tumultuous time.  there were a lot of layoffs and forced departures.  Hopefully a new management team will bring changes that will help current employees.
good,"The company tries hard to make it better by paying well and offering incentives and keeping plenty of fun options and food, but the job itself is what wears you down. When the customers call in they feel like over the phone they can say what they want like it changes policy, and then when you dont budge they escalate and you do not recieve the help you need to handle the escalation except try to de-escalate."
good,Great pay if you can work the hours. It is a competitive call center. Forces you on a lot of occasions to chose between family and work. It i a call center so be prepared for gossip and pettiness.
good,I don't have time to write anything here. Thank you for asking. I need to get back to work so maybe i'll come and update this later. at&t is a good place to work just don't get comfortable because they are laying managers and techs off every 6 months.
good,"As a contractor, your job is always linked to budget issues."
good,DirecTV when I worked there.  Started as a customer service agent selling new products and tv programming and then to customer retention to keep remaining customers.
good,"Workplace culture is one of diversity and proven to develop dynamic and successful working teams.  "
good,"If you are looking for new experiences daily and look for something to change, you are at the right place.  Constantly looking for ways to improve and new tools to improve performance and customer experience."
good,MediaOne AT&T Broadband was a cable provider that was well run but went through different ownership and was ultimately taken over by Comcast.  Great people good strategy.
good,"When I first started at AT&T, it was a dream job and I enjoyed coming in to work every day. There was a positive attitude all around and management was free to openly reward based upon performance."
good,At&t provides some interesting and often fun activities. This is however overshadowed by the stress of maintaining their required stats. The company is about their bottom line and the all mighty dollar.
good,"Coming to work everyday after school was tiring, but most of all it was fun to finally have a job knowing I was still in school. The hardest part on the job is having an angry customer on the phone and having to calm them down."
good,"For young just out of school employees, this is a good place to get started. For senior resources not in the role du jour, not so much. AT&T changes their marketing strategy on a weekly basis at the top but the bottom layers of the organization are about 9 months behind in messaging and work efforts. "
good,Pay was great. I did not like having to be at a desk all the time chained to it. I did not like that managers would listen on calls and if they did not like you they would give you a bad score
good,"i took fmla do to ma illness. i was to return on 10/31 but my husband mom was killed. and they needed mental help so I but my family first, and got the help they needed."
good,This is a competitive sales work environment that requires much of your time to be dedicated to the business.  The hardest part of the job for me and my personality was being pushy towards people to get sales.
good,alot of overtime at first. managers to micro management. cutthroat gm in the areas. working thru all conditions . pole climbing . 3 to 4 installs a day
good,alright if you enjoy customers constantly complaining why their phone doesn't work. management is high turnover. no one really knows how to manage the store properly
good,This is when cell phones were first released to the public on a larger scale. I was considerably helpful as a customer service rep but the company wanted #'s not service
good,A typical work day involves a team huddle with the goals and expectations for the day. Where we are month over month along with area and district rankings. And to make sure we follow the sales process laid out by management.
good,Provides adequate training to new employees. Get to meet a lot of people from different walks of life. Get to interact frequently with customers and help the solve their technical issues.
good,It was a call center.  solved customers problems.  some days were fast others slow.  hardest part of the job was when you could not solve a problem.  company uses easy systems that you can learn quickly.
good,"Will not comment about at&t ,it would be against code of business. "
good,"I began as a customer service representative. I still am, 9 years later. There is now heavy stress to sell, sell, sell as well.  Bonuses require meeting several requirements before bonuses are paid. My best part of the job is helping people. That's what I enjoy at AT&T. I didn't sign on to sell, but I use the mind set of helping customers to fill needs and save them money in order to sell. I rarely make the mark, since sales cannot be forced, of course. That can be very discouraging when it's so pushed to meet goals, but the desire to help people is still there. Upper management is strict but they also listen to employee needs, which is outstanding.  Call volume varies. Culture can be good, but there is a lot of favoritism, evident every single day. There is some fun to be had as well. The hardest part of the job is noise level and push to sell. I've learned many different systems, always more to come."
good,It was fun to get a chance to help sports lovers.The pay was low but had enough hours to work on a daily basics.People depending on a good worker to help them with finding a parking spot was fun.
good,fine. Learned to manage. Its good to work as an employee in client place. Love to work in this....... so many culture guys are working there. Hence understand multi culture
good,"Competitive starting pay for the position and my location, but the real money is in the bonuses. You must meet your metrics to receive bonus checks. Training is 3 weeks and you will miss it when it's over. You have to wait 6 months before you are eligible for benefits and PTO. Customer service skills are a prerequisite. However, this is not a customer service job where your focus is to help the customer. Retention is in a higher tier than customer service. Your main role is to meet your metrics. Your performance directly affects your manager's bonus and your manager's shift bid position. A manager's shift bid position is based on their team's overall performance. Your shift bid position is different, it is based on seniority. Employees with seniority have priority during shift bids so new people typically will get the most undesired schedule. When you are assigned a shift, you are likely going to be assigned to a new manager. Shift bids occur multiple times at any point during the year, mostly when there is a new training class. This job is perfect for individuals who can sit in a confined space 90% of the year, individuals that operate like a robot, maybe similar to a taxi driver. If you allow emotions to influence your decisions, it will be tough for you to meet your metrics. Most customers that reach your line are likely going to be yelling, lying, cursing you out and calling you names. The customer wants you to do exactly what you cannot do. Credits go against your manager's numbers. Cancellations go against your manager's numbers. Escalations make you a less desirable team"
good,"After working there for over a decade, earning a bachelor's and master's degree (without tuition assistance), and earning a certification through their online training system, there ability to move up into management is non-existent. I RARELY saw anyone move up the latter into management. They provide the illusion of ""possibility"" but even after years of hard work and applying to multi-dozens of potions, I couldn't even get an interview inside the company I had proved myself in for 15 years. Was finally laid off when they closed my division because it had reached the end of the product's life cycle."
good,Enjoyed resolving issues with customers. Enjoyed working in team environment. Proper recognition for completing goals. Enjoyed options to learn more and advance your career.
good,I find it very stressful that in a sales job that is commission only one can bust their butt and still may not get anything if people do not feel like buying.
good,This was a temporary position. I was employed for AT&T through a temp agency I had no benefits. It was inbound call position. I spoke with businesses about adding additional phone services. There isn't much moue to rell.
good,This was a good place to work because they offered lots of jobs which allowed me to earn enough money to support my family. There was a lot of driving involved and long days.
good,Great compensation but stressful. The building i was in saw 3 different center managers in 6 months. 1 local in house and the other two were from other states. Lots of anxiety internally with hittting numbers.
good,I worked for DirecTV for eight years as the in-house technician installing Cable Systems satellite systems for them. AT&T bought them out cut my pay by two-thirds and took half hour benefits away. So I left
good,"Initial worked contract for AT&T and really enjoyed the positions held.  When I became a perm employee the opportunities were not as fruitful.  Good pay, benefits, 401K, education, etc"
good,The job in itself is not horrible but the job culture is horrible they dont treat you like men.  Because they judge by statistics they don't see as a man but an asset that can be handeled anyway without caring about the individual.  Plus the people who create these metrics  that judge you as employee have never actually done the job so they have no clue what your day work load is.
good,Was the best job I've ever had and it was nice to help customers in non exclusive doors until ATT eliminated my job and left these retailers to struggle alone
good,I had a great manager. Stressful based upon work matrix about working quickly but not efficiently. Quantity VS. Quality.  The company is always looking to get rid of people.
good,"Having good experience in the Information Technology Industry and also healthy participation in all phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) including analysis, design, coding."
good,"Great pay! They are unionized and your raises are written in stone."
good,"Your days fly by but definitely plan on working a minimum of 12 hours per day for 8 hours pay."
good,"Good company to work for the hours are wonderful, Co-workers are friendly and helpful, The work its self is rewarding and challenging at times, all around good job"
good,"This is a fun place to work with great career advancement opportunity at every corner. Also, close to many different shopping centers and restaurants."
good,"I liked that fact that I could move from department to department, if there was an opening.  There was no work to take home and my colleagues were very sociable. At times, advancement seemed difficult, but if you persevered, then a person could achieve.  The mixture of men and women in the offices in which I worked, made the work experience well-rounded and balanced.  If the desired work was done, the management presented no problems."
good,Working for this company was a fun experience however it was very stressful. I learned a great deal but I believe the company needs to revisit training new technicians.
good,"AT&T is a decent job. I would recommend the job to a friend. The isn't much work life balance Working there actually caused issues in my personal relationships because of the amount of hours i would be working. Also my degree wasn't related to what i was doing at AT&T. The best thing about the job was the pay, the pay was excellent for the work i was doing.  ."
good,"Good management, able to take outside trainng to expand knowledge.  Ability to take time off when necessary and on short notice. Nice people in the office."
good,I really enjoyed working for AT&T however the management team was not flexible at all I had complications after having my daughter and exhausted all short-term disability and FMLA and they would not approve additional time off which caused me to have to resign
good,This job consist of calling on businesses to sell advertising through the print and online products that the company offers. It is a competitive sales position.
good,"This is a great job, with great benefits but you must be willing to commit to the job. I had to travel a very long way to be able to stay in the position that I was in."
good,AT&T is Cool Fun environment to work. Managers are good and considerate of work and personal life balance. work from home is allowed often to balance and address work needs
good,"Lack of help from Management when urgencies transpired on the job, good benefits, 5 day work week but never two days off in a row, lack of trust from employees to management"
good,it was a good experience you do learn a myriad of things about the company and you can use that knowledge in your life and in your career. i worked for at&t and directv and the bad part is that you're standing all the shift.
good,"Fast paced but at the same time good work-life balance, innovative products to work on, nice colleagues, good managers, had lot of travel for me,  but it is okay"
good,Not enough staff to handle the incoming call volume. You need thick skin to work with the angry customers that are receiving poor service or billing errors. Management was terrific and coworkers were wonderful.
good,worked at a third party vender center called west . I would have no issues working there again if needed. I would not work for att if if was formally Direct TV. Direct TV is a horriable place that just chews and spits people out once they force you to go from regular customer service department to retention.
good,This is an okay place to work.  The compensation and benefits are good.  Atmosphere is very stressful and it doesn't need to be.  Liked the people I worked with.
good,ATT - big company with low chance to advance your skills. Once you are in one department everything you do is around few things you do every day. I would still recommend it though.
good,"At&t is a good job that will make you work for every cent on your pay check. Very easy to adapt to, the pay is great but there is a certain stress level that does come with it that could haunt you on your off days."
good,"Troubleshoot hardware, software and connectivity issues. Process equipment upgrades"
good,"assisting customers with their service, answer phone, collection, sales"
good,"It was sales. Very stressful, no time off, Retail can be very demanding, never had anytime with my family. I would not recommend this job for a family person."
good,Lack of advancement coupled with extremely poor leadership skills. ATT pitched a ideal utopic work environment that they hadn't delivered upon. It was virtually impossible to get hired internally through copious and ample amounts of skillsets matching their desired candidates.
good,Job was a good. Changes Everyday which was not a real bother. Some Of the Management were wish washy different day by day. Paid Good for the town i'm in.
good,I liked working for AT&T but I didn't like the supervisors they wasn't teaching the proper tools that we where going to need when going into the floor
good,Everyone was great to work with.  Only downside is the job security is not there.  ATT Executives are more concern with profits so they started to offshore work to save money.
good,"When Southern Bell and AT&T split, it was a mess.  No one knew where they were going or if they had a job.  The Union was very weak.  It was nerve racking while working there..they would even change you job to sales although you were a clerk."
good,Entertaining but a little chaotic at times. Fast paced and friendly staff and management team. Always willing to work with you and are very Understanding.
good,"AT&T does a great job at providing good security, but is headed in a direction of triple volumes of work, less people. They are pushing for a culture of automation - their main goal is to do more work, be more productive, with less people."
good,"AT&T is a good company with good benefits. Sales can be a challenge. Overall benefits are great. Discounts on services as well as medical, dental, etc."
good,I don't really want to review this company. The overall experience has been positive because of the people and connections I have made and for that I will always be thankful for the experience
good,A place to find and work with good people. They are very corporate and you can get lost in the shuffle if you don't keep an eye out. The Creative department does great work.
good,Buen ambiente sólo quesi el cliente contrata un plan y después deja de. Pagar te descomicionan y cada rato cambian el esquema de pago
good,"one place that I had good times and learned and got me started in wireless work, continued in that field once I left, I would love to find another job in that field"
good,"no I don't want to    very stressful to work there, all they want you to do is sell, sell, sell and sell   Uverse, direct tv, uverse, direct tv, internet, home phone svc, etc., etc., etc.,"
good,There are areas of opportunity when it comes to handling employees as well as their client based customers. Company structure at that time was less than ideal.
good,"AT&T was my first corporate job after graduating college. I began as a compensation admin and promoted to project manager. There is room to grow in this company.  However, I was expected to be on call...we had pagers (ha ha) at the time.  We needed to be available to the customer at all times.  I learned a lot about telecom and the industry and it was a stepping stone into my telecom career.  AT&T is a giant and full of regulatory laws.  I chose to move and work for a  CLEC. I will always be grateful for the experience I gained."
good,Its a great place to work the 3 managers I've had have been great there is no work life balance you will spend atlas 10 hours at work a day and if a customer decides to come in before you close which happens often you will be there all night. There are no sick days even though we have them if you call out sick it will be a point against you. Pay is good and so are the benefits.
good,i hate i had to move across the states. This place was family to me. Half of the people i know are gone now but if i would have made more money i would have stayed there.
good,"This company helps to motivate individuals for team resolutions and high technical adaption skills. The factors of this type of employment are associated with the honing of problem solving skills, self-motivation, social connections, increasing communication skills for better advantage of product sales, and multitasking for customer advantages and customer satisfaction. The workplace culture is one closely rated to professional qualities such as mannerisms, and diversities which aid in the competition and skill advancement between two common skills such as technical support and sales."
good,"The company is fine to work however, need to do a better job of assessing their managers all do not follow the AT&T rules and not all are honest and fair"
good,"Very Big organization, it takes time to understand the structure and all the  player involved. Depending upon which BU or organization you are supporting the work culture and pressure could vary."
good,Seems like a great company to work for just not at this time. They are undergoing changes and its really hurting the front line employees with less commissions and more demands. Hardest part is there really isn't any work life balance if you aren't a senior employee.
good,"Fue un trabajo muy bueno es su ambiente , trabajo en equipo"
good,"AT&T provides great benefits to it's employees in terms of discounts, pay and health care. I have to give the company that much. The biggest detractor is that you are a small cog in a big wheel and if you don't know people in the Corporate hubs of Dallas, Atlanta, or El Segundo, good luck moving up."
good,AT&T acquired Directv. The work location is very close to the airport with adequate employee parking. The work environment is team oriented across the US.
good,"Not much job security been working for over 16 years and facing a layoff."
good,Not a bad place to work but should be flexible on your schedule because when they do bids you never know what shift you will end up on. Pay was not bad but your customer service skill on the phone should be really good
good,This company was called Cingular Wireless and was later bought ut by A T & T Wireless. I worked as a temporary worker fr a few months in the position of hostess.
good,"The term work environment is used to describe the surrounding conditions in which an employee operates. The work environment can be composed of physical conditions, such as office temperature, or equipment, such as personal computers. It can also be related to factors such as work processes or procedures."
good,"Good people make the machine work."
good,"I work on Credits and Adjustments for large Corporate Accounts. Some Credit cases are more difficult then others. "
good,"En la empresa aprendes mucho sobre mecánica, solo q aveces no se juzga de acuerdo a tu desempeño sino que todo depende de como le caigas al personal, de ai en fuera la empresa es buena."
good,"Changing with technology."
good,Great company WARNING if call center they are union so doctors notes do not count if you are sick and need off the time will count against you if there is not an open allocation. However the health insurance and other benefits are amazing!
good,As you can see I haven't worked for AT&T for a long while. It was my first job after I left college. I loved the fast pace and doing the secretarial work I did. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the people I worked for. Very professional office. It gave me a sense of accomplishment every night when I left to go home.
good,Middle management seems to be disjointed and not in line with Senior Management. A middle manager lying to one's face or on documents is not out of the question.
good,"This review pertains to Directv prior to AT&T purchase. Long hours, equipment shortage, management would not release more receivers. Jobs took longer than they should and rolled over everyday into operating hours. Customer satisfaction scores took to much of a roll in the everyday job performance."
good,"As a Front Desk Clerk/Night Auditor I performed all clerical duties including filing, typing, and answered phones.  I also made reservations via internet, fax and phone.  I checked guests in and out, took payments via cash and credit card.  I completed an audit report every night which consisted of processing credit card transactions, correcting billing errors, and I ensured that the money received matched the transaction totals, and I handled complaints."
good,"I really liked the company, I liked the people and the customers. I really liked everything except my manager. Luckily after I left, she was shortly fired for fraud. Karma I guess."
good,Have to meet quotas of sales or get marked for it. The only good part is getting free directTV and also get some free DVDs and other prizes for selling things per day.
good,Company has wonderful benefits/insurance and take care of their employees well but they do lack the work/life balance for a continually growing family.
good,This company was actually with direct tv. but the job was good i was outside and i worked with my hands all day and met new people daily. the work of the day was always changing.
good,Amazing company to work with! I had a great time learning and meeting new people. I would def reccommend this company to all the recent graduates who are just starting off their careers.
good,Position was to support customers with services and technologies that can be considered as legacy.  People were great but culture was bad as leadership wasn't focused on developing personnel but rather driving what seemed like a slave galley
good,"The company was going thru ownership changes so it was"
good,"No such thing as a typical day. May be driving lond distance anytime of day or night to meet a river boat to repaire various electronics. May be at that location for several hours or have to ride vessel and arrange for transportation back when done. Work in all types of weather. Next call may be installing radio in a car at the shop. Or installing access control, cameras, radios or other electronics in petrochemical plantes"
good,I loved my job and the security till surpluses began. I loved the people and the work. Great place to work for years then AT&T took over. Bad news. Diverse and fun. Challenging work.
good,"So they fail at buying T-Mobile, and lay off their seasoned workforce? You know what happens when you do that? You get a bunch of new hires that don't understand the job or believe in the company. And then the company goes downhill."
good,"During my two years while working for DirecTv tech support, the company had been bought out by another company and there was absolutely no communication between the big wigs and the local management."
good,"Too many managerial changes which impede the progress of many projects. The company will need to wean itself from using so many offshore resources because of time difference barrier, so many issues have to wait for offshore staff."
good,I think the company overall is great and for 8 or my 9yrs there I was very happy but then a new manager came in and really made it a very bad experience for me. After 9 loyal years a bully of a new manager made me hate my job and hate being at work and instead of standing up to him I left the company.
good,"The company has great benefit for technical employee, from 401k to great insurance. The managers are very attentive to employees complain and concerns"
good,I do not recommend this employer to anyone because of the experience I have had and others I know have the same opinions that is why I seek other employment
good,"Although the pay was good, I felt the management wasn't as professional or organized. With multiple locations, they tend to move you around depending on your selling performance."
good,Opportunities are vast and your experience as an employee is truly determined by the effort you make to expand your horizons in regards to learning about all of the various avenues that AT&T covers.
good,"The route the company wishes to go and the CEO said he can let 50% of the workforce go and be ok by 2020. For a Technician the job is going to be almost virtually gone within a few years if the company sees it's desired approached reached. "
good,"Great company!  Would recommend to anyone looking to start a great career with a world class organization that specializes in wireless communications, digital entertainment content delivery, and so much more."
good,"I have liked working for AT&T. The pay and benefits are well above what I expected them to be. Also, there are perks on purchases and having the service. Management could be very overwhelming at times. Working in the sales environment, meeting goal was the only objective. At times, that was the only focus no matter what. Management also changed their focus, a lot and would neglect to tell the sales reps. It was just assumed that reps would know the new techniques or focuses. It was frustrating to get ""coaching"" on areas that had not been previous discussed.  For as big as AT&T is, I did find some of the systems outdated and unorganized. Some processes were cumbersome and required more work than they should. Customers were a toss up. They could be great or not so great but that is with any type of customer service/sales position. The work/life balance is the most difficult thing to overcome. I had worked every weekend for the past year and a half. If I want one of the weekend days off, I have to take a vacation day. The typical day runs about 9 to 10 hours (if you get to leave on time). Late nights are common especially if the store is busy. However, the best part had to be my team! The people I met were amazing and I truly consider them a work family."
good,"fun place to work"
good,"pretty cool place too work, especially if you are a seller, managers are pretty cool and laid back, lots of incentives, lots of ways too make extra money"
good,"I enjoyed the customer relations and the idea of working for AT&T so i feel like my review may be biased. But my manager was caught stealing phones totaling over $10,000 worth and selling them. Then fled the country. So there's that.."
good,"AT&T has acquired several companies in the last 10 years.  In many cases, they still have not worked out the kinks."
good,Typical day is to take phone calls about peoples bills and phone issues and make sure they are happy by the end of the call and then try to sell them home services TV/ Internet packages.
good,"Good pay and benefits, yearly layoffs. Very little training, too many managers. Coworkers friendly and hard working. No room for growth unless you transfer."
good,"Direct TV was okay. They are fast paced cut throat job. If you are making sales they keep you, if not... you're gone. Pay was good, management wasnt, hours were good, breaks werent."
good,Was a good job but went downhill yearly-the company is interested in downsizing indefinitely-apparently the are interested in only wireless services which require no people
good,"Involved selling additional services the customer did not have, I learned sales techniques, culture was very stressful and a lot of information to retain.  The hardest part was convincing people to add additional services, and the most enjoyable part was the simple every day portions of changing phone numbers, taking payments, etc."
good,company does not know how to take care of the employees.  right now they are cutting back and letting people go to save money but it is really hurting the companys customer service which is what really keeps people coming back to att..
good,"I used to love this job, Our manager became too sales oriented and forgot that he had any morals. I know I am a great seller but I will NOT take advantage of people."
good,"Handled multiple calls a day to handle all aspects of our business customers' telecommunication needs."
good,"Typical day: load up your van. Have  a short meeting with the managers about whatever they have to tell us. dispatch on your first job. the first year will be difficult as you pick up the job, but after that it's pretty easy. Most stressful part about this job is other departments and customers. You are basically a tech and a therapist because the company lacks accountability with the sales teams and the stunts they pull to make money. Generally I keep to my self, you will be working alone most of the time. Most enjoyable part is the when you CAN fix a customers problem. They are very grateful. "
good,Great place to work. very motivated environment. Managment pushes you to do your best and achieve greatness. Always putting the customer first and making sure we have a positive fun environment.
good,lo que más me gustaba de éste trabajo era que demandaba poca carga horaria.
good,"While some managers want to ensure employees have a high moral, the pay is not equal to the work. No balance for those who have children and no spouse or significant other."
good,"Management team was put through a manager in training program, with no experience in this field. The team was unprofessional and clueless as to this industry."
good,"My Manager  was always very encouraging, always pushing me towards success. It was a great working environment with positive and like-minded people. I was provided many training opportunities via classes and seminars. Things could be a little stressful when trying to hit targets but would feel good when you exceed your goals."
good,"Advice is just hot air that blows the well maintained quaffs that adorn the tops of their heads. As long as it doesn't cause a ripple or mess things up, they let it go in one ear and out the other"
good,The work itself is easy and repetitive. Pay is good and so is time off. No sick time so plan your illnesses or they will fire you. Honestly other than the high school like culture and they management that is on you all the time its not a bad job. Great job for someone first starting out. Just avoid people and do your job. They spend too much time together and get too involved in peoples personal business. Other than that awesome benefits and vacation is nice.
good,"We spend more time pleasing the job and was not getting payed what they where saying that they where going to pay us and the ""managers"" had no idea what they where doing putting all there work and stress on us to lift up their downfall. They need to be more Truth full about their company."
good,environment is average; corporate executives don't give a flip about employees job or families.  Only about getting their bonuses.  Job security sucks!!!!
good,"Daily data report card to force compliance with required performance standards.  Every minute must be accounted for within a decade old formula for time it takes to do a task.  Awards give to to those who are able to figure out how the system is built and happen to be in spot that has enough work items to meet standards.   Depending on your boss these metrics may be a problem for those who miss the mark.  Overall an unfriendly work culture with little effort by management to ensure staff understands tasks.  Much after the fact punishment to those who make errors but very little explanation on how to do the job beforehand.  A culture of blame and intimidation fostered by weak middle management worried only about what the metrics look like.  Not a fun place to work but some people seem to become friends with their first level boss this helps make the intolerable somewhat acceptable.  No clue how the managers feel about the system,  this review is only pertains to front line worker types."
good,"Great Team Status, busy in the summer, a lot management changes, a lot of technology advances, constant education for the updated technological advances"
good,there is no balance between workload and personnel. constant changes on management personnel. management focus in their metrics but not helping employees solving system issues.
good,"It has been a challenge going through a merger. I am still in the process of learning about the company.  So far, the challenges that they have brought have been up and down.,"
good,I enjoyed my time at AT&T. Would probably still be there if the economy had taken a turn. My manager was a fair and good man. I enjoyed the work and being outside.
good,A typical day is high volume fast paced production. There is a major disconnect from management and employee when it come to policy due to the union. The hardest part of the job is staying on top of all the policy changes
good,"I ordered and activated wireless equipment for business customers, I processed credit checks for new activations. I ensured the accuracy of business accounts."
good,"Innovative work place"
good,"-100% Job Security without any compensation."
good,"Was hired as contractor to Install, Upgrade, Tune, Placement, Troubleshoot and train employees on Operation and Maintenance of Cisco Firepower / Sourcefire IPS equipment."
good,huge number of employees. nothing great to tell. It may have been improvised but I really am not sure since it was long time back. Hopefully better now.
good,Can't count on pay it changes month to month. Goals are insanely high not based on area or location. Can be rewarding working and helping customers. Ok job tons of pressure.
good,This company could have been great but the managers that were over the teams in the call centers as well as the higher up didn't make employees feel like they mattered.
good,AT&T is a good place to work but it would be great if they work better with the comission based salary as well as establishing a bit more realistic sales goals.
good,"AT&T was a great company to work for initially, but over the years the commission structure has changed dramatically. Sellers and management are making much less than they were years ago. The growth in wireless has stalled and the generous commissions have stalled with it. This is a good entry level sales job that will get your foot in the door in sales and also provide great training."
good,"Your bosses truly care about you and your advancement and well-being within and outside of the company, A typical day: login to phones, start up computer programs, and auto-in to calls waiting. You get two paid 10-minute breaks and a 30-minute lunch break, somewhat flexible. There are supervisors and standers available for questions and clarification, although they could use more help. Hardest part of the job is problem-solving all the different possible solutions to numerous possible technical issues. Good people and work place environment and communication between employees. Learned a lot about computer systems and the cellular business."
good,"Its a call center job, more specifically we deal with customers who continue to have issues with the U-verse product. Most days are not that bad but scheduling is so bad for the employees with lower seniority that we have to check our schedules daily to ensure we are showing up to work on time. That is pretty much the hardest part of the job, lack of consistent work schedule. But the people I work with are top notch and usually help make the day bearable. Management does what management does and that is back the company line for the most part."
good,"My time working for P.M.G. was very well, it was a hustlers job. There was never a day that I did not have to hustle to make my weekly commission check."
good,"Company provided a safe workplace, with a good salary. Work was fast pace.  Everyday we had to adapt changes. Regular training for new products.  I enjoy the pay. We had a union.  Didn't like how some manager monitor."
good,It was a great place to work with lots of incentives and promotions going on. I loved the sales environment because we all pushed each other to do better .
good,To direct cars during to entering and exiting the at&t center. The most enjoyable part was seeing the celebrities and people from  all over come to the job.
good,ATT has a great deal of training programs available to their employees.  It can be a bit bureaucratic but the structure is helpful for folks that find that useful to learn
good,"Learned how to train and maintain an office of 30+ individuals. A great learning experience and a vibrant workplace to be in. Difficult at times, but worth the long hours to assist others in moving up within the company."
good,clock in around 9:00 and answer calls all day . There was barley any breaks in between the calls. The calls were mainly about billing issues which i could handle.
good,it was a regular day. I learned a lt and the management changed every so many months. the culture was different .the hardest part was to many to name. the enjoyable part was the people I worked with
good,"1.Answers customer/client requests or inquiries concerning services and products and reports problem areas."
good,Optimum resources in the company.Learn lot of things.Great benefits along with a flexible work life balance makes this a great job for someone who is both a student and employee
good,"At one time, being hired by AT&T meant a career position, room to advance great benefits and a family atmosphere.  That changed when the CEOchanged.  True customer service was jettisoned in favor of unrealistic expectations which led to fudging to meet expectations by any means possible.  Technicians routinely work through breaks and lunch in order to improve performance indicators only to have expected level of performance raised to even more unrealistic expectations.   Job stress  and Big Brother is definitely watching with vehicle tracking devices, key stroke monitoring and scripted customer satisfaction surveys that insure mediocre survey results."
good,"AT&T has contracted out it's hiring and no longer has the ability to keep or retain quality employees.  This statement is pretty self explanatory.  Between the union and management there is no one there to take any responsibility for anything.  Everyone knows immediately that it is ""not my job"" but they have no idea who may be able to help.  What a large number of people would find acceptable in this day of a typical corporation but I expect more."
good,My AT&T was definitely a fun filled time but yet also with some hard times due to the changes in management and directors. Would have loved to potentially move up with AT&T
good,"AT&T really seems to care about the growth of their employees. Unfortunately it seems to put a lot of responsibility on the management, and they have frequent layoffs."
good,"To many expectations and not enough training or time allowed to carry out the expectations. Not the best environment, always pressured, and always watched."
good,"Like every job, AT&T has pros & cons. The job is a customer service job, quick paced and constantly evolving.You are always learning something different."
good,cambiaron los métodos de trabajo mucha presión pero es muy buena empresa para crecer siempre cuando seas directo
good,"The management team works to ensure you are a success and earn the most possible.  Fun working atmosphere, team working together to be a success and have fun at the same time."
good,I enjoyed working For AT&T most of the time due to the people I was around. I feel the company itself has got away about caring for the employees and are more worried about the numbers.
good,"Things changed too much. "
good,"no work life balance but good for money, there is r9oom for advancement, but it is a very good job the does not require a college degree, the goals can be stressful at times, all the managers I have had have been very flexible"
good,If you are the competitive type of person you would enjoy.  I was only there a short time and doing that time I enjoyed however it wasn't for me. a job is a job however.
good,Opened and maintained Clients accounts. I used multiple programs running at the same time. Handled my own cash draw. Also with extreme discretion resolved customer problems or complaints by administering them credits and adjusting current standing accounts.
good,"Super great place, nice boss.  Lots of help provided from management and staff.  Recommended field, great place to grow and find your passion.  Lots of attention to employees of town."
good,"Very micro managed company, little pay for what is required. Love the people I work with, but the company as a whole is greedy and doesn't seem to appreciate the hard work their employees do."
good,"Good pay and benefits. "
good,As a sub-contractor for an independent broker/agent I enjoyed running my own business and representing outstanding service providers/manufacturers.   ...
good,"great opportunities, can be stressful trying to meet quotas, overall  it is a fairly nice place to work, great managers and great fellow employees. would recommend"
good,its ok could had been a lot better most of the time i got wrote up for nothing and when i was sick i got suspended for being sick so for the most part it was ok
good,"AT&T Mobility Retail is a very tough job "
good,great job. very professional enjoyed the experience would definitely return if position available attendance policy very flexible lots of room for growth and elevation
good,DirecTV was a Wonderful company ! Very sad day when AT&T bought out DirecTV. I feel everything changed when AT&T took over. My department was closed and Travel department was laid off.
good,Loved working for DIRECTV.  The AT&T culture is very different and my job no longer feels secure.  DIRECTV was a very collaborative company and AT&T does not feel like they are interested in employee morale.
good,How many different times can I say that this should NOT be part of the Indeed process - I feel it is very biased and impartial and puts everyone in jeopardy
good,"I worked for DIRECTV for 9 years and after acquired by ATT there were several layoffs, employee moral was down and changes were often quick without training."
good,"This job had great pay and benefits, I only had to leave because my dad was sick, or I would probably still be there. They are very strict with taking off which was not a problem for my first 10 years, but when my dad got sick, I had to resign because it was affecting my attendance, and they have a no tolerance policy for missing."
good,"training is rigorous, and pay and benefits are not very good. long hours, bad people, and useless union you are required to join. quotas are unrealistic"
good,"Started out great, with an amazing manager that cared about his people.  He moved stores and it was never the same.  My store was left without an active manager for about 6 months.  Meanwhile, we had new services to offer and no one to direct us.  The longer I was there the more I realized they don't care too much about the front line associates.  Customer facing sales reps are expendable.  It's really too bad because after I started, I could see myself retiring from there.  They showed their true colors though."
good,"This was a very busy high call volume call center. AT&T offered several employee benefits  involving there products and services. "
good,"The pay was excellent. The work was great after you get passed the learning curve. Other peoples work would negativity impact your work and which would make you look bad,"
good,"coming in the morning check the back office to see how much phone need to be sent back to RLO like Trade-in a next trade in program, Regular return reports, check email and check the floor inventory and display"
good,"Nice company to work for with good work, life balance, and use of interesting content management, and open source technologies. Organizes fun, cultural gatherings for different ethnicity employees."
good,"ATT used to have the most competitive commission structure, then other carriers got the iPhone too and lost their exclusivity and decided not to pay employees as much"
good,Either you were overloaded with demands and deadlines and extremely busy or you were looking for any work to be done.  Busy was definitely better.  Exciting working with other countries.
good,"In what other job could a CEO lose 4.5 Billion on a bad deal and still keep their job? To pay for his poor decision he has cut positions and commissions... yeah, real smart one."
good,"the hardest part is the micro-management, the customers yelling at you. the good is the things you learn about the network and how things work in the world of telecom"
good,Quota's can be cumbersome. Pay and Benefits are great but work pressure and work/life balance is challengingThought out my tenure with ATT i witness many surpluses and realignments... your always wonder if your job will exist the next year.
good,This a very fun place to work with. The actual workplace has stuff to keep you entertained during break times. They do giveaways and management is very friendly. Hardest part of the job was meeting their sales expectations. They are too pushy just like any other sales job.
good,If you are salesman by heart AT&T is the place for you. Unfortunately it is a matter of time before the payroll/fmla departments will be outsourced at some point so in doing so I am just working on all the experienced provided.
good,The job itself was great.  Met new people and made them happy installing or repairing our multiple services. Never a dull moment as things often changed on the fly.
good,A typical day working at At&t consisted of doing a daily inventory count on the devices we have on had to determine that everything is accounted for in the vault. We were asked to not limited to selling phones but also wireless home phones. informing the customer the importance of having insurance for the device and overall providing great customer service to the clients.
good,"Typical day consisted of driving 100+ miles in in company van, installing and maintaining equipment, good benefits, room for advancement, learning tools available"
good,"During my time of being employed at directv, I worked in their warehouse. I worked monday through Friday and averaged around 40 hours a week. They had decent pay and benefits."
good,"Team player sales driven business casual atmosphere. Wages are standard normal benefits offered sales incentives and teambuilding activities , opportunities for advancement."
good,"As best I can remember, the atmosphere at ATT was very friendly.  The supervisors were always willing to assist when needed.  Had many changes to advance."
good,"I like the job with AT&T but it just doesn't have a guaranteed pay, and that's the only thing I don't like about it. I love interacting with different people everyday and going to different cities to work. I have great customer service experience and I would love to work a job that deals with helping people."
good,"Answer phone "
good,"i install security systems "
good,"Having been with the company since the Cingular days, I saw a lot of expecations increase that may not have been the most realistic.  Sales goals were put at levels that made it tough to gain montly bonuses and led to a lot of employee frustrations."
good,"I cannot post a meaningful review as the position, the center, and the company is not likely to be the same as when I worked there 10 years ago. This company changed 3 times while I worked there as well**"
good,"This place had actually shut down recently. "
good,Everything from the beginning of the day to the very last minute of the workday is super competitive. Its takes some of the enjoyment out of the actual work.
good,"Working at AT&T was very enjoyable. I was a customer service representative; I worked with account executives and upper management to resolve their issues; I satisfied customers' needs via phone, e-mail and the occasional face-to-face meetings."
good,"I worked there for six months, and it was utter chaos. The managers didn't take ownership of customer issues, and the good ole boy system was taken place. The atmosphere was that of a night club Completely disgusting, will never work there again."
good,"Very good job. They train very well for production, services, and sales. Will reward you for a great job and for service as well. Good chance in advancement as well."
good,Not a bad job for a young person with limited education but loads of stress involved in the work. The stress of management is by far the worse. This is a company that cares about money i.e. not their staff.
good,AT&T cellular company kind of get lost in the shuffle not a lot of personal interaction with management I often get unattainable call center goals not one of my favorite places to work
good,good place to work and build skill set. People are helpfully. Parking are awesome compare to other facility. Nice little shop around the area for lunch and break.
good,6 layoffs with this company. This company does not value long term employees. Waiting for the next evolution with the company to see where it will be headed in 3 years.
good,"company was good to work years ago, i don't know what its like now but i don't hear great things but in comparison to sprint its good, easy to move up once working hard"
good,The AT&T center was a laid back place to work. The income I made there was not enough to get by especially only working a couple spurs games a week. I enjoyed working with minimal supervision and having to get tasks done on my own in a timely fashion. The best part of the job hands down would be being in the stadium with the fans and feeling the energy and hype of each game
good,in the world of technology this is not an easy job. must be thick skinned and realize people are gonna yell and thats all they want to do
good,AT&T is a great company that you work for and the benefits are awesome. There are some bad apples in the bunch not everyone and this brings the moral down and make employees want to find another job.
good,"I received payments from customers, helped them get on a cheaper and more convenient plan for their families and with general cell phone questions."
good,"I worked for DirecTV before AT&T completed the acquisition,and I have noticed a lot of significant changes to the overall atmosphere that I can't say are positive. My co-workers' morale is no more, we don't have concrete attendance policies due to an ongoing negotiation with the union, and it seems as if every week new policies are put in place that makes our jobs harder. This has turned an already-stressful job into a nightmare, and unfortunately this is driving many tenured representatives to look elsewhere."
good,"Overall a good place to work.  A typical day is busy and fast-paced with multiple projects running concurrently at any given time.  I've learned and grown so much, both professionally and personally, during my time here.  The hardest part though can be balancing all of the work with shrinking headcounts.  The most enjoyable part has primarily been the people, and the many different projects I've been able to work on."
good,You have a secure job.  I did get a better understanding of project management and navigating the corporate political environment.
good,"A typical day on the job would include traveling to different homes and/or businesses all around the San Antonio area to install or repair AT&T services for our customers.I have to always make sure I have all necessary equipment and tools prior to starting my day so I am able to complete my work. I have learned a lot about time management and have improved my organizational skills so that I am more efficient and proficient while on the job. The hardest part of the job is the actual physical demand. The job requires moving heavy equipment and a lot of the work is done outside in the elements, so the weather always plays a factor everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job is successfully completing jobs and walking customers through everything. Letting them know how everything is set up and how it works is fulfilling when all done correctly."
good,"I would recommend this job to others, we keep customers connected to what is important to their lives. I worked for At&t for a total of 5 years."
good,"After reporting to work center to get days job assignments, you get into your work truck & drive to first job. Whether it is an install or repair, you finish the job & go on to the next. Customer contact is necessary. Sometimes tech support is necessary. Training is not provided at AT&T anymore. If you do not know or can not figure out problem, you call another tech for advice. Management can make the job more difficult than it has to be. Although the pay & benefits are good, it is a stressful work environment. I have asked for training as it will only help me with my job & to better understand how different systems operate. For example Ciena, Cisco, Fujitsu, ect.. but never sent to any trains classes. Working in bad weather is difficult, test sets do not work properly when wet."
good,Working for AT&T has its ups and downs. Benefits are amazing but no work life balance. Always scared about getting fired. No one cares about what you have accomplished it's always what today or tomorrow is about.
good,Good job to do.  Great company to work for.  Management was easy to work with.  The work schedule was a bear from time to time.  The pay and benefits where great.
good,answering  calls  for  customer  service to  help  with orders  payments and  technical issues. Management is on hands. Games  and prizes.
good,"AT&T is a decent place to work.  They offer good benefits - medical insurance, dental, vision, prescription coverage, life insurance, union membership, & 401k with a company match."
good,Working for this company is a great start for someone to gain great customer service experience over the phone.  The workplace was very warm and friendly.
good,"its an alright company not that much pay, my manager was really cool and they were good to me i learned the point of sale system and cash registeter so it wasnt bad"
good,"I worked for AT&T for three and a half years during college. In that span of time I made some amazing friendships, and learned more about customer service than I ever dreamed of. They greatly respected my school schedule, however cared about no other aspect of my life. I worked almost every weekend and was still scrambling for the schedule I wanted when I left. The sales goals were ever increasing, to the point where no one cared if you were honest with the customer or their true needs. If you had a good manager, your life was a dream. If not, then it was horrible. I cherish the time I spent at this company and the lessons I learned, but am glad to be gone."
good,it was an ok job. the management was ok. the staff was ok . i learned alot about customer service . the hours were ok. id recommend the job. overall ok
good,"Working at AT&T was great until the end.  Prior to purchasing DTV we did not ahve a good leader over our division and she really killed moral.  Once We purchased DTV it seemed as if their people took over and they had no idea how we did things and then there were huge layoffs, which I was hit with and so were many other managers.  The way that was handled (the first round, the round I was in) was not very tactful or thought out very well.  "
good,Worked for ATT in various positions as a contractor for many years and have found the environment to be progressive and very open to sharing knowledge when applicable. It can be stressful at times but that is part of the fun of the industry.
good,"I worked for AT&T for 15 years and loved my job, (the one I was originally hired to do) however, the focus has moved away from customer service to a constant push to sale, sale, sale and the stress is unbearable."
good,"1. Typical work day is coordinating with other carriers to get customer's the soonest due dates possible for services ordered."
good,"The job was great as long as management had people assigned to duties which matched up with their skill set.  Management uniformly did a poor job of communicating to us what our project was supposed to do, as its mission statement changed three times during my employment there."
good,Job expectations continue to change. Customer care driven. Support staff is well trained. The most enjoyable part of this job is helping people and educating customer.
good,Poor Management and communication. No schedule flexibility no advancement for within. Not very organized at all. Great Pay
good,Its good but not that friendly customers. I have enjoyed while working with them.  Work culture also good .. But more pressures by the managers while handling the complicated seniors
good,The work/life balance was good given the nature of the work. The pay and benefits were below average when compared with some of the other competitive contractors. The job security is just not there given this was contract work and as a result myself and about 70% of my team were laid off the start of 2017. The internal management was very relaxed and knowledgeable which resulted in a somewhat stress free work environment. the upper management including hr and project management was terrible which resulted in poor budget calls and rushed decisions which result in backlash. HR department released everyone's confidential information due to a common email phishing scam and as a result my entire team was compromised. They gave us a free year of identity theft software and advice but unfortunately the leaked info has no expiration date. The Job culture was mixed and everyone got along fine and the workforce was honestly the best part of the job.
good,AT&T was probably the worse company I ever worked for.  They cut corners as much as possible. Seniority is more important than capabilities. Unions run the place!
good,"Good company to work for, but limited opportunities to advance beyond director level (even in Dallas).  VERY slow on implementing technology.  Competitors usually are first to market and we usually are catching up.  Currently focusing more on consumer/content and moving away from core/legacy competencies."
good,AT&T is a good place to work for overall. However I did have issues with the advancement... I tried multiple times to advance and even though my manager at the time highly recommended me nobody would hire me as a manager. This especially when I was pregnant.
good,"Worked as A contractor in IT, nice work environment. Be ready for any surprise if they downsizing or if there are budget constraints. It also depends who are you reporting to"
good,Great place to work.  Exciting environment in a fast paced telecommunications industry where things are always changing.  Must be willing and capable of retooling yourself to keep pace with the ever-advancing communications industry.
good,i enjoyed working for ATT wireless it is a good place to enhance your  customer service skills and a great company with room for advancement
good,this was while at sutherland so i can't have an actually opinion as this was BPO work not directly working for AT&T. just wasting space for this review sorry to waste your time just deny it
good,This company changed their dynamics over the course of years. It was hard to move up in the ranks by merit of the job performance and not subjective surveys. It was easy to have your work schedule adjusted to suit your needs. No benefits. No raises.
good,"Depending on what project or department you were in, your job could be really good or really bad. The amount of resources and expectations of work varied greatly between positions."
good,"Mobility was very cyclical, it was good when sales were good, bad when sales were down. The business was under constant pressure to increase net adds."
good,"Decent Company, They need to stop the relocating of their offices and taking jobs away from faithful employees, stop outsourcing."
good,Submitted my opion on the life of working at ATT in the call center. Very faced past and overall ok to work for and they love to feed you. I enjoyed my time
good,"lots of goals daily"
good,"AT&T Mobility was an ok place to work at. The hours are long, the work you do can be stressful because you are getting yelled at and cussed out by customers for a majority of your day."
good,"ATT is a good company, but the culture that was presented to me when I was part of them was very negative and not employee driven. People leave management not companies."
good,"At&t was a great company prior to 2013.  Our position is being eliminated.  They are going to hire people for less to do a similar job and be micromanaged.  "
good,I worked for a vendor thru at&t however it was a mess. Pay wasn't promised. They sold me on a job and didn't even keep their part of the deal up.. I do not care for them anymore. Be Cautious
good,"cant schedule or have a personal life due to you having to work until there is no more work. Company driven by numbers and metrics. If your numbers are not good , they will give you a hard time"
good,The employees I worked with were all very young. Most of them had only been out of school for a few years. The location was downtown Dallas which was a neat experience.
good,There was no advancement opportunity given the job title. The management does not keep you informed or gives as less info available to safe guard their positions in the company. The management makes you work against one another versus the team concept. They place you in job titles for payroll compensations then boot you out of your job due to the position being full. a typical day changes day in no constant guidelines of handling procedures)
good,Good company but changing in ways that don't seem customer friendly.  Company is  becoming more focused on profit than it's employees.  Benefits are great for those that have them.
good,Not sure why AT&T was listed here. I did not work there and can give no opinion about it. Must fill the 20 words. Not sure what I should do.
good,"decent training, good pay, good benefits, you do worry about not making sales goals and being fired, you get a free phone and service"
good,"very busy place to work at, but the people were very good."
good,I got to meet and speak to a lot of different and interesting individuals. Helping people find the right phone and plan for them was a very rewarding experience.
good,"Go to the desk, get on the stand-up meeting call with the team in Durham, NC. "
good,"This job was very slow paced, so it got boring really fast."
good,"att is doing a big overhaul on the directv procedures. the future seems fairly unstable and un certain, seems like a good time to get out"
good,as with all very large corporations the job is numbers based..everything is timed and performance related not just based on technician but also outside occurances.
good,"didn't like work here, was bad vibes ... call center sucks, always listening and watching your every move... pay was nice but not worth the stress and consent calling"
good,"Because it was an authorized retailer and not AT&T, the company seemed to be trying to figure a lot of things out at the time."
good,"Been with AT&T for over 6 years now. Company has great benefits and pay is nice. The environment is too stressful and management feels a lot of pressure of making numbers, so the pressure on us in sales isn't fun anymore which makes it harder to hit numbers."
good,Great environment to enhance operation management skills. Very diverse with many operating groups within the department.
good,"great experience teaching and variety of students made this a unique teaching environment. Many campuses all over the city which is convenient. Enjoyed teaching here. Would return"
good,"Mgmnt seemingly forced to micromanage EVERYTHING due to pressure from upper mgmnt made for a hostile environment on a pretty regular basis. Some managers handled the pressure well, almost thrived on it: while others seemed as though they would do anything (legal or not) to try and get to or maintain position in the district. You have the confidence going in that you have the better product makes the job funner and easier."
good,Most in the workforce have been in the company for decades.  There is not a lot of movement between jobs.  This results in a very old practices and difficulty having agile teams.
good,This company is dedicated to reducing their workforce.  They seem to get rid of job titles with little regard to the people or their skills.  Would not recommend this company if you are looking for stability.
good,"As with any company, there are always going to be a few bad apples in the mix.  But AT&T is aware of who these individuals are and has given them chance after chance to improve.  Meanwhile, they are not aware of the real problem of harassment and continue to lose valuable employees that make that call center a better place. Someone needs to weed out all the bad and then it would be an awesome place to work."
good,Productive environment. Work gets done efficiently & accordingly. The most enjoyable moment of the job is when the team gets a unknown challenge & we figure the situation out fast & the customer is thankimg us over & over.
good,"Health insurance and pay were great, but the expectations placed on employees were unrealistic and unattainable. The atmosphere there was not very pleasant."
good,He trusted me to be his assistant. From the start of the patients entering the door. To taking vitals and giving injections. He and his family were great to work with.
good,AT&T is a great company to work for. It's a challenging environment because of the ever changing telecommunications industry. Managers become agents of change by being flexible and understanding that the only constant in our business is change. The compensation package is comparable to the telecom industry.
good,Famine or Feast. Find your own leads and close them. Difficult business model but I still closed a ton of commercial accounts!
good,"The pay was great, but shady tactics were in place to get that pay.  Ripping off elderly people and convincing people to keep cruddy products until they are outside of their return window.  Company is desperately trying to be more than a phone company with their sub-par security systems and purchase of Directv...even though there was nothing wrong with Uverse.  Towards the end of my run I didn't even have the option to sell Uverse, and had to sell a satellite dish.  Coworkers were snobby."
good,"I talk to customers, technicians, and managers everyday.  Part of the teams needed by the company. I problem solve, update information, use the computer and databases that I was trained in.  Results oriented employee."
good,"This was a while ago, but what I can say is that I very much enjoyed day to day employment there. I was outside every day."
good,I love working with customers. I am a peoples person. I really enjoy meeting new people and building a healthy business relationship. I am a very great salesman but I'm not afraid to learn new things.
good,"working for at&t from 2014 its been going downhill, our commission structure has been getting worse and worse. almost anybody can get promoted into management, which is not a good thing."
good,"A typical day at work consists of taking high volumes of phone calls. I feel like this a good place to start out, with great benefits; however your are required to meet monthly metrics that are set rather high. This can be a great motivation to work harder, but sometimes can be unreachable due to uncontrollable situations. This can cause the job to be frustrating at times."
good,"•	Provided effective, consistent, and timely customer service within a call center environment "
good,"The job was challenging, fast-paced and work was plentiful. It was rare that things weren't busy. Management was insufficiently trained and there were too many occasions when they weren't knowledgeable."
good,"work can be hectic."
good,"Continue to surplus employees.  As far as technology, they are innovative.  M-F 8-5.  Opportunities if you are willing to relocate."
good,This is a job that pays well but is hard to plan a life considering you never know what time you'll be off work on a daily basis. You do get good benefits with this job which helps make up for some of the personal sacrifices you have to make to work here.
good,Working as a manager within the city limits of Detroit creates a large list of challenges. It is not impossible to succeed but very difficult. Have to spend the majority of your time in the field with your techs. You will quickly learn how to work with and communicate with all walks of life  and all types of people. The two best things about this job is the ability to teach and lead people and make a customers day.
good,"A terrific place to work, however the focus has shifted from telecommunications to video entertainment. As a company with almost 300,000 employees, describing a day in the life is no easy task. To summarize my experience there, it's as good as you want it to be."
good,Good pay and benefits for as long as the decide to keep you. Never safe from surplus. They will let you go at Christmas. Hard work doesn't always pay off.
good,great company to work for. rates the same as any other call center or corporate job. as with anything its what you make of it. create your own path. good luck
good,"Working with customers, resolving issues, staying up to date with technology and communication. Alright place to work."
good,enjoyed working for the company.  was unfortunately part of a surplus and was laid off from the company shortly after merging.
good,"Currently employed by Master Wireless in Marquette Michigan Authorized Retail location, laidback work environment, sales goals and metrics very important,"
good,"I haven't had a opportunity to use this site so I really don't have much to rate at this time. "
good,"Great company, but management is horrible. Hardest part of my job was irate customers and no managers to help diffuse the calls"
good,fun and productive place to work. you will learn about new technology and how to sell also some basic people skills. the most enjoyable part was working with people.
good,"assiting customers with online orders for phones and service., supporting technical department, assisting with customers inquiries about payments and issuing payments ."
good,"Overall a good place to work, other than the compensation. Employees to not get much of a discount. Management was good and did their jobs. Not that many breaks because of constant calls coming in worldwide."
good,"Great products, number 1 in wireless product, use to be really good in customer service but now it's all about sales, so of your good at selling this job is perfect for you."
good,"A typical day consists of high impact on the floor sales driving with the center from open till close. Working one on one with sales representatives plugged in while taking calls to drive customer service and sales excellence. Observe and give feedback live and follow up for demonstration and coaching and developing. Observe and give feedback offline for evaluative purposes. administer discipline as needed/warranted for any infractions that may arise. Includes but not limited to unprotected attendance incidents and incidents of misconduct. Monitor rep effectiveness in relation to call handling and availability to handle call volume efficiency. Coaching to the behavior that results in positive growth customer service and sales impacted. Evaluate performance on individual and team basis throughout the day. In an effort to identify gaps and create/execute plans to attain and close gaps to meet and exceed sales targets. "
good,Worked a title that didn't pay more but gave me more experience especially when handling phone calls from irate customers. knew most co-workers because the office wasn't large.
good,Working there great just needed more money liked all my employees they were great I likw talking to people asking about there day herring there story was a plus
good,"long work hour "
good,Great company to be a part of and the advancement opprtunities are the for the go getters and the people that have a bachlers dgree and above.
good,During my tenure at AT&T I learned a great deal about telecommunications and how to best market the products and services that AT&T offers and that are offered by the company's vendors.
good,"I Loved My Job Duties!"
good,We work daily to assist customers with technical support issues. The hardest part of the job is if we are unable to help the customers and having to explain to them that it will cost to get it fixed. The best part of this job would have to be the people I work with everyday.
good,Overall the worst job at work life balance I've ever had. But the commission checks were worth it sometimes but overall not a good experience.
good,"Great company to work for, you learn quite a lot on different sales tips and ways to build proper relationships with customers. By asking every customer that you work with qualifying questions about what the reason they are looking to purchase you can uncover quite a bit to increase your chances of getting the sale. Management will work with you to grow stronger in your sales process and will always be willing to role play with you to ensure that you get better!"
good,"I can not say that it was a completely bad experience but I feel this company needs to care more about the employees and consider that they have a life and family outside of the job. Most management was nice and it is easy to advance here, if it is where you want to be."
good,The most valuable thing about working for AT&T was working with the other employees. I thought that is what makes a company.
good,you have to be constantly upselling to your customers and there is very little gratitude from the company for sales as it is a what have you done for me lately. You do get great discounts for being an employee though
good,"A typical day at work is to make sure your on time and not even one minute late cause you will get a write up."
good,learned my first sales strategies and how to manage multiple accounts. great place to start. family orientated and ran company.
good,Jobs going to philippines and going away...Company want to be the next big software company...Will not be in wireless or directv per upper management.
good,There were a lot of incentives geared toward having fun in the call center with creative themes for potlucks and diversity so that all could participate.
good,Work can be very interesting but you can easily be bogged down by red tape and governance. Navigating promotions is unclear irrespective of high performance.
good,"When I started, the company truly cared about their associates...not so much in later years. The company changed its stance to one of eliminating jobs at every opportunity. This caused a lot of unnecessary stress at all levels, including mid management. Too bad."
good,"Many employee work from home or virtually to the  actual location they support.  Some day are longer than other, depending on the project at that moment."
good,There is potential for growth if you can get past required time on phone. It's really a selling position and there are many metrics that must be meet which causes high turnover
good,I had an excellent mentor who was phenomenal at career guidance.  He and I worked very well together and a learned a lot from him.  He groomed me to be his replacement while he was on PTO and gave me senior leadership exposure.  I was introduced to individual and team management and supervisory skills and responsibility.
good,AT&T gave a lot of opportunity for training.  They offered an in house PMI training program which is certified through AT&T University.  There was opportunity for moving to different departments and advancement.  During implementations and training the days were long.  You could work remotely to support all time zones.  Co-workers created a cohesive team.  I enjoyed working with a team located throughout the USA and being able to travel domestically.
good,"what I have learned by working at at&t is the way the cellular devices work and the way the network works for customers a typical day at work is working with customer to resolve any issues that they might have with the services and try to find the best resolution that will work for them with in what can be done, management has been great have never had any issues with any manager or co-worker, the hardest part has been transitioning from customer service into retention and smart chat and back to retention in a short period of time, however thanks to that I have learned a lot more and I have  a much better understanding of how the systems works and what we can actually do for customers because each department only has a limited amount of training and thanks to have been train on all 3 I have a much larger knowledge to help customers"
good,I have never worked for this company therefore I do not have any opinions regarding the company and cannot rate them
good,"Good organization"
good,"Wonderful place to work! Managers are fantastic and helpful. Really focused on customer service! Adequate training, possibility of moving up"
good,"Typical day consist of answering calls from 8a-4p hour to 30 lunch 2 15 breaks. Most management where OK some cannot be trusted "
good,I would have loved to stay with Southwestern Bell. It was a great experience to work for a major phone network while just completing graduation from Vatterott.
good,"En lo personal mi experiencia fue una pesima administracion, mi salida fue por cambio de residencia y no me pudieron pagar ni mis dias laborados ni mis comisiones, ni mi finiquito, les hablo y nadie sabe nada, no quiero que me paguen solo quiero mi carta de recomendacion ya que deje todo en orden en la oficina a la cual labore."
good,While I grew with the company and was trained to adapt to their desired skill sets they are heavily downsizing over the next four years upwards of a hundred thousand employees.
good,Answering the phone and talking to different types of people is interesting. Knowing I did something to help someone gives me satisfaction. The stress level is pretty high because you are expected to be perfect and meet expectations that other managers don't set. The pay is good but being stressed is not.
good,"I learned SQL,Unix,Networking."
good,"I Learn  to work as a team player and  to solve technical problems related to the dish , wiring and  receivers ."
good,"Fast paced environment. Productivity measurement daily and team competition to excel, celebrate success and win prizes."
good,This is a good job to have while attending school or looking for another career.  Good position to learn sales and make friends.
good,Inside and outside work requiring manual labor and technical knowledge. Direct customer interaction and customer service. Team concept with individual responsibilities. Sharing of information among co-workers and comradery.
good,Every day was a challenge in every possible way. This position made me realize there was little that I could not adapt to and overcome.
good,"Learned how the phone lines get from point A to point B. It can be a fun job at times,other times it can be stressful.I liked my co-workers better than I did the management.I had to learn to work in all types of weather."
good,not a great place to work. does not seem very stable. lots of tenured emplyees are leaving the company. The direction of the company is unknow to its employee. all we know is that we are no longer a cell phone provider.
good,It is a very Busy work load. Some of the functions are Answering calls and troubleshooting to resolve a resellers issues or complaints.
good,Good company with solid benefits. Work schedule is nice. Have one three day weekend a month. Need more opportunities for training.
good,Safety is important. I got fired for minor safety issues. My boss and coworkers are awesome. The company as a hole is bearable.
good,"We went from being a full-service call center (customer service, technical service and collections) to a collections-only call center after AT&T bought out Dobson Communications. Our employees made the transition quite seamlessly. However, AT&T eventually closed the center to streamline their operations. They gave us a generous severance package and gave employees the option of leaving within the week for a slightly smaller package or staying until the end for a slightly larger package. And we were allowed to look for work during paid breaks and our lunch hours. So it was about as win-win as a company can make it for the employees under such circumstances. However, what really irked me is that they didn't let us ride out the remainder of our employee contracts on our cell phone plans. Sure- take away my job, double my cell phone bill and hold me to the contract? I can see such terms if an employee leaves of their own choice. But really? Poor show, gentlemen."
good,"very friendly staff I have learned so much from everyone."
good,Used to get stock options and decent salary increases. Not anymore staff reductions and cost sutting is the norm. Coworkers are great.
good,"I like the idea of working for a large corporation however this company is not like it was in the old days.  There is a lot of micro-managing going on and there are unrealistic numbers that have to be met. The pay is okay, if you are at top out pay but once you get there that is as high as you can go.  No real room for advancement as a technician. The idea that this company is operating 365 24/7 does not make sense to me which means you do work holidays. Another thing is you don't get to go home until the work load is cleared for the day and you never know when that will be so makes things difficult for making plans.  The best part about working here are my co-workers."
good,Quota's can be cumbersome.  Pay and Benefits are great but work pressure and work/life balance is challenging.
good,"Complete installs, trouble shoot, install new serving terminal and drop wires. Concentrated on customer satisfaction.management listed to the wrong people for info on me with out verifying info. Co-workers were easy to get along with. Hardest part of job is not having enough time to test the complete circuit and equipment and adapting to 4 supervisors in 2 years."
good,"good benefits, pay, good with vacation time, pto time job requires much of your day and mental energy if it is a busy day it would be hard to get time off not good for those that have kids or if an emergency arises"
good,"A typical day of work  is doing any operational tasks at the start of your shift then spending the rest of the day on the sales floor overseeing sales team, and that they are providing excellent customer service and offering our products to the customers."
good,"Corporate environment"
good,"AT&T can be a fun company to work for, if you at good location and good management. Unfortunately management cycle through very quickly.The company seems like it's not quite sure which direction it want to go and trying to sprawl all directions simultaneously. I think AT&T should really talk to the reps and customers to find out what customers really want."
good,Worked in a call center environment taking inbound calls to assist customer with billing and troubleshooting and was trained for several weeks to be able to perform these tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning more and more about the products and systems.
good,"SWBT wasted money at an alarming rate while supposedly under the scrutiny of the Public Utility Commission. Budgeting was a farce and politics and waste was rampant in upper management."
good,AT&T is a good company to work for. Management is very helpful and they always have extra activities for you and your co workers to part take in.
good,I do not want to write reviews for every job I have worked please make this optional.  Descent employer pay for managers is pretty awful.
good,Be ready to work and match to the beat of the drum. I do recommend the company if you're interested in the telecommunication field.
good,"Commission structure needs review, employees are not appreciated as they should be. Executives pass down policies that arent realistic at a store level."
good,"Excelentes prestaciones como colaborador, el ambiente de trabajo en la parte baja de la cadena es excelente con gente de mucho empuje y con grandes ambiciones de progresar."
good,"A workday involved morning daily morning progress meetings with the team I worked with then reviewing and continuing work on multiple projects documents. As I was new to the group and the work involved, my manager was wonderful in helping me to transition into database management and to act as the group representative at initial project meetings. My other co-workers were also very helpful and patient with my progress and learning curve into an area completely foreign to my background. The hardest part of my job was having to quickly learn the various groups and systems dependent on the database group."
good,"Good concepts for future technology.  Management has no idea what Sales reps go thru on a monthly basis."
good,Working there was a great experience. Great people to work . customers were polite and patient. An over great work experience.
good,"had to go to house and figure what's wrong with the wires for phone line, and begin to find the problem then start to fix the problem, what ever comes up."
good,loved the problem solving aspect of my job there.  The people made it a fun place to work.  The facility was top notch and the support staff was great!
good,"You will take many calls a day at the call center, most will be about their balance or overdraft fees.  Will also have to meet sales goals with those same people."
good,Overall decent experience. Great environment for networking and meeting new people. The objective of hitting goals and bonusing is not that bad. The constant debates and quarrels about payout on sales and excessive charge backs can get irritating.
good,"I was a former Part-Time employee, The commission did not match my expectations. The manager is never at the store , you only see about two assistant managers that are constantly there. It is difficult to deal with the store manager and build a relationship, I felt a disconnection. As a new employee you will never see your family, expect to work any hours given. As a new employee you can request time off but you will not be likely to get it. The culture is very chill while you are helping customers, managers are not on you to sell. The company is focused on keeping the current customers, not as much as gaining."
good,no growth in this company. good benefits and pay but no luck on moving up. not worth spending a career there any more not like it used too
good,I'm new to AT&T and learning about their culture.  I was part of the DIRECTV acquisition.  The cultures of the two companies are very different but they both work for what kind of company they are/were.  AT&T is a huge company and it is easy to get lost in their structure and policies.
good,"One of the hardest companies I've ever worked for. Pays very well but no set schedule. Uses intimidation as a way to provide numbers,"
good,"Everyday, members of the staff would find people to acquire as potential customers for AT&T U-Verse.  We would start around noon and end around night time."
good,"Duties include tape hanging of different media type, print operation and output packaging, also microfilm processing and finishing."
good,"Data Clearing comprises standard verification, validation, conversion and processing of roaming billing files in full accordance with the industry requirements, ensuring that files are promptly, accurately and efficiently delivered to the mobile operators. Cloud Soft sets up, tests and operates all the connectivity required with the clients’ roaming partners for the exchange of TAP files. Through Cloud Soft , clients have one single point of access to all roaming partners, other clearing houses and roaming hubs in the market."
good,"this job was a great place and I pretty much did everything that I have done at my previous jobs. Filing, resolving customer complaints, modifying customer accounts & closing transactions.  I can say that management was fair, the best part was interacting with customers."
good,"I am sales associate.I work at Cellular World, an authorized retailer. I have learned a lot. There's a lot to learn, but there is training."
good,"There is a good working environment"
good,"AtT&T is an ok place to work if you are just starting out in the customer service field. The selling is terrible and if you do not ""sell"" things you get in trouble, like its school."
good,"It is a clean, fun, safe environment. The work is easy and the work you do with the customers is great. The management is great."
good,"Just let me say that working at Southwestern Bell/ SBC/at&t"
good,AT&T is exactly what you would expect from a billion dollar corporation. You work on very specialized things and you need to work very hard to get a promotion.
good,"I've worked for the company for about 8 years and I've only worked on the retail side, specifically at a corporate store.  It's a good starter job for fresh out of college or even high school graduates.  After that, due to the poor work-life balance that company has it is very difficult to swing the hours that may be scheduled, but this gets better when tenure is built.  Sick leaves and personal issues or even issues with children that may cause you to miss work are hard to work around as well due to the difficult attendance policy.  But that's the life of retail.  The hours during the holiday season are long and draining.  Prepare to have mandatory black Friday shifts, as with most retail positions.  This is also a company that is constantly evolving so being able to adapt quickly to the changes and constantly learning the changes is a must.  Overall, this company has great benefits and good compensation.  Advancement within the company is achievable, you just have to network and know the 'right people'"
good,Work was enjoyable and the philosophy is to work hard until milestones are met. Co workers are very intelligent and for the most part strive towards a common goal.
good,This was a contract position. Fairly stressful and focused on completing as many orders as possible. Not a very friendly atmosphere.
good,they kept things interesting buy having plenty incentives . learned many ways to deal with all types of customers and people. hardest part was changing the schedules every 6 months.
good,16 years is a long time working for one company.  however good things must come to end. My decision is based on family values. AT&T would be a great company to work for coming out of college.  The offer some great mentoring programs.
good,It was a new site I was with the second batch of employees. The training was not the job itself once we hit the floor it was chaos but we learned quick and adjusted. Working with others was fun but the management were never on the same sheet of music. The hardest part of the job was getting sales from angry customers.
good,"Directv was a great and fun place to work with opportunity for advancement. With the merge of AT&T and Directv, policy changes have been made that are not favorable to employees. Management is still great and the relationships with co-workers is awesome."
good,"There is a lot of backstabbing here, by the time I walked out of training the Area Manager and my would be team manager were fired for something shady. Since then we've had several other management shuffles due to bad behaviors and practices. the place was toxic. Just be careful."
good,"Even if you absolutely adore your job, there are going to be days when you've just had it. It's just the nature of working. For those unbearable days, use this handy infographic as a quick..."
good,Good work life balance. Meeting were very informative and the atmosphere is nice. Would work here again. The managers were also very caring.
good,"a typical day is based around cross-selling and customer service."
good,"I was working in At&t for approximately five years as a technician. For approximately two consecutive years, there were talks about surpluses and layoffs. Eventually in 2005, I was laid off."
good,"Low-level management and HR"
good,Great team building skills needed to navigate a customer service field  that stretches your limits. Exposure to weather and different living conditions make for great stories and experiences.
good,Lack of opportunities for career advancement. Our union contract is expiring. Lack of training on new technologies. Lack of opportunities for career advancement
good,"Presently, the company has a vision for 2020, therefore it is downsizing offices as well as closing them.  Focus is gear towards the Old SBC footprint which is in the South."
good,"organized, very hands on, pleasing customers, helping people, sales rep, pointing people in the correct place or even if i cannot fix my customers problem(s) I always try to make their day better than it was before they called in."
good,"personnel dept was grouchy old-timer who chose his direction daily and picked favorites based on last thought. I should have recognized hostile leadership from ""realistic job Preview"""
good,A typical work day can be very stressful where unrealistic measurements have to be met. The hardest part of the job is having to choose a schedule every six weeks and not knowing what you will be working
good,"The job itself was very good, because you are working by yourself. But you can lose a chance at getting promoted, or even your job for something as simple as having your phone in your truck while you are still in your company lot."
good,"AT&T gave me an opportunity for growth. Being promoted to a key holder gave me the opportunity to learn how to multi-task and the ability to work effectively under pressure. I was responsible for opening and closing the store, keeping track of inventory, and supervising multiple employees. My everyday goal was to ensure a positive customer experience by educating customers on the features and benefits of our products, respond to questions, and resolved any customers queries, problems, or conflicts. Being able to maintain outstanding customer service was the key to my success."
good,This was my first and only sales job. It was very challenging especially as print telephone books were becoming obsolete. The staff was nice and helpful but it was a tough market
good,"•I learned how to adjust to changes in work environment "
good,"AT&T supported me for 31 years.  I have had many mentors through my career with the company."
good,"Solid fortune 10 company. Great benefits, schedule flexibility, and product discounts. However, i'm currently seeking something closer."
good,I enjoyed working for AT&T. I loved helping my customers with their bills & services. My co-workers became more like family than just friends.
good,"Good job, good benefits and pay. Tough place to learn the job correctly. It is a must to be a self trainer in this position."
good,"Enjoyable work"
good,There is constant pressure from management to hit your numbers. The ethical guidelines you are to follow can vary by manager. There is opportunity to make decent money and to move up if you are consistent with your numbers. AT&T has it's hand in a lot of technological arenas so you have to be familiar with a diverse product line.
good,Leadership has no compunction against asking salaried employees to work weekends and log hours with no expectation of compensation.
good,Responsible for day to day mail room operations. pick up daily mail from post office and sort and deliver mail to proper locations within the facility.
good,great way to make money when young but in reality its a young mans job. only movement is if your manager really likes you and helps you get promoted
good,It is a fun place to work but it can be very stressful. they are constantly changing the commission structure and how you get paid. so expect to have to adapt quickly.
good,You take calls from customers wanting to cancel their services and try to get them to stay. Directv lets you talk as long as you want if you can fix the customers problem. The bonuses were not that great but you do get free Directv.
good,"Telephone duty, answering calls connecting people with providers in their areas , taking phone service orders etc..,"
good,AT&T provides a lot of training programs to keep employee up to date with new technology. The telecommuter option is not available as used to be. It would work better if all team members could see each others at lease once a while.
good,"On a typical day at work here, I would first attend the daily morning meeting from our supervisor. She would demonstrate the monthly goals and how we were to accomplish them.  Then, it was straight to the phones to make outbound calls to maintain clients, while accepting inbound phone calls to assistant with customer's phone plans, billing, or upgrades. We also referred customers to technical support if necessary.  I learned that most customers were happy with sticking to their current plans.  Management was nice but lacked professionalism.  There were too many ""brownnosers"" whom my managers seemed to give more attention and favors to. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the daily malfunction of computers which caused myself and my co-workers to fall behind in our numbers which affected our weekly goals.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing AT&T stand by their EOE polices. I got the chance to meet many diverse people."
good,A typical day was selling phones and tablet and giving the best customer service seen in that store. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job was dealing with self entitled customers.
good,overall AT&T pays well but the work/life balance can be poor. The training is top notch and a good place to develop management skills.
good,"Work with customers first hand."
good,Like any sales job you are required to meet sales goals and have adequate product technology. The job overall was a good fit the only downside is the low base pay and high taxed commission checks.
good,"I haven't worked there in over 10 years, so I'm sure a lot has changed.  At the time the organization was reactionary, and couldn't stick with a clear strategy ."
good,"A typical day involves opening and closing the store while filling out reports and processing inventory requests. During open hours, the day consists of greeting and helping customers while also trying to sell them a product or service that can match their needs."
good,"i have worked for many large companies.  ATT in my experience cares the least about their employees out of 30 people that started in my class only 2 of us are left.  all others fired due to performance. as an example i work with an individual that got an award for being the first technician to get perfect customer surveys for 12 months in a row. at the time he received his award he was being put on an action plan because of 1 bad survey he received on the 13 month.  it has gotten better because now uverse is some what a part of the union, but they cant help with the numbers. att also uses the bottom 20% rule which means that even if you make their numbers you can still get disciplinary action if you fall in to the bottom 20%. this can be due to 1 bad survey or repeats that you have no control over. i had a customer add a tv to their account.  the technician went out to install it but because customer service put it in as a repair not an install that counts as a repeat me."
good,"A typical day at work, that never existed here. Everyday was different and I loved that most. My management was available when need. My coworkers were entertaining between call. The hardest part of the job was having to listen to a customer vent to you as if you caused the issue yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job was resolving the customer's issues."
good,"Working Mostly alone, dealing with multiple customers a day, something different everyday, most work took place outside."
good,Excellent company to work for.  The benefits were great and very reasonable to pay for. The only reason for leaving was being laid off due to lack of work.
good,"good company for a career - the technology is always evolving, so there is constant growth.  One can move to different departments and acquire different disciplines, but it is a little tough to receive constant promotions.  Also, the pay is low."
good,I didn't really like sitting around doing nothing it was okay not very friendly I kind of liked the trainer but I didn't really like the other people there
good,"The company is very serious about expanding way beyond it s wireless reputation, and is heavily focused on selling wired services like DirecTV and Digital Life (home security and automation). Sales at AT&T requires you to offer MANY things during each interaction, and just focusing on the customer's immediate needs without exploration into other aspects of their life will result in low commission and potential counseling notices. If you're ok with that fact, you can make a lot of money. If you're an order taker, this is not the job for you."
good,"a good way to start career with networking."
good,"A complete work day is filled with new and creative learning. You start off in your business truck on your way to your first job site where you will use you best judgement to complete the task at hand. You would use power tools, coax cable, cat 5 wires, and phone jacks to create a stable internet, phone and television connection. Your manager would come out to rate you on your job and make sure you have he equipment you need but the most enjoyable part is every job you have total responsibility of satisfying your client."
good,Typical day requires to you complete up to 10 transfers from prospective students to admissions advisors. All you would do is follow a script and thats it.
good,"Inbound calls are coming in, the goal is to successfully make the customer happy, by finding out the issue and solving any problems."
good,It is a great and well known company to work for with good pay and benefits. Work/Life balance could be better. The opportunity to develop could be better as well. There is some discernment and pitting of employees by management.
good,"mal paga, no daban herramientas suficientes para sus exigencias"
good,"Very simple job as a call center agent, fast paced, always changing, overall a good work environment. Pay is decent but commission structure is unstable."
good,a great place to further your education and gain certifications. you are given alot free time to further your education on the clock
good,Great co-workers!  Management lacking in knowledge and skills.  Sales only consisted of inside sales.  Call center environment.  The company continued to cut commissions.
good,"had no insurance or benefits it was contractor work but hard to get in touch with managers, there was misdirects and phone issues with routing calls."
good,"I worked with many very bright people and we had several significant successes. Unfortunately, AT&T is a very siloed company making projects and goals much more difficult. My work load and sense of responsibility to AT&T did not allow a single day away from work. Many peers attended meetings and calls during scheduled vacations, which caused a poor culture and poor health. Compensation is the primary reason many people stay with AT&T."
good,"The job is nice, but there is little work/life balance. Work at employer schedule. Definitely a corporate culture, but they make you feel like they personally care about you as well."
good,turnover rate was high. But the money is good. I liked my co workers. The goals was the hardest thing about the job. Had really good benefits. Best part about the job is not having to sit at a desk the whole time
good,"I worked with a small group in AT& T project. Learned new tool Quality Center. Learned new platforms Apple, and Android. Had good work hours."
good,Fun environment. Got to work in teams. Could be very stressful at time dealing with the customers on the phone. The managers always had to make changes to make things better in their eyes. Very long schedules.
good,The staff is well qualified salesmen that are certified with Ford Motor Company.  Management will help you out any way they can to close a deal.
good,"productive, good workplace, do have ping pong table too, more then hundred year old company, fast pace busy environment, goal oriented,"
good,Can potentially make a lot of commission. In reality there needs to be a varied approach to sales.Maybe some In-store promotions.
good,"The overall corporate structure is very much a facade. The company claims to be interested in developing talent but it much more interested in keeping the status quo and using buzz words to give the illusion of caring. I would recommend the job if you enjoy routine and being in an environment where not much is expected from you physically. The job can also being mentally tiring, not because the material is hard but because a steady stream of calls can be grinding when trying to perform at the company's expected level."
good,"My day started from home 8-5 Tuesday -Friday with meetings on Monday. Professional workplace,flexible schedule and the ability to travel as needed."
good,"The only thing that management cares about is the number of calls that you make everyday. They could care less if you are closing a lot of business or being creative to get to decision makers. Management's lack of leadership ability creates a terrible work environment for the sales reps and the turnover is horrendous. In the beginning of every quarter, you can expect at least 5-10 people to quit. Morale is extremely low for the sales reps, but the other other departments seem to be happy."
good,I learned a lot of relevant business skills and I took a lot of free computer courses offered by this employer. Thanks to this employer I am an expert in computers - both hardware and software.
good,Its a cool place to work. You dont have a lot of work to do. There is a good work life balance. There are lot of opportunities for learning an d here. Try to get the best out of this place.
good,"they work with your schedule and they are all very hard workers there, fun place to work, healthy work environment, being on phones was a lot of fun"
good,AT&T is good place to get your feet wet for customer service. Unfortunately there is no advancement and your sick time you've earned is held against you.
good,"This is a good place to work, good benefits. union place in certain places. They are strict on attendance, but give you plenty of days off"
good,"They push the manages extremely hard which directly effects the employees, they do compensate you very well. If are good at working under extreme pressure work there."
good,Setting up satellite television for customers. learned the ins and out of installation. Good relationship with co workers. Hardest part is the weather. Enjoyed the money alot.
good,"Management was hard to work for and not very understanding "
good,There are opportunities to work with many highly skilled technical people on interesting complex projects. AT&T is changing the core technology of the business from a physical infrastructure to a virtualized software defined infrastructure. You are required to update your personal knowledge and skills each year through a well defined training program for each employee.
good,everyday I came to work I was looking forward to helping someone with there cell phone everything we do now includes our cell phones so I made sure that everyone left with a smile.
good,"Hectic workdays and it depended on what position you are in as I was in sales. Very sales orientated if quota was not met then you would be sent home early. That was typically a bad day but tightly packed area of employment when receiving calls, not allowed to move around too much. Management had a sales orientated state of mind as sales had to be made every three calls, and transfers counted against the employee. The most enjoyable part was selling because it meant more money the hardest was everything else. Management was not too understanding."
good,Decent work area but poor management leadership skills applied to our division. Poor communication skills through the team and customer assistance. Best part was being able to assist customers and resolve terrible situations.
good,"The company and the employees were all wonderful. The benefits and pay was great, this department was just not for me. They knew how to make the job fun."
good,"Position requires ability to multi task while providing excellent customer service, collateral     management, daily banking and critical thinking problem solving."
good,"Decent interim / transition position, learn all skills required to work in any customer facing position. Plus excellent cellular plan discounts."
good,again not a bad place to work when you are in high school or really enjoy the life of selling things and being around electronics all day long it works for the most part I guess
good,"Worked with small business owners to create and implement a business sales and marketing strategy to increase revenues. Utilized a variety of print, direct mail and online sources."
good,"Worked with business owners to create individual marketing and advertising strategies to promote business growth. Utilized a variety of print, direct mail and online marketing solutions."
good,"The company offers growth flexible hours.Incentives for accomplishments. Thanksgiving lunch, company picnics,  talent shows opportunity to train in other ares."
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with people and making their day as enjoyable as mines. Also providing them with the best entertainment that is best for them and their family.
good,"Great company, however AT&T Mobility appears to be lacking in the quality sales representatives hired to position the benefits of their products. Management appeared to be micro-managers rather than leaders in coaching sales reps to maximize opportunities. However, AT&T did have good incentive programs as well."
good,Communications from top down management without feedback or understanding from field force leaves upper management clueless on  operational matters. Poor strategy and execution by too many manager who rely on metric measurements and not from any direct experience.
good,It is a job that you must put first and your personal life doesn't matter. No matter what area of the business -example call center or retail store it is horrible. Just good benefits. That's all
good,shoprite was a ok experience for me because the pay was to low for all the work you put in and the bakery was great the workers were also great as well and the hardest part was keeping a good schedule but i did enjoy baking and pleasing my customers
good,IQOR is a good place to work. The communication between management and the employees could be better. They bought the operation from Jabil.
good,A typical day at work involves taking 60-80 calls. I learned to multitask and I enjoyed my co-workers. Pay and incentives are not very motivating compared to similar employers.
good,"Management does not follow the basic tenants of management; praise in public, punish in private. In my experience, the PRIMARY purpose of management is to support their workers. This is NOT practiced at AT&T."
good,"Very large company so it can be hard to not feel like a number. No real room for ideas, there is a formula that has always worked for AT&T so it will remain."
good,"Its an ok comp any, not the best not the worst. It is not downtown like the competitors therefore has a lot of parking. the building is well kept. nice amenities in the building, cafeteria, gym very close by."
good,"The culture is trying to change, but its all about the numbers, not so much the people.  Time will tell if they can change the culture to a more modern way of life."
good,At&t was a challenging career that will move as fast as you are willing to let it. It is fast paced and dynamic for those who like and are able to embrace change.
good,"there's plenty of room for growth. the environment is nice, the people are excellent to work with, great company to work for. I would refer candidates that are searching for employment."
good,Working at AT&T was hard I did telemarketing sales and was unable to make my mark goal. I quit and went to another job. I will enjoy answering phones to make sales
good,"I returned to the workforce after relocating to Atlanta (my husband started a job at the CDC) and having a child to work as a Technical Support Specialist.  I am responsible for providing a comprehensive customer service experience for Direct TV customers. On a daily basis I work to provide technical support for programming and equipment issues.  I am also responsible for diffusing customer frustrations by providing solutions and determining service options.   This includes troubleshooting problems with both televised and web based systems, and scheduling appointments when necessary."
good,"I have learned a lot while working at AT&T.  I have mastered my skills  of team work, customer service, managing heavy work loads.  AT&T has a lot of great team managers that work well with their employees.  My co-workers are an excellent group of individuals who have taught me a lot about team work, billing, payroll etc."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of many many meetings.  Therefore leaving barley any time to complete other work "
good,"AT&T is was good for opportunity, you will meet great people that will teach you things that will last for a life time. I personally saw everyone there had something to give to the company."
good,I would encounter with many different people throughout the day. I handle very important money transactions. Working with this company provided me with so much customer service skills. Knowing how to handle difficult customers.
good,You can experience politics by the management staff depending on who you may have as a manager.  Job performance is based on meeting all objectives within the company's metric.  Its performance based with the ability to make bonuses.  Company's goals increased each month which made it a little more difficult to meet objectives.
good,"This job is very rewarding and challenges you with thinking strategically, motivating others to high performance and being a liaison between customers and consultants in the workplace."
good,"Fun technology, lots of opportunity to show yourself.  Too many re-orgs.  Nice people, nice workspace, they allow virtual work for some positions."
good,"Call Center environment is fine. Working out of home is great, but you do not get to meet new co-workers or socialize with your peers."
good,"you log in to start taking calls. you have to be on time ready to take calls or it counts against you. I learned how to offer exceptional customer service. micro managing. co worker are great. taking call after call and having to use hard sales tactics. most enjoyable it pay, benefits and a new way of living."
good,Daily tasks are never the same for this highly visual position. The best part of the job is working with building maintenance and engineering crew members in solving continuous issues. I have been fortunate to have competent staff that will take ownership of projects. I have learn to respect their abilities so that I allow them a high level of empowerment to make field judgement decisions. My greatest challenge is to balance property repair and improvement needs with what upper management restrictions are.
good,"AT&T mobility was alot of hard work but the pay, hours and atmosphere made up for it.  This Job equips you for any other call center if you want to make it a career.  The best part of the Job was that enjoyed what I did. You always got a chance to move up in the company if you wanted to."
good,"fun environment , great co workers "
good,AT&T was a nice and fun place to work. That only problem that I had was that the director was not interactive with her employees
good,"Wincor-Nixdorf, allowed me to get my feet wet in logistics and understand the inner workings of getting things shipped from over seas, and dispatching truckers."
good,"cleaning, planting flowers, residential and commercial customer service field work, interior / exterior cleaning, cashier, promotion, greeting, estimates"
good,AT&T wants to squeeze every last penny from its customers so it squeezes every last bit of soul that their employees have as well by having strict requirements and goals that they wish to accomplish. Eventually you get tired on the culture and move on.
good,Great company to work for. Learned a lot from training classes.  Family oriented environment. Loved the work and meeting customers. The smile on customers faces after the job was done
good,In this job there is a lot of moral in the employees  third party billing company. Needs better management. Should also watch who they higher
good,This job required almost impossible stats to meet on a daily/monthly basis. The turnover rate was high because of the high 30-day repeat stat we had to meet.
good,A challenging call center but the employees are very intelligent. Management wants you to succeed and progress within the company.
good,Worked for ATT a brief time before Comcast transition. They had great vacation roll over plans. There were a company of innovation in its time with the Cable industry
good,"Was a contractor at AT&T Typical day busy with clients, gathering requirements and testing changes for production readiness."
good,"good place to work if you are looking for a large employer to work for."
good,"providing first class technical support for At&t customers, frequent training for new products and policies. Co-workers provide a family atmosphere. First line management is great however, upper management seems to be out of touch. Hardest part about the job is helping that angry customer. Resolving customer issues quickly and effectively, and interacting with co-workers."
good,"working AT&T was great for that period of time. I was to grow from video tech to internet and phone technician which lots of potential as tech to better service my customers. Benefits where good at the time "
good,"Fine company to work for if you're starting out into sales, and want a taste for what a corporate, Micro-managed company is like. Don't be 3 minutes late because that Austin traffic was a bit rough! They want you to make a sales pitch to EVERYONE, even the crying grandmother who just lost her husband and is only trying to get the bill stuff situated... make the pitch anyways.   "" Hey, what about getting U-Verse to ease your pain?"""
good,"The job is very fast paced. It's hard to ensure quality when you constantly feel rushed. The pay was good , but it was piecework which made it inconsistent."
good,great culture and company to work for who promotes within and acknowledges your efforts and hard work allowing you to advance and be successful
good,Internship was great. Learned a lot. The company is very open to new ideas. I really enjoyed my time here. A lot of flexibility and able to really show case your talents.
good,"Good Salary, good benefits, job security poor, enjoyable company to work for. Many location closed due to down sizing. Recommend good place to work although long term employment not likely."
good,The company is located in Atlanta GA. It was a nice place to work. The co-workers were nice. I learned a lot about provisioning and number portabililty.
good,"this was a very goal driven position with a what have you done for me lately mentality,  if you can self motivate you have the ability to do 100K east with time off when you need it"
good,"As with any large company, a lot of red tape and politics.  Squeaky wheel gets the grease.  At regular intervals, company requires relocation to other states.  Good benefits."
good,Good place to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my colleagues and learning from them. Some of the managers are more willing to help you out more than others. Some managers dont know everything and they dont pretend to know everything they get the information and help out as best as they can.
good,Not a place where your skills and talents are observed. It was an authorized retailer not corporate. It was tough not to be looked at as a number but a person.
good,Fun place to work. Restructure of management and leadership every 1-2 years. Responsive HR. Processes and structure is very defined.
good,being contractor at Directv is not so much fun due to more work pressure and short deadlines with plenty of work. processes are always in place from beginning.
good,Focus on growth in business. Decent Red Tape and Limited Resources. Seattle office is split between Bothell and Redmond campuses.
good,"Happen to work on more challenging and exciting jobs everyday. Very supportive colleagues, architects and business clients.."
good,Inbound call center for Mobility sales with a focus on wireline solutions. I've learned to overcome objections which was the hardest part of the position....
good,Mundane with very little empowerment for level 2 managers. Upper level managers normally are simply trying to have an impact without regard for implications of impacts. Limited upward movement opportunities.
good,"A design job that presented a wealth of experience in B2B design, but lacked opportunity to present the heart and soul of design principles that left any efforts of creativity empty."
good,This was a great opportunity to gain customer service skills. It also gave my salesmanship skills that i may need in the future.
good,"If you're looking to make money and control your paycheck this a great place to do so and expand your horizons. The work day is pretty fair being that you either work early leave early or start a little later but leave at a decent time. There are different managers with different styles. You will be exposed to all sorts of managers, coworkers and customers. Hardest part of the job is the competition to hit your monthly quota which is more than doable. The most enjoyable part is the fact that you have access to all walks of life throughout the day."
good,"typical corporation, comp is good enough for a decent living, work/life balance is average , Sales is a must to work here"
good,"This company has great job security and pays a very honest living wage. However, the culture of the technicians was poor and the management was overwhelming. Being relocated far from home without options and forced overtime on a daily basis became too much for my life balance."
good,Direct TV is a good company to work with. On a typical work day I close out at least 4 jobs depending on how the weather and customers are.
good,Work place with lots of structure. The company has management and customer service by the book and makes sure the customers are very satisfied.
good,I did not like the way they treated people who were not from El Paso or Mexican decent.  Hours were not consistent.  Liked working with the customers and the equipment and software was up-to date.
good,good place to work. pay and benefits are really good. work place is great. staff is great. good place to work. makes good money.
good,"AT&T is a good place to learn and has opportunity for advancement. Benefits are on par with other Fortune 500 companies however, they are forever changing policies, procedures, and company initiatives."
good,"Assisted AT&T wireless phone customers with billing, upgrades, product orders. Technical support. Account changes. Co-workers were friendly. Management was very helpful."
good,"Good pay, great benefits, loved working with business owners on a daily basis, however, sales you are constantly bound and limited on what you can and cannot sell due to FCC regulations, etc."
good,"How to troubleshoot network related problems, Troubleshoot issues with regards to IptV ,PSTN connections,Internet connectivity ,Wireless networks"
good,I enjoyed my workmates and I loved the technology. I wish that had not eliminated my position but I understand why they did it.
good,went to store in the surrounding locations near my home. pitched deals and promotions to costumers. Which can be very difficult. Team was fast pass and commission worked on a pyramid scheme. which if at the top is good but when working on the lower levels this is bad.
good,"Working here isn't that bad, its just the pressure they put on you to ""meet your numbers'. These ""numbers' are mostly weighed on things that you cant control, such as how the customer rates you ( instead the customer rates the company) and how often they callback. Wouldn't recommend if you cant work under pressure or talk people into doing things that they really don't want to do...oh and sell cell phones."
good,"The daily task as a wire technician for AT&T I worked alone to complete a task for clients. I worked on telephone polls, crossbox units and dslam units to provide optimal care to clients. I was responsible for stocking ad loss prevention. Calling and educating customers on Uverse features. I kept log of all clients for future assistance."
good,"Customer service allowed me an opportunity to work as part of a team and with a company, helping customers understand their bill and get the best value for their wireless service. The most enjoyable part was working with others"
good,Compensation levels are low and could be better. Management is not very connected to the changes in the telecom landscape and that does not help anyone.
good,Typical work day starts around 8 A.M and can last 10 hrs. While it is good to have a van to work from working in a rural area can cause long drives from the different locations.
good,"great benefits, great pay, never know what time you get off, management isnt all that. feels like the military. other than that its fine"
good,i worked there twice it was agood environment and very professional i also made a lot of friends there whom i still have contact with
good,"this was a very professional environment, and felt like a real job.  I felt like a professional and important to the company.  i would like to find another job like that."
good,"I enjoyed working from home on the DirecTV contract. Flexible hours, decent pay. Typical day of trouble shooting, and taking payments."
good,"Management is hard to work with because they are not flexible and place the business needs ahead of their employees needs. With that being said they do pay very good wages and provide great benefits for their employees,"
good,Not the place i would want to build my career at. Great place to start your career but not enough focus on career development.
good,"Very fun atmosphere, but can feel very micro-managed. Very driven by daily statistics. Overall, underpaid, and no opportunity is the downfall in my opinion."
good,This was a good company to work for in regards to the compensation and benefit packages. Also was a great place to move up and move all over the country.
good,"Unfortunately, AT&T is not a family oriented company like BellSouth was. My experience working at this company has been rocky at best. There are jobs within the company but it's hard to obtain job security unless you know someone that is willing to give you shot without playing the political game."
good,"This is a good company to work for. It can be a bit challenging at times but for me the good times have out weighed the bad times. "
good,"although at&T is a strong company with longevity it isnt a the company that it use to be. The company isnt about its employees but about metrics, numbers and competition."
good,I enjoyed working for ATT.  Gained a lot of knowledge and made a few lifetime friends.  Good benefits and there is an opportunity for advancement if you know the right people.
good,"On a typical of work I would answer calls and help customers troubleshoot their phone. I worked mostly with iPhones, but I also helped with other makes and models. I would also help educate iPad customers on how to update their services and payment options. "
good,Very demanding and stressful environment. You are required to sell so many products and stress you a lot. The management does work with you to get you to sell as much as possible.
good,theres really not much more to say about this company. its a job and i can eat and feed my children but not much more. I would love more responsibility and higher pay.
good,Great place to build your career as a young UX professional. A lot of smart people in the technology space. Adoption of Agile is helping drive large projects to fruition.
good,if your motivated and hard working its a great company to work for. great benefits and good people to work for. i was just going different places in life.
good,"Work Experience"
good,Fast Paced and deadline driven work environment with many of the people I worked with at Fox.  It's a very strict environment.
good,Team work is always critical because each work is part and parcel of the whole customer experience.  Clear cut understanding of the project and on time delivery is always the top priority.
good,"A very fast paced environment."
good,Working in a call center was not fun.  Not enough training.  Too many calls.  Pay was not competitive.  Hours were too long with not enough breaks.
good,Have to slog to rise. Have some good benefits and co-workers relationships. Overall a very techie company with work load.
good,"Professional environment, with a diverse work force.  Provides good benefits and salaries are good. In Canada, advancement is somewhat limited."
good,The pay for what you do at AT&T is great the benefits and the fact that you are unionized is amazing. The work life balance is not there (retail hours) unpredictable schedule and working every weekend isn't great. Management frequently micro-manages to drive numbers for their respective stores.
good,This is for GNET a contractor for ATT Mobility. Job is fast paced and caters to ATT Mobility's needs. Company was always adjusting work force to meet demand.
good,"Installed and wired residential automation and burglar alarms."
good,answer calls and help people with the issues they've had with there at&t account and help resolve them in the best way i can

good,"Process payments for accounts, update account information, process orders for new products. change install dates, Sell pros of products. Provide discounts so customers can keep account and products that they love."
good,"decent pay, good benefits, I liked the hours. some management employees were great to work with. people seemed happy with the job. I only left because I found a higher paying position"
good,"Great coworkers, loved the job... customers were great, not too many that you could not please... The hardest part of the job is dealing with the insecurities of managerial staff. They do not know how to talk to people as adults. They try to belittle you and your experience, thinking that they are the only people that matter and they getvery defensive if you do not agree with them. They seem to want the job to be harder than it is!"
good,"•	Responsible for coaching and developing team members in all areas of performance including, but not limited to metrics and behaviors related to the customer experience"
good,"monthly goals constantly changing with different focus and pressure every month. for those who like to be challenged, its the perfect job but if you are just looking for a hourly paycheck, it is not the job for you"
good,AT&T is a prominent leader in the Telecommunication's industry.  You have the opportunity to learn about how to be effective in a corporate environment.  Some areas of operation have very supportive managers and co-workers that drive the success of the company.
good,"Great benefits working for this company - health, dental, vision, compensation etc"
good,"My day started off driving to one of the 15 stores that I audited often driving more than an hour. When I reached the store I would do a walk through the store checking for compliance with company policy."
good,"There are really high expectations for every employee, not just management.  The job is very financially rewarding.  There are opportunities for advancement if you are willing to move."
good,"Sale, sale, sale, sale is what you get with AT&T.  You got to meet new people every day which is awesome. Long hours and no weekends off is what did it in for me on this job."
good,Had lots of fun with the people. Got to talk with different people daily. Was allowed to solve someone's issue. Had wonderful parties.
good,Very fun place to work. Great training & support system put in place by supervisors & managers. Lots of peer interaction & guys are always willing to help eachother out.
good,I had a few different jobs before DTV but this was the first job that i was able to advance into a Supervisory position. I enjoyed the benefits and incentives of working for DirecTV but I would not want to work for them again.
good,Long hours with never ending calls. People yelling at you. never knowing if you were going to have a job the following month.
good,"The company was a good company in beginning but towards the last years there was declined in work, benefits decreased and multiple layoffs where happening"
good,"AT&T is a decent place to work with great compensation and great benefits. Very busy work life with little to no time for anything else ie. school, family, etc. Attendance policy isn't as great and there isnt a set off time regardless of what is scheduled. Overall, AT&T is a great company for money and compensation purposes."
good,The company is very disorganized for the size it is. There are some great people that work for this organization. The company needs to revamp its strategy with Uverse. Not sure the direction the company is heading.
good,This was a great position with AT&T the hours were crazy but the overall job was easy. The only down side was that the hours get kind of late.
good,A lot of areas to learn- hard to manage work life balance.  Not as many areas to grow unless willing to relocate.  A lot of good people to learn from while with company
good,"The company is more concerned with the bottom line to be concerned with individuals"
good,"Great Company to work for... Once you get into a management a lot of benefits with work/life."
good,this is ridiculous how long these things take. You will take business away from yourself for continuing this type of system
good,"A typical day at work would include daily coaching's on various metrics as well as coaching on the customer experience, outlining a sales focus for the day and working on implementing it during customer interactions."
good,"Management needs help. Company has an extensive chain of command and does not like when you go out of the chain. pays well, great training."
good,"Typical day includes installing Internet, TV and phone services. Learning how to properly wire a house to provide AT&T coverage."
good,A typical day at work would be me reporting to a house that needs a installation or customer service. I've learned how to program and install satellites and interact with customers. The hardest part on the job for me would be installing a dish during poor weather. The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing all the beautiful homes that the customers lived in.
good,it is some what a lay back place but the downside is the pay the start you at 8.00 during training and then when you hit the floor you move to 8.50.  it is not a wage that you can live
good,What I learned and gained from 2wire was the hands on technical support after graduating from tech school. I gained more patience and a sharper simpler way to handle customer relations when they have a technical problem.
good,There is growth with in the company different departments. From customer sales to installation of services. Also tech support and repair.
good,"A typical day at Directv was complete sales environment "
good,"Providing accounts receivable management services, make telephone calls, negotiate payment plans and know all applicable state and federal laws and regulations.

good,"•	Create job aids and execute performance huddles that focus on current performance needs and or changes to drive improvement."
good,"never the same day twice.... only see your supervisor a few times in the field, good benefits but you never have a set schedule, you work until there is nothing left, work in all conditions, under payed"
good,flexible shift with great benefits. Exceptional management.. training was perfect and thorough so that one could know how to perform on the job
good,"The company became more interested in the bottom line. The benefits were very good. The managers in our office were exceptional, but executive management did not instill trust in the organization, especially with the way they handled the closing of our office. All of our jobs were outsourced to another country."
good,"Pay Great"
good,"Roles include troubleshooting devices for att, as well as warranty replacements, billing inquires, and any additional service that the customer needed through Chat or over the phone. Taking on two customer chats at once. This position is being re located in which looking for a new job opportunity"

I love my co-workers, I am apart of the Diversity & Inclusion team. I create ways to raise money for our numerous fundraisers, create games and fun stuff fort he center. We have a shift bid, every 3 months, so my schedule changes often, as well as the hours/days of operation of the center."
good,The time that I spent working for LifeShield the home security company for Directv was a great learning experience. I was able to to advance at  fast past in less than a year. The hardest part of the  job was the sudden change in the demand for hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was the responsibility. Being a major part of the Retention team I was able to personally handle and solve many home security issues for hundreds of customers and co workers daily.
good,I learned that selling products is not my forte. I spent three miserable years before realizing that teaching was my calling.
good,It was an average job with average people. Average pay with average work/life balance. Average everything. Just average. Nothing more or less. Just average
good,"I was a great place to work just management was not consistent. One manager may ask you to do one thing, then when you do it another manager may ask why did you perform that task"
good,Decent place to work for an entry level position.  The hardest part about the job are the unattainable goals and not ever knowing if you are going to meet them.
good,"A typical day at work is ringing noises in your ear for eight hours, employees sending messages via chat needing help from supervisors with the customers on the phone being mean."
good,learn how to deal with different types of people every day and learn how to help others in need management was really good help you along the way and my co-workers did the same hardest part was the beginning and then that easily changed best part was helping people solve their problems
good,"Typical day started bright and early, i learned something new almost everyday at work in regards to equipment and correct probing questions to ask in order to get to root of why customer was calling in. The hardest part about this job was the confusion amongst the employess positions and job titles because of advancements and lay offs. The co workers and and enviornment were the most enjoyable  part of the job."
good,"My typical day at work would involve assisting customers with their accounts. I would learn about the products and service offered by the company to make sure I can provide the accurate information needed to assist our customers. Management would provide assistance as needed for our customers. My co-workers play as a team to assist each other with questions or answers we may know to provide and assist each other. My jobs generally are not hard, because I am a people person. The day would prove hard to me if I was not able to assist the customer."
good,In my past working years at various jobs I can say that I appreciated the experiences and moments I have endured. I enjoyed making new friend with co-workers and supervisors. I learned how to be communicative with people and building rapport.
good,"Trabajo típico, atención a clientes, registración de formularios y etc."
good,"Develop and attain customer experience and sales objectives for store. Sell all products and services offered by the Company. Meet all sales objectives. Handle all administrative aspects of the sale including: completing customer contracts and warranties, pulling products from inventory, accepting customer payments and filing the completed orders.

good,I gained a lot of knowledge working for AT&T. They taught me a lot about how to treat people. The difference between sympathy and empathy for my fellow man.
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,While this company is fun to work for and is very easy going but still demand the best from there employees. This is something that i believe a excellent virtue. Though i notice there is a lot of friendships and cliques that are in charge of this company thus is what leads them to have the highest turn over rate in stark county. A lot of high quality people are past over due to this situation.
good,"As a retail sales consultant you will be dealing with alot of customer sevice issues. I would say half of the people coming in the door have problems with phones or their plans and customers expect everything to be fixed. Now on top of solving problems for customers management expects you to also up-sell and cross-sell products and services whether the customer is in a good or bad mood. The hardest part of the job is being micro managed by about 3-4 managers constantly, and overcoming customers objections. If you can handle those few things its not a bad job. The best part was working with a young and energetic team and making the sale."
good,made outbound calls to re-establish customer with company resold to previous customer worked in group environment worked well with others
good,Enjoyed growing within the field of technology. Constant changes requiring continued training in order to transition to customer focused interfacing.
good,"Typical day at work is full and tiring and often seems never-ending."
good,It was a lot of pressure everyday to make sales at the company. Also the way that the quota was structured you could actually miss your quota because of someone else's mistake. The good thing about this job was the union reps that did all they could to save your job.
good,"a day at direct tv was sometimes challenging but then again fun, I would be in Costco , & talk to people asking ""hello , how are you? have you lowered your cable bill threw Costco"" than normally they say yes or no. than id bring them back & give them a side by side of what direct tv Costco could offer them."
good,retail job  with ok pay peopel around the store not too bad average day with stocking and assisting customer checking out and making purchases
good,"Great company to work for, just need some work with the staffing. This company alouds you to grow. Phones is the main drive and making sure the customer is well taking care of."
good,Great team to work on. Case/assignment load is not too much. Processes improved greatly. Competitive pay with possible bonus
good,"Idem Lucent Technologie"
good,"In order to thrive in this organization you must relocate to Dallas, TX. The hardest part of the job is working in an open office environment."
good,A typical day at At&t is basically face to face selling to consumer and small business customers interested in wireless solutions.  In the 14 years at At&t I have leaned all aspects of the business and mastered my sales craft.  I have worked under a lot of different management some good some bad but overall good. Worked with some really sharp co-workers over the years and have gained knowledge and useful tips from them. Hardest part of the job would working with  big groups of people that at times don't get along. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people and the public.
good,This was a very rewarding place to work. The co-workers are great and fun to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is the commission structure.
good,"it has been a very long time since I worked for Cingular which was changed to ATT, but the call center was very busy that you never had a second to breath cause it was call after call. You had to deal with customers calling and yelling at you and if you hung up on someone for calling your dirty nasty names you got fired on the spot"
good,Managed over 20 techs on a daily basis making sure they completed their orders and made the customers happiness was number 1. Also made sure they had the equipment to complete their orders. Also took inbound calls from customers to set us appointments and solve their problems when they were unhappy.
good,i regular day would be attending customers and taking payments and offering options with product. i learned very good face to face communication skills.my co workers were very informative and helpful as i advanced within the company.  there was no hard part at my job very easy transition. the best part of my job was being there and interacting with customers and helping them.
good,Corporate culture is great. No one really cared what you do as long as the work gets done. Management is supportive. You will work with some folks.
good,It's a great company and the only downside is there are a ton of targets and each one has to be attained at the highest level
good,Fun place to work and gave all employees opportunities to work from home. Management are flexible with their employees and allow everyone to share ideas in team environment. The work is fast pace and productive.
good,This was a nice place to work. Opportunity to learn new things and be able to grow respectively in the organization. Management was open and honest. Co-workers were helpful in making you grow in the company.
good,The hardest part of the job was work life balance. The job responsibilities required time beyond standard 9 to 5 workday. High stress environment.
good,"ATT is the pinnacle of a big company - plentiful assets, talented people and the ability to provide all customer requirements"
good,I enjoyed working with people in this company. I felt like it was a family foundation and the trainers were very helpful and determined to make sure their team members accomplished all their goals.
good,"Long hours during the summer months, training is ok but you still want be prepared for all that you are going to face in the work field,management is all about numbers very few really manage anything job related."
good,"When I first started working or Empereon Marketing I was very excited but as time went on. Nothing is set in stone every day something is different and when asking a manager a question, almost every management person has a different answer."
good,At&t overall is a very good company to work for I had the pleasure to work for there vendor as a customer care rep over the phone.
good,"Long hours, but pay and benefits are good. If lucky you will get weekends off. summer months are the worst as far as working long hours."
good,"good environment, you will make custom rugs which are pretty cool, You will get to visit places all over the metroplex and will learn a trade that you will never forget"
good,"•	Educated customers on service features and functionality."
good,"Assisted customers with phone/plan purchases, accepting payments, troubleshoot equipment concerns, and explained rate plans and options to best suit their individual needs."
good,A typical call center environment. Worked with different people. Stat driven center. Heavy phone work. Management always willing to work with you .
good,This was a very good paying job. Very good benefits but you definatly paid for it! Your time is the question you have to ask yourself. I'd never recommend this job to anyone with a family!
good,"Could use improvement, Benefits good, Management view employees as just workers not people, the only care is profit not about customers"
good,"good experience especially if you dont have experience for installing/repairing cable tv and installing sattellite services. management are friendly and approachable. co-workers we dont really communicate that much due to we are home dispatch. The hardest part of the job is when you first install satellite services and get the reception, learned as you go. The most enjoyable part of the job is you manage your own self, you do your own route."
good,"It was ok for the short time I was there. There isn't really more I can say other than what I stated. Nice people I worked with, a lot of OJT."
good,"Aside from the fact that this was a third party authorized dealer for AT&T, the company itself wasn't bad.  A normal day at work was how you would expect any retail job to be.  The only down side of this was the fact that the company had extra rules towards employees and customers that even AT&T found to be out of the ordinary, which demotivated sales reps and customers to make purchases from us.  Had that been changed, the company would have done a lot better. Also used to cut commission in any way possible."
good,relaxed until its outsourced there are lot of vendors due to which the style of working is reduced to mere laborers working in field with zilch respect. If its directly with AT&T and without outsourcing model then its good job else dont go for it.
good,Growing pains as a result of a wire line company taking over a wireless company and trying to run both as the same
good,"•	Troubleshooting Production issues, worked on resolving Application Server Hang issues and High memory and CPU issues in WebSphere Application Server 6.x/7.x."
good,"My daily routine consisted of auditing and analyzing business contracts. "
good,The pay is above average. The benefits are good. Plenty of training available. Beyond that there is not much good I can say.
good,Did not like my experience at all. Would not work there again under any circumstance. Management has no clue about day to day operations.
good,"I was sought after by AT&T. I currently had a great job and was content with where I was working. They laid out the red carpet and promised the moon and the stars. Be prepared to have your w2s to all of your jobs for the past 7 years. If you do not get them in time they will deny you the job even if they already offered it to you. I was offered the Job, given a start date, and continuously harassed on when I can start. Just for them to deny me after I left my job. The reason? A technical error on the background check, honest mistake, and one of my previous employers took too long to get my w2.  All they had to say was sorry, we have a strict policy. Try again in 6 months. I am now unemployed. AT&T is NOT a employee friendly company. I was told my the manager that they fire people based off of a month my month bases. So even if you are great for 10 months if you have 2 or even just 1 bad month they will fire you because there are others in line. Go elsewhere. Verizon. T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular. Heck even Straight Talk."
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for, but they constantly change the commission plans annually, which works as a negative for sales associates."
good,"Working at AT&T was a very enlightening experience.  AT&T in the inside is very high pressure and they pushed people to bundle products that customer did not want which would result in 90% of the incoming calls being customers complaining about stuff they had on their bills they did not understand or were not told about.  After working there for years I became fed up with the business model they pushed on the sales people. Overall I eluded the pressure of adding stuff customers did not need and took good care of my customers and still exceeded my numbers each month.  Growth within this company extremely political and very very slow.  As far as money goes its ok, but be warned that AT&T while the money is pretty decent for a 9-5 job, is ran by accountants who raise quotas monthly and squeeze more work for less money as time goes on instead of rewarding its hard working sales people. This is a utility company at the end of the day and upper management does not care about its sales people."
good,"Good money, great environment of professionals, hard job but well worth it."
good,fast paced environment providing service to existing customers and creating opportunities for sales and additional services.
good,"A typical day at work could not be explained, it is very inconsistent. There are days where it could possibly be busy but for the most part at my location it was slow. I learned how to operate 3 different computer systems in which i process activations, upgrades, and purchases. I also learned how to focus on others besides myself. We learned how to team build as well as team sale. Always helping one another so we all succeed. As the manager my coworkers come and go. The company always wants the best, so if one is lacking somewhere they look for someone that will not. Being 3-4 hours away from my bosses made it a little hard to be as good as other stores where management is located, we dont get as much focus due to not traveling down here to often. Hardest part of the job is being able to get someone fully trained and then having to lose them right after. Most enjoyable part of the job are the customers that come in upset and you building enough value in the interaction to where they forget all about being upset anymore."
good,"Mostly working aloneon jobs being able to repair telephone lines, and internet.Learning everyday that there is something new and being able to have a good manager means alot. I had good support from my co-worker"
good,they are trying to keep up with industry but too many regulations that hold them back... they are still phone company
good,"•	Assisted existing customers with their billing issues and setting up new services."
good,"Good work environment. Co Workers are always a blast and the district manager also is fun to work with as well, as usual you still have your office politics"
good,"I would start off my day by answering calls, I had to handle customers with bills questions to inquiring on new services. Even giving credits and disconnecting services. I learned how to deal with different people and their emotions and how t eliminate a situation before it escalated and still keep a friendly manner! The management was on a only if you have questions basis, so we didn't not communicate unless we were having a team meeting. Everyone around were busy taking calls all day so there would barely be time to communicate with co workers, I did enjoy help customers with their issues a happy customer makes a happy day!! The hardest part was the calls never stopped"
good,A typical day at work by my position is Store Manager or Area Retail Managers passing down needs on company priorities. Priorities change daily and are micromanaged.
good,"You're always wrong. No matter what you do, it's never good enough. Different managers will give you different answers."
good,"great place to work. lots of hours if you want them, company vehicle and phone. also had a laptop"
good,The Premises Tech position is not hard at all. The issue is the hours they are long and there is no promised home time aside from days off. You do not get overtime until you make 40 hours so dont expect OT after an 8 hour day. the company offers great benefits and decent discounts on services.
good,There is lack of communication and it is hard to know the correct way of doing a task when being told to do it a different way.
good,"recruiting"
good,They need better training programs and better salary for managers. Also need more perks for employees and recognition for employees at all levels.
good,"AT&T is a great company but this particular position requires a lot of its employees. Working for sun- up to sun- down literally and lots of strenous work. Customers can be as bit difficult but if you learn to deal with them, it really eases the wwork load."
good,"A typical day at work would be to get to your desk and log in to the system to start taking calls. It is a call center atmosphere. Management is not very team oriented. They seem to be more concerned about themselves. The co-workers are great to work with and become somewhat family. The hardest part of the job was meeting all of the standards that AT&T had for its employees. If you were on the phone too long, said the wrong sentence, or it seemed like you weren't trying hard enough to collect the money owed by the customer, you were scorned and punished sometimes by management. It is a very micromanaged work environment."
good,work life balance is the worse part especially if you are a new hire
good,A lot of standing and meeting face to face with customers of all types.
good,"A typical day was answering phones, explaining customer's bills, filing technical cases, making sure customer's issues were resolved in a timely manner. I had to be be good at listening and equally good at giving advice. The job was extremely stressful and perfection was expected. The hardest part of the job was that it was 100% customer driven. If I was excellent at my job, management did not take that into consideration, if the customer was having a bad day, or did not like AT&T products, they would give me a low score, if you got enough low scores, you were fired, no questions asked. Another policy of the company is to find a reason to fire employees who have been working for the company a long time, to save the company money........like most of the bigger companies in America. I did my best every day, I loved the customers, I loved resolving their issues. I earned a good salary, and had excellent benefits, however, management style was all wrong and getting worse month by month, that is why I left."
good,"A typical day at work: arrive at the garage, stock truck, dispatch on repair/installations, call customer, complete job, make sure customer is satisfied/would recommend AT&T to family and friends, repeat until no more work."
good,"Working at The call center was fast paced, and I enjoy and office setting. The benefits were good, and so was the starting pay. The only, and biggest complaint I had was the training was too short, but I learned along the way. The management seemed to recognize this and were very helpful, and patient."
good,A typical day would consist of on average 20 phone calls taken in a 8 hour shift helping customers mover their service and answer question about there service.
good,"I enjoyed my job but when cell phones became more affordable and people moved away from land lines, the company laid off anyone with less than twelve years of service"
good,At&T was a great place to work. it was a great learning  experience. The most enjoyable part of the job is when an customer is happy with your service you provided  the co workers at AT&T are fun to work around very helpful when you need help with  customer. What I've learned working at AT&T is how to become an customer service rep.
good,"Trabajo dinámico, poco rutinario, buen relacionamiento con otras áreas,"
good,"this job help me with my customer service skills because we help people with problems or trying to upgrade their services, after all it was a good pay and nice hours"
good,"I enjoyed the people to work for because it was a fun, fast paced environment."
good,Working at AT&T was a challenge for me at the time because I was technicially challenged. Through my employment I was able to learn things about mobile devices I did not previously know.
good,"Answering customer calls"
good,"Receiveing, examining and processing requisitions; "
good,"Would take calls from customers and assist with activations, changes on account, ordering equipment and trouble shooting."
good,"Great company to work for with great Management to back you up. However, certain positions will actually inhibit your growth and income potential within the company so choose wisely."
good,"Biggest critique: There is no value placed upon educational background or experience. If you haven't finished college, it's a great place to learn about business and pays well for entry level work. If you are looking for advancement into areas outside of retail, meet somebody in corporate who can throw you a rope."
good,"It is a good place to work overall, but I would like to see better communication between upper and lower staff members, as well as better pay for the work the agents accomplish daily."
good,"Supported sales reps, assisted customers, checked in and stocked inventory"
good,"built and installed satellite dish, ran and installed rg6 cables used to activate customers DIRECTV services"
good,High call volume call center. Great place to work for and helpful co-worker and great management team.
good,I love my co-workers and working with people.  The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with people and developing representatives to their full potential.
good,"Fostering relationship with customers to provide a total solution for products offered."
good,"Environment was condusive to many other retail stores, but the teamwork was a very strong bond. Being able to help customers is what I love to do and the management team was very helpful in assisting with any issues that we werent able to control or fix. Was a very family oriented environment while I was employed with the company. Most enjoyable part of the job was just the close knit structure that was created amonst the workers and management at the time."
good,"Demanding work, physically and mentally. Interesting industry where you meet all kinds of people everyday. The work itself is satisfying, albeit physically demanding. Management can be a stress point being numbers driven. Schedule is very demanding, not leaving much time or energy left for personal pursuits. Be prepared to work late and on weekends, including Sundays and some holidays."
good,A good place to start and acquire technical and customer service skills.
good,A typical day at work was busy and continuous. I was busy 12 out of 24 hours. I learned how to perform on a team. The hardest part of the job was loosing my job to individuals in another company. Most enjoyable was being able to retire.
good,"issue with management and employees.My duties included; remotely troubleshooting businesses Internet connection; configuring business routers, business modems and business fire walls"
good,"Good company, great benefits, great customers. New products that you can learn very quickly. Cons are no work life balance."
good,I worked with the company for 3 years and enjoyed my time there. Always do research on any company before you commit to working for them.
good,"Knowledgeable co-workers "
good,it was ok. The Houston office has a lot of fun people to work with.
good,Established company with sluggish behavior when it comes to change.
good,honestly i got sick and missed a step in a process now i cant get hired back
good,"I was with McCaw Cellular, who then became ATT Wireless - that company no longer exists."
good,The physical work is ok but the company has no structure. I work hard and complete each and every job to the best of my ability. My goal it to complete each job in a timely manner and please my customers.
good,its a good company just needs better training instructors teaching the students
good,"The day started at 7am with a meeting then having to be on the first job site by 8am and the day would not end until you called and the supervisor released you to go home 10 or more hours later. The work weeks were always 6 days at 10 plus hours. This gave me a chance to learn a lot about voice over internet protocol and related phones systems. The management was mostly only seen at the morning meeting and at random site inspections. We worked along and really did not get much time to talk to other co-workers except at the morning meetings. The hardest part of the job is working in conditions under houses, attics, and some unhealthy conditions that people lived inside their homes. The most enjoyable part was meeting other and being able to help others with their services."
good,"Working with multi-national accounts you work around the globe across all time zones - so no two days are the same. Lots of problem solving from the strategy of the sale, managing in a matrix, multi cultural environment, service delivery and trouble resolution. Co-workers were great and for the most part really wanted to provide excellent customer service. The hardest part of the job was the complexity of the internal processes - many acquisitions and little integration of systems."
good,"Powerful company when it comes technology."
good,I had a great experience with AT&T but I really missed the medical field.
good,"Very fulfilling job, but too much overtime."
good,Fun and easy to make your own huge pay check but bad management and unrealistic expectations set by management.
good,Directv offers great pay but not very flexible hours felt like I spent more time at work than with my family
good,"it was terrible"
good,"-allowed you to put together custom marketing solutions for clients"
good,I love the atmosphere of dealing with the public. I have been doing this for almost 13 years.
good,"It was a job, with an opportunity. I had got in at the tail,end of snet run and lived to the beginning of the frontier."
good,"The job was stressful at times, but I enjoyed it overall. Did not feel like there was a lot of opportunity to move up."
good,My day would start at 6am drive to pick up my co-worker at 7am be at the shop. My day would end around 9pm some times 10pm.
good,"I really enjoyed my job but management was a bit poor. I learned to have confidence in what I sale. I learned about different types of cellphones and their specs. My typical day at work was to sale cellphones with insurance and accessories. Make sure that the sales floor looked presentable and the demo devices were up and running, if not, we could fail an audit. I had to make sure that every customers had that extraordinary sell experience to the point that they will recommend my service to others."
good,"Assistant Manager"
good,A typical day at work is never guaranteed. Really depends upon the customer base and the amount of traffic that you get for the day.
good,Great working environment. Enjoyed and learned. It was a great experience.
good,Assist customers with all billing and direct selling of all of AT&T portfolio
good,Good job for some one just out of high school.not very challenging however
good,had great benifits and cool people but i do not agree with the sales process
good,"I work very long and hard hour, Very dirty job. I didn`t make much money."
good,AT&T is a good company to work for unless your in the field of U-Verse. U-Verse itself is easy but made difficult by company metrics. From upper management micro-managing all the way down to the knowledge base of techs. There is no work/life balance. Many times I would arrive home between the hours of 10-11pm even sometimes past 12am only to be back at work by 8am the next day. This job is for single individuals without kids or pets. Now the satisfaction of providing great service for the customer is always good knowing you did a good job by seeing their appreciation for all you did for them.
good,Had a great atmosphere. Everyone was friendly. Dealing with customers was tough at times but with the people around balanced everything out
good,"The job was very interesting and the best part of the job was the investigation of the claims. I was busy constantly and had to be focused. "
good,"Ath this particular location your schedule will change every 3 months, which makes it really hard to plan things/vacations/life etc further down the line. Managemnet, most do not try to help advance throughout the company"
good,"Compensated well. Only provided with on-the-job training. Workload is shaky - could be steady, could drop off quickly."
good,"Good place to work for students and people that have second jobs, very busy call center opens at 5am closes at 9pm shift bids every six months depending of hiring rate"
good,Will recommend this employer to other people. Great flexibility.
good,"I worked for Spring Mobile. The company itself was good. Great products, I was well trained. The fact that you can move up in the company if you work hard was good too. I feel like it was also a problem. Some of the managers were very selfish and unorganized. The managers were very unprofessional and there was a lot of negativity."
good,Very busy and must be flexible to shift changes and overall attainment changes
good,"Typical day at work was greeting customers as they walked in and assist them with any questions or concerns they may have. Management was alright, there seemed to be a lot of churn. My co-workers i enjoyed working with. The hardest part of my job was adapting to a new manager every so often and new co-workers as they came and went."
good,I was not paid the salary that was agreed on at the beginning of my employment
good,"Attracts potential customers by answering product and service questions; suggesting information about other products and services."
good,"- answer inbound calls from customers"
good,Productive workplace that taught me great customer service skills.
good,yes it is an amazing company to work for  but you are alway under threat of being fired that you try too hard and its hard to make right from wrong.
good,"The job is great the first couple of months, but after awhile the constant goal changing starts to effect productivity, and ultimately your compensation. If you dont really care what youre selling then this place is great but i couldnt sell uverse to save my life in my area. (too many home associations already included services to residents)"
good,Satisfying customer needs is the most enjoyable thing about my job.
good,"quiet environment,  no coworkers, work from home position. I had no real supervisor because I had my own business"
good,"Handled customer questions, complaints, and billing inquiries with the highest degree of courtesy and professionalism.   Offered alternative solutions, where appropriate with the objective of retaining customers ' business"
good,I learned quite a bit progressing from an WDTS Support Representative to eventually attaining the role of a Workforce Analyst.
good,everything was just caoctic there.  I wasnt please with my experience there as well. but maybe it was just the location I was working at in memphis
good,Did not care for the shift that I had. Helped customers troubleshoot their DSL internet connection
good,positive work environment with a difficult work schedule.
good,Energized team for a productive day.  Managed all operations of the branch on a timely manner.
good,Its a customer service job so it has its pros and cons.. However i do enjoy helping out customers
good,It was busy in a warehouse environment.  There was a lot of standing during the shift.
good,"A typical day at an att call center consists of  a high level of inbound calls.  Mostly about billing and equipment questions. Every day is a  learning experience there, either something about equipment or just anecdotal from a customer.  I suppose the hardest part of the job is explaining a huge bill  to a parent who doesn't really understand the functions of smart phones and has given them to all their children. In turn the best part is letting them know how to stop whatever it is they need stopped and bringing the bill down to reasonable. Or perhaps  dealing with a customer who just refuses to help themselves by listening, I get their frustration but its impossible to help til they run out of steam. then again  it is quite a thrill to be able to give them the info to make good decisions to lower their cost or get the equipment they need or want."
good,This job is not for those who need stability because it is not a stable position that pays from week to week.  You have to put in work and keep the customers satisfied.  If you are looking for something part time and want to earn fast cash this is the job for you.
good,I enjoyed the job helping people is what i do best. I enjoyed being on the phones all day. I enjoyed the challenges it gave me when i troubled shot phones and took care of troubled callers. They kept me busy and on my toes. The Hardest part was the uncomfortable chairs .
good,"Nothing much to say, didn't stay with them long after they acquired the business from IBM"
good,"It is a company out of business"
good,A day at work consisted of speaking with various customers on the phone. Adding lines of service when appropriate and meeting sales goals for the company.
good,Sales driven company with excellent customer service provided.
good,"In this position was difficult call center was scattered and lot of tension, company really did not put forth the effort to help eliminate some of that  with company pros"
good,"I learned a lot at AT&T, but its definitely not a job you want if you have a family.  Like any retail position, most of your life is spent at work, although the trade off is that you make very good money.  There are options for advancement in the company, but retail sales consultants have the potential to make more money than most management positions.  The best part of the job was definitely the paychecks."
good,places and took orders made sure the restaurant stayed cleaned.
good,"Performs related duties as assigned or requested. Receives general supervision and is competent to work at a high level of all technical phases of data analysis. Requires a broad knowledge of data analysis/database design technologies and tools, excellent analytical ability, judgment and problem analysis techniques."
good,"At the time, the position of Business Care Manager was new and guidelines had yet to be established. The team was very good when I was there but was unable to provide adequate assistance to the sales force because of vague parameters and unreasonable sales promises."
good,Overall good compensation for work performed. High pressure sales focus and little to no flexibility.
good,"As a contractor for AT&T the past two  years, I have been able to work from my home office.  It has been nice. My co-workers also telecommute and are spread out across the country.  It has been an educational and enjoyable opportunity."
good,"very busy company, long hours. met interexting new people at every job."
good,A Good learning experience that taught me interpersonal skills.
good,Fun place to work..managers are always nice and willing to elp along with the other at&t staff
good,AT&T is downsizing and this is rough to go through. However I did meet some great people and learned even more than I already knew about customer service.
good,"It's a phone job with ""talk time"" that is graded."
good,"Unstable work place, and not family oriented.  They fire you for anything because they would rather you fail in training than keep you as a regular employee."
good,"Demands of job don't meet the pay. Retail alone means longer hours, however uncontrollable factors lead you to compromise more of your free time than one would ever intend to. "
good,Above average place to work.  Chain of command is very stacked leading to delayed decisions making.  Good experience though.
good,The new system of ATT has taken the 'family-feeling' from the working environment!
good,"Each day I would review emails and monitored the at&t workforce throughout the United States.  I learned change is a constant.  I learned how to teach other representatives to do what I did.  I learned different state laws in terms of work hours.  I enjoyed working with the same people for most of my time at AT&T and we became like family.  The hardest part of my job was advising other employees when they had made an error and confronting them.  The most enjoyable part of my job was helping my fellow employees find the policies that dictated how we processed emails.  If I could help others find a policy, we could avoid any errors being made."
good,"Bien, trabajaba en la calle en la pleatonal de quilmes centro o casa por casa,vendiamos promociones de direc tv"
good,"Benefits are great!"
good,My daily work consisted of inbound calls sometimes made outbound calls. Worked on small business to middle sized businesses to get customer s accounts current from past due.. Handled  a little help desk. We would get calls from customer sto or other departments to troubleshoot. We had to figure out if the customers issues were related to collections or if they needed service desk.
good,I love working with the Customers in the Southeast region. It shows just how alike we all are and our needs are basically the same; good friendly service is important. The Technical Side challenged me to tap in the knowledge we all possess and to assist the customers in the doing the same.
good,"Very interesting and dynamic industry.  A lot of smart and talented people but very political and ""good ol girls"" click.  Extremely difficult to make a difference, so if this is your motivation, look elsewhere."
good,"Typical day at AT&T:"
good,"Union shop."
good,excellent everything from benefits to job location and hours but i was going through the Recession
good,fun fun fun fun fun fun fun great place always had a blast at work and enjoyed it
good,"Managed a staff of 2 to 4 people and acted as a supervisor."

good,"•	Monitor children everyday activity."
good,"High caliber staff, typical multinational company; many employees; compensation was on market"
good,"sales rep , sell phones , complete contracts worked off commission and hourly"
good,I was not there long enough really to give a accurate review.  I was in training for 6 weeks or so and then I got a call for the job at the Health Dept.
good,"My co-workers were great, however the management changed so often that it was difficult to have a consistent work environment. The hardest part of the job was balancing a personal life. The hours were demanding and almost never allowed a personal life. The commission structure changed constantly, which resulted in lower pay some months, and also made it difficult to maintain a selling culture. The most enjoyable part of the job were the benefits and the team atmosphere between fellow sales consultants."
good,Nice place to work at. For freshers it is great place to start the career.
good,"AT&T is all about sales. That being said, if you are good at sales and like it, you will enjoy working for them."
good,Good salary and benefits.. needs more emphasis on people and not so much the profit.
good,"Answered all calls from headset, resolved cell phone issues."
good,"Great money, needs better staffing. Locations could be better."
good,"Typical Day:"
good,This company does not seem to be concerned with the work life balance of their employees.  Overtime is mandatory and often.
good,"a typical day at work would consisted of opening up the store, making sure it was clean to open, counting registers and counting money that was in safe."
good,over all a good place to work. constantly down sizing is a scare
good,a good company to work for but are changing and cutting commisions
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customer and issue resolution.
good,"I was working for Client AT&T thru vendor Tech Mahindra. I have learnt a lot as part of Technical as well as Management. MY management was always eager to listen to our complaints. "
good,they had us working way to many long days due to many installs scheduled and high demand.the employers were scrambling to keep up with the work load.i most enjoyed the freedoms that it afforded me as an installer and a quality control person it kept me busy and days went fast.
good,Fun place to work with great co workers.  The mobile market is beginning to get tapped out
good,"Inbound customer service calls. Assisted cardholders with managing their accounts. Handled large volume of calls daily. Used customer service skills to identify customers’ needs and also to be able to provide them with a prompt resolution. Navigated through various applications while speaking with cardholders. Resolve the customer’s inquiry at first point of contact, when possible."
good,Continued downsizing and outsourcing in the late 90's and 2000's impacted the ability of the teams to deliver.
good,"This was one of my first job out of high schools. Was able to develop a wealth of knowledge on the hotel industry as I worked both at the front desk, and in the accounts department."
good,"If you dont mind convoluted process and a 10-person approval chain, and if ""NO"" does not demotivate you, you will find your place here."
good,"I contracted at AT&T for almost 3 1/2 years as a quality engineer.  My days consisted of creating test cases from technical documents and executing test cases.  I also sat in on call meetings with developers, project managers, other QE teams, and 3rd party vendors.  Our job was to test the product at the specified AT&T certification level and then at the end of the testing either mark the product as AT&T certified software or not.  I enjoyed working with my team the most."
good,Great employees and lots of opportunities to move around. Always new technology to learn.
good,"Very nice place to work at, with great management very supportive and reachable, night shifts were good for me, Coworkers are like a family and benefits were matching to the work also gained lots of experience when it comes to customer service through long  and very professional training course."
good,I already spent ten or so minutes reviewing this company. Will not waste anymore time on this.
good,The most enjoyable part of my day was helping people with their needs. I loved the customers and the group I worked with. We always had exciting things going on to keep us upbeat and engaged in our customers needs. I wasn't fond of the push for sales and the fact that our jobs hung in the balance of if we met quota or not.
good,"Pre-AT&T company, Cricket Communications, was a great place to work with knowledgeable and dedicated employees. After acquisition you have the option to relocate to Atlanta or find a new job."
good,Stable job with good income potential. Union based company
good,"Well compensated for job, but several concessions were made, such as odd work hours, little family time"
good,good job love working with the costumers. have good benefits and good upper mangement
good,"All things being equal, job quality is highly dependent on management quality.  I have had great managers, excellent working conditions, appreciation and not so much.  If considering a position  be sure to interview the manager as to style, appreciation, if they allow telecommuting, transfers, etc. IT is in the habit of outsourcing and offshoring so be aware.   As a new entry into the working world, AT&T is a wonderful place to start a new career."
good,"On a typical day at work I took between 20 and 40 phone calls a day, the majority of which were customer calling in with concerns.  I worked night shift so there were extra challenges.  Customer service reps do not have their own desks.  I was scheduled to be on the phone at 3:40 but the previous reps do not leave until 3:30 so most days I had to wait on a desk.  This was especially frustrating because it takes about 5 minutes to log into everything and begin your day.  I learned to be more patient with people and that listening is much more revealing than talking a lot yourself.  It's the key to resolving people's issues the first time around so they don't have to call back.  The management at DTV is in general understanding.  They try very hard and do pretty good, considering the blistering pace that things change in that environment.  The only reason I stayed there as long as I did is because of the friendships I developed there.  There is a lot of diversity and never a dull moment where those people are concerned.  The hardest part of the job is that without your own space it's hard to feel very secure and also things change so quickly that you never feel like you know the job very well.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the technical troubleshooting I did to try and resolve issues.  It's nice to feel like a team with the customer and very rewarding when they appreciate your efforts."
good,"Great place to work, there comes a time where you have to move on for personal development."
good,assist customers with assorted needs ranging from connectivity or services
good,Good place to get call center experience but not a place you want to turn into a carrer.
good,"It was not my dream job by any sense of the word, especially since I do not enjoy talking on the phone but it is full time work with overtime, bonuses and good benefits available."
good,The greatest asset I learned is how to conduct and communicate effectively in a large company setting.
good,Enjoyed learning how to repair and condition phone lines and the school on pole climbing was excellent
good,"Very monotonous,Pays bills, takes calls, coaches,take more calls win some prizes and repeat"
good,Taking incoming calls for customer will connectivity issues with internet services. Learning how to network computers. Most enjoyable part of my job was resolving issues for customers.
good,"Had team meetings in the morning to discuss sales goals, productions and new products."
good,Okay work environment. Wanting to advance is biased. Reason for leaving is because after working for four years and wanting to get promoted to become a manager it just was not going to happen no matter how hard I tried. Biased culture
good,"Friendly people, nice environment, fair pay for responsibilities."
good,"I enjoyed working at AT&T, I learned alot and taught others during my employment.  They moved our entire building to MN so lost my job there."
good,I am currently a team manager with Alorica/AT&T vendor site. I manage a team of 12 to 15 people daily. I use coaching tactics to identify behaviors that drive metrics that matter such as first call resolution and average handle time. I am also responsible for schedule adherence and analyzing the quality of calls taken by employees. The hardest part of my current position would be working with negative employees that is not willing to put in the effort to turn the negative into positive. Being able to use coaching tactics and the knowledge that I have gained to develop employees to become successful in their position is the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,The little man gets forgotten. No opportunity for growth in the AT&T UVERSE world
good,good vibe good people never any issues must have great personality
good,"A typical day at work is being a satisfy the customer's needs."
good,very exciting. good work environment and good management. hard days labor produces little in monies though.
good,"* Learn basic troubleshooting and setup of AT&T routers. "
good,at&t will always do what is best for their customers and shareholders. Their products and services will continue to be innovative making it always easy to find solutions for our current and future customers.
good,"very long hours and I worked 6 days a week and couldn't claim overtime pay. I wasn't forced to do that by DirecTV, but by my field supervisor to ensure I would get installs and not service calls."
good,"•	Assisted with hardware and software issues related Blackberry, data cards and mobile devices."
good,I enjoyed working there people were great. I was taught alot of different things during my time there
good,good job wished it would have lasted longer.  Leaned a lot while I was there
good,"Decent job while it lasted. It was only a temp job. Iiked the people I worked with, taught me a lot about the business."
good,Great small company feel in a large organization!  This company was sold to Comcast.
good,I never felt a since of security with my job. The false expectations from management lead to bad morale.
good,"The job of a wire technician, consisted of  fulfilling the installation order of the the day. This typical took 10 - 12 at minimum. It involved contacting client, making necessary connections at Xbox, and connections from service pole or pedestal to clients home or business. Finally install all inside wires and device for the U-Verse product. Management was somewhat rough around edges, and co-workers seem to be stressed out and unhappy. The most difficult part of the job was the pressure to get out there on your with only a couple of weeks real world training.  Do to the demands of the job there was really no enjoyable part."
good,"Es una empresa que te deja trabajar de forma autónoma en busca de los objetivos que uno tiene asignados. En cuanto a lo que he aprendido, fue a manejar una gran cartera de proveedores, agencias, a hacer eventos y a cambiar la imagen de la marca en cuanto infraestructura de locales y oficinas. El ambiente es muy alegre y jovial. Lo más difícil de la empresa fue que al ser una compañia que creció demasiado rápido le falta desarrollar procesos en todas las áreas, lo cual hace que uno tenga que autogestionar todo y más de lo necesario para alcanzar a los objetivos impuestos por su jefe."
good,Retail sales and business to business sales. Developed individuals to become leaders for their individuals teams and families.
good,"Lots of new and exciting projects coming through the pipeline for mobile, web and tablet platforms. Learned a lot in my 7 months here. Very fast paced place to work. People are nice. The biggest con is the constant internal organizational changes."
good,I was a manager for 5 years.  I would not go back to work there ever.  You are only a number here.
good,"Loyalty, dedication and time will never play a role in the loyalty AT&T has regarding your employment status with them."
good,"A typical day would be opening the store at 9:30am on weekdays, setting up the cell phone and tablet displays, taking the till out of the security room, counting my draw and preparing to open the doors on time. "
good,"decent company to work for & learned new sales techniques"
good,"Not in business anymore, was good while I was there. Never had true upward mobility."
good,"My Dad retired from SWBell after 30 years and so did my Uncle."
good,Great learning experience. I learned about multiple computer systems and software.
good,"Good company, good pay, difficult to move up"
good,They are doing the best they can to try and recover lost print yellow pages revenue with internet advertising revenue.
good,AT&T has a relaxed atmosphere and gave a wonderful experience speaking to and assisting customers.
good,"I have spent 15 years as an employee at att.  I have had some wonderful jobs there, then i have had some not so wonderful jobs as well.  My typical day would be to work on the assignments that were given to me, attend meetings, if needed.  For the most part my co-workers have been pretty good throughout the years.  Then hardest part of the job was knowing sooner or later your were going to be outsourced and it was very hard, if at all, to get into an area other that IT.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the many friendships that were created during my time with att.  Also the teamwork that was demonstrated in many of my groups"
good,Cellphone sales industry. More of a dog eat dog sales environment. Hardest part was generating sales
good,"The pay was good..overtime was plentiful.  Benefits were good as well. "
good,"High turnover in call centers, Upper Management has favorites and those are the only ones who advance.  The compensation was good though so it just depends on your career goals."
good,"This job consisted of taking calls from on site technicians at cellular tower sites and reviewing scanned information with said techs over the phone to ensure the inventory of the site was complete.  Job was ok.  People you worked with were nice.  Pay was ok, but it was a temp job."
good,"Even though it was not difficult to assist the customers, for some reason it was harder to take yourself out of the customer's positions and things often became personal. Could of been that this was my first call center position, even though i no longer have that problem with other companies."
good,I was not there very long to give a great review. When I was there I made phone calls and set up customers for Direct TV.
good,Good place to work. Typical retail sales job. Nothing too special but nothing too bad.
good,Great opportunities to work in different areas of business.
good,"Overall, with my tenure at Convergys I have learned so much about customer service. Convergys had prepared me for any call center agency and its prerequisites that come with it. I have retained and mastered the nuances of customer service and would llike to provide my talent to another company that has  a little more ""professionalism"" exhibited on a day in and day out basis"
good,The call center is very relaxed and the employees are always looking to make the day enjoyable. A highly motivated sales environment.
good,Great benefits and salary was uncapped.  I have learned to be more compassionate towards others
good,It was a okay place to work. It usually is not the company itself it is the people for get to treat people like humans.
good,"It was okay, but I had to resign because after I went through the training program alot of the ""available"" jobs weren't so available"
good,"	Serviced and sold media product suite to existing and prospective new businesses for the aim of driving sales. Consulted with businesses to disclose pertinent information about the business itself, potential market issues, and current advertising campaign results.  Developed a customized approach to attract and retain internet media advertisers."
good,Selling AT&T products and services. Troubleshooting billing and device issues.
good,"Constantly learning new processes/procedures"
good,"sales"
good,"def good training, too many meetings for management.  not enough freedom"
good,"paid well good training, unioned. but the union didnt help me wwhen i needed it"
good,Great as a company to build a strong foundation.Learnt alot as a professional.
good,We had sales incentives here with a vigorous pace in work that could go up and down at a blink of an eye. We worked in an office full of other notable companies.
good,Ok place to work. Wouldn't really recommend it to people looking to move ahead
good,"The push new technologies on you, so it is nice to see the new gadgets before they actually hit the street."
good,A  normal day at work would be taking inbound calls dealing with customers from central usa over to california. While i was working at this job i was able to learn how to cross sell. Which i never done before. The hardest part of that  job was being able to deal with all types of customers from the good to the bad.thinking outside the box was kinda a must and being able to place yourself in the customer shoes. The management staff was good there but they lack product information as far as the co-workers there i had no problems with them a few there including myself was always willing to help out. I think the most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help the customer out and getting them to continue to the company service as well as telling other people about what they experience.
good,"Great company to work for,i was laid off and was not called back thats the only downfall."
good,"Very Corporate"
good,"find new customers, new sales and stand the whole period"
good,"Troubleshooting over the phone."
good,Retail location on your feet all day would try to sale to any customer that walked in.
good,"depending on the time of the year you will be busy from the time you clock in till the time you clock out. on slow days some managers make you do busy work like cleaning or restocking or ""roleplay"" sales with coworkers/management. does provide a good amount of on the job training however as long as you are willing to sit and go thru it. management varies, some of them actually seem to care and try to help and do nice things for their employees like throw parties or buy lunches or little things like that, however most it seems are too preoccupied with dealing with the flak they get from upper management unless your store happens to be perfect, even then the higher ups always want more. coworkers vary as well. one store i worked at, we all got along great, did things together outside of work and hung out, even met some coworkers family members. other stores however do not treat employees well and are very two faced and like to spread rumors and talk behind peoples back. kinda depends on the age of the store, if its mostly young it feels like high school again. worst part of the job were all the little things they would ding you on. i had gotten in trouble for not demoing certain products often enough even tho i still sold the required amount or more. for a person like me who is very interested in tech and how things work it definitely had its perks getting to play with all the new devices and learning things before they were made public...plus the pay was pretty good for not needing anything more than a hs diploma"
good,What I enjoy about this job is that from the minute I log on my computer in the morning I pick up job and go all day. I have 65 cell sites I maintain in Houston area.
good,"Answered calls in an inbound call center "
good,"They pay was great which is the reason most people stay, but many are very unhappy. It's rare that you get a good manager because most people are promoted for the wrong reason. I had a few managers that were absolutely great though. It's retail so the hours are always crazy which isn't too bad, but there are disciplinary meetings sometimes numerous times a week at 7 am making a work day 7am - 10pm. Working in retail has giving me a lot of insight on how to interact with people being that it was my first job."
good,I would hope to find employment just as knowledgeable and informative.
good,"C Levels are full of their agenda that is too lofty."
good,"The opportunites that could be obtained are there, and the pay is excellent, but everyone there is miserable."
good,after the merger with cingular and at&t they let alot of employees go to hire brand new reps instead of teaching at&t systems to the cingular employees.
good,Conduct reveiws for each agent to make sure that they were providing the customer's with the correct information and in a timely fashion. Meet with agents on a weekly basis to provide with feedback and coaching opportunities. Also met with management weekly. Hardest part of the job was giving an agent a low score and provided a feedback to them in healthy way. I enjoyed making people smile and delivering good results to the client.
good,"Answer inbound calls in regards to telecommunications: Phone, Internet, Cable. Also transition every call into a sales pitch. I learned how to gain people trust to listen to what I had to say over the phone. The hardest part of the job was sales, it didn't matter who it was or their situation you had to try to sell them something. I really enjoyed my co-workers here at AT&T, we had a nice time at work and the atmosphere was great."
good,"Like many of the major corporations there's some good and bad.  You can advance, develop and get great experience, but they treat you are just a tool and there's little time for your personal life.   Every 3 years there Strike training for managers and it's work that you can be very complicated and detailed.  You can't really prepare fully for the job.  Not many work stoppages over the years, but 1 year your training on the side for up to 150+ hours in addition to your regular job, then the next year you can't plan your vacations or time off anywhere around the strike time line.  They can call you back to work for the strike at any time.  Major inconvenience to life and family balance.  In the end the mid level managers ok, but Exec's director and above simple execute orders that can be extreme.   For the last 5-6 years they cut organizations in IT ruthlessly.    Co-worker very good in general.  Good people make the job most of the time."
good,"Loved projects and coworkers, gained valuable digital experience, but AT&T decided to dissolve the digital ad company and only kept TV.  Unfortunate decision which impacted many smart people."
good,"Retail operations "
good,"Es una empresa dedicada la venta de servicios, con una marcada orientacion al cumplimiento de objetivos, en mi caso en un principio tenia a cargo 2 camionetas con 8 vendedores y coordinada ventas de teereno, luego creci me capacite, y empece a la seleccion de personal de ventas y capacitacion, ahora tengo a cargo 9 stand con un total de 20 vendedores. Lo que mas me agrada del trabajo es la relacion con los vendedores tratando de armonizar entre sus problemas y los objetivos de la empresa."
good,"what can be said about selling pagers? nothing, the company went out of business."
good,"I enjoyed my job, but the quotas were unreasonable and difficult at times to meet.  Typical day would be 8 hours.  I was responsible for selling wireless and wireline products and accessories, as well as providing billing and customer service support."
good,"Great company for job stability, skill set and career advancement."
good,Nothing to comment. I like to work with everyone and I do get a long with everyone in the team.
good,Good work environment.New things to learn. Very good colleagues.
good,not long enough on the job because they shut down the store I was in
good,my co workers helped each other and learning the new material was fun and management came ever so often with different events to keep there employees happy
good,"assist customers with cell phone accounts, enjoyable work environment"
good,It was alright. The days were long and I had to sit for a long time between breaks and lunch. I
good,"AT&T is a wonderful company and I was most fortunate enough to be part of their customer service team. Multi-tasking is a requirement to succeed in this environment. "
good,"face to face sales in walmart stors, build customer service skills managment was gread, not enough monry it was only commission, the co workers were great they are the best part of the company"
good,Sad to see the location reduce in population on quarterly basis due to market pressure.
good,"the last job I had was more rewarding because I worked for a 2nd level manager and had 6 1st level managers that I helped. including the employees. Did various duties from copying , printing ,typing, spreadsheets, excel , paying bills, and anything that I could do to help the managers, the hardest part of my job was when 2 or more people needed something at the same time and I would have to make sure they knew I would be there to help them asap. however that was not always the case because my first duty was to the 2nd level manager. I had wonderful co-workers and most tried to help each other. Management was different. in the past they helped  employees and they cared  but the new managers now don't have a clue how to manage people. the most enjoyable part of my job was that at the end of the day I knew I gave the company 100 % and most of the time more. I took pride in any job I did."
good,I love the experience that i received in sales and understanding different customer needs in what satisfies them.
good,"You needed to process the emails related to projects you were assigned on. To manage the calls with the customer, to double check the status of the implementation of the service."
good,"Typical days at work were answering phone calls from upset customers who had issues with DirecTV services. Issues ranged from loss of services due to none payment of the bill, to requesting new equipment."
good,this job isnt for the week its hard but the compensation shows how much work you put in
good,This place was closed down. One of my first jobs out of High School.
good,Trabajar en el salon con distintas personas.Aprendi el sistema de antenas mis colegas eran responsables la parte mas dificil era que mi sueldo dependia de lo vendido
good,"Selling home solutions, and mobile device solutions. I learned customer service and how the industry works. Management was self focused and was looking to stay within the store. The people I worked with were amazing people. The hardest part of the position was they had no incentive to help you move laterally and never talked about it. The most enjoyable part of the job were the daily changes, and employees I worked with"
good,"Co-worker are great. However, you must meet quota and pressures from management. If you enjoy sales with good compensation, you would enjoy this job."
good,"It was hourly pay for me and your workloads were based on the volume of calls coming in. There are metrics they want you to hit, such as call time, and they can be meticulous with how you are suppose to end calls. Ex: If you fixed three problems with one phone call, at the end of the conversation you have to list all the problems and how you solved them to the customer you have been speaking with. It can be quite silly at times."
good,"n/a"
good,"One of the largest Company in USA. AT&T has a T-University."
good,"Learned more about Customer Service"
good,"Worked with the Best Manager and team these last 6 years. When you work well as a team and there is good management leadership, your team will always be number 1."
good,"Fast paced environment, working with customers and helping rectify their needs.  Schedule changed from week to week, sometimes day to day depending on quotas of calls coming in."
good,"I use to work 7 days a week.  Very physical job, and the hours were long"
good,"Great job for young, driven salespeople who enjoy technology. "
good,I worked from home in the rural towns. I loved the job and had the a great time while I was employed with them.
good,"Issuing Complex orders for AT&T corporate customers."
good,I spend my day prospecting for new sales and answering calls from customers.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working remotely and independently and meeting lots of people.
good,"A decent place to work if you are not too ambitious - not many avenues to grow; most oportunities are in Dallas, TX. Some people have been here for 30-40 years which is presumably for the benefits. Management seems to not want to promote anyone."
good,Nice place to work.I do not wish to share any information.Nice company to work...
good,The expectation is to be on calll 24/7 regardless of it's your day off
good,"Don't expect to be able to retire from AT&T if you work at a call center (that's pretty much any call center these days too). It's not that they are going broke, just check the executive compansation going up year after year while the starting wages drop year after year, followed by outsourcing call centers to put added pressure on the lowest paid employees in the company to give up more pay and benefits."
good,"I enjoyed staying up to date with current technology, cell phones, computers etc."
good,"answer calls, solve problems. resolving technical issues is our priority."
good,the crew and I worked great together and I learned alot.  I liked working with the customers too
good,"I learned the ""Time Management"" is the key to success. Proper time assessment when on a call is both productive and efficient."
good,"I worked at AT&T for close to five years.Compared to most call centers pay and benefits are great. Days consisted of back to back calls assisting customers with billing inquires, service outages, product questions etc. Most managers I worked with at the company are great and the ones that weren't are no longer there. "
good,worked about 60 miles from home - good money until you figured in the drive time.  Office closed & moved farther away.
good,"I left this place on Xanax and therapy, the managers were mistreated and overworked.  You were in a selling environment and you had to produce results. If you did not you were reprimanded and scorned.  Made to feel like a child."
good,"I learned how to deal with people more, how to treat and express myself to other."
good,There is limited space to grow in the company and you can rely on have a stable career in that environment.
good,"a typical day consisted of about 2 hrs meeting in the morning then 8 to 10 hrs on the floor providing customer service while trying to educate people on the benefits and superiority of DirecTV and hopefully sign them up. The worst part was the long hours standing and walking 6 days a week, wednesday, being the only day off. My co-wokers were fairly respectable people but many came and went, lacking the drive to persevere."
good,"learned how too work with customers"
good,"Start day with a conference call, listen to customer complaints"
good,Self management  gave me more responsibility I learned to work directly with customers I also learned inventory and time management .My coworkers were great always available to assist the hardest part of the job was the communication during job closeouts our dispatch were from the phillipines language issues the most enjoyable part was being able to feel important and to have a company give me the responsibility and ability to utilise my skills to benefit us both
good,I was a contractor there so I didn't get a good feel of the actual work place
good,Professional company with comfortable work conditions. Allows room for professional growth. Great benefits and hours.
good,I'll keep this review short since I am still employed by AT&T. They have great pay and benefits
good,"Went from being a great place to be, to you don't want to be there."

good,"Demanding work environment. Clients have high expectations as they should given the amount of money they spend but, often take their frustration for the company out on you in the most rude ways from time to time. However, the clients overall are the most enjoyable part of the job. Management is often unprofessional. The benefits are not as great with the current state of the economy but, overall still better than most benefit packages."
good,"Managers were great, helped out a lot. commission was great, hourly was nice, benefits were a little high for part-time, was hard to meet goals being part time. Full time hours led to meeting quota each month."
good,"First off, I was hired as a contractor. There are 4500 employees in the area of the business that I worked, and 3900 of those are contractors. 1) It is made very clear who is a contractor and who isn't, 2) It is very unusual for a contractor to advance, 3) Contractors have a 3-year limit in their time at at AT&T no matter how great a job you do or how badly you are needed in the company. 4) AT&T does not value contractors."

good,"It was a great start to my sales career, but was not a place I enjoyed working."
good,Typical hours 8 to 5 but longer hours needed when proposals and follow up are needed.  I have learned out to navigate the culture and work through traditional barriers to succeed in this challenging environment.  My co-workers are very nice and helpful and work to achieve a common goal.

Then I prepare my station by logging in to all systems and going over shift huddle notes from the day before, management takes the time to show appreciation to the employees and the achievements they have obtain during the previous shift. Next I would set my goals for the day and begin taking calls.The hardest part of the job is not taking it home with me.

good,"great facility, lunch provided. learned a lot about hotel management, catering, events and the restaurant."
good,My experience at at&t was underwhelming to say the least. There's an extreme lack of a team feel with direct correlation from my team lead. I don't fit into this corporate bureaucracy of work space. 
good,"I worked as an Installer and a Service Technician. Although much of the work was done on your own at the customers home, there was need to be a team player when helping other technicians with jobs or troubleshooting issues."
good,It was fun at time then others it was not. I enjoyed the technical side of the work and dislike the custumer service portion
good,"The customer experience is the most important part of each work day, fostering an environment of collaboration and technology based solutions.  I learned to be cross-functional, customer focused, a SME and motivated to pass along such traits through leadership and mentoring.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the entire experience of working for such a large public company."
good,It's a busy work environment. Management was great. The most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with the customers

I then moved on to becoming a SME, in new the collections system being designed, finally becoming the Lead Analyst and Data Source for the application. This allowed me to make headway in NJ, at the Corporate level. I worked in a management role for 3 years but was actually an occupational employee.

In 1996 (following the first VRIP offering and mass exodus of Analysts and Developers), I was promoted again and given a relocation package to NJ, to take over the development and maintenance of the collections app, we had designed and were maintaining.

good,"Aprendi mucho del trabajo en grupo, la actividad que realizabamos era venta directa al publico."
good,It was a very competitive place to work. Somethings were fair and some where not but that comes along with any job. I would still be there if it were not for the lay offs 
good,"retail sales, standing all day, good benefits, dealing with the general public can be stressful at times "
good,"This was a union based call center environment.  I really liked all the people I worked with, but I was not able to effectively utilize the skills I learned in college.  If you had low or no seniority you received the schedule the more senior employees did not want. You were not able to choose your vacation times until the more senior employees had chosen their vacation slots first."

The typical day would consist of answering numerous phone calls from customers answering questions ranging from billing and technical issues to service questions and equipment inquiries. "

good,A typical day would be logging in to my phone and system and take calls all day troubleshooting DSL connection issues. I learned how to navigate their systems to do what I needed. Management was ok my only complaint would be the lunch hours were scheduled for us. The hardest part of my job here was training because I knew a lot of the stuff and it was hard to keep my interest most days and following the charts to fix an issue when I already knew what the issue was at times.
good,"Busy busy industry! Representatives work long hours and for some it's challenging to meet monthly quotas. If you are sales-driven, this is the type of company you want to work for. If you are looking for work-life balance and flexibility... look for other employers."

Hardest part of the job is learning every product on the market and recommending the best one for each customer's needs."
good,It's a good job if your looking to make money (commisson) in retail. Work life balance doesn't really come into play unless you have senority and have more say with your schedule. Work experience changes dramically depend on your maganement team.

good,Helping out Customers with payments and questions always learned something new.
good,This is what made me decide I wanted to go to college and not work jobs such as this the rest of my life.

good,"Great People, Work, Management and Location, Great Pay...."
good,Handed escalated calls from customers.
good,"At DIRECTV, I've had the opportunity to work in a couple of different groups. A strong work ethic is absolutely required. Each area within the company has different values; it is important to be able to adapt to your department's specific management style. Some areas value attention to detail and perfectionism more so than other departments, where the focus is on speed. I would definitely recommend DIRECTV to folks that have a high level of self-motivation and an ability to collaborate well with others. There is opportunity for growth both up the corporate ladder and personally/professionally, as the company will invest in employees."
good,With the company being so large there are positives and negatives.

good,Directv is a good company to work for. The management was really nice.
good,"Decent place, good management, typical retail environment."
good,Start in the morning and take calls all day. Mgmt is very hands on w/your developement. Hardest part is the non stop calls coming in. Most enjoyable was the company of your co-workes.
good,"I worked Mon thru Saturday with one day off during the week and every Saturday. Schedules differed weekly. Management was okay, but there were no further advancements available above supervisor. The easiest part of the job was satisfying customer needs."
good,I have worked at Directv for a long time. It is a stressful job having to meet whatever requirements they deem to be important for that particular month.
good,"My part time and full time position at AT&T was sometimes fun. Working as a manger there was nothing but training, conference calls, and the always ""Sell More""."
good,Helping customers in a retail environment with the purches of cellular devices and accessories.
good,While working for at&t I have met some very interesting customers.
good,"Fast pace workplace, solving customer problems, assisting customers understanding products and pricing."

good,"Era bueno trabajar con el grupo, pero el tiempo era mucho y el dinero muy poco, por algo duré muy poco ahí."
good,AT&T is an excellent fit for the employee who wants to follow strict rules and deal with constant change.
good,Good employer with union scale pay and benefits; wasnt the type of work I was interested in doing.
good,"AT&T was very different, a union environment. Most important thing to them was to punch in on time (can't even be a few seconds late)."
good,it use to be a cool place to be at but as time went by it just isn't that cool and management is okay.
good,The day to day experience was that I took incoming calls from Business customers
good,"Good company to work at, in spite of the long hours and all-weather necessity."
good,love my co-workers but the contract between union and the company to have the lay off every quarter is just too much to handle.
good,It was a busy environment and challenging with goals to be reached.
good,"If you like a challenge, this is the place to work. However there is no job security so you might want to think twice about working here. Outside of that the benefits are great, co-workers are like family, even most managers are awesome to work with."
good,For many decades the AT&T brand relied on the phone book to be their money maker. Times have drastically changed and everyone under the age of 30 doesnt even know what a phone book is. So AT&T is letting employees go at the speed of light
good,Working at DirecTV is a great experience!
good,"The working environment was not a friendly one, it was far from home."
good,"Take calls seven and a half hours a day, sometimes non stop. Working their taught me patience and understanding. Most of the management will help and assist you and your co-workers are always there for support. Hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers, but once you are successful in helpinig them you feel a sense of accomplishment"
good,"Taking and handling calls, mostly billing inquiries. Management skills were very poor, promotions were not based on performance. I did meat some nice people while working here"
good,"Great benefits, pay, and I made some life-long friends here."
good,"Working for ATT wireless was fast passed, never boring, and at times overwhelming however fullfilling at the same time. Each customer offered a different challenge but new experience. 11 years working with the company I had seen many co-workers and management come and go.The hardest part of my position in sales was meeting the quotas set forth by the company, while trying to meet customer service issues and other basic non commissionable customer needs."
good,Highest peak of professionalism in most cases. Enjoyed the fast-pace and learned something new everyday. Stress from quotas and high pressure sales tactics became increasingly unmanageable as a career choice but all-in-all a very positive long-term experience.
good,"Working for AT&T Advertising Solutions indeed has it's challenging times---as with any position dealing with the public. However, this position has allowed me to grow even more as a claims negotiator and a customer service professional."
good,I worked my way up from the phones to a good department. But then AT&T moved the program overseas.
good,"Eight hour work days. 40+ hours a week. I learned how to troubleshoot phones, marketing ways to sale and what words to use to make it good. My co-workers were awesome. We always had so much fun working together. The hardest part about the job was trying to make my sales pitch to people who were cancelling because they were dying or someone pasted away in their family and they wanted something recovered but you couldn't do it. Along with the hard part of selling, actually getting people to listen to what you had to say and how it would help them when they were yelling at you and calling you names. The most enjoyable part of working for Convergys was just the all around excitement when someone in your team or another team sold U-verse. Every team had their own ways of celebrating a sale."
good,es una empresa reconocida en el mercado lo q la hace atractiva trabajar en ella
good,Lots of fun until they spent all the $5.1B and couldn't pay it back
good,If you have the mind and the suave for it then sales is a lot of fun. Meeting a lot of different people and assisting them with their communication needs is great. The hardest part of the job is when team-selling doesn't go the way you want it to because a coworker move to your groove.
good,"I enjoyed my earlier years more than my latter. I wish they, as well as other large companies like them, would return to their core values; customer service above all else."
good,"I talk on the phone daily, help customers with new purchased and billing, I also strive to reach a daily personal goal and a mandantory monthly goal."
good,Excellent training in the organization. Highly committed to the professional and personal development of associates.
good,"I learned how to use outlook, excel, and how to be a better customer service rep. My Co-workers were like family. The hardest part of my job was the mandatory overtime during the iPhone launches."
good,This would be a job for an individual looking for work for the first time.
good,I learned a great deal of ATT processes. I managed three LTE projects that split into five projects. I worked long days and nights. No work life balance.
good,The day begins and ends without knowing where the time went.
good,"A typical day is normally eight hours, but that can be changed at a whim depending on your manager. I did learn some great customer service skills that I will use throughout my future careers. Management just depends on the person, some are great and will help you in any way they can. Other managers will stab you in the back and throw you under the bus at the blink of an eye. Co-workers can be great team players, but also be sharks waiting to steal sales out form underneath you. It depends on the store and how well everyone gets along. The hardest part of the job would be the constant hovering by higher management for you to be perfect. It can be deflating to have a good sale with a a customer only to be told you weren't good enough and could do better. The most enjoyable part would be the relationships that you get when you work with a great team."
good,Provide support for for Network Field Operations.
good,No full time employment available. Company seems only interested in contract employment.
good,"Very stressful and high pressure work environment. Our small IT area was managed by someone who was completely illiterate when it came to IT and PC's, he was a former choir director with a masters in music"
good,it is a ok job. good money. Definetly can make money at this job. good hours to work
good,Fun coworkers
good,Great job to work for. Very good. everyone that you work with and for for wonderful people.
good,"Work was fast pace with not a lot of support, managers were hardly ever available, learn to work on my own with decision making. Co workers were great we were all going thru the same things so we were close and helped each other. Not having any managment support, leaving work was the greatest part of the day."
good,meet new people eavery day. learn new attitudes management very supportive co-workers are like family good support group in the field. hardest part of the job going into small crowl spaces. getting done with an install and seeing the coustomer happy.
good,management didn't know how to increase morale in the office and it began to be management vs reps.
good,I worked mainly as an account rep for large business customers and in escalations and appeals.
good,"A daily work requirement will place the customer sales rep with customers wanting to pay their cell phone bill, seek adjustments to their bill, arrange payments for later dates, change service features, add an addition line of service, upgrade device, or cancel service. Additional services could lead to selling cable *U-verse"", high speed or DSL internet service, and land line service. Purchase of such services could be bundled with their current cell phone service as well."
good,"I have been a U-Verse technician for two years. The job has changed drastically in two years and will keep changing for years to come. It is a good job for younger people, especially those without families and an education to worry about, as long as they understand that it is only a stepping stone and NOT a 'career job.'"
good,It was a good job but the stress of calling centers took a toll on me in a few months. I learned excellent customer service skills but the hardest part of my job was staying calm when a customer was upset over the phone.
good,"Installation and maintenance of AT&T products. A typical day at work is meeting new customers, installation and maintenance of AT& T infrastructure. Providing AT&T customer with the best service and support."
good,"Buena empresa, en proceso de transformación cultural."
good,An extremely challenging job with good benefits and excellent training. I have had the opportunity to become an expert in internet sales and print advertisng.
good,"Many co workers promoted based on realtionships with management. Good solid company for regular work, not a great place for advancement."
good,"Calls for billing, technical support and sales. Hard with economy being so low and us having goals everymonth that we have to meet. not they went to Colombia for the same job positions and they just sell with lies and we get those upset customers.,"
good,"The average customer is fairly friendly, but some clients are expecting greater service than At&t can provide."
good,I supported internal & external customers with security issues and questions. I learned to be empathy to the customers issues. As co-workers we worked as a team to assist one another. The hardest part of my job was when the customers reached our helpdesk by mistake and we didn't support the issue they were calling about and trying to get them to understand it should go to another helpdesk. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to assist the internal or external customer with their issue.
good,very productive and very good company to work and great co-workers
good,"Interesting company to work for, majority of the people were friendly. Pay & benefits are good, 401k opportunity nice to have. Overall good life time experience for me."
good,Refined my installation and troubleshooting skills of telco products
good,"This was my first job, and unfortunately I don't think I was very prepared for it. I was thrown into a fast-paced environment where I needed to know everything quickly and I became overwhelmed."
good,"AT&T at the time that I worked there was not a bad place to work; however, it wasn't a great place to work either. Pay was pretty good for the job I was doing. The management was either not equipped to do the job, not competent, or lazy; I can't say for certainty which is the correct answer."
good,"typical day was arrive at work early and check email, a morning meeting. day planning and phone calls for appointments, going on appointments . the hardest part of the Job was the culture was not good between management and the sales employees. The most enjoyable was the sales commissions."
good,Overall good place and company to work for. at&t offers great benefits and very competitve wages.
good,"talking on the phones, greeting people, talking on the phone with new clients"
good,Must be able to navigate through various systems and show excellent customer service. Every work day is a challenge to do better and provide customer satisfaction. Management is there for support and clarification on certain situations. The hardest part of the job is having a customer ask you a question and you not know the answer to the customer question.The most enjoyable part is being able to work over time and also being able to meet different people.
good,My day normally begins with greeting customers and to help meet their needs. About new share plans. Somewhat postive. Fully prepared to work and be postive. A calculated amount of downtime. Meeting new people and helping others.
good,"Great benefits, horrible schedules. Lots of peers and employees to work ith. Extremely fast paced environment. Limitied advancement opportunities."
good,Good place to work.
good,A typical day at work is go in and get the job done.T he most enjoyable part of the job is getting Paid & Going home to Rest.
good,"I assist persons who have a hearing or speech loss to communicated on the telephone. When our tour begins we log onto a computer and handle the next available caller as they call into our office. We handle various call situations, those who are completely deaf, some can speak but can't hear, others can hear but can't speak. Our customers make personal calls as well as business related calls, and at times even emergency calls. Some communicate very clearly and others speak with heavy ASL and may at times be difficult to understand what they are trying to say."
good,"Work was fun, talked with alot of customers and made there experience fun. Co workers were really friendly."
good,It is a great place to work nice people but not family friendly place to work.
good,"i love the job just wish it had better hours, the work place is nice and so are the people"
good,"A day at work, like any other responsible company."
good,A typical day at the office is conference calls all day and working on project solutions. Dealing with other departments telling you they do not handle that and to call another number to finally end up after 3-5 different numbers with the initial department called from the start. Sitting at a desk all day on the phone with two monitors in front of you multitasking.
good,A typical day at work at att your on the phone the whole time except your break so its a little getting used to. I learned how to handle customers over the phone and be able to express and sale over the phone.
good,There are a lot of opportunities for work but it's very bureaucratic in getting things pushed through that you do not have direct control over. Co-workers are a good bunch of people but the tools at your disposal are not the best. A lot of this is currently changing so I don't know how true this will be in a year from now.
good,"I had a short 3 months contract with AT&T,typical day of work was a lot of phone calls and meetings."
good,Great Place to work if you are desperate for a job. I enjoyed my co workers. I didnt enjoy being forced into doing certain things.
good,Growing business enviroment with new technology always coming to the concumers.
good,"A typical day at work involved installing or repairing 3 to 4 sites. This would include using ladders, installation tools, attics, roof tops, driving, involvement with customer service, billing or tech support."
good,At&t was typical call center environment. Although the work was not hard it was hard to accomplish the goal of making sure the customer was taken care and problem solved in a time frame selected by management.
good,"A lot of phone calls, you have to be good a sales, very fun environment"
good,"It was a very interesting job being able to watch people supposedly doing their jobs. Most of the time there was more goofing off than actual work getting done.It actually was a fun place to work,espcially when the employees knew they were being watched and still did some really stupid things.My co-workers were great people to work with.Also my supervisor was the best.The hardest part of the job was trying to watch 11 stores at one time."
good,"Long days, strict guidelines and standards which must be met and not a lot of time to do them. Very demanding job."
good,"Airlink is the Authorized Retailer I work for and is an ok company, but there just isn't any room to advance within the company. I have been a sales manager here for three years and there is only one postions above me and has been filled by the same person for the past ten years. I am looking for a job where i will have more room to grow. I have actually been with the company going on six years and have been running the location in Florissant for the past three. I oversee all of the day to day operations for the store and am responsible for making sure the store continues to hit all of the provided goals. I have six employees that I oversee and have to keep motivated to both sell and achieve excellent customer service with each and every customer."
good,"Its all about Sell, Sell, Sell!!! They are a very competitive company."
good,"Excellent sary compensation, however, downsizing every few months was extremely stressful."
good,"Helped 50+ customers a day to resolve cable, internet, email and phone issues, using a total of 8+ different programs to achieve resolution"
good,assembly line / timed / numbers driven approach to all tasks. paid well though.
good,"Between getting to know your customer in their home and the daily challenges, you never have the same day twice. Most of my co-workers helped each other. Techs had a team mentality. The biggest downfall is that the managers did not know that much about the product."
good,"The days at the company were fast paced, high- energy filled with people all around helping customers solve their many issues, or just helping them understand their products and services, this workplace offered excellent benefits, and competitive pay"
good,Very busy work environment. Learned a lot about different types of footwear and sportswear. Management was always very helpful and co-workers always worked as a team. hardest part of job was conversing with some customers because it was located in an area with a lot of tourism. Most enjoyable part was meeting new people from all over the world.
good,A typical workday would be dealing with customers helping them trouble shoot the by
good,"DirecTV had a lot of cases brought against them for non-disclosure issues. As a result, I took multiple complaint calls. In most cases the customer got off the phone happier than when they got on the phone. However, the amount of negative complaints were overwhelming at times. Since then, the company has hired 3rd party teams to makes sure that all information regarding contracts are properly disclosed and the call is recorded."
good,Assist will most to all issues centered around an Business End User mobile phones and accounts.
good,"office work in a cubical, not much socializing,"
good,A day at Directv was always something unexpecting but fun at the same time. There was something different we learned everyday about customer service and productivity to make the company better. I loved my co-workers. They were the ones who made the day go well and calm. There really wasnt a hard part of the job besides the rules changing more each day. But the environment of the work place was always exciting.
good,Achieved above and beyond monthly sales quotas. Satisfied sales requirements while building rapport with customers to fulfill their needs. Highest in team for accessories add on sales and lowest for Buyer’s remorse cancelations...
good,"A typical day as a manager begins at 7am with a conference call with the other managers in the area. After the call, we begin our daily routines of approving time, checking tech performance from the day before, and dealing with the day to day problems that may have come up."
good,"answering calls from customers to transfer phone numbers from another carrier, scheduling meetings,vacation sick days, working with other management to schedule training"
good,"A difficult place to do a good job because of constant layoff worries, which were warranted. Age and experience not recognized. I loved my job programming Finance and HR reports, specializing in tax applications. I learned to watch my back."
good,review and analyze results
good,definitively sour after you put so much time in something. This company is good to work for if you don't like your boss or someone higher up doesn't like you they will find a way to get rid of you. benefits are greats. best company to work for in pueblo currently though.
good,"Good sales environment for a sales driven person. I learned that a sales job and a customer service job are completely different.The hardest part of the job for me was getting information from some customers. Sometimes they would want us to just answer all their questions, but we had no type of information from them in order to give them any accurate answers. The most enjoyable part was learning a lot about myself and also working with great people."
good,I worked 20 - 30 hours a week.
good,Has great benefits but not a strong possibility of career advancement within sales departments
good,answering questions about at&t products and services...providing customers with services that could enhance there overall living experince
good,My co-workers was very diversed and a pleasure to work with. Management was ok but not well organized
good,My day was very busy all the time. I learned a lot about the engineering enviornment and how to project manage.
good,This job was mainly me installing and repairing DirecTV satellite dishes. The hardest part of the job was the sweltering heat and extreme cold of working 95 percent outdoors. The thing that I most enjoyed in this job was the technology that I got to experience before most other people.
good,"I worked for a Contractor (Collabra, Inc) and we were told that the employment would be for 3 years. After 6 weeks, ATT moved the job to Witchta Falls, TX. Confirmed field techs works when installing U-Verse."
good,Typical. Could be better. I wish my employers had a discussion with the employees and gave the right work to the right people.
good,Solid organization to work for! Competitive benefits package.
good,It was a wonderful environment to work in. I enjoyed assisting clients with all of their sales needs. I worked internal as well as external.
good,Big Compensation cut. corporate job. lot of drama and negativity. its not what it used to be.
good,"It was a good job but at&t caused alot of stress. Callers were always angry when they called and no matter what you did, could not calm them down."
good,"The call volume could be high or low at time. But helping custmore with there bills make time go by fast. My co-worker can be okay at time. The hardest part about my job was the equipment was out of date, made work chanlleging to hear custmores"
good,"I receive my work orders via internet. Schedule job w/customers. Cover Greenville, Spartanburg, and Cherokee county territories. Manage warehouse on my property for other locations also."
good,I had no problems with this company I work there a short time due to the fact i had to move out of the city.
good,"Good pay with great benefits. Fast paced, hands on training."
good,"moinitor air pressure system,repair cable lines and air pressure lines"
good,When I started working there in 2000 I really enjoyed the job. We use to receive annual bonuses. The management seem to really care about the employees. I really enjoyed the people I worked with. The hardest part was dealing with irate customers. I enjoyed working with team members.
good,"Provide financial advice to customers and promoting products to help keep customers financially stable ( certificate of deposit, savings account overdraft protection etc)."
good,My day consisted of inbound and out bound calls. Dealt with customer with phone issues. Resolved and did troubleshooting with customers to resolve there telephone issues.
good,"A typical day at work is to answer calls from customers who would inquire about programming packages, billing, and technical issues. As needed we would be required to persuade customers to stay with the company. I learned how to use many programs and how to multitask. Management worked with the employees and helped with any issues that would not be easy to resolve. The co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is the constant demand of free programming and equipment without lease agreements. The most enjoyable part of the job is the perks that come with the job and the customers."
good,"perform duties relating to long distance calls for customers. Billing, credit..ship to shore..toll station calls."
good,"Room for adavancement, locations through out the country, fair salary"
good,Demands of the company are difficult on Premises Technicians. The tech has to interface with several different systems to perform the job at hand while installing or repairing the product that the customer has. I have expanded my already vast knowledge of Telecommunications while at the company. The Management could be more understanding with the conditions which the Techs have to perform the job in. My co-workers were great and easy to get along with. The most difficult part of the job is trying to meet the companies performance numbers. The best part of the job was seeing a happy customer that loved the install or repair and the service.
good,"Understaffed/overworked...typical environment. Otherwise, a very challenging experience. Promoted to Linux Resource mgr. Only contractor to be promoted to this role from a team of 15. Lot's of teams(moving parts) involved & many applications supported thru -out AT&T's many datacenters in the US. I stay very busy and that I like being known to do more work than the average."
good,Highly diverse and interestly entertaining employer. Recently incorporated a sale culture and partner with other providers (i.e telephone companys)
good,"this call center is no longer in OK. the new company is AT&T, so you will have to apply directly to AT&T."
good,"Daily, as part of the Customer Retention Group, I would handle anything from saving customers from disconnecting service, remote activation of DTV products, processing new equipment orders, billing, upgrading service and equipment, disconnection of service and sending out technicians to trouble-shoot or do new service installations. I enjoy multitasking and this job brought out the best in my abilities."
good,I feel as this company does not value its employees as much as other companies.
good,great place to work. new challenges. growing company. Was a long time ago for me
good,In this job I was responsible for ensuring each and every call that I took was resolved with the first call. I learned how to work in an extremely fast paced work environment.
good,A typical day at work is productive and exciting. You learn many things about customer service.
good,"Good for people who need a steady schedule, benefits were good, promotions were often and could lead to different areas in the company. Paid minimum but the tips were good."
good,"ok place to work at, happy for the experience. it is time to move on."
good,AT&T is a company where upward mobility is a great possibility.
good,small market with lots of money made it easy to move product.
good,AT&T is a great place to work. A day at work is sitting at my cubical on the phone assisting customers with their accounts. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you get a customer that thanks you for resolving their issue and not fussing. The hardest part of the job is to have stay on the phone when the customer constantly and repeatedly downs and degrades you as an employee as you are trying to fix their account.
good,"I loved my job, but not the level of management above the sales reps."
good,great place to work but no job security would reccommend to college student or as contract work lost value of customer over the years
good,"AT&T is a leading telecommunication Company dealing with many devices like cell phones, wireless, U-verse, digital TV, high speed internet and many more. As a tester I worked Remotely on a web based application""Mobile Pay""."
good,"Busy and innovative work environment, but many rewards. Exposure to new wireless products."
good,"I have never worked for a company that has no benefits, incentives, or bonuses. It's not ATT as a company contracted through Alorica. The worse ever. In much need of a better stable position."
good,"Educated customers about their directv billing, took payments,"
good,AT&T has excellent compensation and benefits but with all the acquisitions and mergers job security and career advancement is almost nonexistent.
good,"I enjoyed working as a customer service rep at at&t, My job was to fix members issues they were having on Tv, Computer and or phone i troubleshooted and got members issue resolved."
good,There was never a dull moment while working for this company. Managers were professional and up to date on current job related issues.
good,"There is a cafeteria and a gym on location, typical call center job"
good,Directv consistently changes your schedule every 3-6 months so it allows a lot of optional variety.
good,Great place to work and good pay if you are a good sales person
good,Excellent benefits and growth opportunities for self starters
good,Stable company with excellent benefits. Great opportunities for self starter
good,It was a team atmosphere. We all helped each other on all circuits.
good,Working at AT&T for over a year and a half was a pretty good
good,"Not bad for a call center. The advancements offered are not personal advancements but rather just the next step that everyone takes. Heavy push for quantity and minimal credit issuance, even when the billing system is incorrect. Make call time exceptions on occasion but give the impression that you've always got someone looking over your shoulder."
good,"A high volume, high pressure sales environment for the strong."
good,"Build and design Ethernet paths/circuits in Granite, upgrading their network to 4G"
good,"This place is constantly changing, and it's hard to keep up."
good,A very friendly place to work. You feel as though you accomplished something at the end of the day and look forward to the next day. Very close and tight working environments and departments.
good,i liked what i did and the people i worked with. liked working outdoors.
good,managers are often getting lectured about sales and it trickles down to the reps on the sales floor. managers will constantly watch and listen to your sales pitch and if you don't offer every thing under the sun to the customer you have potential of being written up. typically your coworkers make the job easier to bare.
good,"Increased revenue by 12% top performance  each quarter. Assisted in floor support to walk agents through closing sales for products and services ."
good,"With constant competition, AT&T has to continuously evolve and adapt to maintain its lead in the industry. This however has cause a massive shift in the focus of their path and has caused quarterly layoffs and massive downsizing."
good,"Communications are evolving art an exponential rate. Make sure you are prepared for the forward progression, and assume that the changes will continue and come more rapidly."
good,"Change is occurring rapidly. Many veterans are befuddled with the direction of the company. For rookies and mid-career folks, I think it can be an exciting time to be there."
good,"AT&T is a great place to learn and grow as a progressional. The training is extensive, the benefits and pay are competitive. The company still has opportunity with leadership and direction at times, which can help make it a great place to work. There’s also an opportunity for allowing a better work/life balance."
good,"great co-workers, good location, alotted time off if you were able to request it. a typical day consisted of the hours of 7a-330p monday through friday."
good,"This position is very sales driven and micro managed, Scripted phone calls and tracking everything you do. It will give you a great bases of sales knowledge and training offered is extensive."
good,"The most difficult part about this job is the work life balance, as a salaried manager you are expected to work 24/7. That being said compensation and benefits are good."
good,I really liked the people and the management. Management can be very encouraging. The base pay is not sufficient enough for the type of customer based service that we provide.
good,"Management likes to micromanage their employees. They sometimes seem as if they WANT to catch you making mistakes (and that has been formed through SEVERAL manager changes, as well as filling in at several other stores as well). The Company progressively changed their sales requirements to be more and more difficult as I stayed, and eventually got to the point where selling felt near impossible at times, while also having management breathing down your neck and trying to catch you failing. Working here took a major toll on my mental health over nearly 2 and a half years. You have to be pretty flexible with your schedule until you gain some seniority (which can be impossible as a lot of employees tend to stick around a LONG time) as the union allows seniors to pick the best schedules and lower down on the totem pole you are, the less prime shifts you will have! However, pay is pretty good especially when sales are good and benefits are also very good. The company is also fairly generous with PTO and sick time. That and the coworkers was the only thing that kept me there as long as I stayed."
good,All about numbers. Need to be more concerned with the customer instead of perfect surveys. Jobs dispatched are not in consistent areas so owning responsibility for “your” customers is lost.
good,I enjoyed my work. Everyday provided new challenges. I enjoyed working with new people everyday.  It provided me the opportunity to take pride in my work.
good,"My senior team members are extremely knowledgeable and offer direction and purpose. We work very well as a team, and each is willing to assist the other without hesitation. I've learned so much thus far, and continue to learn each day."
good,I enjoyed working there for about the 1st 2 months. After that it got very stressful!! The customers we impossible and the goals were almost impossible. The pay was good i must say. That's the only thing i miss. I loved my manager though. It was so stressful I took a pay cut to leave.
good,"Call center agent for U-Verse television, internet and telephone problem resolution and support. Supported call center agents, customers, technicians and small business clients."
good,"The pressure for sales when you aren’t really trained, wasn’t the best."
good,watch what you say. Everything that is taken wrong gets reported to HR. There is too much work given to do a decent job. Managers are told to do whatever they can to get the work done. Not enough input from the people who do the jobs. Pay is fair only because of Union contract. Benefits are negotiated also. CEO only cares about numbers and stock. Diversity is no problem.
good,have goals to meet  when you do you get prizes  you had to keep up with how many people you tell to open the att app  keep there number  turn it in at the end of the night
good,Large complex with lots of walking trails.  Office buildings all have well planned open places to work with small meeting rooms for conference facilities and small discussions.
good,"Good place to work with, Good working environment. if I get the opportunity would love to work again, office is in good location and lots of parking spaces."
good,Ok place to work had some problems with job security due to changes and layoffs. I left because of this . The pay was good the people were good but needed more security in my job
good,This would be an excellent job if they were a little more flexible with work life situations. If you are late then you are late. There are no excuses with the company. All time matters which means you have to be prompt in everything you do. If there is unexcused time then it will be accounted for. Watch out!
good,"During my employment  there,  I gained skills of multitasking, attention to detail, and accomplished time sensitive tasks.  I was fortunate to work with individuals that worked together and as a team."
good,Bottom line for leaving is that entire billing department is being outsourced to India. While we are training our replacements we are advised once competed we will be let go. this is a large number of employees let go to improve the bottom line of a company that is profitable n the billions. This is not the only company doing this as labor is cheaper overseas.
good,I like the job I learn a lot of different things about the job be patient giving advice monitor accounts I learn how to get along with everybody know matter what it is
good,Just do your job. Don’t attempt to make friends. Don’t think for a second management has your back. Focus on making that money and that’s it. Unless you know someone or enjoy kissing bum don’t think your moving up anytime soon.
good,"During my tenure at AT&T, I developed a lot of professional skills that are very useful in just about any job environment. Pay and benefits were great but no job security at all."
good,"Meetings and presentations. Design inputs Strategies and Milestones Technical Writings and Drawings, Logs, RCAs and Proofs"
good,The sales environment didn't require a great deal of education. Just needed to have a smile and be good with people. Just a tad more cutthroat than I prefer in a job. Also didn't feel like this was going to be a career I would go far in.
good,The job started good but it changed quickly to a sales based position and the management pushed sales over customer service. The job became increasingly stressful dealing with customers who are upset about service issues all the while your manager is pushing you to sell the customer something
good,The job is a well paying job the problem is job security. The reason I am looking for a new job is I do not think our call center will be there within 2 years.
good,"If you want to transfer closer to home, it won't happen.  When they tell you that you can transfer it's never where you want.  Be prepared to work 6 day 10hr shift on a regular if you apply in the Bay area."
good,"You have to be able to manage multiple tasks, time management and dealing with dissatisfied customers. Hardest part is that the management isnt great."
good,"AT&T does not provide much in the way of extra work activities, not do they go out of the way to develop intra office relationships.  The former Bellsouth knew and encouraged the personal and team development as that has a positive influence on both employee morale and an enhanced customer experience."
good,Overall the role I had wasn't a bad role. Can not see any longevity with them due to all the changes going on there. Ever since the purchase of DTV they have been buying out the legacy DTV managers. most all are gone now after 4 years.
good,"I enjoy what I do in this job.  You get to work independently with little direct oversight.  It is not for everyone.  You work in all kinds of weather conditions and you work until all the work is done, so there is no set end time.  "
good,"I would rather not discuss my career here at AT&T. My time here is completely different than any other experience that anyone reading this will have. "
good,"The job itself was amazing. I did very well amd got a lot of commission as well as my hourly pay. The problem I had was with management. It is union based so you can not fire someone. I was hired with disability of major depression and psychosis. My boss would come to me while working with customers and say things such as ""Wow, you can't solve this faster than me? Aren't you a mistake. I'm sorry you have to work with him today."" To the customer. Completely uncalled for. But it is union based so no matter how many people complained. Unless the opened a case file and worked very hard nothing would be done. The answer was to leave. Many people did the same thing. "
good,"Management was strong for my group.  Good leaders in front of me.  However, I saw little room for advancement.   Budget cuts affected my group greatly and we were not able to work on all the great things that I was hired to come in and manage. Some of the people on I managed seemed to be sacred to accomplish or finish anything in fear of not having a job when done.   Very frustrating, at times, to say the least."
good,"The facility has great amenities but the job culture is not conducive to positive reinforcement and advancement.  Too much emphasis on sales and not just meeting customer needs.  If you like call centers, it's as good as any, I suppose.  Not my cup of tea."
good,"is a call center ,it would be stressful job,"
good,In three years time crew was cut from 45 technicians to 12 technicians.  No hiring for last three years.  Most days 2 hours of overtime.  Work 3 weekends a month.
good,"You learn what that means. You stay because the pay is so good, the benefits are great, the people you work with and customers are great. The people you work for are horrible."
good,"job is fun, open ended. you get to plan out your day based on what is needed to complete the job. boss is quick to assist in creating plan of action. great pay, core job doesn't require OT or weekend work or night work. all of that is purely voluntary. pay increases are on par and in style with military pay increases. overall a great work environment, with the exception of being at risk of a layoff every year."
good,"I'm not sure that I can comment on the practices of my company. However from what I've seen in the few months that I've worked there, the staff is very supportive, the management team is very approachable and there is a general sense that most of my peers really enjoy working there."
good,"The job was good, management was understanding. The problem I had being a authorized retailer was the limitations and company changes. Went through 2 different owners that kept changing rules, which made it difficult."
good,"can be a nice environment but when it comes to emergencies they don't help you, my 1 yr old daughter had to go to the emergency room bec her elbow popped out of place and I am her only parent, I was told by accommodation that its for ATT employees only ad bec I am under a year I was adv I by my manager that I couldn't be helped there is nothing they can do. I completely understand theyr attendance policies but when it comes to children ESPECIALLY if I have documentation that I shldnt have lost my only income and way to provide for my children."
good,"Its an ok job but nothing long term. They let go alot of good managers from DirecTV. The job depends on your manager actually, if you have a good manager the job can be good."
good,"I liked working there for the most part, but we shipped celll phones and of course security was of high importance. and it seemed as if some regulations were enacted without being examined from various situations. The working atmosphere was very enjoyable most of the time and we were unionized so we knew that our salaries would continue to rise and that we had some security from being fired or singled out for harassment by management. I am a person that likes this kind of environment and this is the second best place that I have worked at. You also have the opportunity to apply for other jobs company wide and they offer education support,"
good,Great benefits and pay but lack of communication from upper management causes a disconnect for employees. Goals are hard to meet and often consequences of not meeting these goals are held over you.
good,"No permanent hire from outside, only term employee hiring. Not a place to go fotr a career. Pay is good must pay union dues. Good benefits med dental vision"
good,Good work life balance but they seem to keep employees that do not have motivation to work and there are limited available positions for permanent employment without seniority.
good,"The overall company is a really good company to work for. I would love to go back, just in a different department. "
good,"The job and products I sold were great. The management was terrible. All upper management drove the salespeople and sales managers to accomplish goals that were extremely difficult to hit. Middle management did not work to help, but rather echo upper management."
good,"Los jefes solo ven por ellos y no te ayudan en nada, son prepotentes y no les importas en lo absoluto"
good,Great benefits and great place to work as a stepping stone. You will learn a lot. Keep an open mind. Your managers are great Att only promotes people who are serious about their job.
good,"Ran phone route,repairing phone lines etc.Being on your own an d traveling around the city was one of most enjoyable parts of the job. Learned to work with people and maintained good customer relations. We had a certain amount of time to get each job completed or we would fall behind on our route, which we were graded on each day,on a overall monthly evaluation! Helped me to start my own company."
good,"It would have been worth it if we were paid a salary we could live off. At the time I was making $2.90 p/h which was grossly insufficient to survive. I found myself having to ask family members for money to help cover bills and food costs. In addition to that, I don't think our achievements were properly rewarded. We were told we would get incentives based  on sales and retention which I was doing a really job of. I remember only getting floor recognition and pats on the back, but this was never reflected in my pay despite being with them for months and so I chose to leave."
good,"I worked on a graveyard shift, people at the office are busy as a typical office set up. Ive learned a lot from this company on how to handle customer very well trained both customer service and product service."
good,"Typical corporate America, There are many things to learn and opportunities to take, if presented to you. However, some positions are very limited and mundane with not much growth."
good,"A typical day at work was like any other call center work, back to back calls.  I learned how the cellular industry works, system, billing, etc.   The management was okay.  The workplace culture was neutral.  The hardest part of the job was the back to back calls and dealing with angry customers.  The most enjoyable part was the friends I met along the way."
good,A poor manager or manager unwilling to adapt can change your perception off a company very quickly.  Under the current structure there are no management replacements so their peers have to divide their duties when a manager leaves.
good,"Great company with great benefits.  The downside is that the job security is not there, too many rumors of about letting technicians go.  Fear of going on the unemployment line is frightening."
good,AT&T is a good place to work. Its a wonderful place to gain a vast amount of knowledge in the telecommunication industry. You not only gain information in that pertain to cell phones but other technologies as well.
good,when i worked there it was nice pay with stressful environment. Like any other company changes happened all the time. It's mobile technology so they have to stay competitive.
good,"Everything was written in stone as far as what we were able to  say to the customers, if you did not follow the script you got written up"
good,"Good place to work can be stressful, and understaff most times. Never can have weekends off. It was a good place to work and I would recommend it. If you have a god managers it will be good."
good,"fun place to work with great pay. able to move up into management,"
good,"no set schedule on quitting time, everyday is different, have to deal with people and their good or bad habits, and living conditions. best part is working alone, which can also be the bad part"
good,I worked for Direct TV and they had great incentives and managment. ATT came in and let go of a lot of good managers and did away with a lot of the incentives that made the job worth it.
good,"Some of the coworkers weren’t happy so he wasn’t good environment, and some of the management weren’t flexible when it comes to reevaluation,  I simply left for better app or eternity better job"
good,"Good place to work. Your coworkers become your family. Management makes all the difference. They rotate a lot. I had several great managers that made you want to work hard, while having fun. There were a few bad managers that made work miserable to go to. It just depends."
good,"My manager was one of the best in the business was a pleasure to work for him. He did a great job at resolving issues, keeping the team on track and allowing each of us to strive at what we do."
good,The pay is good but should be higher because they keep giving us everybody else work. Management sucks. Benefits are good. If you are a new tech be ready to work every weekend and holiday. The work it’s self is ok sometimes it’s easy sometimes you got to do actually work and sweat.
good,"AT&T has great perks for its employees, however, the company is so big, you are just a number. Great company if you don't care to advance. I didn't really want to leave the company, but they wanted everyone in my organization to move, but wouldn't help with the cost of moving."
good,"AT&T is a company that offers advancement and great benefits. You’ll make a salary and commission. The downside is that the company is very much sales based and does not care about customer service. Also, you will need to devote most of your life to AT&T and forget about having personal time or a flexible schedule."
good,worked as an outside sales rep for att. position was fine. sometimes you would go into clients homes and they would be destroyed other than that was fun
good,Review summary says it all.  Things do change and get scary occasionally.  Targets are sometimes set to high as to make it difficult to reach and this effects your ability to remain employed.
good,"Honestly a great work culture, but it can only do so much to offset the horrible, stressful nature of working in retention. Also, frequent retraining/policy changes and the lack of upward advancement really make a lot of employees feel stuck."
good,"Mind set has shifted from caring about employees to seeing them as a number on a spreadsheet. "
good,"Became more about double checking, constant micromangement, negative culture as time went on.  Benefits got smaller, moved from telecommute to trying to bring everyone into the same roof"
good,"I do not care to participate in commenting on a typical day of work and what I learned or management, workplace culture, the hardest part of the job at AT&T"
good,"good job to start off as beginner, good for college students, friendly environment. i learned to be a people person and be able to communicate and help people."
good,AT&T executive has made very poor decisions and investments recently. The results have been massive layoffs of great employees. Loyalty at AT&T is almost mot existent.
good,"There are many benefits of working at AT&T- Salary and Benefits, name recognition, great products and services. However the downside is work/ life balance and the constant reorganizations and layoffs that now happen very frequently as the company grows."
good,"AT&T Management has problems not knowing how to coach their teams, they also go out of the ethical guidelines in an effort to reach sales goals.  abcdefg"
good,"This company has been OK.  I thought the compensation was fair, the benefits good. Many fantastically talented and committed people. But, in 12 years, I heard of maybe 3 or 4 people actually being promoted.  It seldom happens.  They also do periodic ""surplus"" exercise, their terminology for layoffs. These exercises generally happen twice a year, and are seemingly done at random with no rhyme nor reason.  This of course contributes to a soul-sucking never-ending feeling of impending doom . .  when will it be my turn? They are big on training, and offer many different venues through which to stay current or improve your skills.  The bottom line though, it does not contribute to your place in the company?  Finish a Master's degree/new cert?  Great! Fantastic!  Pay raise?  Nope.  Promotion. Nope. If you're young, it only helps for the job you will be searching for when you get whacked."
good,Upper management seems lost and isn't able to provide proper direction on how to stay relevant in today's world. Instead they sow discontent and confusion with multiple staff reductions or re-org's each year.
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for. The benefits and pay are competitive. The issue I found is that a single bad manager can ruin the experience of multiple employees and it's impossible for the lower level managers to convey this to upper management. Upper management changes every 6 months or so for generally every group so it's hard to get to know any of them before you are moved around. This makes pleading a case of a poor middle manager difficult as the new upper management will generally have more interaction with the middle manager and little to no interaction with the lower management in their chain. It's also hard to constantly show your value to the newer upper management so when surplus decisions are being made, which seem to happen 3 to 4 times a year, the constant change in upper management, who make the decisions on who to keep, don't even know what their employees do. So they tend to rely on the feedback of the middle management and if you've had a bad experience with the middle management your voice is silenced and you will ultimately be offered a surplus package at some point regardless of your work ethics/performance rating on a team. In general I would recommend AT&T but I would make sure that you have a backup plan because surplus seems to be the only constant."
good,"The pay was good. Great commission incentives, although they're difficult to reach. Competitive sales environment, which I found to be motivating. Decent benefits."
good,good place to work good pay lack of job security good benefits.to much money saving do to bad decision by few and them they get all the bonuses and the employee get terminated to balance the budget.
good,Was a great company to work for until they changed the max salary for premises technicians to a lower amount. They expect you to do the same work of other higher paid technicians for half the wages.
good,If you keep your head down and work by the At&t guidelines than maybe you can keep a productive job. There issue is the monthly criteria and standards you must hit is set mostly by individuals who work there numbers falsely and would never meet the requirements under the correct standards. It makes you cheat just to keep up and not look like a below average tech.
good,Working at AT&T was a delight and I wish all the employees there long and prosperous careers.  This company had many great people who put their all into making sure the products and services were the top of the line.
good,AT&T provides the opportunity to learn many new technologies and solutions. The pay for sales executives is market rate. The most significant negative aspect is that downsizing is always right around the corner. Keep your skill set relevant to ensure your role.
good,I would not recommend AT&T. They are not competitive and are not interested in keeping the customer happy for a long term relationship. They are not team players.
good,Review Summary sums it up... very unpredictable...  Need to meet daily standards when working with customers.  Need to be able to switch projects easily
good,Things have changed at At&t. They care less about the employees and customers and more about money. I used to enjoy my job but now I’d rather not go..
good,The goal is to buy out all other competitors and make customers pay more while the CEO’s and  Shareholders get rich. Customers are not told the truth about there bill and they are charged more.
good,AT&T does not allow for this commentary and is it would be considered inappropriate for me to offer an opinion.  So I will need to pass on offering and opinion.
good,"Was a good place to work. Just not long term if you are doing customer service. Look to advance as soon as possible to get out of customer-facing roles. Will get burnt out, management continually moving the bar or changing duties."
good,"It was a sales position. The money was great when you bonus and the hourly wasn't bad. However, the amount of stress that comes with the job, the pay doesn't balance out. The environment is super stressful and some times the goals are unrealistic."
good,"Unless you work in an area considered an ""HR Hub"" advancement will be difficult unless you relocate. (for the HR professional). The company is really good at training and developing its employees."
good,Managers have a lots  of time to see things in the employers that didn't affect the sales and costumer experience. Theirs  not  schedules for the people that study.
good,"Support mechanisms and call centers are fair to poor when on-site technicians need help providing for customers. Many sales agents incorrectly provision orders wrong or are misleading to customers, which the premise techs must devote time consuming hours to correct in order to provide what the customers really want, or need in order to accommodate an understanding of services being provided for are wide customer base. Also to further complicate this process is that for ATT Premise Techs are part of a metrics in that each job is monitor for quality and efficiency to a degree that on average each job should only take an predetermined amount of time. In real world settings each location, customer, service or product is inherently different and may required additional time for completing, especially when reliance on support mechanisms fail or repeatedly delay or hinder smooth flow to complete work orders. this can range from not getting good cell data signal to work iPads or customers didn't fully understand or comprehend services being provided. This creates a stressful environment for the prem. techs and liability seems to fail on techs shoulders. Our focus should be on safety first and quality installs, repairs for our customers."
good,The management above my direct manager create bad moral at the workplace. There’s a few racists guys in upper management! The fellow premise technicians are good people to work with.
good,i worked in a call center so it was 6 weeks of training. You got to choose your schedule meaning mornings days or nights. I enjoyed working there I just had a lot on my plate at the moment and had to move.
good,"As far as technology and incentives, this is a great place to work. Training is provided often to adapt changes in technology, policies, and procedures."
good,AT&T does not want to be a communications company.  It wants to be an entertainment provider.  Benefits and salary are better than average.  Peers and direct reports are easy to work with.
good,I used to work for the Directv portion before AT&T bought it out so keep that in mind that benefits may be different. Other than that it wasn't half bad for a call center.
good,Job consisted of extensive working hours causing work stress and personal stress due to the minimal personal time. Strong relationships were built with co-workers due to time spent together.
good,"Entry level pay is not the most competitive, but there is room for growth.  The hours can be really long.  You will work in all kinds of conditions and mostly outdoors."
good,"-The environment was noisy in the lab"
good,"work was very busy, filled with many reports and research deadlines. answering calls and emails to fill the customers request. Most of the time you had to make executive decisions and quick thinking.  "
good,ATT is the in midst of a major shift from telecommunications and networking to entertainment and content delivery. They are newly focused on consolidating locations across business units. If you are willing and able to work in Dallas or Atlanta ATT would be a good place to work.
good,"Due to recent acquisitions, the company direction seems uncertain to employees and is not properly provided or described to employees and lower management by upper management. Feelings of any job security has diminished greatly over recent years. "
good,"I enjoy going to work and being with my co workers. I enjoy taking calls and giving customers the promotions available to them. Our breaks are fun with a pool table and 2 tvs to watch shows and movies on,"
good,Culture among peers was great. Worked with folks all over the globe. The diversity of all project teams I worked with allowed for a unique experience in all.
good,"My roles at AT&T were always challenging.  The company has changed over the years, so it's not what it used to be.  It's moved to a telecommuting environment, so there is no team work, nor community in the work place.  "
good,"The company seems to be focused on rounds of layoffs.  If you are not in a technical field, you could be facing unemployment for quite a while.   Best advice is to not go here until after at least 2020.  Which is when the rounds of layoffs may slow down."
good,"Decent place to work. Issues with management in our center. Overall, I liked my job but the center closed. I would have stayed with the company had they not closed."
good,Great pay and benefits.  Only downside is if you have an emergency at home you will be written up when you return to work and no advancement opportunities.
good,Great team building but no attention is given to work / life balance.  Management did a good job of making people feel they were a valued team member. Targets / objectives were made clear.
good,"The Headquarters is in Dallas and that is a fun place to work.  Unfortunately I worked in San Ramon and it is a step child location.  There are several jobs in El Segundo and that appears to be the best location if you want to live in CA."
good,"My internet service provider....."
good,"I worked at AT&T for 2.5 years and the pressure they put on their employees to meet impossible goals, is insane. At the last stretch of my time at AT&T retailer Master Wireless. They began to implement illegal sales strategies. Make sure you check your plan to see if an employee has decided to tack on all sorts of mobile addons because that is what we were told to do. I would not reccomend this company to anyone unless they REALLY need money."
good,"Overall the company is highly focused on performance and performance management, much freedom is given to manage as an individual with comparable benefits and compensation to other industry leaders."
good,I worked within internal teams and directly with clients in regards to their unified communications maintenance tickets.  The work was not physically hard but was stressful.
good,"Upper management is the issue of company problems and blaming it hourly worker to fix the issue of there screw up,I wish upper management work with field tech and add more people to the call center,this is a major issue with AT&T,i there is no more customer service,that is one of the major problems with the  company,they kept for getting that the customer pays our salary. Its really  all about numbers and Management Bonus and no room for advancement with company."
good,Life as a Prem Tech at AT&T was a daily battle. The job required long hours in all types of elements. Depending on your manager(1st & 2nd level) you stress level of either elevated or set at bay.
good,"All is well within at&t except for the culture of layoffs. In order to cut costs to pay for DTv and Time Warner, layoffs come every 3 months seems like."
good,"The business ethics that are held up by at&t are not very reputable, I was forced to leave customers without options or charging them more consistently for an error on our part."
good,AT&T is one of a few companies that will challenge you and reward you with great pay and benefits. You will learn quickly how to interact with a global audience.
good,"At&t like any sales company changes the sales structure frequently. So one month you made money because  you followed program, then the next month they changed it and have to change your whole selling style to meet this changes. Schedules were based on seniority, so it was difficult to get work life balance if you are the newest employee when surrounded by tenor agents."
good,"Need to have more opportunities available for tenured employees who have hands on experience. Also, provide support for retail, which drives the business, example: staff your stores."
good,The company is always cutting costs by reducing head count.  They seem to always cut the 1st and 2nd level management jobs.  As you get older in age you always wonder if this is the year my job will be eliminated.
good,"went to customers houses did installs and provided customer care, drove around in a company vehicle, also had to make sure that work was completed on time"
good,I was here on a 6 month contract the group I worked with was helpful and very accommodating as I am a single mother even let me work from home when she was sick
good,This job is better for a single person with no children. There is no cushion for family emergencies. The pay is excellent but can not make up for the loss of family time and situations that arise and cannot be addressed by you because the company is mandated by the fcc and has to have you on those phones with no regard to human life situations.
good,Great benefits and pay but you work very hard for every penny! Very very stressful. I put in many weeks with 50 or more hours. My manager should never been a manager.
good,"Given diverse opportunities in job roles."
good,I didn't particularly enjoy being treated like cattle. Management was so concerned about making quotas that the personal side of management was almost nonexistent.
good,Covering all customers concerns while retaining customers and transitioning to sales. Providing empathy and engagement through the your call. Customer.
good,The company is a lot less customer and employee focused than what it used to be. The pay used to be phenomenal but has gone down over the years. Still a great place for someone starting out in life. Its a step up from average retail.
good,"Installing and maintaining Uverse, DTV and fiber topologies in all types of weather conditions. This included business and residential customers. Performing a large range of different jobs."
good,"Tough job, no tardy leniency no matter what. Same goes with attendance. The company is run similar to the military. You are expected to have each and every customer off your phone line under 3 minutes. If you help another employee while your on a call. You will be reprimanded. It's a very tightly run company. The company picks favorites and their favorites are always given opportunities that the everyday representative is not. It's not a fair work environment. I was a favorite. I have first hand experience."
good,"* Assisting customers with their billing, phone service, payments, device issues, technical support"
good,As I have worked for other companies I have learned that the training available at AT&T set me up to be a better leader in later roles. I would definitely  recommend AT&T for development reasons.
good,Day was 10 hours long did quality and safety inspections on crew members. Carried on call pager every 4 weeks and was on call for 3 states. Responsible for emergency response for any outages in my covered area by keeping 200 generators serviced and ready.
good,Working for AT&T was not bad but it is all red tape and trying to get one over on a customer. Workers needed to be held responsible for misinformation and the company doesn't really care to be realistic in its goals for a person. Also they push DTV way too hard. I mean in like 8-10 years 80% of people are just going to be streaming anyway.
good,"I'd say it was a pretty good place to work, incentives were great as well. Advance opportunities were not as available. Mostly depended on who you knew and who you were."
good,I really enjoyed workign at att. I left to better my career in tech services. great place to make money but be ready to work hard and think quick on your feet.
good,"Although the pay is really great, the account itself is really exhausting and drains you by the end of the day. The management though is very supportive to their employees which made the workplace fun and exciting every day."
good,I had a lot of success at At&t. I was the top home solutions employee in the North Central Region. I won the Summit Award and was invited to go to Fort Lauderdale Fl. with the other top producers in the region
good,"A typical day at AT&T is long and always changing. The hardest part of my job was getting the tools needed, for the constant changes that were being done; before the infrastructure was created."
good,"Extremely corporate, but willing to adapt quickly to the industry. I enjoyed the team overall, but some processes seemed dated. They move like a dinosaur and kept many departments siloed for no apparent reason."
good,Manager was more into being friends and getting family members hired.  She was not friendly very mean and cruel.  She allowed others to do the reviews on you instead of her.
good,Installing cable and Internet about 2-4 times a day. Climbing poles is the hardest part because you tend to go up and down carrying a good amount weight. Lunch is the best time of the day.
good,"Great team builder spirit always fun , folks are fair. Would recommend the job to friends and family. Managers we understanding to schedules and training."
good,"+  Very standard corporate gig"
good,Typical day required serving customers needs as per calls received. Call management can be stressful. Company requires occasional mandatory overtime. Gained more customer service experience. Hardest part of job is working with difficult customers.
good,"Directv was a great place to work before ATT bought it out. Company was going through so many reorgs, the mission objective would change every few weeks."
good,"The only reason I am writing this is because indeed is requiring me to. ATT seemed like a fine place to work if you need a decent sales job with commission. However, if you are truly trying to make a career it is not the place to start in my opinion."
good,"This company has made its employees ""job scared."" There is no security any longer. It used to be a place where people were allowed to hone their skills and move around the company as you've managed one area of the business.You felt successful, like you qere making a real contribution. Now, it's You're lucky if your department isn't told it's moving tom Dallas."
good,"as a contractor i started at 50% of what i was making 10 years ago doing the same exact work and pay was cut twice from there in 6 months time to my boss which then had to pass those ""savings"" on to his techs or eat the cost. He ate the cost but the third time was the final straw."
good,"Was much better workplace before SBC purchased AT&T. 80% of customers in Healthcare were very dissatisfied with AT&T Overall, Most complaints were from over billing customers and taking months to years to issue credits rightfully owed to customers. The other common customer complaints was the lack of empathy that AT&T leadership showed toward solving business affecting problems the company caused faithful customers.."
good,"I'm afraid my time there was very short, and I did not experience the ""real deal"" due to the position becoming outsourced. It was extra professional: business attire, no phones on floor else fired, keep to the script*."
good,"good place to work an train, enjoy fellow employees, good work vehicles,safety was job one, worked with vary different departments all over the country."
good,"Customer service and sales. Should say it all. IMO, its hard to combine sales and service in the same phone call. Its hard to talk someone into buying another AT&T Product when their billing is never correct for the product they currently have."
good,"Worked with some great people and management while there, the only real downside to working for such a big company is the higher management closing offices even after huge profits and even after a government tax break. but such is life working for a corporation.,"
good,es muy buena empresa pero hace falta meoras en el tipo de pago para los eecutivos
good,"i did not enjo working at att because supervisor would get angry at everything. Sometimes it was hard metting our goals for the month, but tried our best."
good,"company allows collaboration with people from other groups and organization, work from home 2-3 days in a week, a lot of training resources to equip yourself..."
good,"Very competitive, fast paced, goal oriented.  Continuous commission structure changes as well as upper management fluctuations.  Need a little more consistency."
good,"I don't have anything ""negative"" to say about working for AT&T because you get what you put into any position. However, in retail, a lot of the accountability and leadership practices didn't seem to be completely conducive to maintaining high morale AND successful sales numbers. Your mileage may vary."
good,"Management was very poor and ultimately was the result of me leaving the job. The job it’s self was great, I loved what I did and I love helping the people in my community. But dealing with bigotry from my supervisor, and the lack of concern and respect from upper management to my complaints proved to be far to stressful to the enjoyment of the job and life itself."
good,"Tienen un ambiente laboral bueno, condiciones de salarios y beneficios contractuales buenos."
good,"A typical day is to get the supplies that the techs need for the day, scan them out, and then put them on the shelves of the techs.  Then scan in all the defective equipment and box them up to be shipped out."
good,AT&T is a large company with many different areas.  A person's experience in one area may not be indicative of what someone will experience in another area.
good,"good job for staable good income, requires alot of your time with very little flexibiblity your told to staay as late as necessary without any way to go home until all areas are serviced"
good,Affected by nation wide layoffs in which a small severance was provided. ATT would raise metrics to an unobtainable level. Customer Service was important but did not have tools or resources to provide excellent experience.
good,"After several years of service, many high-performing managers find themselves scrambling to find one of few internal jobs due quarterly “surpluses”.   There seems to be no real rhyme or reason how those whom are actually selected to be laid off are chosen. Regardless of high performance reviews or years of service, no one appears to be safe in this very unstable company culture.  Many are forced to uproot their families and move to El Segundo, CA or Dallas, TX to remain in the business with very little notice."
good,Good job great enviroment until new mangement company iqor took over... made new friends good instructor great activities to earn prizes such as money
good,A good place to work for if you want benefits and good pay but favorites is definitely a game played around here. Even if you do your job and perform they say “we don’t know you as a person”. Translation; you’re just a number to us.
good,Large company with lots of duplicated personnel.  Developers are generally well versed in one area instead of diverse in multiple areas....................
good,"attt love there agent but they love their customer more '"
good,"aprende-se muito com sistema, processos e cadeia na tomada de decisão."
good,Money there is great but it takes a special person to deal with the stress there daily without going crazy if it’s not one thing it’s another. Money was a great motivation their but it’s hard to substitute your sanity for money.
good,"Laid back job just a little stressful to meet and exceed sales quotas."
good,they were nice people. i just did data entry and clerical work mostly.i can't remember anyones name it was just a temp job that i filled twice while the company was in a hiring freeze
good,They drastically changed the comp plan frequently where it was very hard to maintain your commission.  They are also not very flexible when it comes to emergencies and you are basically written up if you miss more than one day a quarter.  Very hard to have young kids and work there.
good,"Directv has a huge push. Expected to demo the product with every customer but it’s very difficult sometimes when customers aren’t interested and just want to talk about phones. AT&T is an entertainment provider now, so don’t come in expecting to sell just phones—you’re selling tv too."
good,"ATT has been cutting it's legacy workforce very quietly for the last 2-3 years.  They have to pay for Time Warner and Directv somehow. If you can get on in the Cloud or Big Data group, it should be a safe job for several years,"
good,I worked here for almost two decades. There were always a lot of opportunities for growth and movement. Its a giant company with competitive pay. You can retire there.
good,"It really depends on the manager you have and how the vibe is in the environment and in the store. I have thought about going back. I felt some of the goals were unrealistic. But it is corporate so I understand, you’re always pushed harder! But all around, great compensation and as you all know, that’s why we’re at work (:"
good,"1/1 coachings and write ups is the daily culture, even when you meet your metrics the Co. has high expectations for you to exceed in all metrics. Could be good for a sales person who is looking for advancement."
good,"I thought AT&T would be a great company to work for, its such a big company. The first year was great, I thought I could make it a career. But then the union negotiations started and I realized the company really didn't care for its employees on the ground. Refusing a decent pay raise, adding more responsibilities without increasing pay. Constantly changing the metrics to keep your job. No job security, at all."
good,"Working in the call center as a representative is a union job. Therefore the pay and benefits are actually quite good for a call center. However, it is definitely high pressure sales with requirements to hit certain sales quotas that were not easily attainable for most."
good,"Good benefits and decent pay, but becoming less stable over the years.  The company culture is different in each office.  But there are a lot of opportunities to network.  Training is provided"
good,Scamming customers has become second nature in many areas due to wildly unrealistic goals. Whistleblowers are listened to but nothing is done. Those who succeed by cheating are still praised. I see no proof it's getting better. So I quit.
good,great vacations opportunity to work in different states.  they have the good old boys attitude.  Lack of security for employees at job site.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working in Hawaii.
good,Management has no union to protect their employees. I believe if both reps and managements had the same benefits all of the employees working for AT&T mobility would be treated equally.
good,Great education development programs. Could work from home once a week. Good health and 401K company match programs. work space didn't fit our design needs.
good,"En general la empresa es buenas, solo que tomaron toda la cultura de Iusacell. "
good,"It was a greate place to work, until I realized I wasn't growing my skills.  That can happen if you get locked into one of the silos there.  I had to leave to grow my skills and my pay."
good,You get a new manager every six months and the differences between one and the next can seriously jeopardize any advancement opportunities. No standardization with management.
good,"No family Life, always stressing over numbers. Keep telling you to slow down and not get hurt, at the same time, tells you to hurry up on jobs. Never know if there's gonna be a lay off or not."
good,"Scheduled installation and repairs for customers for technicians in the state of California. Managed vacation request, sick time for technicians. Prepared weekly reports for upper leadership to review progress and areas that need improvement."
good,Enjoyed the job and people I worked with.  However immediate managers were difficult.  I went through several managers and they all unappreciative of work accomplished.
good,"Ecxelente trabajo, de facil adaptabilidad, buenas capacitaciones"
good,"I did not agree with the management at AT&T, Coming from Verizon I did not think that the job was done the right way. I was asked to make a lot of shortcuts."
good,"The scheduale for part timers are ok, you cannot take more than 2 days to go to school and those days have to be week days. If you have classes from Monday through Friday you cannot work here."
good,"AT&T was a great place to work until competition rolled in and AT&T didn't update the equipment and keep up to pace. The local telcom's had better rates and faster internet speeds than us, which in turn stole the heart of our customers. Less customers, less installations, less jobs, and then they don't need you. Makes logical sense, but it lacked security. "
good,The one benefit of AT&T was the flexibility to work from home.  It gave you the work/life balance to start your day early and not have to worry about that daily commute.  The one issue though was not having the direct people contact in which you felt at times that you were not a recognized individual and no really knew what your true impact was to the day to day activities you provided.
good,"Great place to work when I started in 2000."
good,"Was a good place to work for the give you full benifits, vacation days and sick days. The job has you on your toes at all times thinking of different scenarios to get the job done."
good,Not bad place to work. lot of quotas need to meet. good people. good atmosphere. free phone service. free tv. family environment. good commission. good to work
good,"Pay is comparable"
good,"With the exception of certain managers, this would be an ideal experience. Great pay, many benefits, and goals aren't too hard to achieve. Some managers really destroy the vibe though."
good,Long hours but over all easy work environment. Enjoyed my time here but had to eventually throw in the towel. Started to feel cramped up in the same office day in and day out.
good,"Long hours and you're always wrong. Good thing is they always have you learning something new. Little to no management, for the most part youre in control of your day"
good,"Micro managed, constant changes that make it difficult to do your job, the customer does not always come first, unreasonable metrics to meet. Constant hounding of managers to get you into trouble."
good,"No executive or senior management emphasis on or support for technical staff and project managers. If you weren't selling something, you weren't valued."
good,"Response differs depending on position. "
good,"Stuck as a contractor, no career advancement possible, decreases willingness to learn new things to advance. Will still learn on my own but willing to move asap. One of the lowest salaries in the US for software developer."
good,"I went through three mergers while working at AT&T, from Bell South to Cingular and AT&T. As a manager every merger increased work load and the word used was effeciency. Less workers and support staff to more employees under one manager. The basic premise was to be number one or out the door. With 60 plus managers 59 were feeling the heat monthly. The job was great at first and as AT&T got control the atmosphere in the staff go cut throat and the morale went down hill."
good,"DTV/AT&T,  changed over the 14 years employed.  Although, it was structured as a call center,  there were areas that were more related than others.  Meeting all of the deliverables may have been the hardest part of the job.  Working with a multi-cultured atmosphere was the most rewarding."
good,"Over the 17 years with AT&T, I was able to get experience in Customer service, Sales, Sales management, Account management and Operations which has helped in my future careers."
good,i had high hopes! which quickly faded due to management politics .... I loved things at first but things started to change the more established we became
good,Projects are quick short and also long scope depending on need. There are chances for travel and working in a team with some good and some not so good collaboration going on. Talented groups of people and management makes effort to keep the committed engineers.
good,A lot of favoritism. Some workers had tons of work as some did nothing. A lot of unfairness. But I really appreciated my pay and benefits. Very proud I worked there.
good,"i worked for an authorized retailer, the pay was limited and there were no raises no matter how long you had worked for the company. People changed a lot because no one ever stayed too long. Business was slow in my third re location and it was not worth standing there for 7 hours with only 2 customers every hour OR LESS between 4 sales people. The benefits were practically non existent compared to a corporate store. The training was trail and error, which there is too much to learn and too much risk to learn it all that way. Although i do recommend the job, it does make you proficient, teaches you patience when you teach the elders how to do simplest things on an iphone or andriod. It will also teach you accuracy and improve your communication skills and confidence because you will get use to talking to strangers and you will learn how to vibe off peoples energy to offer products in a way that gets them to say yes every time."
good,"The pay is great, however, working here will get stressful. I would recommend only working for this company is you are a cut throat sales type of person and interested in company advancement. Other than that, you will hate working here. Customer service at this company is hard, people will come in angry every day and you have got to make the best of it. Also, selling is the NUMBER ONE priority in this company regardless of what the customer actually needs."
good,"Job provides good pay an benefits for all positions.  However, upper management does not care about its workforce despite its public message.  Hours are fixed so weekends may be manditory"
good,Job is great if that atmosphere is great. Work was not hard. Location was not as strong for what we were trying to sale. Overall good job but could always use improvement.
good,AT&T is a good company with great benefits but the management is a mess! I was an Account Executive and called on large buildings in San Francisco. The big issue is that AT&T is too big and depts. do not communicate with each other and customers are therefore frustrated when they call in with issues.
good,"It was hard to sit for 8 hours of the day answering phone calls. Part of the problem is that you didn't have a choice to pay into their Union, but the Union really didn't do anything for anyone. There were a lot of do's and don't's representatives were held to. The call center I worked at ended up getting shut down."
good,I liked working at AT&T.  It was a fast paced environment and very open.  The Management worked with you very well to ensure an open door policy.  They were great to answer all questions in a timely manner.
good,"As DSL tech support I mainly interacted with people that were unsatisfied with their AT&T service, so my experience over that past few years with AT&T comes from a slightly negative disposition. That being said, the most stressful thing about the position I held was feeling that AT&T could not deliver on any of the promises and reassurances I was routinely asked to dole out."
good,"Not somewhere I would recommend, maybe it was just my store but the environment was hostile. I say more and more employees leave the store rather then continue their career there."
good,I learned a lot there. typical day at work was taking phone calls constantly. The lower management was excellent. Higher management was doubtful. The hardest part of the job was making sure I got back from breaks and lunches on time.
good,Good company if you’re an it software engineer.  Company seems to be phasing out premesis field technician. If you’re a team memeber plan on either getting higher eduaction or moving on. Customer service used to be focus now it’s on cost cutting.
good,not a bad job if you don't care to be at home very much. Rules change alot. Great benefits. pay is pretty good. work hardly have a full weekend off. 14 years of Saturdays i missed alot of my kids activities.
good,Really enjoyed working here for my first job out of college. Everything was great until my store manager was fired and replaced by a terrible manager who drove myself and many other coworkers to quit. After I quit the new store manager was also fired for being caught stealing company devices. AT&T needs to do a better job of picking and choosing the new managers who come in.
good,I think it was not a great fit for me.  The metrics are more important than the people.  Good managers do help as much as they can. Advancement is slow.  People with high levels of experience should not start here; it is not a stepping stone.
good,"You get a good discount, good pay and good benefits.  The retail hours don't provide for a lot of time off.  You will be working weekends.  You have to not only sell wireless services but also tv and internet which is stressful"
good,"When first hired in, it was a great company to work for. Great benefits, great pay, great work hours. It slowly declined over the years I worked there. Went from having some job security and possibly advancements, to absolute zero. We never knew if we where going to come in that day of work and find out that was our last day. Layoffs starting coming quick and they where downsizing departments. Right now i would say to anyone who wants a job with AT&T. Do not plan on retiring there.  Its a technology based company that is moving so fast, but not bringing there employees with them."
good,They offer great training opportunities for everyone along with a great tuition reimbursement policy. Fast paced and cutting edge would be good words to describe the atmosphere!
good,"trying to find the most efficient way to design the blueprints, and having to go through corrections after already turning in a project and not getting paid for the time that you have to do the corrections"
good,"The company hides all this stress and pressure behind a mask of corporate culture. When you hit your numbers you are the king of the store....until next month then you are treated like trash and constantly monitored and documented until you close another good deal or sell more than your target. Goals and Compensation constantly change and are marketed to employees as if its more beneficial however that is not the case and commission becomes less and less compensated over time. If you are a salesman its hard to move up outside of retail to something else like marketing or training or IT work etc. They would rather hire someone outside the company first than their own in the front lines. Once they see that you are no longer producing the numbers they want, They will try to pressure you until you quit or find any excuse to fire you so you can be replaced. Overall, it makes you never want another retail job again."
good,"No more job security after 7 years of feeling like I was secure.  It was hard work, but I enjoy fixing problems and making customers happy.  Sometimes expectations are unrealistic, but they change them frequently."
good,"I worked at AT&T for 8+ years and only due to the fact of an amazing manager, leader, and person.  The company is split between union and non union employees.  The compensation is fair but every year there is a ""testing"" period to scrutinize if the new commissions structure is too rich or too difficult.  AT&T is fortune & company and it very much feels that way as an employee"
good,"Working in a retention (cancellation) department can be hard in any company, but AT&T gives their employees the empowerment to be able to genuinely help customers who are trying to cancel, which makes it a lot easier to handle."
good,Good pay.  Good job.  Would have worked here still if the Coorperate greed didn’t lay off plenty of hard working employees.  I don’t know why you make people leave a review if they don’t want to.
good,Worked on Big Data project as a management consultant.  It was good while it lasted.  Project lost funding which diminished organization's ability to meet objectives.
good,"Overall, AT&T is a good organization to work for. Typical day consisted of a morning huddle with your team and manager than dispatching on your first job. You never know what you will get - either your climbing a pole or crawling under a crawl space. AT&T is all about safety so not following safety protocol is an easy way to get fired. Benefits don't start until after 6 months and the healthcare is SORRY and rather expensive. Discounts on phone and TV services is a plus. Never make plans on days you are scheduled to work because there is no set time you get off, you basically dispatch on jobs until the job load for the day is cleared. Don't apply if you are scared of heights, tight spaces, insects, hate the outdoors, or driving!"
good,Eaay job if you just need an income but not sustainable for a career. Good for an easy paycheck but i wouldnt imagine being able to live off of a sales reps salary
good,Good entry level job but not a lot of advancement options. The best part about the job is being able to work independently without supervision. Not a bad place to work if you can deal with the inclement weather.
good,"I have worked for wireless retail a very long time (9+years) I have to say alot is changing and fast. At&t is no longer focusing on the wireless side ,they are focused on the entertainment side. That being said your commission is based on that matter. Have to try and sell too many things for less compensation. Regardless if you are a decent salesperson you will average atleast 50k+ the go getters make about 58k+"
good,"compensation, discounts, products and benefits are great but advancement opportunities have declined. Benefit premiums are good, but copays are extremely high."
good,"take back to back calls helping customers understand their bill "
good,I did not care to work for the direct sales department.  My supervisor was not in the town that i worked in.  She lived over 3 hours away and was never around to help.
good,Heavy sales environment. Hardest part of the job is that its always changing qoutas and sometimes not to realistic with traffic received in stores. The hardest part is dealing with customers in which authorized dealers promised a customer something impossible to do for the customer or meeting some of the harder products. One can learn about dealing with many types of customers and problem solving while learning about the newest technology. Change isnt always bad but sometimes the direction it takes doesnt benefit the employees. Hourly and Commission.
good,I was a contractor with ATT through Matrix resources.  My managers were Matrix employees and were very knowledgeable and took the time to make sure our team was train and knowledgeable. It was one of my favorite workplaces.
good,"I liked my job at AT&T as a premise technician, they give you on the job training also good benefits and pay.The job its self was great at first but AT&T as a whole kept making it harder for us to do our jobs correctly because of a computer program that baby sat us on a daily basis, making it harder to get paying customers in service."
good,"Over working the employees while Under paying the technicians."
good,Likely to be laid off in a few years because employment is on a 3 year term basis. The pay is good but we just don't know how long it's going to last.  I got hired back on and 7 months had gone by so I didn't get to keep my seniority or employment status. The cutoff is 6 months.
good,It was a decent company to work in. They outsourced from Sutherland  Global services that is why the rate was lower than the usual US rate for the job. The only reason I left was because I decided to apply for another job in a bigger city.
good,"I was very happy working for this company for the first few months. Once I was there for a while and the busy season was in full swing, I was overworked and underpaid.. Ultimately I was forced to make a decision. Either work after they cut my pay without telling me beforehand, (I had to find out on my next paycheck that it was cut) or I could wait until the quarter ended and basically be fired because I didn't meet the minimum amount of points on the scorecard. This company I feel needs to give a little more respect to the entry level for technicians. We are the ones who are doing the hard work, we deserve a little respect from you office junkies."
good,Support billing and a lot of project management of your sales monthly. I have learned that you gain a large amount of technical knowledge on system networks. It viewed as a sales position but I would characterize it as a consultant with a lot of billing support included.
good,Top management is not in touch with bottom levels of workforce. Training and HR are not aligned with needs of business so there is huge redundant waste of time on programs that are inefficient and detrimental to workforce productivity. Layoffs are not handled in manner that keeps middle management informed so they are blindsided and cannot keep best workers and are forced to make hard choices just to meet their daily work. This is not a recipe for growth or success and does not empower the lowest levels of the organization to feel they can step up with good ideas to advance in their positions when they are afraid they may be let go even if they are doing good work.
good,"For starters, AT&T hasn't truly hired 'off the street' for years so this may be of less use for many. I also spent my entire career at the 'phone company' so bear that in mind. "
good,"I worked at DIRECTV before the AT&T merger. At DIRECTV we had more ownership, innovation and creativity. At AT&T it felt like we went back in time in some ways. Very large company where you sometimes just feel like a number."
good,"Daily stress is expected since we are working for a sales environment. I get to know more AT&T as a product, and how the business is done with their set of products to offer. The management puts a lot of pressure to employees, most especially the higher management. Hardest part will always be making sales, especially if the customer is financially challenged. Most enjoyable part of the job however, is the support of my co-management team and the culture we are trying to establish."
good,"The pay and benefits were great. However, being a full time college student, there were times I was required to miss classes for trainings. Not to mention, the hours were fixed and it was near impossible to switch shifts since I was one of the only part timers. Personally this was a part time job that is meant for a full timer."
good,Micro-management beyond severe. Little home/family life. Mandatory 6 day work weeks and also 7 day work weeks without overtime due to schedule falling within two differing pay weeks.  Please remember this has to do with what area you are working in and who your managers are. Stressful work environment. Late shifts (work till the jobs are gone) Mandatory 6 day work weeks. No 2 days off in a row
good,"Overall good work environment due to management. To many employees for such a small location which affected income due to the ratio of customers and sales reps. Working on commission you must have customer interaction to make money. all together great job, re;axed environment. If you like customer service and technology great job! Daily operations includes sales, cash handling, computer navigation, customer service, IT, marketing, and problem solving."
good,"A call center type environment.  Not a lot of privacy, and you had to learn how to talk in a very low tone.  Very fast-paced, must be able to multi-task.  Know your products and competitors.  Floor managers, were readily available to assist with any guidance to ensure proper knowledge was explained, overcome challenging obstacles."
good,The company offered me being part of the union but unfortunately we were out of contract before I was even hired on at the company. I dont like the way that played out.
good,"It's an okay place to work. Good manager, god benefits and more than enough work but the company overall is stressful and very strict. They do not play with attendance."
good,"Typical work day consist of dispatching on a random repair or install, driving to the location and doing whatever it takes to install or repair a customers services. This includes but is not limited to running wires, drilling through walls, and climbing poles in order to obtain the best signal possible in order to establish service. This also includes dealing with customers from all walks of life in their personal homes and situations, as well as their animals whenever necessary.  The job is basically a 1 man job with limited supervision.  Generally you work at your own pace, but depending on what the flavor of the month is you may be micromanaged and kept a close eye on.  The title of premise technician was suppose to be the title with the best and longest future.  Upper management only has an eye on the bottom dollar and the employee is just another number.  Technicians were hired very fast to meet the needs of the business and laid off even faster at the first sign of low profits.  Overall the position offers relatively good pay and enjoyable work life, but can be stressful at times and can be placed in sometimes dangerous situations as your work environment changes daily."
good,The best part was my coworkers and Some Managers. It taught me a lot of things that will help me in the future. They pay you because there is a lot to learn and do
good,very stressful work environment not much room for growth an the company unless you move to a new location also the pay is great but with no weekends and holidays off almost not worth it
good,"The company is fairly ran at the corporate level. The majority of work days over 10 hours, with mandatory OT. Team managers rule with fear and unnecessary competition. Great training program, but terrible support when out in the field."
good,"During my time with AT&T we had many organizational changes. This was especially prevalent in IT. We spent a great deal of time worrying about, and recovering from reorganizations."
good,"This company is the most complex and unnecessary I have ever worked for. Everything has to be an ordeal for them, while ""creating culture."" I would only recommend working for this company if you enjoy everything being more nonsense than it has to be."
good,It's an ok place to work. Pretty safe if you're not in management cause you have the union. Some management are underhanded. Supervisors need to be trained in handling employees.
good,"Pay and benefits are decent  If you want to advance in this company, you need to know its all politics. You need to get to know upper management to advance. It does not matter if you are very qualified for the job"
good,At&t requires one to be able to adapt fast and to change quickly.  Candidates must be driven and can accept very high stress levels.  At&t has great benefits and job advance opportunities.
good,Good company no job security. The pay and the benefits are good. The discounts and insurance benefits are also great. I didn't like the fact that union was involved.
good,"Taught me about the workings of successful small businesses and learning what is needed for advertising growth.  However, there was a lack of diversity, growth, and advancement."
good,"I liked the work at AT&T,hands on,good customers.I became very skilled at my job.changes at AT&T caused a more stressful environment,which included management and technicians."
good,Overall the job was interesting and challenging. There was always opportunities to learn and grow if you pursued them. Most of the people were very nice. There were a lot of layoffs during the later years I worked there.
good,"This job is for big turn-around now if you have a lot of years. If you are new, the benefits are great. Vacation has gone down but it's still worth the money."
good,"A typical day includes visiting my stores and checking in with managers and owners of retailers."
good,AT&T would be a good place to start off but no stay in. Dealing with customers throughout the day could be a drag on you and could become very stressful for few. Management is always changing.
good,"Great place to work until AT&T took over.  "
good,If you are willing to relocate and chase the dream of a big time career it is still possible at AT&T.  It isn't easy and you will not be able to reach the top layers of management without relocating....so understand there is family disruptions while you are in pursuit of this dream.
good,"This job is a nice culture and environment to work in, however they expect you to do a lot but don't give you what you need to do it. They ask that you meet very specific metrics but the company does not take into account what the customer needs you to do for them. The company really makes it hard to do the best for the customer, making it stressful and eventually you start to dislike the company in general just for the way their customer service works."
good,"High paced High stressed call center environment, Had a timer that made you validate caller, fix customers billing problem, go over products that customer does not have, & sell - sell & sell packages ! Off the street managers were poorly trained, once in a while they would hire someone that did the job previously so they had empathy to what your job entailed,"
good,My job was to manage a team of outbound sales reps selling telecommunication products as well as being a CLEC (Competitive Local exchange carrier in Orlando and New York.  Our technical staff and repairs crews were not very good so if there was a problem it often took weeks to resolve it and customer satisfaction was horrible if there were problems with taking the phone service from a competitive local service provider.
good,enjoyed my time at AT&T am now ready for new career thank them for the time and training i received will be leaving with a heavy heart and a deep respect for some of the people i worked with learned alot about people practices procedures and life
good,"Overall AT&T is a great company with a great vision. AT&T is a great company. Great  benefits and great spirit. Sometimes stressful, but what job don't get stressful at times."
good,Very stable job with great benefits. Unfortunately advancement opportunities are few and far between if you are not within the core business unit. Otherwise it is a great place to work.
good,AT&T proved to be a rewarding career for me. I enjoyed working as a communications technician because every job presented a new challenge. The most difficult part of the job was working outside all day enduring the extreme weather conditions. I enjoyed the challenge of trouble isolation working on repair tickets.
good,There needs to be room for advancement or financial gains if you expect us to adapt to last minute changes or pile us with extra work without reward. Treat each employee no matter the position with respect
good,I enjoyed my job. I trained the new hires. Wr gave the at&t employees discounts.  Added service or moved service. Most of the time it was enjoyable.  Until the company moved to Florida.
good,"not always busy, but when we were consistently working with new customers to find complete solutions to help them save money and drive over all sales of the company at the same time.  Management is always present and available to help.  Usually a fun place to work."
good,"the typical day as a tech support rep revolves around customer service. our primary function is resolving customer trouble in reference to uverse high speed internet, iptv, voip."
good,Att is a nice place to work that pays pretty well for the job however the work life balance is not realistic especially since its based on seniority and you have people with service in the 30 year range even 10 years of service means nothing.  Its hard to get promoted in nashville because it doesn't  have much to offer besides the call center piece or management position which of course if no new hires no new managers needed.  if you are willing to relocate Att has a lot  more to off outside of this city .
good,"We are hired by Insight Global and work at AT&T, Not for AT&T."
good,This division no longer exists. It dissolved shortly after leaving the company after a merger.........................................................
good,"AT&T, West Palm Beach, Fl	2014 - Current"
good,on a typical day I would go to customers homes and interact with them and install or repair their service. I learned a lot about how internet and phones work. AT&T started having layoffs and it got very uneasy to work there not knowing from week to week if we would have a job or not. Supervisors were not very understanding.
good,"The pay is pretty good, but they change the compensation plans regularly.  Have been there almost 2 years and have been a top performer EVERY month, yet still unable to move up in the company.  I am seeking a career with a company that offers employees growth and advancement based on performance and execution of duties and work ethic."
good,"It is a great work environment, however the bonus structure is only good if your store gets enough traffic, or if you are short handed and get to work with more customers."
good,This is a great place to start a career of your fresh out of High School. You can have a great starting place. The people are great and there is a lot of work and I mean hard work...
good,"I worked at a very busy store in Las Colinas TX which was right down the road from Dallas Cowboys training camp. They would always come into our store and give us business, Plus we got a lot of autographs! If you were not tech savy, then you better have done your homework because they would have secret shoppers that would come in and try to buy a phone and quiz you with 21 questions about different phones and you were evaluated on that and it could go great or really bad for you and the whole entire store, That was the major stress because I am not tech savy and new phones come out every single day with the greatest and latest and you were expected to know them before they came out. I am more hands on and the training wasn't up to par at that time. Overall I loved staying busy and taking care of my customers."
good,"I learned a lot while I was at AT&T: Customer service skills blossomed, learned a lot about different phone software and specs. The pay way pretty good. The management is something you should watch out for, though. They can change the schedule and not let you know about it."
good,"As long as your performing its fine, but your best bet is to move up through the ranks, and not stay in customer service for long. Great benefits, but the stress and morale wasn't great."
good,great place to work if you are driven to sell. can be very stressful but enjoy getting learn different things. not very much advancement unless you can sell.
good,Working for AT&T has been helpful for keeping my sales and customer service skills very sharp. Dealing with customers all day for mostly customer service issues and also pitching current promotional offers. Working to hit a personal sales monthly quota and also reaching other metric goals.
good,Relaxing work environment. Good salary but limited and unestablished promotional opportunities. Project engineering works provides flexibility and fun experience. Interacting with contractors and overseeing projects from cradle to grave provides learning various skills ranging from budgets control to coordination and implementation.
good,"Intake calls regarding Services. Fast paced environment. Great company to work for, if you enjoy being on the phones. AT&T provided all employees with resources to perform Agent responsibilities readily. Management and Supervisors involved daily with Employees, able to assist and answer questions. Enjoyable fast paced environment."
good,"answer calls from wireless customers for bill explanations, payment arrangements, and payments. learned a lot from speaking with different people in different places, learned everyone has his or her problems and they live just as i do. management for most part were good but as with everywhere some have better people skills and are better leaders than others. the hardest part of working collections and knowing people are going through rough times just as many people do and knowing that you have to do your job too as well and you just have to say no sometimes. loved talking to the people though."
good,"typical workday- 8-5 work hours, daily stand-up, occasional agile meetings."
good,"Competitive sales rapidly became superior to offering customer assistance.  Many of the reps were very into making bonus sales and thrived.  It was not a good fit for me, as I am a terrible sales person; I find it difficult to pressure people to take on a product.  I was more interested in helping customers with phone issues, such as billing, deciding which product was compatible with their needs etc.  I eventually felt I could not continue in this atmosphere, and left ATT to work a position where I could be of better service to others and was less stressful for my own well-being."
good,"It's easy to get excited about many projects at AT&T, just not the one I'm currently on in their B2B area."
good,A fairly decent place to work with good benefits  Some real good people I've met over the years and they will certainly be missed.  This job has provided a fairly decent living for me any my family
good,working for this company there were small issues .Having a stable manager was always an issue and having to move to a kiosk requesting to go to a store instead.
good,"AT&T es una buena empresa que me ayudoo a descubrir la pasio por ell servicio y atencion a los clientes."
good,"Working with AT&T was a great experience. The atmosphere was positive and the team always excelled above and beyond. Working with the customers was one of the most satisfying parts of the job. Providing a great experience to the customer and receiving commendation for supplying the perfect solution to their need, is one of the greatest benefits of all."
good,"decent communication, nice facility, co workers great, good work experience, several shifts available , qa, close to home, variety of culture make an interesting space to work"
good,"A typical day includes scheduling calls, creating project plans and spreadsheets as well as hosting status calls. I have learned alot about the IT field and the product implementation process. Management ment however tends to Micromanage."
good,Taking Customer calls about porting numbers into AT&T. Working offline to address trouble tickets and contacting customers after issue is resolved. Working with other reps to provide assistance.
good,"At&t is a great company to work for if you want to pursue a business career. It pays very well and has awesome benefits! Retail can be a little hectic at times but other than that, it's a pretty easy job that requires you to practice public interactions with a large diverse customer base."
good,"Working as a wire technician for this company has plenty of benefits but can be extremely stressful due to the amount of mass confusion on an above your position level.  Constantly changing and not being updated as a technician.  Pay is great, benefits are great, and sometimes work isn't too hard, but you definitely should be paid more than you do for what you do.  The worst part here is they do not care about your family life and only care about you doing a job.  Hopefully you have a great manager because that makes a world of difference."
good,They expect you to be on time. It can get very busy non-stop calls. Angry customers that can disrespect you. That's the hardest part of the job. You are monitored all day.
good,"Comfortable with work and work culture is good."
good,Overall good place to work.  I enjoy the diversity of people and the encouragement and opportunity to advance from within the company.  I feel compensation for all that one does needs to increase so that great employees don't seek employment elsewhere.
good,Att was a good place to work.  The pay was great for the area.  You get a raise every 6 months and the commission was also good.  But like every commission based company they change it quit often.  One knock is you have no life with them.  And for the time frame that I was there I've been through 3 managers and 4 assistant managers.  They was not really that good at there job and made life really hard for the associates.  Other then that it was a great place to work
good,"The great thing about this place is that because they are cheap and dont like to pay, you work on a lot of different technology. The bad thing is that they do not like to pay overtime which hinders your ability to complete the work. But overall is not a bad place to work if you are a contractor, do not, I repeat, do not, become a permanent employee. They will work you to the bone."
good,"Experience has shown its very easy to feel lost in the shuffle at AT&T. While the benefits and pay were great, its hard to feel any particular connection to what you're was doing there."
good,The company was run very poorly. Management did not know exactly how to manage its employees in terms of work-life balance. Good place for experience.
good,"Good benefits, great time off and management in my department crossed their I's and T's. "
good,"siempre que llegaba a trabajar, había un buen ambiente de trabajo, aprendí muchas cosas como a tener facilidad de palabra, hacer ventas, etc."
good,"Working on a daily bases in a communications world always brings something new, whether its having and issue with a phone or tablet that you've never seen before or having a conversation with someone you never thought you'd ever met never a duel moment."
good,"AT&T is growing daily, but the customer service and integrity side of the business is declining quickly. As a person who tries to live by certain morals it is a hard company to work for."
good,Too many projects with short due dates that made for many long days and nights and weekends. Since this was a new AT&T support initiative we had to be very creative in our support efforts since many of the devices we had to support were not on the AT&T supported equipment list
good,"Constant changes with offers for customers."
good,"This was one of the most satisfying jobs I have ever had. It provided challenges and rewards unlike any other. There was a balance between work, community and family that allowed for location, remote and virtual workspace give a sense of accomplishment and truly made me feel as if I was making a difference. The culture and values of the company made me more socially aware and active. To this day I still involve myself is community affairs and helping people in need."
good,"Work/life balance is seriously lacking.  There are many changes taking place to the training infrastructure and many are poorly vetted. This creates lost time, extended work hours, and lots of confusion.  Change can be slow because so many of the employees have worked there for 10 years or more. It seems that upper leadership wants change just... because I said so and I know what's best. This will happen even if the consequences, both inter-department and intra-departmental, causes lots of disruption which are often time-consuming and difficult to rectify. Do not expect your work load or timelines to change based upon poor decisions made by upper management. "
good,There were about 60 people hired when I was. I was one of three who made it past 6 yes of employment. If your friendly and can take constant scrutiny as well as have no problem meeting sales quotas then you should do well.
good,I love the various jobs I have held within the company.  They are advancing more and more to having fewer and fewer employees.  Job security is nonexistent.
good,Great place to make money if you are hard working and have a good relationship with the management staff. Retail hours are terrible if you have a family or life outside of work. I like that you can go in any AT&T(corporate) and you know how to use the system and could jump right into sales. Makes it easy to transfer to anywhere in the country.
good,"Not a technology company, good products, good job stability, not for everyone.  This company is an institution and is not known for being all that flexible.  If you thrive on being able to be creative in your job, this is not the place for you."
good,Same as previously stated in my earlier review. Great place to develop management skills! The training is awesome however upper management is detached from the needs of the ground level employees
good,Every year I had worked there the company posted record profits my over all sells went up yet my pay went down. at least once a year if not twice a year they would come out with a new pay plan making it harder to make money. The company is actually on strike as I am typing this about their pay.
good,micromanagement could not even go the bathroom sometimes the attendance manager would go and check on the employees to see why they are taking so long in the bathroom and would knock the door.
good,"AT&T was an overall pleasant working experience. My coworkers, trainers, and managers were awesome. The call center environment was very laid back, but extremely busy, especially on Friday and Saturday. Long story short, if I had to go back to any one of my previous jobs, AT&T would more than likely be my first choice."
good,monthly commission goals is the most important thing to management. You do get to learn about a lot of new products. Coworkers are the best part of the job along with nice discounts.
good,Answering phones and assisting customers with the issues or concerns. I learned how to handle customers when the are angry or upset. Management was not the best. Workplace culture was poor.
good,AT&T has it's plus and minus depending on your manager. A lot of the managers are from the old AT&T land line and likes to micro manage. Roll the dice
good,"I liked the job itself but could have done without the way they did things or how in training they never fully prepared you for the actual job. They need to thoroughly train employees. It is very fast paced which I liked because there was always something to do, just never knew what to expect on any call."
good,"This was a contract position and lasted only 6 months in Atlanta, GA."
good,"With the technology constantly changing, they strive to make sure they are on top of everything by providing a total home solution to  each and every guests. Retail Sales Consultants are required to insure that the needs of the guests are always being met.."
good,"high stress competitive sales environment, excellent pay, benefits, and incentives. tight knit yet highly competitive. Very tall center, they rarely hire."
good,"great benefits and pay for retail sales, hours are always different and expectations to sell too high when season is slow."
good,"It's an great job for someone that's looking for a company for with good benefits. As for as management goes, it just depends to what garage you get assigned to."
good,There is very little room for advancement in the AT&T call centers.  I spent 9 years with DIRECTV when it was bought out and the culture has changed dramatically.  No concern for agents or morale.
good,"It could be a challenge day to day with moving deadlines and lack of a true work/life balance.  They did encourage folks to move up, and most I work with have 15+ years tenure.  "
good,Not the best place to work if you don't want stress.  The company is worried about your goals and forgets the employee completely. They focus on pushing the senior members out of the company to pay the incoming people lower wages.
good,"Had to go by the guidelines of the FCC in calls received, documentation, and customer service recognition. I learned lots of tolerance and patience. Hardest issue was the back to back calls where we are to complete the call in 4mins. or less - at times to assist the customer for their needs/complaints, one could go over this time limit. Enjoyable part is the 'Team' working to accomplish the requirements by the company."
good,"AT&T was a great place to work until the business split.  I had the opportunity to lern numerous software package, as well as learn a lot about the phone business."
good,Though AT&T is a great company it has some minor flaws that can be adjusted from within. One being the management/tech relationship. Managers tend to be hand tied to micromanage techs because of various contract negotiations with union. This making them ineffective
good,It is a very competitive market across the country. Price driven. Changes in products pretty much daily. Very tough market. It seems like whoever has the best marketing that week / day gets the deal.
good,"It was better in prior years, but the company had recently started layoffs this year. The job didn't feel nearly as secure as before. Benefits are great! Discounts on AT&T services are wonderful as well. Management outside of the store level seems to distant from what actually takes place at a retail level. They have been ""out of the game"" too long."
good,"The environment fosters continuing education, teamwork and innovation, however, it has grown so large the IT engineering has become very compartmentalized, and with 75% of any team working overseas, it is very hard to keep communication opened with the whole team."
good,If you like call center environment then this is the place for you.  Customers are rude at times but it's all part of the job.  Management is good but could use a little improvement in supporting the agents.
good,"a lot of over time and with good pay. the two months of training needs to be more accurate to the field work you will be doing. And having a six month probation, not having health benefits for six months is crazy and you can not miss a day due to the probation."
good,"I was a DIRECTV employee and became an AT&T employee when they bought us.  I'm not clear on how the culture was before since I came from DIRECTV, but since the merge, it's been unstable, unorganized and chaotic.  The merger sure was not a smooth experience.  A lot of us were laid off or automatically promoted due to difference of job titles/levels between both companies.  It became very corporate very fast and the team moral went down.  Just my two cents."
good,"Early on SBC was a great place to work, then they bought AT&T. Things went down hill from there. There is no loyalty to the employee, just the bottom line. Very frequent layoffs and work group shut downs to consolidate to larger cities."
good,cerraron la tienda por mala administracion del gerente
good,"I honestly only enjoyed the people there.."
good,"The direction of the company is a twisting road at times. Seems like a communications company that wants to be a entertainment company now. The benefits are very good, they are not the best out there but very close to it. The best part of the day is when you are able to get someone back up and working, to see the gratitude on their face for a job well done."
good,"job has a strict attendance policy and vary little room for tardiness"
good,"If you work hard, make good numbers and are able to relocate, this company is awesome.  Decent home/work life balance.  Would do it again if I was given the chance."
good,Wire technician job is a good paying job with good benefits. The company is huge on micro management and technicians do not have the independence to work with out being fussed at for not meeting made up metrics. No complaints over the job or the work I have to do. Wish AT&T would put more faith into the ability of the technicians that they hire and train.
good,"First job. Worked long hours in a call centre environment. Included benefits so that was definitely a bonus. Hours of operation for me were during the day, but other shifts were available"
good,"Tough work but fair pair."
good,"AT&T has good pay and benefits, but the culture and work life balance for first level managers needs much improvement. Senior leadership talks about work life balance, but it does not seem to get past the VP level."
good,Normal day at work was to login on my computer get a job. If it was a repair ticket think about call to customer to see what kind of trouble they are having and start thinking where the trouble might be at . If it was a install call customer to see what type of install you are putting  in and after you finish confirm all service is working and customer has knowledge of the product you put in and are happy with the service.
good,"Most days was great, however if get shift you don't want you still stuck in for about 3 - 6 months until it's time to bid for a new shift & if like shift still have bid every few months so no set shifts."
good,"Your schedule is chosen by seniority. Meetings are mandatory,even if you're off and consume of nothing but negativity. Management is non-unionized and are basically against you. The money is great, but you have to meet your goals every month or get written up."
good,"At AT&T Connectech, we can acquire knowledge on each individual issues. The work environment so friendly that I actually enjoyed it a lot. Better support and salary."
good,"High work demand, work morning to dawn, great benefit, meet new and interesting people, the job is not hard to work but many obstacle to goes thru, great job."
good,"This was a great company, with a lot of great people, but it was going through way too many changes during the time I worked there.  Re-org's and re-brandings were almost continuous events.  It had began as Media One right when I joined, but became AT&T Broadband, then Comcast during the few years I worked there.  A wonderful environment to gain experience in my trade, but a bit chaotic overall."
good,"Poor work life balance, but high compensation and benefits."
good,Great company to work for. Have the branding and all for you're resume but if you were not good at sales you didnt survive. Everything always changed and overall job security was always low
good,"start work at 8 in the morning, do anywhere from 1-5 jobs a day, running fiber optic cables through underground conduit, mount sitalites on houses, install phone, internet, and tv services"
good,"Been working for the company for 4+ years. Working under Union & honestly they are no help at all. Only things to talk about the greatness is benefits, rest of them are average or below average. Work/life balance is getting worse day by day. No Planning of work load, assign job at any time & we get re-route all over the city. Talk about safety & then shifting you all over the city make no sense of safety !! Poor load management, Anything goes wrong its you ! So to work here you have to have thick skin & also smart enough to go with the system."
good,"Loved the benefits."
good,Great work envitonmrnt and many opportunities for advancement.  Competitive pay scale and fringe benefits comparable to industry standards.  Friendly long term employees with minimal turnover.
good,you barely have a life and its a struggle to find that balance.. money is great though.. very laid back culture ..other than that it can be stressful at times but that is a part of a job
good,They do a great job of training you and coaching to success. Once you hit first level management there isn't anywhere to move to in the company without moving out of state. They are very big on making you move to Dallas or Atlanta.
good,The job its self is easy but its hard to feel like you are wanted. I love most things but the feel that you are always replaceable
good,"Working at this place was very overwhelming for me at the time. First job getting paid commission and also was door to door knock. If you're New you only get one day of training, rarely help."
good,"I wish I was more mature when I had this job.  You can't take back time but it was actually one of the better jobs I had.  I was just too immature to realize it.  They give you all the tools to be successful as a sales person.  Nice store, family like setting. very easy to maintain since you didn't have to do any of the cleaning.  Just counting stock every so often"
good,Coworkers are excellent. Management is good and helpful. Equipment is dated and not always functioning. Good training and staff.
good,A Sales Consultant that shows great sales skills and good leadership skills is often overlooked for promotions by someone that knows someone in upper management
good,"I have been working at AT&T full-time"
good,If you are a young person with little or no responsibilities in your personal life and a good drive this is an environment in which you could flourish. If you are willing to work hard but have a family the company has taken a turn to being uncaring.
good,"Los días de trabajo agitados controlando a los diferentes asesores del Dealer en diferentes ciudades."
good,"Great Company to work especially for entry level positions in sales, marketing or finance.  Great training and benefits."
good,"- If you are fresher and would like to spend sometime in a organization that would tech you both technically and logically about the IT industry this is right place  "
good,"Lots of work. Fast pace work place. Lots of responsibilities, lots of work. Need to be active in questions to sell more products."
good,"For the most part this is not a bad company to work for. They pay well, and the benefits and perks are great. The job can be very stressful at times which is understandably so given the nature of any sales nob."
good,"More customer service than Sales"
good,the company has changed to a lower paying occupational employee. company is closing offices all over. upper management is is clueless about how products are produced.
good,It was a pritty cool gig. Unfortunatly i had a manager that was all about chopping heads off for taking 3 repeats or more a week. Or if you ran into trouble that outside of your control he held you accountable. Which didmt seem right. Got fired for following att protocol but not his protocol and with out a union rep present.if rep would have been present no question i would have still been there and i would have tryed to transfer to a different garage
good,Working in cubicle in an office environment with objectives to meet that aren't always in the best interest of the customer. Union represented employees ensure good benefits but puts strict constraints on reporting with little flexibility.
good,"Who you know not what you know work environment."
good,"Interesting job  where you add more to your knowledge.•	Responsible for extracting, tracking and compiling data to generate reports.Worked in a team setting to achieve desired result."
good,"Meeting new people every day was the best part of the job. I was able to add a few different things to my resume, My boss was awesome and the hardest part of my job was having to deal with some co-workers that were very uncomfortable with my experience and being a female."
good,"You are mostly independent, managers do check on you in field periodically. You work until all work is finished. Hard to maintain a good work life and personal life. Co workers are good to work with. Uniforms are supplied."
good,"AT&T is a great company with awesome benefits like health plan, 401K and for some retirement. Training is consistently given so you are always on top of the new changes that the company will implement. Procedures are established for every situation and has a pretty good leadership (top to bottom) communication. "
good,Great coworkers. Management lacking severely. No job security. Management will tell you to do one thing and then harass you for not doing the exact opposite of what they just told you. Benefits are amazing.
good,This is a great place to start out working in the security field because it gives you face to face contact with clients. The management needs major improvement. You can tell them how you are feeling about a situation and they promise a resolution but yet no resolution is ever found then the situation is turned back on you.
good,Buying all the major corporations out there but at the same time laying off management. Makes little to no sense but who am I to judge I am not the CEO.
good,AT&T provided excellent job training and paid for additional job training through the local community college.  They encouraged advancement and movement within the Accounting department.
good,"The positive nature in the store is amazing, my co workers have been great. Your direct supervisor(s) is always available for questions and assistance to hit your targets."
good,"The call center employees are not so professional. There is a lot of favoritism. The training material is all over the place, it is 6 weeks long and people still go on the floor confused"
good,"Pay is not inline where it should be for industry standards.  The pay bands are on a VERY wide scale, and raises are almost non-existent.  The training is lacking for day to day work, but there is support from your team members.  The new initiatie to get everyone 2020 ready is unoragnized and seems like a reactive approach.  There are huge amounts of computerized classes that ""have"" to be done, regardless to your workload.  I already work days, nights, and weekends with clients.  Now this training has to be done, and is mostly after hours.  There goes the quality of life lesson....but I am glad to have a job."
good,"Good company to work for, very VERY good benefits. Hourly pay is decent. Commission pay USED to be amazing. Now it is pretty terrible. Went from making almost $3000/month in commission to about $1000 or less."
good,"If you are ok with the call center life.. then this is a good place to work. Scheduling changes every 6 months based on seniority, some area managers are tough. The customers are ok for the most part."
good,"I enjoyed every day of my job, I looked forward to any challenge that occurred during the day. I was only hired for a three year contract with the possibility of being offer permanent employment, but to cover legal ends the company had to offer my position to existing permanent employees. Knowing the situation that I needed nobody to volunteer for my job title many people disregarded the implications of their actions on my life/career and volunteered for my job title anyway."
good,Great place to work with when you are incoming call center.  Benefits are great.  Supervisors very willing to work with employees.
good,"answering calls to assist with customers advanced technical issues with Uverse products ranging from tv, internet, phone and email issues. ensure customers are satisfied with their product or determining if new equipment is needed or if a technician must be issued"
good,With this job you are able to make a decent amount of money but are limited to making it in only a few ways such as the home security and home solutions (TV/Internet)
good,"I recommend this company as a starter for learning and gaining experience in marketing and sales development."
good,"I have worked many years with this company as DIRECTV. Recently Directv was acquired by ATT, Therefore there have been a lot of changes to better mirror the ATT way of management. As a Team leader I was not effected as much as the customer service representatives. This has been the most challenging part of the merger,"
good,"For many years AT&T provided great job security however there are now constant reorganizations resulting in surplusing of employees and outsourcing as well. The work environment, benefits and pay is great."
good,"Answer phone calls and help AT&T customers with technical issues."
good,"AT&T is at a major crossroad between 100 year old technology, and trying to lead the future. Two years ago it was about delivery excellent service and delivering on commitments, now it's about putting has been rock stars in their latest group of Direct TV commercials."
good,Good company to work for must have a goal.  Enjoyed the employees.  must have good time management.  Good incentives for extra cash.  Company had many bonding experiences to promote camaraderie.
good,"I would take daily call ins, update schedules to ensure adherence is at 93% daily. Maintained individual vacation days for over 90 service reps daily.  I've learned that communication is the key to a successful business.  The hardest part of the job was maintaining adherence, but I achieved it daily, while overlapping in other areas.  I believe the most enjoyable part of my day was just knowing that all my work was completed, to the best of my ability."
good,"Overall my job experience at AT&T was rewarding. Most of the personnel I worked with were friendly and supportive, particularly the group I was in. Most days were fast-paced, handling incoming calls from technicians resolving customer issues, as well as designing circuits already assigned to me for that day. Every day could be different, which made my job interesting, challenging and unique."
good,"AT&T has been a great place to have such a long-term career at up to this point. "
good,Management could do a better job of being available. Processes are always changing which is annoying. Co-workers are friendly. Benefits are solid.
good,"I managed wireless construction projects such as small cell, umts, lte and expansion."
good,"Working for a company acquired by at&t was an adjustment because the scheduling and management were changing, affecting a lot of fellow employees, myself included, the company i worked for before was wonderful! once at&t took over, the enjoyment and the relationships with everyone changed,"
good,"Retail hours, work every weekend. Sunday is time and a half. Asked to push features on people that don't need them. Large quota"
good,CEO is a little too old school and needs to match up better with T-mobile in making bold moves and focus on what the customers want as well as building and investing in its employees
good,In the beginning it was a fun and enjoyable work place. But the last 5yrs have been all about making sales and performing all the many task we were given to do. The atmosphere was overly aggressive and totally stressful everyday. we work in 2 Pc monitors and used many different screens and apps to perform our work. I learned how to multi task very well. Co-workers were great. management was unpredictable. If you meet all the required sale catagories mgmt. was please but if you didn't you felt you would be fired at anytime. The hardest part was having to continually keep up with constant changes and the additional products we had to sell. The most enjoyable part was the benefits and the salary.
good,"If you work hard, the pay is solid. Good benefits, good 401K  and good people to work with but management leaves much to be desired."
good,"Great company with great employees. There is just no room for opportunity, Its a fun environment and everyone is engaged. Besides having better management AT&T is a great job to have."
good,Company was great to work for until the last few years and it became a 60 hour work week and no increase in wages. I learned a great deal about self discipline and motivation.
good,"Dealing with different people every day, matching their phones needs to the ideal phone for the right price is always fun"
good,"Have experience in taking bill payments, processing upgrades, up selling, and meeting quota's. "
good,"This company is not for everyone. You MUST be reliable be there when you are scheduled and on time. You also can't have personal problems or need time off as the motto is ""needs of the business""."
good,"I would strongly recommend that anybody that is about to start working at Sykes, have some previous experience in fast paced customer service delivery; otherwise, they will find it very difficult to settle in the organisation."
good,"-La remuneración es excelente."
good,"The enjoyment of the job can vary greatly and solely based on the personality of the manager. While this may be true with most work, I believe the retail sales atmosphere amplifies that affect."
good,"Started when it was Bellsouth which was a great place to work. Pay was great, good benefits. Managers were okay. Wanted to retire from  there but didn't work out."
good,I cant say nothing bad about this company at all. the more you put into your work the faster you will move up and your salary will move up as well.
good,"I enjoyed my job, although errors from up top made a lot more work for the CSRs. In the beginning we were mostly covering tracks and fixing billing errors, for like thousands upon thousands of people. It all eventually got worked out."
good,"Long hours that fluctuate daily. No time to spend with family or attend school. Pay is average, but depends on the amount of hours you put in."
good,"Sales job with low base salary, hard to advance in company. Great benefit package and 401 k plan. Hard to gain no business in sales"
good,But Micro Management is Chronic specially in a place that everyone want it to be first as an employee not as a team. You will notice that in most of the new supervisors.
good,Part of the SBC wireless portfolio included paging products. This was a tough environment to work in as this division ran net negative quarter after quarter losing customers to SBC's parent cellular organization.
good,"AT&T is a tough place to work but, for those who can make it work, the compensation is very good with good benefits.  The local management is good to work with."
good,"This was a very fun, rewarding and challenging career at Bell South/AT&T. I enjoyed the 18 years I worked at this company and what I learned. I made numerous friends for life and we always made sure we had fun at the end of a hard work day. Troubleshooting could be challenging at times but what I learned through training I was always able to figure a way to repair something in a safe and prompt manner following company policies."
good,AT&T is always looking for ways to improve the company's technology.  This company set new trends on telecommunication.  It provide a good salary to employees and have a excellent vacation package.
good,"When I started with SWBT it was a good company to work for.  As time progressed and mergers began, AT&T became to stringent and the company worried more about profits than the customers."
good,"Stressful work environment, management micromanages their employees, even when the work is getting done.  The compensation is great, good benefits.  Feel stuck in current position with no advancement opportunities.  They do provide tuition reimbursement, which is excellent, but there are no opportunities to use your new skills!!!"
good,"Handle inbound  calls  , very  busy  atmosphere.  Great employees .  Management  could  be better. Morale  in office  was  down.  Great company  but  room fro  advancement.  Union environment .  Great  work experience and  good training"
good,"While they promote from within, the turnover is astronomical.  Because they are an outsource company, a subdivision typically folds within two to three years and moves overseas.  Employees who do not make the cut are laid off, those that do are retrained for another soon to depart company."
good,"I would take calls back to back. I would help register the account, I would help and troubleshoot internet connect, schedule dispatch for tech, Provided tech info."
good,"While considerable effort is made to make employees feel appreciated, the work isn't rewarding. Numbers are the bottom line. The environment is internally competitive-- difficult to feel camaraderie with coworkers. The rapid change rate creates tension. And many employees stagnate in their positions though they were assured mobility, and even after showing promise and loyalty for many years. Level 1 management is on-point and seems to have employee's backs in many ways but aren't in a position to implement suggestions that might make for a better, more rewarding workplace. It's a well-guarded secret who actually calls the shots."
good,"AT&T is not an equal opportunity employee. There were a ton of imperfections that when overlooked and when it was brought up to be resolved or even acknowledged, there was always retaliation. The managers at AT&T had more of a do as I say and not as I do attitude and the Area Managers were no help either, but they always spoke of having an open door policy."
good,Corporate was the worst part. They never asked you to compromise one's values but they rewarded those that did. Ended up not being wort the time. And they will be selling the wire line soon so there goes Uverse.
good,I was out in the field for the majority of my day. I liked not being micromanaged. I had a task assigned to me at the beginning of the day and it was up to me to deliver the service to the client.
good,"Typical day includes reading service orders, going to cross box, testing for sync, placing cross connects, running cat5 home runs to Gateway at the best location for the customer.  Running additional cat5 lines for IPTV or using coax as a last result.  Registering customer on their new account, testing wireless speeds and overall line status of lines to cx house.  If lines are bad the buried service wire may need replacing or an aerial line may need replacing.  If that's not the problem then we drop helper tickets to the service techs who take care of the lines from the cross box to the serving terminal.  I have learned a lot about loop length, capacity and Db and how specific they all have to be in order to get a passing Quality Check. Management is ok, Co-workers are great support if there is any technical issues that arise.  Hardest part of job is dealing with the bad equipment out of the box and having to Smart Chat in for hours at times to resolve an issue.  All this counts against our numbers and is out of our control. The later you work the worse your numbers are and its required you pull jobs until 7:45 at night 6 days a week most of the time. There is no job work/life balance.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers faces light up when their service is working 100% either installed or repaired."
good,At&t is a great place to work without a degree. The pay is great. I would say that I have to work 45-50 hours a week. It is retail hours and you do have to work based on seniority. Great management training program.
good,"I enjoyed working with  customers, helping them to find the solutions they needed. They are union so getting a day off  is next to impossible because its based on seniority.  Management is constantly looking over your shoulder.  It seems that they are always looking some reason to write you up.  probably one of the worst places I have ever worked.  They have a very high turnover."
good,Telecommunications giant with many employees.  Culture and politics can be hard to navigate.  Continual restructuring can make it hard to be secure in your employment.
good,I advance to team lead in a year so it proves that there is opportunity for growth throughout the company. I have also saw many people advance into management positions in only two years with the company.
good,"I worked as a CSR for AT&T, meaning that I did troubleshooting over the phone for all Uverse products as well as computer technical support over the phone with both technical and non-technical users. My co-workers and management were the most unprofessional part of the job."
good,"Fast paced place with good co-workers, strict attendance policy, good benefits, Union representation, very political, some room for growth"
good,This is so redundant.  I just wrote this same review on all these jobs.  You need to set up some controls for those who have held multiple jobs within the same company
good,"The pay is well, living cost gets covered, problem being management talking offensively towards their co workers, requiring to have union members present."
good,"BellSouth, Cingular Wireless were excellent companies for employment."
good,Its a typical call center environment and they have amenities like a small fitness center and they have ways to earn bonuses and prizes. The hardest part for me was having to sit all day long. I'd prefer to be more physically active at work then to feel tethered to a computer all day.
good,Very easy going not a lot of customers lots of down time filled with cleaning or training very positive atmosphere just not a whole lot of money...
good,"Being a contracting company for Direct TV, MSC satellite system installations didn't get the higher paying jobs.  Typically, the jobs were trouble shooting the satellite system issues in customer's homes that could be a simple 5 minute job that at times could range up to a 3 hour reinstallation of an entire system with a simple service payout when the job was completed.  The pay scale that was adopted at the time was not always fair in comparison to how much work would required to complete a job."
good,"The pay is great in comparison to other companies in South Florida. Getting out of retail is almost impossible, therefore the work/life balance is difficult to manage. My coworkers are great as they feel like family, they make my job worth while. Overall AT&T is a great company to work for, as long as you don't get sick. In a Sales environment there is always a constant reminder that we can easily be replaced and that you are only as good as your last sale.Not a good feeling!"
good,"This is the highest paying job I've ever had, complete with 401k, health, vision, and dental, as well as vacation time. Those things were great, but there was no transparency with our management and I was laid off from this position. Had it not been for the efforts of one brave co worker, none of us would have known exactly when we were being laid off. This is a great company in many ways, but the corporate chain of command is frustrating."
good,this is a faced paced position but if you can commit to constant change and being mobile to advance this would be ideal for you.
good,"Excellent product and promotional Sales tools to use to nuture a new relationship"
good,Typical day of answering phone calls and helping our customers with there issues and concerns- from billing issues and plan changes and corrections on current plans  walking customers through phone activations and trouble shooting phone technical issues. We always utilize our co-workers and management when needed to help troubleshoot issues. Making sure the customer is happy with the customer service I have given them when the conversation had concluded.
good,"Great company to work for, until the merger. Once the merger  became AT&T, company stop caring for their employees. To many people out on strees leave."
good,"A typical day at work includes 1:1 coaching sessions to develop and career path agents, call observation, and meetings"
good,"Great company that has given me opportunities that I am grateful for. As of late management has been getting really redundant. Scheduling is based on seniority and so is time off. Retail stores have blackout dates. Benefits and 401k are great, 50 percent discounts off of at&t services. The people you work with are awesome most of the times. Attendance is run on a point system. You get to speak and meet some pretty cool people and get yelled at some which are the pretty bad ones. at&t say they are all one and want to show that perception from a corporate view but in reality its not seamless at all."
good,"No team work on any branch in Fresno area, its always individuals interest first and upper management benefits first and the sales associates and support team are treated the worst, i would never recommend to work for this type of environment, its not healthy for a person stability to put their pride and even customer interest under the trash when working for a company like this."
good,learned a lot with smart phone technology and co-workers were great to be around. Job is commission and hourly but sometimes sales floor is slow and paycheck can be effected due to that.
good,Everyday was a challenge with the work itself. This position pushed me to do my best and thrive. The people that I worked with held high moral and ethical behavior.
good,"Horrible Management, if you didn't talk about non work related issues with management then you were considered an outcast even if your work was exceptional. Great compensation and overtime though. Had to commute 45 minutes each day."
good,"I checked my provided phone to see my route, call the customer for a ETA, then put myself in route for my destination, get to customer house and proceed with the installation. I learned a lot of technical staff about electronic devices. Little interaction with co-workers, hardest part of my job was the bad weather, attics and crawling under a house, the most enjoyable part of my job was customer satisfaction with my performance."
good,"Its cool and good money for young people like me "
good,"Working with U-Verse pushes the mind as well as the body, because you get to experience technology changing with ever day. Working along side the other technicians feels like a family help is there when you need it no matter the time day or night for the late techs."
good,"Go to customer's home and do the best that i can do each and everyday that i report to work"
good,"I had the opportunity to work with many nice coworkers.  Although the company provided excellent salary and benefits, there were downsides  to this company as well.  Work schedules were constantly changing and procedures were changed with short notice causing confusion."
good,Helping customers with the Att service needs & also Att devices. Being knowledgeable of all the new month to month cell phone & tablet devices.
good,"Good job , can be hard when the winter weather comes, climbing poles and crawling under houses is much easier in the fall. Good company over all . I enjoy working here."
good,A typical is clocking in and going to straight to the sales floor and assisting customers with managing accounts and sales.
good,"Exellent pay, but poor work life balance. Work can be streesfull at times but it really depends on your manager. You have no life though."
good,"Not a great place to work for a management employee. However, great place to work for a Union Employee Non-Management. I would only recommend AT&T to a person who wants to stay in customer service and has no desire to move up to management. Outside of the union, this company is brutal to work for. Every month there is a surplus."
good,"Work life balance is a struggle. You will definitely work far more than 40 hours per week due to demanding, fast-paced projects.  Flexibility to work from home is a plus, depending on your manager."
good,Any company with 300K employees will have a distinctive character--especially one that is a legacy of a utility.  The pros are balanced against the cons regarding career opportunities.
good,I love my job. Working at At&t has become my life. A typical day includes the occasional irate caller but is off set by being able to work with great people. The management is awesome i couldnt have asked for a better supervisor.
good,"Great place to work but limited growth without relocation."
good,DirecTV is a great company to work for. The benefits are great and the people even greater. I am able to be flexible with my schedule. The incentives are a great perk.
good,I preferred working with Google while at Revana. The corporate culture for Directv was very different and I was never able to use the benefit of having the satellite at my apartment.
good,The people you work with mostly are great. The direct managers are usually pretty good. After that it goes down hill. Very good pay and benefits..
good,Very customer focused corporation.  I am a tenured employee with over 20 years of experience and I have been given many different job opportunities throughout my career.
good,"•	Confer succinctly with customers via telephone within a call-center environment to provide information regarding products/services, take/enter orders and obtain details of complaints."
good,My position as Executive Secretary was pretty streamlined. Oftentimes I observed a company struggle to improve the way things were done as the company grew to make it more efficient and effective. I loved working there and with the owner. I could feel the passion and family blood running through the company and understood the struggles they battled.
good,"A typical work day consist of showing customers the benefits of the product. Management is okay, sometimes hard to deal with."
good,"The people at AT&T I work with in the Corp. retail stores are very easy to work with. My co-workers are some of the best I have ever worked with."
good,"Typical day included sales, customer service and customer issues with products and services.  No room for growth within the company and mandatory overtime or else you will receive disciplinary action"
good,Good company to enhance your own skills and abilities. Management tries their best but unfortunately the pressure of being a sales associate at times holds them back
good,Great job with amazing benifits. Definitly a great job for a Retail Sales Representitive. Being an assistant manager for AT&T is much harder and tough to move up past that.
good,"Pros:"
good,"Though I overall enjoy working for this company I can honestly only give it an average rating at this time."
good,"A typical day:"
good,"Always different. No two houses alike. Some customers great, others are hard to work for or with. "
good,Sales Driven atmosphere looking to drive solutions to all customers. Handled customer escalations at ease. Created solutions for new customers to ATT answering questions about services offered.
good,All of my coworkers were great and it was like a family. I enjoyed working with them very much. Hardest part of the job was to manage the heavy load of work. And the was the most enjoyable part too because seeing everyone working hard and trying to meet the deadline was great. It showed how much everyone loved their work and enjoy their work.
good,Brought on as a contractor with limited experience and AT&T provided me with the opportunity to prove that I was worthy to work for such a big company.  Came in and performed the work I was responsible for and worked as hard as I could to become part of the AT&T family.
good,"Days are busy. Learned a lot about fiber. Well balanced company in regards to management, well diverse."
good,"Very busy phones, great people, great supervisors, the hardest part of the job is the outbound calls - calling and asking small business customers for payments on their accounts, the most enjoyable part is the people."
good,"This is a great company for someone out of college to get a taste of what Corporate America is all about.  It is a global company allowing you to easily move around the globe giving a long term plan of job advancements.  In sales the quotas were constantly changing which made big impacts on compensation to the top performers.  The bottom performers were put on conference calls to tell all their peers why they had a bad sales month...Many found this to be insulting, but from a day to day the management team I worked with was productive and supportive and had minimal office politics and limited mental games between management and sales made it a great opportunity if you are a top performer."
good,finding solutions for customers and finding better solutions for new and existing service
good,"Bad management, and very unorganized. Installing security systems in home and different devices as well."
good,"answer inbound customer service calls, i learned time management and problem solving procedures, the hardest part of the job is making sure the customer is completely happy when they disconnect, i love talking to people and helping them get what they need."
good,A typical day at work involves mostly customer service and assisting in anyway possible performing closing and opening duties such as counting money and running reports on the day.  I have learned ways to interact with customers in order to put them at ease and also what types of questions to ask in order to generate responses that give the information needed to assist them. The management and co-workers are all great always there to assist and help.  The most difficult part of the job is the sales aspect from the point of view that the company wants you to at least pitch every product to every customer that is qualified so you sometimes end up with a customer that doesn't want or need a product that you are required to pitch to them anyway.  The most enjoyable is assisting customers with their concerns when they may not have had the best experience with getting help in the past.
good,"A typical day at work here consist of following up on dates of project plans, emailing the customers with updates. We also have to communicate with our sales team and technical department to make sure the order flow as smoothly as possible. My co worker are a joy to work with and its like a team effort among everyone to reach goals set. My manager is great and always available and knowlegdeable. The most enjoyable part of the job is that upper management acknowledges hard work and effort."
good,Worked there for several years and I don't wish to complete this required review. If you have worked there you already know. If you have spoken with those worked there then you've heard. This review should not be required.
good,A typical day in the call center was to take several calls from other phone companies who used the main line of our and to test troubled lines and to send technicians out to the homes or businesses. I learned how to multi-task well doing this job. Upper management was very nice and the job uncomfortable at times. The hardest part of the job was upper management and the most enjoyable part was working with some great people.
good,"I like it. I mostly open, so im here at 8:30 in the morning. I basically sell phones and solve problems all day. I enjoy just being able to help others in anyway possible"
good,"Rotational shift"
good,very fast based business we were trained to do our job fast and friendly ... and to solve issues on a first call bases
good,"I'd rather not comment on the matter, except to say that it has definitely been a learning experience!"
good,"It was hard to meet the daily quotas, but I did have fun while i was there. Their policies for sick leave and disability were confusing at times, but mostly fair."
good,"The company attracts many top notch ambitious people which creates great products, but the management has a disjointed culture.  Depending on the individual manager, you can either have a wonderful or a horrible experience."
good,The salary and  benefits were great but the customer service expect of the job was very demanding
good,I liked the job it was just hard with retail hours. The co workers and family like environment was great.
good,The International Implementations team was a very hard working group. The connections you made with vendors around the world was the most exciting part of the job.  The work was very enjoyable and challenging.
good,"On a daily basis regardless of shift worked the day was busy, one call to the next, very little down time if any at all. Co-workers and daily customers were a pleasure to work with. Looked forward to taking calls.  There were exceptions, in dealing with the public you don't always have happy customers. Just had to remind myself they were upset at the company and not myself personally and did the best job I could to make them satisfied and happy with at least my service with them on that interaction.  Enjoyed and looked forward to my job on a daily basis. Solving issues and making my customers happy made me happy."
good,AT&T was a place that taught me different things. I believe that the management needs to be worked on along with some of the policies for workers. Other than that the company does provide a good atmosphere where employees can grow.
good,Great overtime hours! A hardworking job. It can be a bit stressful at times. Coworkers are cool!
good,I liked working for them. But their company was just basically experimenting in the area. Their is no more company that I worked for. They were trying local business. This wasn't long distance AT&T.
good,"Handling calls from customers & employee associates in the telecommunications industry in a high volume, high stress environment. Great pay & benefits"
good,I was an asst. Store manager for att. Company had strong leadership and strong goals for growth. Had the staff to meet those goals but stress was a number one reason that I left.
good,"When I started with this company, it was AT&T, great job, wonderful employees, management was great and plenty of job advancement opportunities, as well as great compensation and benefits, loved going to work everyday. Two years ago, our company was sold to YP Holdings, things started to turn for the worse, employees started leaving, work environment started to get worse, management was no longer supportive, there is no more job security, everyone is worried about their position, which makes it difficult to enjoy my job."
good,"At AT&T we have a different day everyday, we don't know what issues will walk in the door. While the retail experience is probably the most difficult part of the job due to traffic patterns keeping up with the current technologies and interacting with customers is the best part of working here. I have learned a great deal about cell phones and how they work while not an expert I am proud to say that I can almost keep up with my kids."
good,Realistically no real shot for advancement.  Very strict on some unattainable goals and commission plan changes regularly
good,"I troubleshoot phones and help customer will billing issues"
good,"I installed the next generation wireless broadband digital home systems (home automation and security). I  also served as a consultant that provided recommendations for other products and services that meet customers’ needs for home comfort, convenience, and security."
good,if joining as a fresher will get exposed to networking skills and troubleshooting.
good,Great opportunity to build a new team for data network management.  Sales team was trained and advanced in offering technological solutions to business customers
good,"Typical day was 40-60 phone calls "
good,"This was my first job after college, and yes i did make some $ but there is no benefits, and it was 100% commission."
good,I really liked working for this company but the pay was not what I needed and the didn't offer any benefits.  No more room to move up.
good,I enjoyed my job a lot.  Creative Services department started with me and 2 others and when I left it was over 60 people.  Management needs to be more aware of who is doing what on a daily basis.
good,"Working on all outside plant for AT&T getting the plant ready for the AT&T U-Verse to come in.  Pole climbing and working on underground plant, also driving feelt."
good,"AT&T sells everything mobile under the sun, and so goes your job. If someone comes in mad about a billing error and you do not try to sell them a bunch of new products/services, u r in trouble....focuses constantly change...management constantly changes, and with that comes policies view/perception change based on  your mgr.....Upper Management has all the power in the world to help you in a tough spot, but instead of rewarding honesty and integrity, AT&T REWARDS and sticks its neck out for DECEPTIVE, LYING, SHADY employees as long as they produce HIGH SALES figures.....period....well known fact amongst employees"
good,"Would receive outbound calls and offer UVERSE services to customers who had a home phone line with AT&T. "
good,Each day I accomplish a great deal and know that I have helped my customers with a personal touch to let them know I care and am capable.
good,"Typical day of work started on the sales floor and ended there, it is a very competitive environment and you have to be able to ask open ended questions.  Those particular questions allowed you to build a rapport with the customer to sell various products and services."
good,Working for Directv was a great learning experience and it taught me patience and how to work under pressure. Working in a right to work state was also a new experience but I was able to push through and preform well.
good,The job and interaction with customers is very interesting
good,"Working for AT&T as as a sale person means working on the bottom level with little to no chance to move on. They have a workforce development structure in place for those looking to go back to college but the reality is that those working on the outskirts away from a central market are often overlooked. Most advancements come from highly competitive districts. As a sales person the store will become your life as the pay will force you to work during the evenings and weekends. The balance between work and personal is awful. You will be a slave to retail."
good,I loved going to work everyday . It was a different adventure everyday . Got to meet a lot of great people on the job .
good,a typical day at work would be me at the computer desk taking a massive amount of calls and or going into the class room to learn more about the job we do or playing fun learning games if the call volume is low enough to take some agents off of the phone. the most enjoyable part about the job is the paycheck and the fact that its so layed back and you dont really have to have a uniform. the hardest part is making sure you keep composure when handleing difficult calls.
good,"Have held a DoD clearance from 1993 to present working on all type of interesting equipment.Looking to becoming a dedicated team Faclities Operator and continue the professionial that I have shown in the past supporting our country in the air conditioning, ventilation, refrigeration and boiler heating field."
good,AT&T is a good company to work for. The pay is nice along with the benefits. I had three managers in the short time I was there and each had their own expectations. I saw new faces almost every week and the training almost had nothing to do with what you would actually be doing. Most of what you learn will be when you ride along with another tech. Overall it's a good company.
good,"They were more focused on servicing customers the first time opposed to servicing a lot of customers a lot of times.  There's a quality emphasis here. My manager was new, didn't know what he was doing, and it showed in his performance.  Coworkers were coolest part of the job, everyone got along together and did lunch together frequently. Elements were the hardest part of the job. Customer relations and job freedom were the best"
good,"Maintaining, cultivating existing client's advertising portfolio as well as acquiring new account in the Greenville, Spartanburg, Anderson, and Asheville area"
good,"Co-ordination between teams located at multiple locations."
good,When I started it was a good company to work for. I was one of 8 employees in customer service. As it grew it became more about the bottom dollar and less about the people. The benefits were good and the other employees friendly and helpful.
good,I loved AT&T although the turnover rate is very high. I hate the fact that this company wont offer opportunities to advance for current employees.
good,"A typical day at work involves generated sales for local stores."
good,ATT is a great company except some departments have awful local management as leadership
good,"The job itself is very demanding. You change shifts very frequently, and you are forced to work that shift. You have to reschedule your life on some basis in order to stay consistent with the job. The benefits are the best and the work environment itself is good. The schedule gets a little overwhelming sometimes, but it's an alright place to work."
good,"	Identify root cause of the incident, solutions and preventive plan"
good,"After 5 years in retail sales with the same company, the job became very monotonous. The ultra corporate processes made it difficult to be excited about work. With AT&T being my first ""real job,"" I learned a great deal about team working, business relationship management,  teaching, and how to quickly adapt to change in an evolving industry."
good,I like this job a lot. It was just kind of far I stayed in a whole other city
good,i was a communication major in college so this was the prefect place for me to grow.
good,"Handling customers all day, trying to fix any problems in their accounts or with their bills, selling products to the customer, and upselling any devices and products. I learned more patience dealing with ornery customers, and how to bring them from a 10 to a 1 easily. Management was always their and very helpful with every need we had. The hardest part of the job is having no time for your own personal life. The most enjoyable part was interacting with new people every day,"
good,"Requires high mandatory overtime, pays very well, schedule is not very flexible."
good,Take incoming calls from AT&T customers who want to pay their bill or make arrangements to pay their bill.  I enjoyed the people I worked with including management.  The hardest part of the job was being tied down to the phone for 7.5 hours a day with designated breaks and lunches.
good,Depending on your store you can work for the company for a few years and still be mired in 10-9 shifts 5 days a week. There's no time to enjoy your personal life.
good,"Nice job to learn marketable knowledge, but NOT if you are looking for rapid advancement.  Lots of smart people work here, but also there are a whole lot of nepotism and croonies that get hired that clog up the bottom half of the company.  Pay is not bad, but NOT great either.  Good place to start your work history, and if you are lucky and happy . . . then stay, BUT if you stagnate, Get the heck out in NO MORE than THREE years.  They bow and worship education .  . . PHD's get hired nearly instantly, MBA's and CPA's that keep ALL of their opinions to themselves get ahead.  IF you have an idea . . . write it up, do NOT shoot your mouth off, because if you do, you will be branded for life as a trouble maker, and you will go NO further no matter how hard you work, learn and do MORE than what you are paid to do.  Image is important at ALL times, even at functions.  Smokers, this is a taboo company to work for.  Drinkers would be SMART to keep it secret as you would your privates.  They used to have okay benefits, but they have cut back as far as they can now.  Personally, I learned a lot, and I am NOT sorry I did work for them.  I should have left much sooner than I did . . .  BUT that is NOT their fault."
good,"Overall I would say AT&T mobility was a great experience. Pay is good, management is good, union is definitely good. However, This company in one month cut our comission in half. Over a two and a half year period it was clear that if you tried hard you could do great. Now if you try hard you might make half of what you were making. I could not reccomend this company for people who require consistency. They have effectively moved from a lets give people what they want and need company and environment to lets see how much we can pile up on customers plates company. That is horrible! They then started to hire people with car sales backgrounds. It is getting bad."
good,"over worked, no time for family worked odd schedules for days off, great for young person without home life"
good,"My job is to trouble shoot circuits and please the customer. I had to take control as lead on all tickets and orders. I verify facilities and sent in for changes. learned leadership, team work and many types of job functions. What i most enjoyed about my job was able to solve problems with and without assistance."
good,"I had to drive an hour to get there, set in the same chair all day taking calls. The job itself really wasn't bad, it was just how much time it consumed with being there and driving back and forth. On a typical day you would sign in and take calls, answering any questions and assisting customers in all sorts of ways. I learned all the steps it takes to do things that most people think, even I did before working there, is just a click of a button. Management was good, they treated everyone fairly and did whatever they could to help you, whether it be keeping you motivated or helping with a tough customer. My coworkers were some of the best, we all became a family even within the short time I've been there. The hardest part of the job was selling, you are supposed to make a sales pitch on every call, even if the caller is calling in yelling at you. The most enjoyable part was the atmosphere, you really felt welcome there."
good,AT&T was an absolutely awesome company to work for but its decision to offshore and outsource jobs was terrible.  Very Good = Absolutely Awesome / Terrible
good,"Constant driving over 40 miles a day."
good,"Learned to multitask, using multiple computer skills and awesome listening and negotiation skills."
good,At DIRECTV we take escalate calls where the customer are upset about a particular situation. We have great leadership that helps lead us through the tough customers we may have.
good,Benefits were great. Pay great. Flex hours. Little to no overtime. Top management doesn't care about the Yellow Pages. All American support was sent overseas to India.
good,"The benefits and pay rate was great. Very demanding, high call volume, not family oriented."
good,"A professional work environment which the work was generally routine, fast paced setting."
good,"Manage vendors on a daily basis and identify areas of needed improvement.  I was able to learn that weak leadership at the top, causes stagnation through the ranks at the lower levels, but strong leadership at the top with drive the lower levels to give the best they possibly can. The hardest part of the job was working through all of the red tape to accomplish even the easiest of tasks.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of accomplishment when a project was completed ahead of time and under budget."
good,"Typlical da at work, consisted of paperwork, selling phones and daily depoists. Also hadnling store inventory"
good,"Resolve all issues for customers that call in for AT&T service. Educate expectations to customers of their service contracts. Sell multiple features, plans and phones."
good,A typical day of work consist of taking customer calls and troubleshooting customer equipment and scheduling tech appointments. My co-workers were always active at work and always kept a positive attitude.The hardest part of the job was leaving after work.The most enjoyable part of work was the customer compliments and solving problems for myself and co-workers.
good,"*Resolve customer cable issues."
good,Directv's primary goal was to provide cable service to customers
good,"Prospecting, appointments, growing the module.Great team to work with and share ideas."
good,"La gente es colaborativa el ambiente de trabajo es bueno, sin embargo la carga laboral es muy alta, se pierde mucho tiempo personal por el trabajo."
good,"Managed production team to perform Engineering tasks in accordance with the goals and directives of the Engineering team."
good,"Excellent pay and benefits.   You will work for these though.  If you would put in the required hours which can be up to 90 hours/week, you will be monetarily rewarded.  There is room for advancement within the company."
good,"When i started this company it was the best thing to happen to me, about 5 months in they decided to revise our pay. at this point my yearly income has been cut in half, advancement is widely available if you stay in the top of all your metrics."
good,Learned how to be transparent in the sales process and guide customers to make rational purchases while providing high quality customer service.
good,"Its a very sales orientated position, The co workers are great"
good,"No day is the same.  Some days I may be setting appointments and building proposals, while other days I may be in face to face customer meetings.  I also complete daily tasks such as order entry and Salesforce.com, and attend internal meetings and training classes. Whatever I am doing, I am always working with my customers to ensure we are meeting their needs, and with our internal teams to create a positive customer experience."
good,"Description: AT & T is one of the leading telecommunications providers in United States. A portal solution was developed for the sales department to unify the information from various applications at one place. The employees in the sales department use this portal as a one stop shop for all the information they need to work on. As a senior SharePoint developer I was involved in design, development and implementation of the portal. The portal helped to integrate the data from various sales applications, automate the business processes with workflows, easily access information using a search solution, easily enter and evaluate the information using electronic forms created by InfoPath."
good,"Assist customers who were experiencing technical issues with equipment. Add delete programming, add equipment to existing account, create new account, explain charges on bill. I learned to have patience on this job. Management was OK.  My co workers were awesome. Most enjoyable part of my day was about the first couple of hours of work, because hardly anybody was having technical issues at 5:00 in the morning."
good,I gained several sales skills while with the company.  I learned how to ask questions to uncover the customers needs and provided the products and services that best fit those needs.  This was an inside sales position and I always wanted to further my career in the outside sales medical arena.
good,"This was a call center working directly for AT&T, not a third party like other call centers working for AT&T. It was a great place to be at. Once you get through your probationary period, it is reasonable for scheduling appointments and other days off. You cannot be absent more than one day within 90 days, otherwise it is termination. They are open most days during the year and stay open late as well. That is one of the biggest downfalls of working here. The pay is great though."
good,"work rain or shine in the field"
good,"Quick morning meeting to discuss the plan for the day, have company supplied laptop throughout the day to pick up work, tech to customer interaction a lot of interpersonal skills and 1 on 1 contact with customer. "
good,"AT&T is a great job that provides good pay, good benefits, and a positive work environment.  However, the company doesn't focus very much on development and advancement for its employees.  For someone who is career oriented, there are limited options locally."
good,"Great company and benefit of having free DTV! "
good,Our work place is very fast paced.  Some good managers some bad. There are micro managers and managers who know you can do your job and is only there to answer questions and be of assistance if needed.   I love doing payroll and finance.
good,My job included helping customers with any problems they called in with and also selling them new products and services.  Management was not understanding to situations and didn't seem to care about the employee.
good,"Great benefits, be sharp enough to make every client encounter really count. Be the best you can be."
good,"good company to work for"
good,"Over all i enjoy my job and i'm good at it but it just isn't fitting all my needs currently. My manager is great and my co-works are so nice and helpful.My typical day at work is opening the store making sure i count in the drawer, count the phones, clean the cash wrap , set up the displaces and clean the windows, turn off the alarm and turn on the open sign. The hardest part about the job would actually be fitting the customers needs each day, its always something different. The most enjoyable part would be my customers being pleased and happy with my overall service. I truly enjoy my work i'm just looking for a more challenging position. "
good,Its a ok place to work at if you need good benefits. really long training process. the way the push you to meet standards. not able to miss a day even if something bad really happens. really doesn't give you a social life in my opinion. 
good,"The company is a decent company to work for, out grown the call center environment. Unions make it impossible to really manage and hold people accountable will keep you busy with grievances."
good,"Great people to work with. No room for advancement. Get monitored every month was stressful."
good,arrive at work clock in and wait fro customrers to arrive i would help with picking out telephonesand  accessories . also helped with problems a customer might have with there phone
good,"Customer service rep, answering phones, billing issues, dealing with customers issues"
good,"It is a good company, however it is very difficult to move into a different business unit. They would prefer non- payroll employees rather than hire within. Young managers who have no idea how to separate business from friendship. "
good,"Location was in a mall, so stayed very busy. managed three employees was leading sales for the region for two months in a row."
good,Directed daily tax operations for compliance and proper management of payroll tax liabilities for all ATT (formerly SBC) companies.  (Daily tax remittances and payroll tax returns). Consistently learned of new tax regulations;laws. Coworkers were good to work with.  the hardest part of the job was clean up from conversions/acquisitions of other company data. Most enjoyable part was responsibility scope.
good,install and troubleshoot phone tv and internet. long hours and travel required.
good,I always arrive early for a positive day at work
good,"I do door to door sales, I have learned a lot and have potential for management after 30 days. My co workers are great team players. the most difficult to me is the fact that it is commission only and with a new family on the way I need more financial stability."
good,"I thought I might enjoy a job in sales so I gave it a shot. A typical day would involve selling cell phones, accessories, and features such as insurance and data packages. The hard part was not necessarily the sales but in the goals that you had to reach. The first month I was on the sales floor the store only did $10,000. in gross profit. There were three of us on the sales floor and we had to make $3500. in gross profit for the store to keep our jobs. I did not reach the goal the first month. The second month I was on probation and had to make $875 a week. I made it up until the last week in the month. I had two returns that put me in the negative for the week and it ended up being slow. There was not a specific rotation in customers. There was one chair that sat by the door that all three of us would have to sit in in order to catch customers as they came in. The minute someone got up, one of us would have to sit down. It was not a pleasant environment by any means. The job itself was fun. I did not enjoy the constant threat of being terminated if goal was not met. I am a hard worker and I would rather be judged by work rather than numbers. You could get stuck with bill pays all day while watching another customer come in to purchase something from another employee. I was almost a threat to the other two employees who had been there for a few years. If I made even $1. more than either of them, they would have lost about $500 from their feature check since it is distributed based on the amount of GP you make."
good,It was pretty good. It was an 8 week training program and I got sick after week six and missed 4 days. I was not allowed in another wave of training or to pick up where I left off in another wave to come.
good,"At the beginning of each day, I sign in and a Manager will assign me my duties for the day. My duties can consist of manual extraction, sorting, iem, keying, pass 1, and/or hand mail. Because the machines are pretty loud, many of the employees wear headphones throughout their shift. Management prefers that employees don't converse with one another for it may distract or slow us down in production. This job is very repetitious day to day."
good,"Typical day consisted of counting cash in morning and night, selling products and features to clients, inventory management. I learned and enhanced more of my social and personal skills. Management needed to learn to stick to rules and not have one for one employee and not for another, management would pick favorites and never punish them. Co-workers were great and had fun on the job even during stressful situations. Hardest part was the constant demand by the company for perfection, enjoyable aspect was getting to meet lots of people."
good,"Managed AT&T's 22 state regional Tariff and Non-Tariff Usage Contract Agreements. Full management and supervisory responsibility for a team of 5-10 contractors, hired as needed based on company work load"
good,"At&t is a company you can certainly earn a respectable income with. That being said, this is not a job for the faint of heart. You will be worked to your limits and stress management is key. There is little room for work life balance. The responsibilities are endless. A typical day is driving sales through others, leading people to achieve their maximum potential and having fun while doing it. It is a must to be able to make decisions on your feet that make sense for your people and the company. The environment of our market is always changing and you must learn to adapt with it to survive."
good,"Great environment, great co-workers... I did enjoy helping customers and loved the changes as far as promotions."
good,Fast Pace environment with moving targets and multiple deliverable projects at a time. A wide non-project responsibilities like release owner for a project release and perform root cause analysis for SDPs and SDRs. On the whole a very tight schedule for a worker at Directv and can learn organizing work to meet deadlines during shot time span with the moving targets.
good,"Had wonderful coworkers, but the company at that time did not help one to advance.Management in the office was spectacular."
good,"Answering inbound calls. Resolving customer service issues. from billing to phone issues. Also sales of mobile devices as well as technical assistance. from phone not getting service to voice mail issues. Data entry of customers comments, concerns and the overall conversation of the customer noted in computer. I also had regular training to inform us of any updates to the system or to the work environment."
good,At&t has given me a great deal of technical know how and customer service training. These are things I will be able to apply in any future endeavor .
good,"Most important part of the job was to maintain professionalism for all customers, and contain top notch poise when handling accounts and information during working hours, as well as off hours. I learned that there will always be a chance to export and import business through business cards and word of mouth outside of the business working hours. Very important to carry ourselves professionally at all times."
good,"I install satellite television equipment on daily basis as well as service work and upgrades on existing customers. Although I possess an technical background, this job has improved my troubleshooting, time management and customer service skills. I work outside (rooftops mostly), in various weather conditions, residential and commercial. Difficulties of the job depend on numerous factors (house size, dish preference, cable existing and non-existing). I work on a team of 60 techs which cover the eastern shore side of MD and the lower areas of DE."
good,review updates in the system. work in a high call volume work environment. review stats.
good,Not a great place to work. Management misleads on future intentions.
good,"My day would start with logging on to coumputer,calling dispatch to recive my tickets for the day.After iwas at AT&T for 10 years i became an onsite tech for thw city of Dayton OH,tokk care of 97 buildings learned about ISDN circuts.If i needed help with cable pulls i would call my coworkers and thay where glade to come help me.Well the hardest part of the job was finding where all the closets where for D<Marks.What i enjoyed most about the job was meeting new people and doing my best to make them happy with my work. I really enjoyed it alot."
good,"took calls all day, made sure that our AT&T customers were satisfied"
good,"really repetitive work, strict. get to meet different people. If your not patient you will probably not be suitable for this type of work, enjoyed days where management was not strict."
good,Fairly typical corporate environment. Decent pay and benefits.
good,"We are making more$ now than ever. Goals are high, but goals only go up not down. I am happy to work for a good manager and AD. I think this is a good company to work for."
good,"helping customer, meeting sale goals, my co-workers, and new phones was the best part of the job. My management was also great at what they did."
good,It is a good paying job but the goals every month are a little extreme. This job is definetly for a person who is settled
good,great company as your going through training but once you are on the job seems as though they are trying their best to make you quit by watch dogging you or setting up traps to make you violate company policies managers have favorites and most dont know what they are doing because they have been out of touch sooo long pay is alright but not enough for the hidden land mines they try to set everyday
good,Working for AT&T has allowed me the opportunity to grow and develop skills necessary to make me a marketable employee in todays workforce.
good,I enjoyed working for AT&T because i had the opportunity to learn about the wireless field. Getting the chance to work with all different types of customer and situations i became very good at problem solving and providing quality customer service. They have a good training program and there is much room for growth within the company. I do recommend this job to anyone looking to be apart of a good system and of course enjoys sales.
good,"Not a bad company, but often you are forced to work overtime. If you have a family, it is a tough job to juggle. If you are single or have no kids, it can be handled. Union backs you up, but doesn't have much power."
good,"I would have to be on early morning (5:00 a.m.) conference calls with my vendor in India who evaluated all of the customer service calls. I would then proceed to be on many more conference calls throughout the day with Call Center Management; Area Managers, Directors & Vice Presidents calibrating & discussing our Quality Guidelines & Processes along with presenting Customer Satisfaction Results & Action Plans for improvements."
good,talked with customers about different services - could have had a better work enviornment my building was not a positive environment - too much negativity and pressure to meet the numbers. Compensation was great! I did enjoy talking to most customers.
good,"A typical day working for this company is like any other day it can be fun and exciting sometime but you never know if that day you go into work would be your last day,the information that the customer call in about sometimes is not updated,might not get the information until a day or two later sometime a week later.Some of the information that is given does not make sense but you still have to give it to the customer anyway."
good,A typical day would be to take 20+ calls per day and handle all types of retention calls for telecommunication services from billing to technical issues.
good,Great company to work for. Great Benefits. Lacking in advancement opportunities
good,"I love this place, wish I could go back in work in the Customer Service Dept"
good,"A typical day at work is talking to AT&T customers, providing excellent customer service. Typing orders, explaining bills, collecting past due monies, making payment arrangements, repair testing, determining products available and properly explaining credit procedures, selling bundle packages, overlapping and multitasking. Meeting company goals on adherence, time on calls and customer surveys. Following strict guidelines and scripted information, followed all mandatory disclosures, protected customer private information. Followed company protocol. What I learned at this position is to listen and communicate effectively, and to make sure the customers left the line confident, that I took care of their request and helped them save money. Management was helpful. Co-workers were excellent people to work with, like family. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers, in which were challenging, but once I assured to help, they were happy. The most enjoyable part of the job was being recognized for meeting goals."
good,Would go to about 3-4 customers houses daily. I learned the importance of customer satisfaction. Worked with great employers and co workers. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was carrying all kinds of tools and equipment up a 40 foot ladder. The most enjoyable part of job was meeting new people everyday.
good,"This was a contract through AT&T for the Department of State for Passports. AT&T lost the contract, and everyone was laid off. Not much else to say."
good,- Install/ repair at&t home sevices
good,"Mi evaluación, como lo antecede, es muy favorable en cuanto a la empresa realizando un enfoque desde el dto de recursos humanos y de la dirección comercial."
good,"Work opening shift. Checked stock, got everything up and running, and started pitching for my sales immediately. Since I was working in a kiosk that was privately owned there was no availability for raises or promotions. My co-workers were easy to get along with but were not punctual whatsoever, so it made it difficult for the schedule to be correct on a normal basis. The hardest part of the job was that the majority of the people didn't come to you and you had to try to call them over and get a sale. The most enjoyable part of the job was dressing professionally and interacting with people."
good,Enjoyed the work environment as the Facility Manager. Time consuming position requiring 12 and 14 hour days for move planning of equipment and staff within the facility. Interfacing and assistance of contractors and various work groups very important in accomplishing work facility goals and time lines.
good,A typical workday was 8 hours with frequent mandatory overtime of 1-2 hours per day when experiencing high call volume. I learned sales skills. The hardest part was maintaining a low call handling time while also trying to upsell or retain sales.
good,"I liked working there, very competitive, and always room for advancement."
good,"Answer call, assist with bill or account related questions. It's a good work place for people with no kids or in need of better pay and healthcare benefits. Schedules are not family friendly."
good,Worked on a high profile customer. Complicated and disorganized databases. Is amazing how anything ever gets accomplished. Poor excuse for an H.R. department.
good,"Good opportunity but it will drain you of energy. Things change constantly, goals and responsibilities rise all the time but compensation does not, and you are greatly micro-managed. On the flip side, it's a great place to start off to make some decent money and build up your sales or management resume..."
good,"Taking 55 calls each day with different cultured customers who had questions about their bill. After the initial question was cared for, I would review their account and show them how our products might better improve their lives. Communication of all types to include Directv, Cell phones, Home phones and Internet was discussed and services were sold. Hardest part of the job was the sales end. I was hired as a billing specialist, but more sales were required. This makes good business sense of any company. I did pretty well,, but I always strived to do more. Most enjoyable part of the job was talking to people from different walks of life and developing a rapport with them. When I was able to help fix their problem, I was most happy and felt rewarded."
good,"it's okay the money is good the stress is bad. Good for money, the co workers are pretty cool as well"
good,"I worked here as a temporary employee, so was not involved a lot in sales transactions. Wanted to transition from temporary status into a full time sales representative, however, higher level management refused to look at resume or interview for position"
good,This was my second chance at trying to work as customer service.
good,work/life balance is difficult with the retail hours. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know customers and getting to help them with their issues and helping them get into the device they need.
good,"You can make a lot of money, but your job is always at risk if you do not make quotas."
good,Workaholics with no family life!!!! AT&T stands for at this time everything changes everyday money goes up and down and managers aren't always the best!
good,"Managers only think about themselves and how they can benefit, dont like to help you when u run into personal issues, they are too the book"
good,I go in at 1pm and leave by 6pm i dont get much hours or pay the office is very messy and there is no organization and it drives me nuts.
good,"aside from daily operational duties in an AT&T retail location you get to see and meet hundreds if not thousands of people from customers to co-workers all with very diverse backgrounds. we are in a forever changing environment that is well worth it if you can adapt just as quickly as things change. Management is always there to support you and are always easy to communicate with several rungs up the ladder. Even with policies and regulations in place we are always looking for the best way to ensure complete satisfaction with all customers and make sure they are willing to recommend AT&T to all friends and family. The customers themselves are the hardest part of the job, but also the most enjoyable. it is a great feeling when someone comes in with a challenge and you are able to help them overcome it increasing loyalty."
good,"Fast paced, every changing climate! Dedicated to training and development. Best part about working at AT&T there are some great individuals who work there and care about the development of your career."
good,It was a great place to work for but like any job after being there a very long time there are going to be differences.
good,"A typical day was getting started early and prospecting for new business setting appointments then managing advertiser accounts to set appointmens,plan and prep account for face to face visit to upsell customer into new products but maintain customer spend on current products, follow-up, turn in paperwork, enter completed sales contracts in computer stay in touch with customers for new product sales opportunities."
good,Help customers enjoy there service that much more. Taking time to listen to customer and sell them service they need not just for the sale. Inventory was a bit tedious once i got the power to order it was more convenient. Increased sales bilingual clientele and kept them on contracts.
good,Hours usually start from 10am-7pm monday thru friday for the first 6 weeks of training and then once training is over you will work 12pm-9pm four days during the week and saturdays. If you are confident and have a background in sales then this is the job for you. You can make quite a bit of money not just from your salary but also from incentives for making sales goals as well as commissions.
good,"Handled customer questions, complaints, and billing inquiries with the highest degree of courtesy and professionalism and resolved customer issues with one call resolution. Offered alternative solutions when appropriate with the objective of retaining the customer's business and completed transactions in connection with activation of new customer accounts on a computer terminal. Communicated with customers using web-based tools such as email and instant messages which and demonstrated proficiency in typing and grammar. Made financial decisions to protect/collect revenues and adjusts customer accounts and achieved monthly sales quotas. Knowledgeable on products and services to educated and offer the customers. Demonstrated continued and consistent proficiency call center and performed other duties as assigned by management."
good,Company states how important small business is. Then they reduce the sales force and increase # of accounts per manager.
good,"I loved working for this company, however I didn't like their attendance policy"
good,When working with a coworker you work as a team player. That fact that you have someone to back you up when your stuck and dont feel confident. Customers are sometimes challenging but its always good to help them out when they are in need and putting them a smile and solving the problem is the best because you know you did your job...Management in general it varies but as far as the store manager or assistant manager they are great people to work with it.
good,"A typical day involved the tailgate meeting with the manager to discuss workload, team goals, and get company announcements. There was plenty to learn in the way of technology. Management was average, but they seemed to be more concerned with numbers than anything else. My co-workers were awesome! They were more knowledgeable and helpful than the managers most of the time. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and providing service. The hardest part of the job were the hours, which were so demanding, and varied so much that it was difficult to maintain a healthy balance."
good,"Installed cable,phone, and internet in customers homes. I did 2 to 3 installs a day and 4 repairs a day"
good,Working with multiple departments. Work with General Manager and Collections.
good,"Consistently busy, learned how to manage myself better without management actually being around. Also learned how to deal with irate customers in a calm manner and resolving the situation. Hardest part of the job when short staff and have to handle other people jobs on a busy day, but was successful in the end."
good,This company has great benefits and a very good pay compensation plan.
good,if you are able to compromise with customers and assist them on their needs this is for you. multitasking handling calls via call queue and computer data entry
good,"Fast paced, constant work. Performance and productivity always counts while working safely as possible."
good,If you dont mind working every single weekend then this is a great job.
good,"The scope of this Review is confined the Capital Mgt. Group. The nature of the work has been interesting but not overly challenging. Finally, the position was contracted to last for 1 yr.; I have been renewed, but I prefer to work in FT position."
good,Experience over 31 years has excelled my expectations. I advanced in personal and professional skills.
good,"Great benefits, strict with punch in times. Great paid training."
good,"great benefits, low pay, hard to move up within the company unless someone from upper management help you out. work/life balance is acceptable. nnnnnn"
good,While working for this company I did not have much time to spend with my family. I was a technician and during the last 2 summers I worked there we worked 6 days a week. So the work/home balance was not there.
good,"Hired before sales was the main thing, we diversified the products. But it became too much stress.  And it was a constant competitive Ball of stress. "
good,You can learn pretty good  software development and data analytics. It is a place that provides good work life balance but limited career growth.Compensations and benefits are decent.
good,"With the transition to AT&T ownership, the positives of working for DIRECTV disappeared.  So you had great management and compensation, but a terrible company culture and attitude."
good,"At a team level, there was always comradery and a sense of inclusion. Met goals and deadlines were always celebrated in one way or another. Issues were always discussed in a way that was productive. The hardest part of my job was juggling as many as six projects at one time. Collaboration was key to managing priorities and deadlines."
good,"Productive and would be a great place to work except for the threats of constant possible layoff's in IT/Engineering which came at least twice a year. You would have to wait a number of weeks before they tell you if you made the cut. :) The last of the twice annual 'you may be laid off' communications always came at the Thanksgiving/Christmas holidays. I went through this personally for 6 years. You may be thinking that these folk are people who are stuck in their positions, but for the most part a lot of the people took advantage of the training to make themselves eligible for the new technology positions that were coming available. Maybe the job stability situation has changed since I have left but for people in the mid and later parts of their careers this was very concerning."
good,"You Get past Security with your pass & you head to your assigned Seat. Everyone Greats each other Warmly because, it's like a Family We all know what is needed to be done and What's Expected. No day is really a easy Day Especially in Retention, The Stress is Usually High but the Pay Most of the time along with Management Encouragement helps keep you focus and pushing Forward."
good,"Working at AT&T afforded me the opportunity to meet a variety of people in my community. However, the culture lacked professionalism and was not customer oriented."
good,"Great flexibility and great benefits. At times, the frequent driving to and from customers' homes and headquarters can wear on you. Decent income can be made with the right effort."
good,"Good pay, great benefits, but the call center in Fayetteville ONLY cares about sales. I worked there in 2016 when they were purchasing DTV, and it slowly turned into all sales by the end on the 1 year I was there. It's supposed to be cell customer service, but the sales quotas are ridiculously high, considering people are calling mostly about their wireless bills and it's an incoming only center. you really have to cheat customers in order to reach sales goals, which did not sit well with my moral standards, so i left. If it were customer service based I would still be there."
good,"The job is not hard and is actually kind of fun once you get into your flow. However, your experience will be determined by your RSM. Period. Management makes or breaks the store/morale. I was at a level 1 store and it was pretty chill but at higher volume stores  there is more pressure & money to be made. The worst part of this job is selling DirecTV."
good,No job security even though unionized. My position may be in jeopardy in the next round of surplussing to keep shareholders happy. It seems the goal of the company is to eliminate as many jobs as possible to reduce overhead.
good,Meetings are sometimes redundant. Management of using propitiatory technology versus open source technologies is not well done. Company does offer good benefits.
good,Good career starter for someone looking to get into corporate world. Learn the technical skills needed for most corporate jobs to a certain degree. Would recommend
good,They had great training and had a strong team to support. Hardest part would be dealing with customer's you can not do anything for at store level. Overall really enjoyed working here and became passionate about sales.
good,It started to turn into a sales goal oriented versus customer resolutions orientated and I declined to keep up with the level of stress it added. So I transitioned out to do what I loved.
good,"Buen sueldo, pésimos jefes, te las tienes que arreglar tu solo preguntando con otros compañeros"
good,They dont care about managers it's all a numbers game if your store doesn't hit goals you would be held accountable. They increase goals if you execute previous month.
good,Great company but high turnover and always new policy. Work life balance not so great. Sales is now required which was  not part of the description. Too many manger clicks if they don't like you.
good,Working here Could be a bit overwhelming at times. There were days which were good also days which could have been good . Just very much overall a good company to work for just some complications along the way like any other company !
good,Great place to work if you don’t mind working nights and weekends and sometimes 7 days in a row. The money is good but it does a real number on your schedule.
good,"AT&T is a great place to work for career advancement, however the stress that comes along with the job is quite a lot to handle at times. Unsettled and angry customers are a normal, but the pay is relatively decent for the work."
good,"It's all about who you know, not hat you know This job causes a lot of stress on the body, the mind and on your family, Going to school and working at this job is extremely hard if you do not have any tenure.."
good,"I love my job at att. Although you have to fight for your spot in company, if you don’t sell you don’t have a job, no matter what’s beneficial for customer,"
good,I worked at At&t for 40 years. Started in directory services and then became a cable splicing technician. I enjoyed the years I spent there servicing the customers.
good,"Company expects you to be fast paced with calls, while still collecting, and getting multiple attempts into collect. It can be very stressful at times when you are needing help on new policies or changes. Schedules aren't very flexible."
good,This company can work for you if you just look at it as a job. It is hard to trust because your fellow employee might be your boss someday so watch what you give out.
good,"Some managers are impervious to the advancements in modern technology. Work is like a treadmill. You have to keep moving, but you don’t get anywhere. For a tech company, I wonder when we are going to use great technology. It’s the Wild West where each individual is allowed complete autonomy yet these idiosyncratic processes must work together, somehow."
good,"The company has descent pay and benefits, and it helps that there is a union that protects and empowers you. The wireless and entertainment industry is saturated, therefore making it challenging to show growth for the company, which puts pressure on the managers, which puts pressure on the sales consultants."
good,"Buena empresa, aunque tiene muchas áreas de oportunidad en sus procesos, ambiente laboral aún puede mejorar."
good,Able to work with you for certain personal requests for time away. Excellent benefits with a great Compensation package.  Flexible schedule if need for personal reasons.
good,"Good place to work, work culture is good but you may not get good exposure so for candidate looking for more projects this may not be good place from long term perspective."
good,"Enjoyed the work for the most part. Lots of pressure to perform, always changing requirements. Upper management is highly involved and does a good job listening."
good,"Fast Paced, they care about you but they want sales and will push you to no end to get them. Also if your customers call you after hours they say you dont have to take the call but that customer will come cause issues at the store. Then you will never hear the end of it"
good,This was a great experience but for the strong sales expert the schedual for new employees forces you to close everyday. It gets exhausting. If the union didn't dictate when you schedual was due to seniority it would be great.
good,"At&t can be a great company, but be aware that you are expendable. If the company doesnt feel like there is enough business they will layoff. I left after 11 years to try and get ahead of it."
good,Good pay work life balance sucks. Could work from 8am-10pm everyday. You are rush and you can’t leave until all work is done. I’ve actually been at someone’s house at 12am before. They weren’t to happy and neither was I.
good,"I enjoyed working for AT&T for 21 yrs but corporate downsizing has claimed almost 30% of the work force (90K workers).  I am looking for a position in a stable company with good benefits.  If I can work from home I need to work graveyard shift to be able to support the needs of my family,"
good,The job can be very stressful it is your job to stop the customer from changing provider ( more like sales ) it is still a new center  more room for improvement benefits are amazing good location and work hours
good,Everyone I worked with was professional and easy to work with.  Generally issues are identified and dealt with so they don't become problems. Refreshing lack of finger pointing and back stabbing.  Repeated layoffs make the job difficult with loss of institutional memory and actual people to get things done resulting in increased pressure on those who remain.
good,"Work environment always feel like competition, you always have to ask for days off a month in advance ! (How Can someone have the whole month planned?!) they always need travelers to drive to other stores! Always short staffed because you don’t make money here ! You start with 13 in training and it’s so hard to go above 15/hr here.."
good,It was good but very demanding due to lack of employees. Patience was needed helping people who forgot passwords and things of that nature but learning the technology was fun.
good,"Unreasonable expectations for sales.  You get paid time off however if you have an emergency and have to miss work, you have to go through a whole process of submitting paperwork signed by yourself AND a doctor in order to excuse your absences and keep your job.  If your job accommodation gets rejected you accrue points which result in you getting written up or fired."
good,"Although I truly love what I am doing, the company is making turns toward outsourcing work to various international countries.  They do work you very hard; have high expectations with little appreciation or compensation."
good,Good pay but ATT has bad work/ family life balance. You will work hard and have good co workers. They are in a transition currently. So job security is low.
good,"It was very hard to get a flexible schedule, Seniority overruled everything pertaining to scheduling. Management was unprofessional and we constantly were threatened to be fired. You must stay on board with any training that is needed, or you will be lost."
good,Not the ideal work place for career advancement. Consistently top talent is pushed away due to lack of new opportunities and or poor management from the top down.
good,Horrible pay structure heavily based on your luck and it’s closing direct tv new customers installing dishes on their homes and starting service with us  cell phone store that pays you more to push its bad cable than its quality smart devices
good,Culture very diverse. Always learning and improving skills. Willing to help atmosphere with strong leadership. A lot of growth opportunities.  Room for advancement.
good,"On a typical day, I was forced to sell services to meet a quota. Services that are way overpriced. to customers who could not afford it. I learned selling overpriced cell phones and services was not right for me."
good,"I have great people I worked with but I know I missed all of them. Very nice people but in AT&T you are stuck in one place. I have to move on, my manager was tough but it helps me a lot. I thank him for the experience I learnt from him. Great guy. Thanks to AT&T for the opportunities I got from them"
good,If you like having some one looking over your back all the time they treat you like you are a child the money and benefits were very good the company only wants to be in the cell phone business
good,"Fast pace, customer oriented workplace that takes the customer best interest in mind.  Listen to the customer problem and find the"
good,"There’s a lot of dead weight, people who are just collecting a paycheck and waiting for retirement benefits package. "
good,I was here over a year then lost it while I couldn’t work because they kept refusing my fmla paperwork but wouldn’t state what was wrong with it. I loved it besides that.
good,difficult to be positive due to the overall poor attitude of most all employees that work there. at a desk all day teathered to a phone required to sell when it is not pertaining to the conversation at hand. focus is not to help the customer but to help the company. this all changed after at&t took over. it was a wonderful place to work when DirecTV was the owner of the company. however after the merger it all went down hill in about every aspect.
good,"Contract position. No career advancement opportunities. No Health benefits, no 401K benefits, no paid time off benefits. No opportunities for overtime."
good,"AT&T has good pay and benefits and opportunities to improve your skills though internal training. However, lay-offs are common and you must be willing to relocate in order to advance your career."
good,"Un día por semana se hacían las juntas para establecer las metas y se aprovechaba para distraernos antes de compensar nuestra labor ya que por estar en puntos muy separados solo nos veíamos en esas reuniones, estar en esa empresa me enseño a tener mas disciplina, mas responsabilidad y a ver que puedo trabajar muy bien sola, los directores nos daban las capacitaciones mas dinámicas e incluso podíamos salir de la ciudad si llegábamos a las metas para recibir mas capacitación, era difícil cuando no teníamos los equipos necesarios o suficientes para nuestras ventas o cuando otras áreas nos retrasaban las entregas"
good,It has been a long time since I've worked for At&t. I left because there was not any opportunity for growth at the time I was there & I reached a cap at the amount of money I could make. Not a bad company to work for. This particular call center location/area did not have opportunity for growth.
good,"la presión por lograr las metas mensuales son altas, pero el apoyo también es alto para lograr los objetivos."
good,"Sometimes it feels like you’re doing a fulfilling job, and sometimes you feel like an ant. AT&T is a massive company employing tens of thousands of people in retail and more in call centers. The compensation is good in retail, as you’ll be a union member in most locations. Management is hit or miss. Beware, if you’re in anything other than a sales role or a call center CSR, your position may be eliminated-laid off."
good,"As a manager with AT&T, they are highly focused on achieving metrics.  Sometimes the employees are disciplined for metrics outside their scope of control.  The freedom during the day was great, but my daily ""to do"" list consisted of over 150 items and kept growing."
good,With broken systems and red tape stopping us from fully solving customer issues it became difficult to stand behind the company and feel proud to help. They pay very well. Around 20 an hour but they fail to solve major customer issues.
good,"Started off great, great pay and benefits. Management  will hire anyone. People who don’t know a thing about technology. Having to bombard customers with questions about entertainment needs in an attempt to sell directv which is a dying service and no one wants."
good,"I did not have phone skills/communication skills to do this job efficiently enough, and it was extremely stressful. Management was great with trying to work with me, but eventually, I couldn't handle it; I was way too shy for this kind of job."
good,"Working at AT&T has been a tremendous experience, however, recent company changes have made it difficult to think long term career here. It has taught me to be flexible, work responsibly and be ethical. Staying focused is important and engaging the right levels of support make the job much easier."
good,"A typical day work would start of by going to their headquarters in Irving, Tx. Your going to have a meeting with your team going over numbers and ways to make a sale, then when that's over your boss is going to assign you to a certain walmart location throughout the DFW area. Once your there you try and make as many sales as possible once people walk by."
good,"Good working environment, always active. Had to stand up all the time and willing to keep upbeat. had to hit sales and quota to get bonus. Overall, a good beginning job."
good,"While I started with Pacific Bell and this was a great company to work for, AT&T has always been known for laying people off every year. This always puts people on edge at risk of losing a career as I did after 23 years. My job was specialized and even though I had a great career how they laid me off was atrocious. They did not go by attrition but rather just straight cuts of departments, location AND if you worked from home. They lost many valuable assets that are now working elsewhere."
good,"Projects are often over budget resulting in furloughs and layoffs. Lower management is in the trenches with their team, however upper management makes decisions based solely on balancing the budget. There is a constant push to get more done faster with fewer people."
good,Job security isn't what it used to be but benefits are good. Good place to acquire transferable job skills but may need to move to different company for long term growth.
good,ATT has been a great company to work for the pay and benefits are awesome.  the work environment is not always that great. I would say that outside of call centers ATT is great place to work.
good,"Company no longer cares about workers, numbers only, call center jobs are being shipped overseas, more concerned about stock holders, poor corporate management"
good,"Company culture is great!"
good,This job is extremely stressful and the work/life balance is not there. People with families are not shown very much compassion or sympathy for emergency situations. Its like business as usual.
good,logged into phone.  Answered incoming customer calls.  troubleshoot phone line.  Put in repair ticket for customer and advised customer of date by which trouble would be resolved.
good,My manager was one of the best I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Mosh was truly one of a kind - he was easy going and laid back and gave me the freedom to do what I do best..
good,things have changed over past 10 years Directv doesn't even own it. So hard to say how it is now. I do know when I was there you got paid by the job and we made real good money
good,"ATT was a good company. Unfortunately, our department of yellow pages advertizing was declining product, losing popularity. Being in sales, you were just a number. As more and more people opting out of yellow pages sales, ATT struggling to introduce more products and retain their market share."
good,"performed safety and quality inspections, verified time reports, held safety meeting once a week, covered technicians on evaluations and verified technicians had a work load"
good,"I started working for AT&T when i was a teenager, I left when i was in my 40s.  I appreciate the experience AT&T gave me about customer service and management, however they could do so much more to support their employees, and be more open minded about suggestions made to them by their management staff."
good,"I enjoyed my time at AT&T; It was a pretty laid-back place to work, there was always incentives and potential to earn more than your expected salary. Favorite part of this job was there was always food!"
good,Working fro att is a great oppurtunity but is also draining and stressful. You take calls for 8 hours a day which might seem easy but if sales quotas are not met coaching steps are taken.
good,"Fun workplace, always having inventive contests etc, great benefits and awesome discounts. Only downside is pushy sales tactics and having quotas that benefit your managers pockets but not yours."
good,"I would sit at my computer desk in my cubicle and log into the computer, put on my headset and take calls. Customer service was part of the job. Sales was the majority. I would get my systems up. The main system. Email. Chat. And log in and take calls. I would greet the customer with a friendly attitude. Assure them I would be more than happy to help them. I verified the account so as to maintain security. Once the accout was verified I would assure customer I was going to help them out and review their overall account ensuring they would get the best value for their services. Some customers had all services, TV internet and cell phone. Even then we offered on every call and I needed to think of some creative ways to do so. I enjoy the challenge and learned how to offer the customer an overall inter-grated solution for their entertainment needs. We had a 15 minute break, an hour lunch and another 15 minute break. I averaged about 20 calls a day. I really enjoyed the different scenarios which occurred but I did notice trends in call types. I loved our product and emphasized to my customers how much I valued them. You are the heart and soul of AT&T I would remind some customers. And they were too. The workplace culture was split. Some people really enjoyed their jobs and there was an overall happiness and good spirit. Some did not. "
good,"Very stressfull when trying to collect on past due accounts, but having to use soft collection tactics.  Not being given more freedom to assist customers properly and make suggestions to help bring accounts current and up to date."
good,"Perhaps it was just the store I was in, but my experience wasn't too great with the company.  I even told the manager during the interview to not hire me if my tattoo on my neck is going to be a problem. They went ahead and hired me anyways because my skillset was more important, but I was still harassed everyday by the assistant manager about it. My performance was never a problem, and my appearance was never a problem to any of my other co-workers or even the customers. Also they wouldn't give me a full-time position because they said I need to prove myself. I worked for apple prior to this job full-time for 4 years. I don't need to prove anything to anyone! Will never work there again and don't recommend it to anyone who is aiming to grow."
good,"Commission is always changing. You can make decent money if you apply yourself and bend over backwards. It can be a stressful job, it is pure sales. So be aware that you will be given quotas and goals to attain."
good,Working environment was quiet and allowed you to accomplish tasks. However the infrastructure was a bit of a challenge due to the many acquisitions.  The company had some growing pains in terms of merging together all of the different business solutions that were offered.
good,Frequent layoffs occurred. Job security is not there.  There is a shift in culture to more into collaboration zones and less supporting of remote support.
good,Todo bien pero sus cuotas son irrealistas y la presión es demasiada
good,"At AT&T you will grow in knowledge, and  feel like you are part of a big family. I always looked forward to going to work. I will miss being a part of the culture."
good,"at&t used to be a great place to work with many opportunities for advancement and a great culture. however, in the past 5 years that has dramatically changed. the current culture is focused on saving costs (i.e. layoffs) and creating a fake culture of ""family""."
good,"AT&T is great if you want to be pressured into selling their products and when i say pressured i mean pressured. One manager told me "" If they aren't buying anything get them off the phone"" (we were customer service and sales in a call center). The pay and commission was AMAZING!!! The best part about the job, they also did fun techniques to get you to sell but the pressure of it all was awful. If you weren't getting sales you would eventually get fired and they will find ANY reason to fire you (to standards) if you are not selling."
good,"Long hours, loads of conference calls. Abundance of training available to those that want it. Wireless side is required to fill  in for wireline side if they strike. Most of the people I worked with 9 years ago are still there. I just had to leave and focus on my life."
good,"July 2000 - December 2016; AT&T Inc - Wichita Falls, Document and report support activities, project advances, and help desk requests and resolutions"
good,"ATT offers a job. Pro: Health Benefits, Pension "
good,"If you're willing to put up with pushy management and selling products you don't believe in for good pay, then go for it. I started out very happy at AT&T, but depending on your management it can be a nightmare."
good,It was very stressful but great pay and benefits. AT&T is not family friendly at all. You have to be very adaptable and flow with changes easily. You also need to be able to learn computer systems quickly.
good,Company would be great if management would care about their employees besides what they do while working. Employees work harder for managers that actually care about the well being of their employees
good,"ATT is a very nice beginning platform to ensure steady income while being able to balance work and life schedules, it has its downsides which comes with any job in customer service but overall provides a chance to climb to higher positions given proven time and effort."
good,Start the work day at 8:00 AM and depart the yard by 8:30 AM at the latest. Install which ever services are on your work order and use which ever service wire that is required which is either fiber or copper. These come in aerial and buried depending on where the terminal is located.
good,Management was horrible. It was the worst. If the management was better. The job isnt hard and it is a good job. You stay up to date with the latest phones and services they have to offer. The quota and management is so toxic.
good,A typical day at work in my department involves engaging technicians in diagnosis and repair of equipment nationwide.  My department did not require a large amount of conference calls.
good,"Great people to work with, however in desperate need of a management and culture change. Opportunity to grow if you put the time in and benefits are in line with industry."
good,"It's a collection center and when I was there, I did like what I was doing, but management did not take the time to get to know employees.  It may be the Union atmosphere; but the Union was able to get a good pay scale and benefits."
good,"To be honest in my store, you had to kiss the store managers (you know. what) but don't get me wrong, it was a great company to work for...although 10 year employees got fired erroneously."
good,Overall this company has tried to stay true to their mission.  Provided opportunities to their employees to continue to grow in their career.  The management still is one of trying to empower their employees to make their own decisions while knowing they can go to their leadership for guidance if needed.
good,Hardest part of the job is to keep the customer from leaving. Tmobile is a large competitor and a lot of loyal customers tend to closed their accounts because of better offers
good,"Not much to tell, you come in and get on the phone and then leave once your shift is over, you go home. There is no learning about IT because you mostly will be completing ports and helping the reps with issues with the porting process."
good,"Too much work, not enough people. People are quitting and not being replaced. Management doesn't really show support for the workers. The job was good before ATT bought out Bellsouth."
good,"AT&T is good for promotion within the company.  Their training has been shorten and not giving enough time for a new hirer to learn all systems.  "
good,"Company seems to be chugging along and merging with other businesses. Layoffs happen. Not a lot of interesting work or using up and coming tools. Work life balance is manager dependent, but seems that most people do not have to work too many hours."
good,to much travel required    mthe managers were unskilled  and had never done  the jobs that there workers were doing and could not provide any advice or training
good,Great salary for job but no job security most jobs moved out of the country. Job that did not require degrees now require for same amount of work. Job titles being down graded for less pay.
good,It could be fun depends ur management . It could be stressful they are slow days  . They are quotas to hit every month. But I like I said everything depends where u work
good,"Legacy employee who left about 6 months after the merger, was very happy at DIRECTV for 7+ years and left for a better opportunity.  I had fun, great leadership, autonomy to do what I wanted and moved around quite a bit while I was there."
good,"the company offers great perks and benefits and gives you the option to grow within the company and branch out to differnt areas, but expect no work/life balance."
good,"Great job and benefits"
good,"AT&T pays good ."
good,"I enjoyed my position at AT&T, but not the annual ""surplus"" aka layoffs. It made things tense during the holidays which is when notifications went out that jobs were being cut. Unfortunately, I was one of those cut, even though I was a consistent performer at my job. So the culture itself isn't bad but the constant unease over job cuts is."
good,"You sit at a desk all day and field calls from mad people.  The management is wishy washy.  You might get a good one or a bad one, it just depends on how long you have been there."
good,If you do not work well under stress this is not the place for you.  Customers will be difficult of course in customer service and sales that is what you sign up for.  Managers like to create a fear factor work environment instead of finding out ways that motivate their reps to strive higher.
good,"Creo que necesitan más atencion al personal"
good,"Ambiente de trabajo dinámico con los implemento o herramienta necesarias para el buen desempeño laboral ya sea con compañeros o personal con capacitaciones constantes acerca de las funciones laborales, con ropa o vestimenta adecuada al trabajo que se realiza,horarios establecidos bajo leyes actualizadas y con contrato temporario o indefinido."
good,"AT&T was a bit of a roller coaster ride for me. My store went through 4 managers over the course of 2 months, and I was left at the store alone a month into my ""training"" leaving me to look foolish for customers as I didn't know how to operate the systems effectively yet. Over my year and a half, I was moved to three different stores and had a total of 6 managers. Training for the job was one week of virtual training, then two weeks of on the floor training - although I don't feel that is enough training for all of the different systems they use in store. The best thing AT&T did for me was to allow me to work part-time while in school. They don't hire part-time employees, so the fact that they made the exception for me was of tremendous help to me. The places that AT&T could really do better in terms of employment include: better management training, better payout structures for commission and better hours would be a plus too. At the store I worked at, there was only two shifts, an opening, and closing shift. Unfortunately, my manager thought it would be best if we had the same people working the same shifts each and every day. This is great for schedule managing, but closing the store each and every night is a bit of a hassle if I want to do anything else that night. Overall my experience was mediocre. I would recommend working there, but only if you are really good at persuading people to buy certain products over others."
good,It's ok   I really don't have much or know what to say. I don't know what you want me to say. It was an ok job. Ok.  I am not there anymore.  That's all.
good,Very friendly people but very stressful when people call screaming and cursing at you the whole time. They do offer a discount on your services as well as paid time off FMLA vacation ETC.
good,"-  Fast pace"
good,"It was very pleasant to work for AT&T. Unfortunately there're was an employee committing some type of fraud and the store was under investigation. I was originally working at the store located in Steinway street, Astoria, but the manager from Main Street, flushing asked me to transfer to his store to help out. As I transferred, 3 weeks later the entire store staff was laid off."
good,"Pay was great. Benefits were great. Very poor work/life balance. Not all management was bad but the regional in my area was very pressing and cut throat because everything and everyone was just a number. Workers who were faster and less safe got preferential treatment over workers who had better quality and were more safety conscientious. They also didn't coach on what the issues they had with their employees were. They would just assume get rid of you and replace you then coach you up to what they wanted. In other words, they were vague with the standards that they expected. One day its quality and the next you aren't going fast enough. In my mind, these two things are mutually exclusive."
good,"With AT&T you are a member of the hive, which comes with total freedom. The best thing you can do is start putting together side projects and tinkering around - as long as you can get your work done. They are going to expect results out of you, this place isn't just a joke. Please be prepared to work and to learn. If you want to mess around during the work day, no big deal. For many employees, having lunch or seeing that attractive member of the opposite sex is the thing keeping them moving along. There are plenty of trolls, but they get weeded out. AT&T will give you a chance. If you don't take the chance and humble yourself, you are going to get kicked in the face. Start working, you lazy azz. Don't try to smooth talk your way out of doing work, your contract will end. They end peoples' contracts without blinking. If you stay true to your skills and work honestly, you will get steady pay checks. It's decent money too, not the best in the biz, and still good."
good,"Your work life all depends on what crew your on. So some managers are really bad to work with others are great. I had 5 different managers while I worked there and three of them were terrible to work for all for different reasons. This is not a job to take if you plan on maintaining a social life though. The hours are often long, but the benefits are amazing. I do recommend joining the union if you work here they helped me and much of my crew deal with the tough managers in question from before. Overall good it's a good job with great benefits just occasionally will have a bad manager."
good,"AT&T is great at being a corporation. As long as you do quality work and enjoy working outdoors, you'll be happy there. It's almost all men and has a brotherly ""crew"" feeling to the environment."
good,"Management is lacking in certain stores. Incentives not what they once were. Everything goes based on seniority, which is perfect for sales reps that have been there for years, for the new people starting out that means you have the least favorable schedules."
good,I was oppressed during the buyout. They lowered my pay by 6 dollars an hour and were hiring people with zero experience at a higher pay rate. Worked another year hoping for a raise and did not see that at all
good,"Great pay, benefits, and retirement. However, somtimes the quailty life becomes more important to some of us. Ive dedicated 7 years to AT&T and wouldnt take them back. I owe everything I have learned to them, but I am done. I want a less stressful enviroment and a more structured schedule. You are required to give a 2 week notice of any vacation you plan on taking so the load can be adjusted for your absence, but they just force someone in on their day off to cover for them anyways. I woke up, Life is short, family is everything."
good,The culture at AT&T has changed over the years with all on the buy out and consolidation u multiple companies. It used to be that the company seemed to care about the people that worked for them and showed that. now you're just a nmber.
good,"Un ambiente laboral agradable, pero con muy pocas oportunidades de crecimiento en distintas áreas."
good,"AT&T wouldn't be half bad if they didn't cram DirecTV down the throats of its customers. They sit and observe you to see if you mention the DirecTV entertainment to your current customer and even after mentioning it to your customer, they will walk over if they hear an objection from your customer and try to persuade the customer into signing up. I think the atmosphere would be a little more relaxed and enjoyable if you weren't pressured with the thought of having to submit DirecTV."
good,"at&t runs an extremely tight ship, and it can be overwhelming for some if they arent familiar with how extreme professionalism works. Overall it is a great company to work with ."
good,"Depending on your long term goals and your skill set you may be a good fit. Also, if you are ok with favoritism in management at times. The company as a whole is more bottom-line driven and frontline employees are often not fully supported."
good,"Great pay if you’re a tenured employee. New employees good luck. Healthcare used to be free for employees now it’s over $300 per month and it covers hardly like it used to."
good,"In my 20 years at AT&T, I have witnessed inconsistency in the way employees have been hired or rewarded, and rarely is it on merit alone. Often, promotions are tied to ""who you know"" over what you've done."
good,"long day at work , paying good , you need to drive one day a week to the office to pick up equipment which is 40 minute driving on the opposite side  from your first  job"
good,"When you have a friendly positive manager and can work from home 2 days per week it is hard to complain. If you want to stay a long time, you must fit into the existing culture. Employee managers do not require the same high standards of themselves as they require for their vendors."
good,"AT&T is moving away from their traditional copper network and striving to be a totally wireless company as is able. In turn, less people are needed and down-sizing is common practice."
good,very productive company to build a solid career at. They are willing to help you succeed and advance in the company. They are understanding if you have urgent matters outside of work that needs attending
good,"I enjoyed helping customers and working with friendly coworkers. My last two supervisors were excellent. I learned how to troubleshoot, backup and train customers to use multiple types of wireless devices. Every day required high energy, ability to research and think outside the box while maintaining strict stats and protocols. "
good,"Most days were acceptable."
good,"If hired don't expect to stay long if your done can be done remotely."
good,This company was really good to the employees that worked there. We got very good bonuses and they did well with vacation. Overall a great comapnay to work for.
good,"Originally started in a call center as a representative.  Each office closed due to modern day technology.  Moved to IT Services as a Manager for the Corporate Helpdesk.  This job consisted of assisting company-wide employees with some of their issues that consisted of company applications, pc problems, payroll, HR, training and purchasing.  The company decided to give this department to non-management and outsourced out of state."
good,"AT&T has great benefits the pay is really good, no other company can compare with that."
good,"Very competitive environment where sales matter more than anything else. One-on-one coaching after every customer interaction, even if the customer was just coming in to pay their bill or ask a simple question. Supervisor wanted to know why you didn't offer them more products, and if you did, why they didn't buy everything in the store. Not my kind of work environment, but if you are good at it, you can make a lot of money. At the time I worked there the store was very understaffed and I made $1500/month in commission without even trying."
good,If you bring the money in your good and this must be done in less than 2 minutes. They keep you there with the goo benefits and money but they do not create a positive work environment
good,"I made good money working in the business sales division of AT&T and that was exciting. However, there is no opportunity to be promoted if you do not have seniority."
good,Marcar mi hora de llegada y prepararme para dar una buena atención a los clientes; buen ambiente de trabajo. Lo mejor fue el tratar de convencer a las personas para que compraran los productos. Lo más difícil es que no había mucho interés de las personas por conocer los artículos que ofrecía. :(
good,I absolutely loved working for ATT. The only thing that was a negative for me was the unlocking of commission percentages by selling Directv. This was definitely a moral killer.
good,"A typical day of work consists of being on the phone and answering customer questions. Questions may come in the form of billing or technical issues with equipment. There is an even mix of good mannered and angry customers to talk to. It is definitely a job that can seem difficult to start because the more experience and knowledge you have with solving customer issues specific to this industry and company, it will become easier and faster to calm customers down and resolve issues. This will become especially important as management cares a great deal about call statistics, such as call time and good resolution. You will see people having difficulty adapting to the job start rushing through calls to meet statistics without resolving the customer's issue due to being in trouble with their stats. Listening skills are a must."
good,Job advancement out of some positions is nearly impossible. The benefits are good but they could be better for as much stress that is considered “normal”. A lot of micro management but not-so-great techs seem to somehow get by. Constantly adding more responsibilities and sometimes there’s little to no training but sometimes you do training on mundane things.
good,They are very strict and doctors notes does not matter you only get 3 strikes period and you are fired. They literally came to get me out of the bathroom. Be prepared to be a robot and not get sick and have not one reason or excuse for the duration of your employment.
good,"Administrative assisting with back office & processing department"
good,"When working for Directv is was great, when At&t took over they cared less about their employees. They expected their employees to understand the training too fast and when it wasn't understood they immediately fired them."
good,"Fast paced environment. Installed cable and internet for customers. Get paid by pieces installed on the job. Worked outside, so at the mercy of the weather. Required to climb poles."
good,"Even though I was only working at AT&T for a couple months, I've learned a great deal about sales and technology. I have also enhanced my customer services skills."
good,"AT&T was a nice place to work prior to 2006, when the merger occurred with Cingular and the AT&T Landline culture took over everything changed.  Micromanagement and removal of all decision making at the regional market level was removed."
good,A typical day at work is usually high volume and high paced. AT&T releases new products regularly so learning a new product and how to position it was to our clientele was a common start to my shift. I learned how to stress benefits and overcome objections with re-enforcing the clients needs can and will be met and which our services best suit their needs. Our Management team was committed to our success and did their best to insure we were planning ahead. The hardest part of the job which was also the most enjoyable part of the job was making clients happy.
good,I worked at AT&T at a time when the company was entering the media/television business through the acquisition of DIRECTV.  This was particularly interesting because it clearly indicated that AT&T was all in in the delivery of entertainment and content through it's cross screen infrastructure.
good,"A normal day at AT&T was helping each and every customer that worked through the door, pushing for getting the most out of each customer by finding the right solution for them, such as if we offer you internet at your home try to up sell it as well as tv"
good,I worked at att for 18 years. I learned the meaning of dealing with change and embracing it. At att you had to be willing to accept change since change always happened but with training and management help we were all successful. It had a positive environment to work and very motivational as well. The pay was great as the benefits.
good,Usually work 8:00-4:30. May have to work 6 days a week for a month or more. Required uniforms are not made from the correct material for summer heat. Should be a cotton based to breath. Very physical job. Must be good at dealing with the public in their homes. Management is 100% by the book with companies policies. Safety is the highest priority. Too extreme where it hinders you getting the job done. My experience with the workplace culture was very low moral. High turn over. Hardest part of the job is working through and tolerating all kinds of IT software bug issues. From issues with the company phone to various bugs with TV equipment. Best part of the job is meeting some good customers and enjoy good conversations with them.
good,The company is typical corporate with all the benefits and pitfalls of such. A lot of great people including the managers but a lot of bureaucracy. The benefits were also being eroded.
good,"My Manager followed and taught the job expectations, but also provided ""freedom"" to the sales agents to maximize their performance.  I enjoyed working with my Manager and have our regularly scheduled meetings and conference calls to get together as a team."
good,"I worked on publishing side of house. we went from crown jewel to least favorite cousin at the family bar b q."
good,Overall a good place to work. Some managers were great while others were not. Fun and competitive place to work. The culture was somewhat unprofessional.
good,"I was there 6 years. It had good benefits and paid decent to live. However, the way the company works the way they treat employees and the things they make you do are unbelievable."
good,"Job was great, pay was outstanding, overall possibility to achieve company standards were impossible.Should you work in a location that doesn't have a lot of traffic, you could be relieved of your position."
good,Very Stressful work evnvironment.  Working here is like being in a pressure cooker. Many deadlines to meet and many jobs to manage a one time with not much help.
good,"I went back to Nova Scotia after i got laid off at Nortel, My sister was working there, so i took the job to stay busy, answer call and trouble shooting problem, find the best phone plans for individual people."
good,"Good benefits - poor job security"
good,AT&T was a great company to work for. A typical day included coming to work and being treated like you were family. I learned discipline in working with all aspects of customers. This was a fairly easy job and the most enjoyable part of it was when I was given the opportunity to train new hires.
good,Good company to work for. Culture is a bit tough at times.. very corporate feeling. Depending on department flexible working hours and corporate structure. Plenty of opportunity for development
good,"Fun entertaining, learning everyday and growing friends and strong mentors. Great first step in creating a career direction with many different facets."
good,I personally wouldn’t go back to work for  AT&T because it was too stressful  and I have a family if you have a family and you actually want to spend time with family I would strongly suggest finding something else but if you single and you like to work and you like have been hours this will be the perfect job for you
good,"Need to get every customer to sign up for tv. If they dont you get talked for an hour about why they didnt regardless of if they already had it or not. Manager didnt help with a transaction after I was told to ask for help. He left for 2 hours for lunch instead. "
good,Typical day at work was delivering training materials to new hire techs. AT&T is very unforgiving on matters of COBC. The Management is fair giving advancement when earned. The work place culture is great. The hardest part of the job is staying current on new technology and training materials. The most enjoyable part is the transfer of knowledge.
good,must be able to multi-task and open to change. hardest part of the job was the continuous lay offs. most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits and pay.
good,I spent over 10 years working with this company and the product. They eventually decided to sideline the product i worked with and eliminated my position.  I have nothing negative to say about the company or my coworkers.
good,My years at AT&T helped to shape my character and develop my professional skills in business. I believe it is the a great first step into the corporate world.
good,Very busy environment with great perks. A little pushy on the little promotions but overall a good experience. I'd recommend this type of sales job to someone starting out. It teaches how to multitask and how to communicate with a client while performing basic info entry and attention to detail while working with a lot of numbers such as phone numbers and serial numbers on products.
good,"Good company to work for with regard to a constantly changing environment and company provided learning tools and education with very good Benefits. On the other hand, the cost cutting on expenses creates an atmosphere of uncertainty on certain Jobs."
good,"I really enjoyed working for AT&T, my expectations were to retire from the company. AT&T went through many changes while I was employed there, as far as products we sold. It was always challenging to keep up with those changes and to be able to continue to meet sales quotas, while receiving many excellent compensations while doing so. There was a Surplus in my Call Center, which was the reason for my leaving after so many years."
good,"The company allows you to learn and to improve on areas of the business, however I would never recommend this company as it is always looking to downsize or outsource.  Employees mean nothing at this company."
good,"I have a neutral opinion and prefer not to disclose any of my thoughts regarding this company, it's policies, environment, or any other attribute associated to same."
good,"This employment was a 4 day per week - 10 hour per day position. Most of the calls pertained to wireless phone accounts, billing, phone activations, how to use and troubleshooting wireless product issues. The last few months  providing training in a virtual environment. My favorite part of the position was helping customers resolve their issues and the opportunity to assist with the virtual training for incoming CSR's."
good,Good work life balance but little to no opportunities for advancement. The company is constantly going through layoffs to reduce costs and few opportunities to move laterally or vertically.
good,Everything was ok except for my manager. She liked to motivate through fear and it caused a lot of drama in the office. When she wasn't around it was a great place to work.
good,"Working at AT&T, you can definitely tell that this is one of the largest and most powerful companies in the world, and that you are just a small replaceable speck in the grand scheme of things. Overall, I did not have much of a problem with this, but the fact that you were not allowed to even request single days off even if it was well in advance, nor were you able to even guarantee a vacation day until over a year of working there rubbed me the wrong way. Throw in an armed robbery and a very poor handling of me, and employee that was assaulted, and you have a recipe for me looking for a new job."
good,"AT&T was pretty cool. Sucks that it was only an internship. The employees were awesome, energetic, and really passionate about the work they did for the company. The management switch a lot, which was not so good. But that would be my only complaint."
good,"Very different management types makes adjusting a little difficult, but if you are a well adjusted person, you should fit in well. Many times senior management will make decisions that have adverse effects on downstream work force that appear illogical and arbitrary."
good,"The pay was great and benefits were fair. Most people were in good moods but management was so so. "
good,I would give my AT&T work experience a 3 star review out of 5 stars. The last 7 months of my tenure at AT&T were not positive. Three years of my tenure at AT&T were great. I was very grateful to have the opportunity to work for them and will always remember the first three years fondly. The surplus experience was a very negative one for me.
good,If you are good at selling wireless and home services in an high pressure environment then you will be good at this job.  The benefits are great.  In the call center you will work evenings and weekends your 1st yr or two.
good,"Got laid off after 12+ years of working there. Got re-hired within the company. They wouldn't relocate me when i moved to Oregon, so i quite and got a new job in Oregon."
good,"I retired from AT&T, when I started it was Southwestern Bell which was the better company who cared about the customer.  I enjoyed working for Southwestern Bell and SBC not so much for AT&T."
good,Sales Associate at AT&T authorized retailer is a decent job for a college student. daily work routine not too strenuous. I straight forward routine. Protocols for everything.
good,Great place to work and earn good money. Advancement is halted due to the many layoffs. Job security is sometimes in question. While employed take advantage of the many training programs and additional learning tools offered to employees at little to no cost
good,"Poor Management, AT&T needs to respect employees more!! It is a great company as far as benefits. All employees are taken care of when it comes to health care."
good,"Att gives very great benefits and the pay is well, however that is because it is a very difficult job. The training is limited, the metrics are unobtainable, and the union is worthless."
good,Never felt that they truly cared about the employees! They were more focused on moving all jobs  overseas than in the United States! They will eventually have no full time employees all contractors!
good,"It was not a bad place to work at all. My department was losing money, and starting to close multiple locations across the country. Good people and a good company."
good,They only care about what you do not about you unless you luck on a manager but that manager can only do so much. But the perks are great. And they do have a quota so as long as you met it your are ok.
good,"att is a company that pays well, it has gone under a lot changes but if you have the chance to work for them it is has good benefits. recently the company has shift their positions and that has caused a lot uncertanity and cuts."
good,"I worked for att corporate for 6 years . the pay and benefits are amazing couldn't ask for better. the hours when first starting are usually going to be closing shifts until you move up in seniority. management can be a hassle because goals are sometimes way un achievable and observations can be a  beat down. it is a stressful job being face to face with customers all day long because they aren't always all great, the good ones make up for the bad however. I loved the people I worked with we became a big family . be aware tho , I was going to be fired due to a peer who I didn't get along with submitting things I had posted on a private social media page to HR, att has a zero tolerance social media policy, so I quit first ."
good,Great friendly work environment. Managers  were easy to deal with when asking questions. Somewahat helpful when days off were mandatory @ home. Enjoyed it!
good,"Works on a seniority based system, so if you're new, expect to work most nights and every. single. weekend. The workplace culture is very nice, although they are very strict about DirecTV sales and that is where you make most of your money. Overall, I don't get stressed out and sad when I have to go into work, but it's like a lot of other retail sales jobs where you have to deal with some snobby customers."
good,"During a typical content management assignment, I collaborated online with a team working from sites across the U.S. We created, edited, and published marketing for AT&T products, usually on tight timelines. Later, I focused more exclusively on creating and managing DIRECTV NOW Help Center content. I enjoyed collaborating with and assisting the various stakeholders, including marketing, legal, and front-line customer service operators. The highlight of any day always consisted of successfully publishing the timely, clear, correct, and eye-catching content we'd been working on."
good,The environment is fast paced and you have to deal with many rude customers. The calls are recorded and listened to so you have to make sure you handle the customers with patience. The customers can survey you and if they give you a bad survey and you did all you can you will still be called into the office and counseled.
good,"This is definitely a sales environment. It is not the most relaxed environment, as you may get pressure from management to hit your sales quotas individually and for the store. I would say the most challenging part about sales at AT&T is the Vast Variety of products you need to sell. Most customers come in for cell-phone related services, and you are expected to sell products like Digital Life (security system), DirecTV, and Internet."
good,"At&t was a fun environment, that encouraged you to learn the product, and find key points to uncover the customer needs. Making the transition to management was different. I was promoted within my store. I learned that through repetition, I was making sells, top seller for home solutions in my district."
good,"Company going through restructure - lots of change. Limited opportunities for upward mobility. Management does not reward high performers. Great place to work if you want to coast into retirement, they rarely do rate/ranking reductions. Once you're in, you'll likely have a job till retirement"
good,"Low traffic was promised raises that didn't happen sales quotas were were extremely high for the volume of traffic that we had, management was good decent job for someone with no experience"
good,"Directv as a whole cared about their employees.  When AT&T bought Directv, suddenly employees became just another number and less valued.  Everything became more centered around how much money they can make, instead of taking care of the customers first or employees."
good,it is a great company to work for but difficult to advance to higher positions. Great benefits and discounts on their products. Pay is good but jobs are scarce.
good,"wages for the job was not good for the work provided they worked us to the bone and payed us nothing, although the benefits were good and the feild managers were good"
good,Very quota oriented.  Expected to sell something to a customer who has come in extremely angry about something.  They are more concerned with squeezing blood from a turnip than providing good customer service.
good,"great opportunity to learn, relaxed individual work. enjoyed what I did until the management team nitpicked, harassed, stalked me on the job, if not for that would be an ideal place to work"
good,"A typical day at at&t as a wire tech is acknowledging your work order which you learn how to properly use it on your own, good company to work for but there are a lot that techs don't have control off. Hardest part if learning all of the not covered training which you learn on your own in the field."
good," Providing a warm welcome to customers in the chat interaction. Assisting them with their"
good,Everyone seems to get burned out easily and quickly. Back to back calls. Doing the same thing day in and day out. There is no time between calls to really get to know people you sit right next to. Benefits were better than my boyfriend's.
good,"the job was like subcontracting installs, each tech was responsible for materials scheduling jobs and completing the schedule.I personally learned a great deal such as, how to locate satellites,cabeling techniques,and interacting with customers.the management was an ever changing event though,which led to a lack of pay raises"
good,I've worked with some great people throughout my career at At&t in my 21 years and counting but  I do not see me retiring here due to downsizing which was my ultimate goal.
good,No work life balance.Worked very long hours and days. Pay was very competitive. Very difficult to promote beyond Management in retail environment unless someone retires or leaves the company.
good,My time at AT&T was very nice and I was disappointed when my contract ended. Unfortunately this company is going through a lot of layoffs that is making the employees very uneasy.
good,"The training you get is excellent. The actual work is non-stop. The policies are changing constantly. It is a lot to keep up with. You are very much micromanaged. They record your screen activity and your calls and judge you by everything you do. This is okay I guess, it is just very difficult if you are a perfectionist to always having your inadequacies thrown in your face. I felt helpless most of the time. I also felt that metrics were preventing me from really helping people."
good,"Working here was okay. Other than the set times to work based on seniority, everything was cool. Overtime was optional & always available if you want it."
good,"Understand that AT&T is one of the biggest global companies. Too big for its own good when it comes to business sales. There's a different system for each product that you sell with different order managers. The higher you go in customer size, the more your compensation is based off of Total Billed Revenue. They set your account base to its current billed amount plus a growth percentage. You only get paid if you're about 92% or above to that number. They don't adjust it even though prices continually drop in telecom and multi-million dollar customers have to have contracts written down to stay with AT&T. Nobody in my region was paid on TBR because of this and it was 50%+ of our compensation. So basically its been do well, get promoted, make less money. "
good,"Its a hard job due to the politics and micromanaging "
good,Loved working there and they completely stiffed me and kept me on an intial 6 month contract  for a total of ten months. The merger with direct tv was not a smooth transition and a lot of my peers also lost thier jobs over the lies they were told by at&t about direct tv services
good,"Company started out fine, compensation changed as you are now required to sell more services while earning less money. Pressure from management is consistent."
good,The company has good pay and benefits but very stressful environment especially for the newcomers who are still learning the business as a wire technician.
good,"Good job from the beginning, like being your own boss, but the union and the company have slowly eroded the ideology of keeping employees happy and secure. It isnt Pac-Bell anymore its a corporation that only thinks of you as a number"
good,Rewarding work culture with opportunities to expand professional skills in many different organization within the company.  The constant fast pace and competitive landscape of the industry brings with it many personal and professional rewards.
good,"AT&T is trying to improve as a place to work to be more attractive to new and recent grads. If you have been here awhile, you will rarely be paid the market rate because raises don't keep up with the market. Benefits are pretty good and vacation builds up the longer you stay. The company is going through changes, particularly around span of control for directors and above, meaning promotion opportunities are fewer. It is a good company with good people."
good,Spring Mobile bout the retailer and treated their employees like dirt. Cut everyone paycheck by 50% cut throat company that dont care about the employees that were loyal and good people shame on them !!!!!
good,"New products and services are unclear and hard to sell. Use to be alot of fun and exciting to work at at&t but now its all about selling."
good,"After creating good documentation, I have seen the users in my facility solve their own IT problems. They have had to reach out to ATT helpdesk less. We all have come together to report and fix problems, keeping this building running smoothly."
good,"Buen Ambiente de Trabajo"
good,Great co-workers. Poor management. Just want warm bodies to do work whether sick or in good health. Great pay but very stressful company that will cut you loose if you become ill.
good,AT&T Call Centers are not geared to family life.  Many times when you have no seniority you are stuck working hours where you are not able to pick up your children from school.
good,"In my time at Bellsouth/AT&T I found many things to be rewarding and I learned a lot in my many roles with the company. My disappointment comes after working with them for nearly 17 years and receiving many awards and recognitions for outstanding performance and leadership they decided to add me to the latest round of surpluses.  It is very disheartening after all the consistent hard work I have and continue to perform for them.  I feel somewhat betrayed because I love my job, the company and it's benefits. Being part of the surplus saddens me."
good,hourly pay isn't great. had to work a lot of ot to get by. bad fro family life. My manager on the other hand was awesome and would definitely love to work with someone like that again.
good,The people were organized the schedule was up to you to work as many hours as you want to with commission also for overtime and sales. The census was very interesting. The open angle of the office was neat we all had out own cubicle also.
good,"Take Inbound calls for dsl internet. Learned how to trouble shoot internet and basic pc issues. Management is awesome great environment. Job was for the most part pretty easy. Love the job, the people, and the 2nd family I made at att."
good,"typical day at work is handling avaya, and infront of the computer since we always wait for inbound phone calls from different states of america mainly dealing with at&t u-verse"
good,I worked their four years and they decided there was a surplus of people in the area so they laid all of us off. Even tough there was more work than we could handle. Right place wrong time. Att logic is confusing.
good,"Please be on time"
good,"Decent Company to work for. Has many amazing benefits, working for a company that size offers a lot in the way advancement. Politics and Networking go hand and hand so do be afraid to reach out"
good,"AT&T offers competitive pay with great benefits along with a great opportunity to grow professionally. Unfortunately, AT&T is slowly becoming a Comcast replica. Sales/making a sale trumps everything and moral compasses are ignored more and more often. Yes, this is true of most large corporations, but it was less noticeable when I started 6 years ago."
good,"A typical day was answering inbound calls helping customers with billing, plans there're on advising on different rate plans , excepting payments, resolving phone issues. That the rate plans offered by the company were really good, management was for the most part ok, the hardest part was explaining why the bill was higher, advising a resolution to a billing issue."
good,SBC was always a very good place to work.  It could be high stress at times however that is usually balanced out in the long run.  Benefits were decent.
good,Learned how to deal with customer problems. must be patient and listen to every customer's needs. Pay important attention to detail. Standing for a long period of time on a shift. not enough people working with you. you can learn a lot information in technology.
good,"At&t is poorly managed. Very cut throat sales tactics. My life was threatened by a Co worker in front of a manager and they have decided that she was just joking and it was a ""figure of speech"" they will allow certain people do whatever they want.  But they will threaten to write you up if you don't meet your sales goals."
good,"I enjoyed working for this At&t. The company was supportive, reliable, structured and provided a workplace that I felt comfortable  in."
good,Sales and customer service are not the same don't hire people and call it light sales when its 90 % sales and 10% customer service. It should not be advertised as customer Service.
good,"Stressful and demanding with very few opportunities for advancement."
good,its a good job if you have no kids and are young. the workplace was fun but it has its stressful moments like any job. id recommend this job to anyone to get started after high school or college.
good,"The job itself is not very difficult. You need a basic knowledge of Android and iOS software, but you'll learn more while on the job. You get to learn about (and sometimes play with) all the new and upcoming tech from different companies (Samsung, LG, Apple, etc)"
good,AT&T is a good paying job except their numbers quota at the end of the month. If your numbers are poor then your job will suffer at the end of the month. Then your manager cohearse's you to resign before you pass your one year probation so they won't fire you so you won't collect unemployment.
good,"Talking to customers over the phone, getting to know how businesses worked and what was needed to improve. How they started their business......................................................................................."
good,"When I started working at AT&T in 2002 it was the most amazing job. Selling yellow pages was a win/win! Businesses were seeing a huge return on investment and if you worked hard you could make a ton of money! When I left in 2008 it was the most heart breaking ordeal. They had cut our commissions in 1/2, my sales objective was  a negative 1% & management had gone from a group of successful sales people to a group of unsuccessful salespeople that were in leadership positions because of nepotism & I mean everyone in a leadership position was related to each other... The internet killed the yellow pages...."
good,I can not give any opinions about a typical work day at att.  I have learned many investigative techniques working at att.  The workplace culture is very diverse.
good,It isn't for everyone. It's a lot of work and it requires you to be able to no longer have much of a life. You have no flexibility in how you sell. You follow the formula or get written up.
good,Up until this year the job was great and meeting your stats was a wonderful and playful adventure. We had a recreation room to go to during breaks to relieve the stress. The customers at AT&T have now learned to use the app to make their payments so collections has become harder to meet. Upper management changed hands at the beginning of the year and up until then it was a wonderful place to work. My manager was great in coaching us on his team to better ourselves. Now AT&T is cutting back and last month let 8 managers and one in HR go. These people had put in many years and it was sad that this call center seems to be on the path as that of the Sprint call center in Blountville that shut down. Up until this year this place was the place to work because of the fast pace and enjoyment in doing a great job for a great company.My ratings above were rated on the company as it is today and I fear it will eventually close.
good,You must meet a certain amount of repairs/install every day. these numbers are checked daily. You are not able to transfer to the another department unless done by management.
good,Not the greatest but pays the bills. They have great benefits the job is not too difficult constantly changing. I just dont believe they are looking out for the best interest of employees or customers.
good,"Training provided for collections operator, but once on the floor, expected to also provide customer service responsibilities and be able to help customers with new phone plans, change plans, issue credits, etc."
good,"Fun place to work. Competitive, yet friendly environment. They have made it harder and harder to get paid (commission-wise). Like many businesses, the right people don't always get promoted. Gained a lot of professional and personal skills at this job."
good,The job is super high paced and a lot of multitasking. Sometimes way to competitive that the customers end up losing quality service since you have to cut their call short. Company was awesome until they combined sales and service. It will be extremely difficult to meet sales goals when they give you mostly service calls. If you can manage to do the work you will be paid really well and benefits only thing is I heard from a current employee/friend that they are paying less now.
good,"All together the whole time I worked at the call center (which is no longer there) it was a good place to work, good friends, ok managers with good benefits. They scheduled you however they need, nights, weekends. A typical day would be taking about 30 - 40 calls, assisting customers with anything to do with cell phones, I learned how to handle stress at this job, it is a stressful job. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
good,Just see the ratings I gave above. I guess it can somehow give you an overview of what I had in this job. No need to give very specified answers on this.
good,"Daily I would have to service customers looking to have New service installed, and or repairing services to customers who were having problems with their services at any given time."
good,There is no place for advancement unless you know someone already within the company.  I did learn a lot while working there and I enjoyed going to work until I was recently laid off.
good,"Typical work- Planning and executing - coaching and developing agents. Fast pace - typical call center operation. Lots  of training."
good,"Days usually ran 12-14 hours."
good,"Job Description/Duties - As expected and then some"
good,its a okay places to work. No advancement but good work life balance. pay could be higher. but benefits outweight some lower salary gaps. too many changes currently and uncertain future.
good,"typically dealt with rumors, speculations, as well as unethical and inconsistent directions for employees. inconsistent scheduling and not accommodating. Very little room for advancement from CSR due to the lack of turnover in management. I would not recommend this job to anyone who has children to support (due to the varying schedules), or anyone who cannot operate in a fast paced, high stress environment."
good,Typical day on the customer service side would be back to back phone calls with customers for 8 to 10 hours a day. It does include some sales as well as well as customer service.
good,"I am a contractor working for Ryder Logistics on an AT&T Construction Yard.  I enjoy the atmosphere while performing my duties for the AT&T Managers, Technicians and company."
good,"Sales is full of cimpetition, so if you are not competitive, this would not be for you. Must be very motivated, fast, and ready to sell!! Goal oriented and pay based off of commission."
good,"To be successful, you have to be willing and able to change constantly.  The company offers great incentives for selling, and great benefits.  Overall a great company to work for."
good,"Coaching and developing, inspiring and motivating associates. Monitoring growth and success of associates. Open and honest feedback with immediate on the spot coaching. Excelling in department metrics and customer service on a consistent  basis. Great atmosphere!"
good,"If you want to work all day, every day...this is for you. Vacation timing is good but you will have little holidays to spend with family. Attendance is very strict here. As a new hire, you will more than likely not be able to get the schedule you want for quite some time, so expect to work all holidays and nights."
good,AT&T is a great place to gain technical expertise in all facets of wirless communications. The company however is not stable enough to ensure job stability.
good,Just like any other sales job you have the opportunity to make a lot of money. It can vary by location and management. Working for Spring was enjoyable until they recently changed the pay structure and have added a great deal of pressure to store managers. Due to that my manager changed into a micro managing robot and has made it unbearable to work there anymore.
good,flex hours for management is the culture and most managers are easy to get along with. good benefits and great vacation time off if you can build the tenure.
good,I learned a lot during my brief time in the United States Air Force.  It taught me a lot of good values that I still apply to my life today...........
good,"At AT&T Mobility, the customers can be challenging at times but thats what made work more enjoyable. Meeting new people and helping them resolve there was a plus."
good,"The management of the company will drive the normal person insane."
good,I worked in a couple different areas and the stores are not run the same everywhere. Company has excellent training and trainers. Still a union employer so some things are out dated but always treated fair. Enjoyed my time with this employer.
good,Working at AT&T is really a great career to have. I started when my division was actually BellSouth. Typically the stress level of the environment is not very stressful.
good,"Interesting place to work for, with high personal benefits should you choose to interpret challenges as growing opportunities. The company provides many challenges, however well compensation. "
good,Excellent training--excellent benefits--paid holidays--good pay---choice of job sites---chances for advancement ---some paid college courses--free parking
good,"This job was at Directv. It was in the process of being bought by At&t. I was not particularly fond of my time at At&t and when they took over and started implementing their management style it change to what I remember form my time before.They are not as friendly as Directv, their workplace culture is old school, show up and work. They moved away from our policies of how to treat a customer, to more how much can we increase ARPU."
good,It has been too long since i worked here to provide a valid review. So please take this review with a grain of salt. It was a good place to work and provided competitive compensation.
good,Directv was an exceptional place to work for. Once At&t took over that tried to fix a system that worked and failed. The work environment is highly stressful. If you can't deal getting yelled at on the phone do not bother applying. The staff is excellent. I have zero complaints with the leaders they have all been very nice atnnd friendly as well as willing to help.
good,"When the company was Directv, it was an amazing place to work at. We were bought out buy AT&T, company values changed and it became less enjoyable for myself. Its still an okay place to work at, just not the change that I wanted to see happen."
good,"At&t was a learning curve for me, having to deal with a call center enivorment for the first time. Although I had some great moments there trying to move within the company was a bit hard and trying to met all that they wanted you to met and not be acknowledge for it was not fair."
good,another typical sales and customer service job it was fun managing a crew 4 i loved how we could go out and market and the commission base was nice as well.
good,Work was not bad and the company is stable.  Management was good and benefits were excellent.  The only downside is process gets in the way of being productive and has created a poor work environment.
good,"Att was definitely a growing experience and has taught me so much.  I certainly appreciate all that this company has given me.  Had it not chosen to relocate my job to another state, I would still be working there."
good,"Great pay, but always nervous about layoffs. Never feel secure. BellSouth was so awesome! They treated you like family, whereas ATT treats you like a number. I don't feel valued. When they first merged with BellSouth, they were great, but as more and more were taken away by ATT (SBC Global), things got tougher. The pay keeps a lot of us there. The ongoing attendance meetings and constant blaming employees for issues, so as office closings, adds stress. At the end of the day, it feels good to tell others i work for ATT... It's just a lot of stuff with that."
good,Must keep up with an ever changing environment. Pay is fine but advancement is limited. Upward mobility is limited as well. Great place for a college student to enter corporate America.
good,"A typical day would be to load daily jobs assigned from internal customer of various departments, to make changes to end user customer billing such as basic customer data, phone numbers, added or subtract services, to correct taxes, surcharges, bill messages. I learned how to make a simple change to customer billing based of same criteria that would have a positive effect on a large customer data base."
good,AT&T was a fun job while I was in college. Their sales training was a stepping stone for my sales career. The AT&T corporate stores have moved to more of a customer service store.
good,"Working as a manager has made me a better person in and out of work.  I love working with people, handling business accounts, and the merchants that come into the stores.  "
good,Commissioned phone sales in a fast paced retail environment great work environment not a lot of foot traffic. tough sale quotas low pay and 30 minute lunch breaks unpaid
good,"My daily routine was to complete an inventory check on my truck and be sure that the truck was operable. A typical day included completing 2-4 jobs a day, installing and repairing internet and cable, occasionally alarms systems as well. The job was great however it had its difficult days also,  where you would have problems. I ran into dealing with more difficult  jobs that could last all day such as; problems from old wired homes and having to install all new cables, two business having wires mixed up at the box and more. The job gives training but most things are learned on the job and this causes conflict with management. They allow you a certain amount of time per-job and that time sometimes isn't enough. Example I had a job were a lady couldn't figure out why her TV screen was black the solution was simply changing the input on her TV and explaining to her how to resolve the problem for the future, giving you 1 hr to 1 1/2 hr to do this while your next call you get an installation job needing new wire  run  but there is no crawl space and the customer doesn't want you drill any holes in their walls. Find a solution and finishing the installment can take 2 to 3 hr, but you are given 1- 2 hr to finish. The job overall was great and I learned so much from being a Premise tech. I recommend the job."
good,"Att is a great place to work, Yet you do have to be prepared for cahnges at th drop of a hat, If you need to do major home based things you would really need to assure yourself that you have supprt at home."
good,When I worked for AT&T you learn that you must allow this job to become your life. Most of my coworkers did not have families and the ones that did had a very large turnover rate. The job has great benefits and opens doors for you that most companies can not but I would not recommend this company to anyone that wants a healthy work and home life balance. I personally was at a store that they had issues with management and went through 4 store managers in my just shy of 2 years employed. I enjoyed working for AT&T don't get me wrong they hired me with no previous experience in the field invested money and time in my training and helped me a lot when I became ill I just believe the company has a lot to change to become a better company.
good,"AT&T continues to get leaner... working on the premise of lowering cost, increasing output and increasing quality.  Great premise, however difficult in practice with all of the reorganization occurring because of the major purchases over the past several years."
good,Commission based pay. Not much room for advancement. Obtained a great amount of sales experience while working this position.  Good management.  Worked with their employees usually.
good,"Selling Direct TV is a great chance to give the customers a good product in a personable way. It is paramount to be skilled in sales in majority of industries, and Direct TV is good to train you."
good,It was a very pleasent workplace and management team was very willing to help. I had to face daily costumers concerns about their products and guide them toward fixing various technical issues. I really enjoyed helping people and solving their problems. I gained a lot of communication skills and I developed my critical thinking.
good,"Working with Veterans. I experienced a lot of interesting views.and knowledge. Unfortunately, the Company was being restructured in response to Monopoly Issues."
good,Installations are easy.. if you are a quick learner you should be ok.. technology is always changing so u have to learn more and more.. so patience I key..
good,"AT&T is a good place to work and they have decided to change their old ways of thinking and they are trying to create a better work place for their employees. However, they still have a long way to go to change that mindset in all areas of the business. Communication between other departments is a constant struggle and there no signs of the company wanting to improve on this."
good,"While I was at AT&T, I learned how to become and all round good sales rep. I learned how to research information to better my sales technique to better my experience with customers."
good,"no room for advancement, but in your Union job, you will make above average wages. Be prepared to be tethered to you phone for 90% of the day, however. Management team is down to earth, however they also have money to make. If you are not hitting your numbers, they are not getting paid. So though they are human, they are also business people and you will be fired if you cannot perform."
good,"it was a good company to work for, great benefits, but can't be late or calling out because for fun it's a point system, once a rep accumulate 8 points the sale rep might get terminated..."
good,Loved the company the springfield call center had awful management and used scare tactics to increase production. Retail stores are great to work for just be cautious with the call center
good,I enjoyed my time there hate the center was surplused but that's business but the company as a whole was great to work for and really enjoyed the management team there
good,The job was hard because we had to use strong persuassion skills to  change the customers mind. The company culture was very relaxed and the relationships between coworkers was excellent.
good,"I enjoyed my time with AT&T.  The work was challenging and everyone was helpful.  Some of the programs used by AT&T were difficult to master so it was necessary for the co-workers to work together so that everyone could master each program we worked in.  "
good,Working for AT&T is a good experience for someone who likes sales. You can make good money but the pressure is very high to meet sales goals. I will recommend this job for someone who loves interacting with people.
good,I appreciate the stores that create a healthy work environment. Other places have unrealistic daily goals considering the amount of customer service that needs to be done in store.
good,This is not applicable and should not determine my eligibility for other employment.  I do not think this should be included on any type of application process.  Your website will not just take a simple answer so I am basically repeating myself so I can complete the application process.
good,I enjoyed my 18 years with AT&T and hated to see it end. The company was very challenging and allowed me to add or improve a lot of skills.
good,Fast paste environment. Learned how to multi task effectively. Management was always available for help. Co workers were focused on earnings. The hardest part of the job was the scheduling.
good,Really strict with safety..Good place to retire from if you cab get past the nonsense.Very large company!! All communications done by email.
good,AT&T offers many opportunities for career growth. I was afforded the trust and recognition of my leaders as well as my peers and subordinates. Management is willing to mentor others to help advance their careers and grow in the business. AT&T is team environment set to meet its business goals.
good,"A typical day at work would include us contacting customers to verify requests for bill reprints, requests for adjustments and handling as many cases as possible. What I learned is that the management has unrealistic expectations for their workers and make the goals unattainable. I loved the people I worked with but, did not like the constant nit picking from managers. The most enjoyable part of my day was being able to assist customers solve their concerns in one call."
good,"Fast paced environment, sometimes too fast. More intensive training on merchandise and how it works would assist employees"
good,"As as sales consultant, I learned how to build value with customers by asking asking qualifying and general question to meet their needs and exceed company goals.  As a top salesmen, I was often placed as a team leader for various competitions within the store to help drive sales."
good,"I was hired for a Customer Support Sales position. My acquired skills, level of professionalism, and knowledge made me a perfect candidate for this position. I enjoyed my clients, and my co-workers greatly. There was very little if any interaction with management. We were advised that the company advised against it. The enjoyable part of the job is that no two clients were alike, each scenario was completely different, which presented challenges along with something new every day. What I disliked was the same skill level I was hired for was taken away, The job became scripted and the calls were timed. Taking care of the client was no longer a priority. The priority for this position is now Sales and Metrics.."
good,"Learned how important it was to make customer's happy. Was the hardest worker they had  and always, enjoyed every bit of the working with the company."
good,"Typical work was great because the freedom that the job allowed."
good,"Great Pay and its easy to advance if you know the right peoples. It can be tough some days,but thats with any job. I have nothing negative to say about At&t."
good,"AT&T Wireless was a fun and challenging and a very good place to work and have a career, also had very good management and support."
good,"Working at AT&T is very fun because you're allowed to work and showcase everything you learned in training. The coworkers are helpful and considerate and always literally a phone call away. They make you feel like you're family and will do anything to ensure you get your job done."
good,"How to manage a retail store"
good,"AT&T has amazing training and really takes care of their new hires. There is amazing room for advancement and the pay can be unbelievable. On the larger regional and national scale, it's extremely well structured and organized, however its a roll of the dice when you're starting out if you will be under good management or not. The professionalism and atmosphere can very greatly from one location to another. One store may have professional management with a welcoming atmosphere, while another store only 45 minutes away under different management may be like the ""cool kids club"" that is impossible to fit in to and is run like the wild west with double standards and no rhyme or reason. Overall great company, just hope that when you're new that you are able to be placed in a more professional location (normally the slightly larger city stores)"
good,"Transfered into U-verse from SBC Video Services and worked for them for 5.5 years. Started to have trouble with the lack of time at home, I would like to get back into a steady career and find a new line of work."
good,"One of the top companies in the world for a reason. but if you plan on having a family life, you might have to think again. great pay, ok benefits, poor work life balance."
good,"fun place to work, potential to make a lot of money if you like sales, co workers are great they will come and help you side sell, management is good but sometimes they micromanage, and most enjoyable part was that everyone was so close it was like everyone was best friends"
good,Company is downsizing good workers and high achievers.  Managers need more training on how to supervise and coach employees.
good,"AT&T is a ""union-based"" company. Therefore, the people that have been there the longest are considered for advancement, scheduling, and benefits...not the top performers. There is a ""do enough to get by"" mentality that I honestly couldn't see myself being a part of any more."
good,Had fun times. Met good people. Enjoyed working here. Gained alot of experience with different scenarios day by day. Hardest part of the  job were the unbelievable productivity goals that were being asked for.
good,"People are great. Good compensation for a Customer Service Rep II. There always seems to be a threat of the job site closing...I don't know if that is to keep our production up and expectations low. Never the less they are still open and we have learned a heck of a lot. Our operations manager takes on every challenge, he states in order to keep the place open, and does it without getting us a raise. So we keep getting more training and better at our job but our classification still only shows us as a Customer Service Rep II when we are some of the highest level technicians in all of AT&T Mobility...I find that a hoot. (we meaning all the reps in the call center)"
good,"you work a lot, get overtime, on call when needed. Pay is okay, good benefits. Learn a lot and at times had to travel with the company when the company was needed"
good,"A typical day at Cellular Visions, Inc. included assisting customers with cellular plans, devices, and promotions. The management was fantastic, and associates supportive and knowlegdable. The company was recently acquired by another dealer, and there are many changes, both positive and negative."
good,Store within a store.Made selling easy and enjoyable. Good co workers and a place that was willing to work with you. pay was comission and salary
good,"Great Job, you interact with great people and can earn a decent income. Typical retail, weekends will be spent mostly working unless you have seniority."
good,This was a great place to learn more about multitasking skills.The hardest part was sometimes you got overwhelmed with the load. Management was cool for the most part. And the most enjoyable part was when you actually got a sale.
good,"For the last 20 years, I have learned an incredible amount about Marketing, coaching, communicating and problem solving.  The downside is that unless one is willing to move to Dallas, there is no growth long term in the company"
good,"AT&T is an amazing company to work for, it gives you the opportunity to develop sales skills and technology knowledge. Typical day involves helping customers with technical issues and with new products & services. Some days are fast paced and other days are very slow."
good,I love working for At&t great benefits a lot of opportunity to advance to the next career level. Co workers are great you can get certifications through AT&T  university.
good,"I have learned many things in working in sales with the public. There is no such thing as a typical day of work. Each and every customer has his/her own specific needs and wants. In time I have come to learn how to present customers with both, the option to help them solve an initial problem and also inform them about options they may have never known of,which would help make there life easier. I am a peoples' person and love working with the public to help people."
good,"Directv is a wonderful company with many hours of opportunity to work. They are constantly in demand of technicians and are still growing. They work technicians six days a week and sometimes more then twelve hours a day in all types of weather."
good,"I have learn how  to manage time in a face pace environment that demand a lot of your time. Prioritizing is key to accomplish goals and  time constraint assignments. Self motivation and organization makes life in the work place a smooth operation. My co-workers can always rely on me for guidance; whether it is  as simple as pricing information or latest promotions, i am the reliable source of policies, procedures, their check and balance for compliance, smooth performance. Team effort makes a world of difference more enjoyable to work."
good,"Great colleagues who would help and assist with problem situations."
good,"I enjoyed most of the people I worked with, and the pay and benefits were great. However, although my save rate (I was in retention) was good, I did not use their call flow (""valid save attempts"") enough to satisfy them. Customers loved me, but it was not good enough."
good,It's the best call center job I have ever had. The training is good but as with any call center falls short in real life scenarios. The atmosphere was great with plenty of opportunities for growth.
good,The culture at AT&T has been conducive for creativity.  Never felt threatened or concerned about loosing my job or being able to share concerns.
good,"Typical day of work at this AT&T Authorized Retail Store was sub-par. Management was way too lax, often sitting in the back office playing games or watching videos online. Often, I was told two different things by two different superiors, getting me in trouble and causing fights between management."
good,".       I was hired as a call center representative and was required to answer all calls in queue with professionalism , competent information and sales and service with a 100% satisfaction. Call Centers are demanding and incentive based at AT&T. I was able to excel and achieve success."
good,Best part of this job is the relationships and friendships you meet along the way.  Metrics are near impossible. Attendance policy and sick time are non existent.
good,"I liked AT&T, but we were in the beginning stages of launching U-verse TV and interent service and It was very frustrating at times while they worked out the bugs with the equipment."
good,Typical day was 8 hours of inbound calls relating to various issues. Management there is questionable as people advance into positions they have no business in. The hardest part of this job is no recognition when customers take timeout of their day to want to speak to someone about your performance. The weather issues are a whole different story. This company is willing to jeopardize their employees safety in horrible conditions at 5am.
good,I was hired into a growing company that allowed me to continue my education into the Microsoft word and gave me the experience to use what i learned in the real world.
good,Management is great when put with a manager who is a good fit. team work environment. extensive and informative training.
good,Fast Pace job with great job security. Lots of rules as expected from a big corporation. Long hours. Home dispatched. Great place to learn experience with all kinds of customers.
good,"great sales opportunity, and great income plus great benefits.  Very supportive management which help you learn sales tactics and customer interaction."
good,"Every morning started with a group huddle with the first line manager to review the previous day’s report, soft skill training and team building. For the most part, technicians were required to load, dispatch and leave garage no later than 15 min after start time to include pre-calling your first customer of the day. At the end of day all techs were required to restock perishable item, clean out their trucks, and perform end of day call backs to all customers serviced that day to ensure the highest quality of customer satisfaction."
good,"There were several departments within our organization all working toward a common goal.  However, it sometimes created a very competitive work place where certain groups were not as supportive or cooperative of others.  Sometimes navigating this type of environment was difficult.  However, this is to be expected with such a large organization."
good,It is good company to work with better benefits but growth is very slow. Atmosphere is good.management is also fine.Overall it's good company to work but not for long time as growth will get stagnant.
good,"Is a great company to work for. Great pay and benefits but like all jobs there is favoritism and people who like to scam. We all are not perfect but life and work balance is a must unless you want to go insane. This company changes everyday, so if you like constant change, challenge and meet high quotas this is for you. If you like to be bossed and coached every transaction this is for you."
good,A typical day would be 8 to 14 follow ups with client to ensure services were intact and all service calls for equipment install and replacement inquiries are met with 48 hours or less.
good,"My role as Sales Support Representative has changed and evolved multiple times in my short time with AT&T. There is a high demand for superb organization, as well as attention to detail. There is also a constant influx of customers that require patience and enough basic technical knowledge to facilitate fixing minor issues or simply calming the customer with a simple explanation so that they can be checked in to see an Retail Sales Consultant. I've learned that doing something quickly is nothing compared to doing 10 things at once quickly. "
good,The money at At&t is great. There is no leeway as far as family or your own health. We mainly receive billing calls or trouble shooting and try and turn them into a sale. Calls are expected to less than 600 minutes to accomplish this.
good,"Tech support, company dwell too much on customers and cared less about their employees , however taking care of customers phones was number priority."
good,"There SEO and SEM program was very expensive and did not perform to potential."
good,"AT&T is a pretty great environment it definitely pushes you when it comes to sales, mentally and teaches you to think OUTSIDE of the box. Working for a wireless carrier shows you that theres an entirely different world that exists then what customers think actually goes on. When it comes to selling you always have to make sure that you stay in FRONT of the store by the door."
good,"A typical day in my title within the organization consist of connecting, disconnecting, and trouble resolution of  DS0, DS1, DS3, POTS, and DSL level circuits. I am also responsible for the installation, inspection, and turn up of new equipment within a central office. I find the hardest part of my job is locating the proper Method of Procedure for new technologies as our database is not as user friendly as one would expect. I find the most enjoyable part of my job is learning about a new technology being implemented in one of my offices."
good,The company was a great company. The company provided me with hand on experience.  They trained you but you will not be prepared for the actual call center experience.
good,"Our team was able to work from virtually anywhere most of the time. That helped with productivity and enabled us to dig into our work easier."
good,A typical day will be laid back satisfying customers getting work orders done making sure the customers get what they want an need providing information to make them more interested in there entertainments giving them the latest updates for there occupations that comes with they devices basically assisting customers!!!
good,"I learned that some managers are hired based on their sales numbers only and not on their ability to lead people. Also if you are not hitting numbers (which you should be able to do), the management team gets nervous and begins to micro manage to a point where it creates a negative environment. Benefits and compensation are amazing and most of the people you work with are as well, but when things go south they go in a hurry."
good,"Poor Work/Life Balance"
good,I only worked as a contractor for a short term.  The assignment was short lived.  I don't know if they were ready with the processes for deploying the tasks at hand.
good,"You must definitely enjoy being on the phone. This is not a job for everyone, it definitely takes a certain kind of person. I did learn how to speak to people over the phone better and how to have patience with them. The hardest part of this job for me was staying under the talk time."
good,Management was very helpful and was willing to help whenever they could.  The hardest part of the job was trying to up sell products to customers who was already mad because of their bill or their equipment not working.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having contests with co-workers to see who could up sell the most products in a day.  On a good day we averaged about 50 calls
good,"AWESOME compensation, good management who will bend over backward to help you out."
good,The benefits are amazing with AT&T. I was apart of the Union and they do an amazing job working for the people. You answered in coming calls from Cellular customers. You answered questions and complaints rfom dropped calls to billing issues. AT&T has a great training program to make you the best rep you can be. Once you get on the floor to take calls they have ample trainers walking the floor to be there to help you. Once your past the training part there are not many supporters there for you. It's hard to advance in the company unless you know someone.
good,"Answer and assist customers with different needs on a day to day basis, multi task between 9 different screens, take payments and help customers make purchases over the phone."
good,"Assist customer with programming changes, equipment upgrades, de-escalating calls. Assist agents with programming changes, programming discounts and timecard management"
good,Assited customer that had their land line phone and mobile phone services combined with questions or concerns on their bills and basic troubleshooting of their devices. It was sometimes challenging assisting upset customers.
good,"I enjoyed my job. Due to I love helping people .Working at AT&T was very stressful at times . They pushed the sales where it made it hard to work there , I didn't mind the sales most of the time I saved the customer a lot of money. I liked working there the co workers were very nice. The call Center closed.."
good,"AT&T used to be a great place to work. Commission compensation has decreased year after year due to strict goals to achieve shareholder wealth. Loved all my co-workers, didn't agree with the high level of micromanagement."
good,I answered calls from customers about their cellular service.  I processed payments and did troubleshooting for problems with service  I also offered additional products and service to provide customers with excellent customer service
good,"AT&T is forever changing, I worked for them 10 years and no 2 years were the same.  My biggest concern while working at AT&T was getting laid off due to down sizing."
good,"Overall fairly well. As a student, management with support center has been very flexible with my schedule. Although sometimes working with such a big corporation, it's easy to get lost in the big scheme of things."
good,"Typical work days ranged from 8 to 10 hours with some flexibility and work / life balance. During my time there I learned all aspects of wide area and local area networking technologies, project management, and webdesign. Management was supportive of employees. I enjoyed the peer interactions with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with outside vendors to ensure client satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was in the role of general trouble shooter, helping peers and clients."
good,This company provided 2 weeks paid training and covered everything a technician needed to know on how to perform a quality install.
good,Great team for the store. Manager was amazing and always listened to my needs. Co workers were always there for each other when needed. Nice team environment.
good,"Minimal work-life balance in sales and marketing. Other departments may be better."
good,"it is a job where they want you to give a 100% and they will pay you for it.  However, there is no security and no love lost when it comes to cost cutting.."
good,"You day starts off with a quick view of the customers, or crowd flow you will have for that day, and a review of your menu. Then it's off to serve your customers making sure they are satisfied to their fullest."
good,"Good listening skills"
good,"Working at AT&T wasn't so bad at first, but then they started requiring you to sell a product, you couldn't even test for yourself because it wasn't available in your area.  You had to sell 4 packages a week, and if you didn't do it three times in a row you were terminated.  I understand sales goals, but when I was hired, I was not hired to meet those goals, they made that a requirement about 6 months after I started.  AT&T doesn't care about their employees, only the money they make for them."
good,"Being an overseas contractor for this US based firm, I found that the company is very productive in sales and its hunger to achieve higher numbers of sales everyday makes it all the more competitive. Its sales team is very hard working and very efficiently converts potential customer into sales. "
good,"My typical day at work requires me to work on the sales floor as a part of a sales time.  I handle all of my customer interactions from beginning to end and often assist less experienced employees.  Over my time with the company I have become extremely comfortable approaching strangers and recommending personalized solutions for their needs.  It can be frustrating occasionally when I feel that I am more dedicated to my job than my manager, but we have a good working relationship.  The hardest part about the job is that is never seems like you have completed a job well done.  The company sets high goals for your metrics and even if you excelled for the number of opportunities you were given the company is almost always asking for more.  The most enjoyable part of my current job has to be my co workers.  Working with people that you enjoy working with makes the job much more enjoyable."
good,"Majority of the day is spent on the phone answering any questions customers have about products, offering new products, and reviewing bills."
good,"The only  thing I will say about my experience at ATT is that, I was there for almost 15 years and I was surplused because of the departments reorganization."
good,Great work environment for an inside sales job and has great people to work with.  I learned a lot about customer service.  Over all great life experience.
good,"Amazing pay, but the job is very strenious and you will have to work long hours and weekends on short notice. Management will be your best friends when you are making sales. Co-workers are just going through the motions of being there."
good,"Not a bad place to work but not the best either. Typical union structured company. Like all companies, they are about production and numbers. Unfortunately production is at a cost of quality. I dont think Management really understand the concept of the less time they give to do a job, quality suffers which result in unhappy customers. On the brighter side the technicians all have a great teamwork mentality."
good,I enjoyed working for AT&T - compensation/commission structure was great and the culture on the job was awesome. I definitely appreciated the shift in the job work/life balance the past 3 years with the company (definitely stressed the importance of taking your PTO). I would recommend working for AT&T.
good,"AT&T is a huge company, with teams spread across the country. You may never meet your some of your coworkers in person. Sometimes chaotic, very shaky middle management, demanding Leadership are some adjectives to describe the workplace. Nevertheless, you get to meet great people and a very relaxed work culture are reasons to choose to work here."
good,The company has an outstanding program for furthering your education and technical skills
good,"At&t representatives are unionized. With the Union working with the company, everyone is treated fairly. Breaks and lunches are a good length to allow for any personal things that need to be taken care of. The company is works with all family situations including time off."
good,"fun but stressful at the same time. And when the recession hit the nation, the pressure is more and more to keep customer stay in business."
good,"A good place to work with a good work life balance. Lots to learn from the vast product offering at AT&T. The teams are very understanding, fun to work with. It is a good working experiance at AT&T"
good,There were many benefits to working from home - and I had nice managers.
good,"Allows ample opportunities for overtime"
good,"Taking incoming calls from customers that have concerns about their bill, current plans or doing an upgrade or cancelling their services. Taking calls from customers that are having issues with current mobile device and assisting in doing resets or any type of software or hardware problem."
good,"Responsible for all aspects of the daily retail store operation "
good,"The managements seems did a okay jobs."
good,"-9 to 5 work hours."
good,"If pay is the only thing that determines your happiness then AT&T is the job for you. Their pay is great, benefits are decent. However the culture of the company is to have sweeping ideas with no realistic plan to implement it, and pass the hardship down to the front line employees. These same employees face downsizing every quarter, however the highers up receive big bonuses every year. The constant pressure to meet the unrealistic standards, facing layoffs, shuffling/increasing job responsibilities, reorganization upon reorganization make AT&T a tough company to work for. Reorganizations moved me out of state twice in less than a year, me refusing to move out of state a third time (in 18 months) caused me to lose my job. The great pay is hardly worth the stress and subsequent health issues that stress causes."
good,I am a customer service represenative in the Customer Relations department. I have to try and retain all customers who call in and try to cancel. It is my job to try and retain them as well as make sure they have the best price plan available to them. This job is a very stressful job but I work here for the pay per hour as well as the benefits.
good,Great place to work!  As a business manager I woke with both internal and external clients to the business managing the day to day activities for the accounts I supported. The excitement was communicating and  working with multiple business units on projects to deliver projects. The difficulty as with most large companies is the process can sometimes create delay when time is of the essence.
good,Great co-workers and compensation. Work/Life balance wasn't good.
good,They make it funt to work there and great benefits. Constantly on the phones and Having to up sale to every customer. But managers are great fun people.
good,My time at DIRECTV was a good learning experience.  It's been a few years since I was there.
good,Hard work good benefits Rules and policies are always changing and not for the better.
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for, one of the things i enjoy most about the company is having the ability to work with all different kinds of people. When working in this type of business they have a saying "" no job is the same"", I must admit that the challenges of this business is what i enjoy the most. Arriving at a job and trying to figure out how its going to get done is what I enjoy most."
good,A generally good company that gives good benefits and decent pay and incentives etc.But this particular job has little to no job security on top of being a very difficult and strenuous job on a daily basis.
good,"Hardest part of the job was the escalations, of course. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers and great benefits.  Would have stayed longer if the company wasn't closing.  Was planning on retiring here."
good,"A great company to work for. Brand driven, ensures the team has the tools needed to be successful. Very structured and recognizes the employees for success."
good,"Very fun days at work always laughing having fun answer phones i learned that you have to be open minded at everything in life management is very helpful always there to point of what was wrong and what you can do better next time co-workers are like family, the hardest part of the job is having no social life and the most enjoyable part of the job was helping people solve their problems."
good,"When I first get to work I have to prepare my till for that day and also count money in the safe to make sure it is correct. I do any inventory that needs to be checked, priced, and put away. I send back all returns/exchanges and DOA's. I make sure the showroom floor is clean and neatly stocked for the day. I print out all required paper work for that day and then I open the doors and let the fun begin. "
good,"Received orders and wrote tickets, paid close attention to detail, returned orders within a reasonable amount of time and conducted department cleaning."
good,"Stable company...transistion to ip based, software delivery company.  Lots of tenured folks, legacy systems and competing priorities that make it difficult to get things done.  Culture is dependent upon the group and will vary."
good,My first job out of the Navy.  Great place to get my feet wet.  The team I was on was extremely helpful.
good,They dnt really care about there workers to me. The team leaders are not really helpful when it comes to telling you how they want the job done.
good,I would recommend AT&T overall as a good place to work overall.  They are striving to be a best in class place to work.
good,"I was initially hired on for their B2C campaign and was promoted to their B2B campaign within a few weeks."
good,Company was excellent. Management was decent. Programs sold were sometimes taken to market before bugs were worked out. Pretty unforgiving if sales quotas are not met.
good,Resolving problems for all customers. Selling services. Educating customers on how to use services.
good,"worked in field to upgrade existing plant, didn't have to deal with a lot management, co workers were great."
good,I very much enjoyed working at AT&T for many years. The U-verse management portion required you to no family life and absurd scrutiny.
good,"I like the place of work, just the type of work is not for me. good crew members to work with."
good,"Researched and resolved technical issues with customer's devices. Utilized network trackers, outage programs; various systems to ensure proper device functions and service. Answered customer/client requests or inquiries concerning services, products, billing, equipment, claims. Utilized computers, keyboarding and mechanized systems to initiate and complete service orders. Continually maintained working knowledge of all company products and services. Co-workers were hardworking, and a joy to be around especially when the job atmosphere was challenging. Hardest part of job was service, policy, economy changes that didn't benefit the consumer, nor the customer service representatives. Most enjoyable was working with new innovative products."
good,AT&T is a very reputable company to work for. there is opportunity for advancement due to the constant growth in the communications field. They have comprehensive benefits packages and union environment.
good,AT&T took over Comcast and never improved the company at all in the 3 yrs that they were there.
good,"As part of one of the largest corporate acquisitions at that time, my company -- McCaw Cellular -- was purchased by AT&T which is now known today as AT&T Wireless.  As part of the transition, key employees were requested to stay on for at least two years which I did and then I left to join Cell-Tel."
good,"Taking incoming calls for customer seeking new wireless service with company or adding service to existing services. I learned aggressive selling skills while employed with company, time management. Most enjoyable part of my job was to be able to provide quality solutions to customers."
good,"Learned a lot, very organized company to work for. People would come in to be a phone so the sales associated really didn't have to worry about sales unless they didn't close"
good,"-Acquired TMO ASP certificate as integrator."
good,Great environment and co-workers. Good management to work for
good,"En Directv existe un excelente clima laboral, el cual permite trabajar de manera tranquila y concentrado en tus tareas."
good,The most enjoyable part about my current position by far are my co-worker.  They are some of the most positive people I've been around.
good,Answered phones dealing with customer account issues or complaints. Required to share any new products or services that AT&T was currently offering. Enjoyed working with customers and fellow employees but did not care for office politics amongst the managers. Erase the by way between managers that overflowed onto the employees on the floor and the job would have been ideal.
good,"It is not a bad place to work if you are really young. As an older employee, I dont feel that the opportunity for advancement is high."
good,"they do a lot to make it a very nice work place, they provide very nice compensation"
good,"on your own all day,good pay,good benefits. make decisions on own,"
good,"Routine work, taking calls regarding technical issues with directv equipment. Also assisting customers with billing issues."
good,"typical day is coming to the office, teaching coworkers and doing interviews, 1 hour long lunch break, handle outside acquisitions and help customers, hit your goals in sales and make sure your team hits theirs. I learned how to communicate with customers and how to handle unhappy customer situations."
good,"Excellent product."
good,"My tenure at AT&T has been fantastic in terms of professional growth as well as learning."
good,"Fun, up-beat, exciting place to work. A typical day at work consisted of, coordinating the floor, conducting bill reviews, analyzing customer accounts, demoing and suggesting various merchandise. I learned how to operate various operating systems on multiple devices. Management was very helpful and my co-workers were hard workers. The hardest part of this job was offering all services to every customer. However, the most enjoyable part of this job was networking and helping people with all their questions, concerns, and devices."
good,Typical day consists of working nonstop on projects and assisting sales with their issues.
good,"Co workers and really helpful and friendly, hardest part is being told there is job security but the scare tactics about to MANY ways you can be fired. Personally not a huge fan of that. Management has its flaws. Most managers have their times of not being approachable, same goes area managers. Training was well, not provided all the information needed to do the job effectively."
good,A typical day at work would never be typical. I would like to try and make everyday better than the one before and I think striving for the very best and making it fun are a necessity.
good,Ok place to work. Good pay but to much pressure on Stats and not enough focus on the actual need of the customer
good,I worked for BellSouth before AT&T bought them. AT&T had similar benefits and pay but the top down approach did not always jive with what was happening in the field resulting in poorer customer experience.
good,is a good company to work if you are an individual who likes to get compensated for your sales.
good,"Pros: Good benefit package, decent pay for entry level job, easy to move up the ranks, free Directv, unlimited overtime opportunities, you can kind of pick you schedule (shift bid based on tenure/stats), monthly bonus based on your stats, paid leave. Awesome facility. "
good,"Answer the phones using a complicated phone system, process payments, make payment arrangements, explain charges on customers bill. I learned how to handle customers that were angry or upset. Management and co-workers were supportive. The hardest part of the job was handling angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist the customers when they had an issue with their service."
good,"A typical day at work greeting the management and co-workers then login into the systems review if there's any changes or updates while answering inbound calls. Handling customer request which could be billing questions, making payments, making changes even adding services . After resolving customer request offering additional services"
good,The company is really good but the job on the phones was very stressful
good,Overall good place to work.  Certain sr level management have issues with trust and authority.
good,"As an At&t retail sales consultant your selling abilities are constantly put to the test.  In the fast paced world of mobile technology the only thing that changes faster then the devices are the goals, and companies direction.  Cell phones, to laptops, to tablets, to wireless peripherals and bundled services.  The management on the store levels were outstanding, however on the regional level their is a slight disconnect on what products and services are focal in each market.  However, At&t is a great company to work for, with competitive pay structures, constant contests with great prizes, and great benefits.  At&t was a great place to work and taught me a valuable lessen in the importance of forward thinking and staying ahead of the market rather then trying to follow the market and playing second fiddle."
good,"A diario tenemos capacitación sobre todo lo nuevo sobre programación , tegnologia que llega nueva a la empresa"
good,"Typical day at work is taking calls that would include from as little as sales to troubleshooting services, to billing issues, the overall job is solving problems for customers in the best way possible. de-escalating irate customers, multi tasking between multiple computer programs and screens."
good,Retail sales of all things wireless electronics and their accessories. You are given a wireless device to use as an employee so that you can become an expert with said device and OS. Extremely goal driven and high stress.
good,Service and sell AT&T products and services through inbound and outbound calls
good,The money and benefits are great. Upper management is out of touch with lower tiered jobs
good,This position was in a call center.  I took inbound phone calls and assisted customers.  This position had an excellent wage and great benefits.  This position was not flexible for raising a young family.
good,Sales Sales Sales at ALL cost.  unreasonable sales quotas.  A lot of micro management.  Poor relationship with CWA union.
good,This place is very productive with lot of learning while working on different projects. Co-workers and management is very supportive and helpful.
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers smile, knowing that I've exceed there expectations. I supervise 50 representitives with customer takeover calls,order flow, new office methods and procedures, I've learned that running a business you have to be consistant and able to maintain company goals. The hardest part of my job is not being able to do more for the customers that need the most help and assistance with there accounts, But the most important part of my job is knowing I done it to the best of my ability, and being reconized for a job well done by my superiors."
good,"Large company, with union.  Compensation was excellent. Wish I could work there again."
good,This job was a good learning experience. The job helped be get experience with the public
good,"Employed at AT&T 4-1-1 operator services for 10 years."
good,"I would take calls all day, troubleshooting cell phones, mifi devices, laptop connect cards, whatever the customer was having issues with. I learned a lot about how cell phones work and how they work within the network. "
good,Working for AT&T had many advantages as well as limits on career advancement. Most career opportunities were in other states.
good,llegar a un stand y practicar el abordaje siempre para lograr generar clientes. crecer como vendedora es algo de lo que aprendi era un vuen amviente de trabajo
good,"Your career fulfillment at AT&T is partially dependent on your pursuit, but also dependent on the department you end up end.  The key is to constantly migrate to growth areas.  "
good,When we arrived logged on to computer to start shift. We worked and had two 15 minutes break and one 30 minute break per shift. We learned skills to listen to customers and translate to the other caller what was said. Management would coach us on ways to improve our skills and training was weekly on software and complaints. The co-workers always shared when calling out for lunch so that everyone could order if they wanted. The hardest part of the job was when you messed up on a call and got reprimanded or wrote up. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we reached our goals and got to celebrate and get prizes. 
good,There were many training classes to keep us up on the latest devices and keep us up on product knowledge. The pay was great. The benefits were good as well. The amount of stress we had  to deal with was a con to the job. Other then that overall the company was okay to work for.
good,"8 hours a day, sometimes mandatory overtime up to three hours"
good,"I was hired to assist customers and resolve issues. After a few years, sales were added as part of your job description. I was not very comfortable with this due to the fact that I was not hired, and would not have applied to AT&T, to be a salesman. Of course, since sales makes the company lots of money, this, and not customer service, became job one."
good,"Transfered wireless numbers to existing or new accounts"
good,"Daily routine of constant call taking handling a variety of customer issues."
good,"Learned alot about Uverse and the technical side of how to use various software tool to assist customers with their problems, mastered the company software(WFE)."
good,"Workplace was great, but too much pressure in terms meeting quota. Disconnect from the top management and the frontline."
good,This was a great paying job. I often felt like a number more than a person to my superiors. I did advance quickly in this company but there were no times that I felt that I belonged to the company I just worked there.
good,A great place to gain some experience. You also get to work with really good people. Management style varies from one business unit to the next.
good,Everyone is friendly and great to work with. Treated consultants like FTEs
good,"I worked for at&t Mobility since it was originally Cingular. It's difficult to sum up my experience simply because it changed so drastically so many times in the last six years. As it stands now however, at&t has a lot to offer. You can work as a Retail Sales Representative and make quite a bit of money even without a college degree. If you stay long enough and show interest, there are opportunities for work-from-home and area management positions which allow a ton of autonomy. The benefits are spectacular, if a bit expensive. There is a 401k investment-matching set-up, and a pension plan. It is a very ""corporate retail"" environment, so keep that in mind. Overall, I worked at at&t longer than any job I've had because it was the most stable, best paying I've found."
good,"Es una buena empresa, destacada por los valores de sus jefes, aunque en el modo administrativo ( contrato, salario, etc.) era bastante deficiente."
good,Interacted with customers by telephone in a call center environment
good,The most important thing that I learned is that having money does not equal happiness. The most important aspect at work is truly enjoying what one is doing.
good,I've been with this company for 8 years (originally started with Bellsouth.) It's a business casual environment that is results driven.
good,Loved the fast pace environment of the sales job. Our sales team was a great group to work with.
good,Full time employees asked to work overtime constantly because not enough employees and schedules not staffed appropriately for call flow. Constantly learning new techniques and procedures for handling calls. Management not trained in proper assistance procedures.
good,i have worked for at&t as a rep and a manager. the commision structure for rep is fantastic as a manager not so much. i lost about 400-600 on average per commission check and was constantly put under fear of loosing my job due to unrealistic quotas.
good,"AT&T has an awesome diverse environment. Though work life balance can be a large struggle for corporate workers, the company prides its self on the hard work that goes into every aspect of the company."
good,it was a very good place to work but honestly no room for advancement
good,Great opportunity to work with a diverse group of clients. Taking prior business/life experiences to inform and guide businesses through the process of position their business in the market place through print advertising and a wide variety of digital and online tools. My peers we awsome. We had the same drive to learn and grow so that we were best equiped to inform our clients of industry specific trends and market place trends. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the downturn of the economy and watching some business take a big hit financially or even fail. Dealing with the fear and uncertainty some of the clients held. The diamond in that rough time was the reward of watching the businesses that took my recommendation and ran with it and sustained their business and even grew it in some instances.
good,"Here in the Chicago Market as an RF engineer there is barely any downtime and we work from the time we get to work, until the time we leave. Everyone that has come to this market says it is the most stressful job they've been in and management is extremely cheap. They would much rather have their employees deal with more stress than spend an extra $50 on something they need for their job."
good,"I would have to say, that AT&t is not a bad place to work for, Im sure like any other company there are some thing that you dont agree with, such as there are no sick days, so if the vacation que isnt open you just have to come to work, you cant schedule sick days, but you can however schedule doctors appts."
good,AT&T gave me an opportunity to serve in various Leadership positions that helped me become a better employee.
good,"Working with Mastec for direct tv loved it very much organized very helpful when needed. For Networks llc. this company unorganized very unreliable as a business. (The freedom of being able to exercise your ability in management organization and problem solving abilities) (not very reliable as far as payroll and reimbursements for fuel and other company expenses) this was very challenging because the company had no set structure as to how payroll, routing and hiring it was left up to each region manager to come up with creative ideas and solutions."
good,A typical day at Directv can go either way it really just depends on your attitude of the job adn what you expect to gain from working at the company as far as the calls go if you just learn to take each call one at a time and not take it personal you will enjoy working at Directv espcially if you like call centers.
good,"Training is ongoing with AT&T, and there is always something new to learn. For those just starting out in a sales career, AT&T would be a great stepping stone. Immediate management, at least for this location, is wonderful, and I enjoyed working with those around me. There are a number of different metrics that must be focused on and there is no one way to do attain your goals. Luckily, immediate management recognizes that and allows you to sell in your own style with guidelines along the way."
good,"A typical day was a shift starting anytime of day. I worked in a 24/7 call center. We were taking 411 phone calls on an 8 hr shift basis. Management was helpful, but always felt very far away and hard to connect with. The hardest part of the job was the monotony of the day. The best part of the day was knowing even in a small way you were able to give ease to someone going about thier day."
good,"Management will throw you under the bus, once they feel the pressure from higher ups. And will bend over backwards if a customer would raise their voice."
good,"After 15 years I was laid off, but it was a wonderful 15 years. I wish I were still there and contributing."
good,"Assit customers with any aspect of the AT&T mobility side. You are Customer service, rate plans, bill issues, account overviews, split accounts, making new accounts, contract information, legal knowledge, tower issues and technical suports. You are also responible for quotas to sell new products and devices, based on contracts, features and survey status'."
good,- A typical day at work includes calling customers to inform them of upgrades and discounts that we have on devices. We also inform them of ways we can help them save money on their bill.
good,A typical day at AT&T is always different. I learned various aspects of selling various phone products and how to handle various customer needs. The managers I had were very nice but firm on individuals and team meeting sales goals. My co-workers were great. The enjoyable part of the job were talking to people about their phone needs and assuring the concerns are heard. The hardest part were not meeting goals at times.
good,Decent place to work. Great benefits but you can't really work around the schedule too well.
good,"I worked for AT&T for a total of seven years. There were many ups and downs with the company. The environment was never consistent. Pay and benefits were amazing, but is that enough for an unstable work environment?"
good,"Customer Service. Learned how to handle objections and praise customers for building a solid client base. Managers were fair, coworkers great. Hardest part was keeping everyone on one accord and most enjoyable was pay and benefits"
good,DirecTV is an all around good job as long as your willing to work hard and put in some overtime.
good,"Long hours in any weather,in and out of peoples homes and trying to get the job done in a certain amount of time to keep your numbers up to keep from getting written up and/or let go. Management is ok, they do the best they can do. The job for the most part was good but it seemed to me that they were trying to get quality and quantity at the same time. And in my experience that is not possible."
good,"call center for cellular devices such as cell phones, ipads, uverse and all AT&T products."
good,"They don't seem to care much about the people who generate all of their income for them. It was great helping the people on the other end of the phone, even when they weren't the happiest about their bill or service. I really miss my co-workers. They became like family to me. A typical day at work as a customer service representative was answering calls all day long, assisting customers with payments, billing questions, technical questions about their phones or their service."
good,"The company pays well for what you do. However, job titles and expectations are extremely ambiguous. Positions require being able to ""work independently"" which ultimately means that no guidance will be given regarding where or how to get something done in the organization for new employees, and feedback is almost nonexistent so you are always worried whether or not you are doing a good job."
good,At&t was a supportive company and worked very hard to help their employees be successful.
good,"Nice place to work, good people, disappointed when I was laid off. Would really like to be re-hired, only need 2 weeks to get 25 years service."
good,Great co-workers and a challenging work experience. Enjoyed the challenge of solving problems while on call. Didn't like the company's policy of off shoring.
good,Great company despite cutbacks. Was able to expand the market for revenue.
good,"This is a great job for a self-starter that can handle learning a large list of technical products. The training for this position is somewhat helpful, but fails to explain the internal systems used for order processing, billing, etc. This becomes the employee's responsibility. The management in the Small Business channels are friendly and willing to help. However, they attend several meetings and have to assist roughly 5 to 6 other salespeople on their team also. Because of this, I did become proficient at managing my time and setting priorities. If you don't mind spending most of your day on the phone with customers and having to coordinate several others' schedules to complete tasks, this position pays well by industry standards. There is some travel involved that can be overnight or longer depending on your sales territory."
good,Good job for the right person. Great hours and friendly people.
good,"they do not care about thier employees, the job was easy and you got trained for any new products or systems issues"
good,"We are the best at what we do, I think. We have the name, we have the people to get things done and we have the resources and technology. It's the technology that surpassed us and won. Who needs a book to give you a number of a plumber when that information is now at our fingertips with our smart-phones. There was no way to compete. Paper, unfortunately, is dying. Everywhere."
good,"It was a well paying summer job, i dont really remember that much about it."
good,Its cool if your not working on commission. I would say the Costomer Service Positions are the best. I left AT&T and if I ever come back I will work in Customer Service.
good,Training was too long. No coaching provided after training.
good,"During my tenure at AT&T, I was able to learn how to really sell. Great Compensation that consist of hourly base and commission."
good,AT&T had great benefits and fabulous people to work with. This only downside to AT&T is it did not have a balance for work/life.
good,I liked working here...only real improvement I could see when working there is the need for a better quality control system.
good,Great learning experience of new Technology. Lots of training provided. Great Benefits.
good,At&t can be a really great place to work at when there are things going on.
good,DirectV was an ok Job to work for. The managers are really nice for the most part. I worked from home and They have way to many system issues
good,"Weekends off, long hours sitting and very repetitive work."
good,"Policies and procedures for sales team and manager are great thanks to respected owners , BUT NO ONE FOLLOWS including Sales Director, sales are forced to employees in At&t to gain revenue and a job threat is like hanging on your head atleast 5 times aday because they are getting 22 yr old managers to run a place that produce 5 million dollar revenue every year. no offense to person age but managment positions required field experience."
good,"Very forward looking organization at the time I was there, especially in training. We developed some of the first CBT and software simulations for training on communiaction systems."
good,Working for AT&T was a life changing experience. It allowed me to make a lot of money and figure out my chosen career path.
good,"Nice place to work to meet new people and to do a service to make your customers happy, but management is not together, everyone should know what is going on. you have to call to many different people to get thing done right."
good,"The pay and benefits are decent for the work we do. Must be a social person and be able to deal with many customers that are mad and be able to calm them down and make them feel like they are getting value. Employees are expendable. Company lay's off as many techs as they can at the end of every quarter, even though we are very busy and need the help. They only care about their bottom line."
good,"I was a DirecTV employee prior to AT&T buying out the company and what stood out the most is that AT&T did not care about employees and culture at work nearly as much as DirecTV did, it went from employees being treated as humans to employees being treated as numbers."
good,Working at AT&T will vary greatly depending on your organization and current leadership. Your leadership is also very likely change yearly or every other year. AT&T has been my best and worst job ever and it was all within the same organization.
good,"Enjoyed working here and the people, it was very good while it lasted. You will learn a lot and be challenged, growth is also possible. However, there are frequent job layoffs that do not help the company culture or work/life/health balance."
good,The company is great. Very professional atmosphere and helpfull fellow associates.  Good leadership and great communication with everyone.  The technology wasn't the best but everything else ran smooth.
good,Applied to work here because I thought there would be opportunities to move up in the company.  Unfortunately that is not the case. If you start as an install tech......that is most likely where you will remain until a surplus finally catches you.
good,"The job is very different then they tell you, they give you parameters for safety and when to decline a job. You follow those and i promise you wont get paid virtually anything but minimum wage. You risk it for the biscuit but if you getvcaught we warned ya! Jobs a joke"
good,"I really enjoyed my job & the people I worked with.  My supervisor was helpful and tried to help me fine another position in he company because there was downsizing in  my job title but the company put into place a ""hiring freeze"" so there were no jobs to be found.  I left with a very bad taste in my mouth for the way I was treated at the end."
good,I left At&t due to not enough time with my family and lack of pay. We also got paid commission and they couldn't show history of the things that we got paid for and the things that we got charged back for.
good,Typical day would begin with setting goals for the day based off what is needed to achieve a monthly goal. Interact with customers and coworkers.  Learned how to build and maintain lasting relationships with our guests. And leadership skills that will carry on for a lifetime. Culture was amazing.
good,"The company was great for the most part,  scheduling was flexible work was easy to learn and caught on to everything rather quickly n which helped me work very effectively."
good,The job is what you make of it. You have to be resourceful and self-motivated to do well. Quotas are questionably high and continuingly increase which is the biggest con.
good,AT&T says California has too many laws to protect the employee it seems like they’re trying to make all California employees contract employeesIt seems you were trying to make it hard for the employee to stay at AT&T
good,"Trabaje muy a gusto y dando siempre excelentes resultados, y solo me sorprendió que hayan tomado en cuenta comentarios de gente con dolo hacia mi persona para que me despidieran con una justificación no valida ni tampoco comprobada. Fue muy descepcionante."
good,"As long as you consistently deliver, kiss the right cheeks, and perform with the right teams (visibility), you are rewarded.  I did not appreciate the work culture and management culture there.  It has changed and NPS (Net Promoter Score) went downward over the years."
good,If your about sales this job is for you. Though it is a customer service and sales center .. it is very sales driven. The money you make is great and the commission is good if you sell. Job is mentally draining but most big company call centers are. I enjoyed the people I met and the opportunities I had while working there. Schedule accommodation was my reason to part ties. It was a hard decision.
good,"Great environment for someone who loves sales, competition, fast-paced environment. Lots of cold calling and it can be tough to do right by your clients because the company is so big- billing department, technical difficulties, etc"
good,"good job, great supervision, good training, just don't see a long term stay a reality. They are destroying DirecTV and that means I will be out of a job."
good,I learned a lot. This employer was my first step into telecommunications. I did what a technician would do. Sometimes the work hours were really long and the shifts were unpredictable at times.
good,My typical day would be to sign into work station only on your scheduled tour/hours.  Access your work database and work the most critical issues first thing in the morning and then work on the remainder of your work throughout the day. At times there were issues where you had to switch tasks.  I have learned a lot over the years and I treat every customer the way that I would intend to be treated.
good,You are given leads and areas to make sales. tough competition and work environment. Great for people who enjoy lots of walking mixed with hard sales.
good,Difficult to manage long term projects due to budget cuts and continual force reductions. Too many conference calls /meetings and not enough time spent on getting the work done. Leadership is short sighted due to valuing new hires over experienced knowledgeable current employees.
good,"ambiente tranquilo de trabajo, capacitación buena,"
good,Overall the Job was set and consistent schedule. Setting goals and expectations for yourself daily to achieve them. The hardest part of the job was getting the sales
good,Love the company in the beginning but after they purchased other opportunities it made are job harder and no pay up grade and the stated trying to down size laying techs off
good,"It was sales, so there were a lot of expectations. Sales is a revolving door, and what I thought was a huge driver for success is commission payouts. So if one are seeking to make a lot of money and willing to sacrifice work-life balance, then, Sales with AT&T would be a right fit."
good,"Company was mostly enjoyable. Expansion of AT&T services and products were very exciting to be part of it. Work balance could have been better was able to learn a lot of new applications, tools, and infrastructure."
good,"this potion is great if you are invested in the company for more then 20 years. if you love to work sole, work outdoors and problem solving. this is a perfect job for you"
good,"Making this a career was my first choice.  I see that with numerous surpluses within the company, it is just a matter of time before I'm next.  The company has been good to me in many ways.  I have many opportunities to learn and grow to prepare myself for success for this company or the next.  I am well compensated for what I do.  My only and biggest drawback is the constant fear of losing my job due to the ever-changing technology of today."
good,"The people and work environment are awesome that i work with. The supervisors are a hit or miss tho. But the company seems to not want to hire new permanent employees but would rather hire temp (terms such as myself) employees for major projects.They would rather transfer someone within the company with no line experience and have to train them then to hire the terms they currently employ. I was there for a 3 year term and its as if your life is on hold cuz they constantly hold it over your head that your term can actually end sooner than the maximum of 3 years, so even tho you're making good money, you're afraid that next month you'll be unemployed. And don't expect the union to lift a finger for you."
good,Fun place to work with fast pace atmosphere. If you are good with sales its a great place to work. Major down fall is there is no flexibility with scheduling. Everything is based on seniority.
good,"I joined AT&T right out of college, and for the first 5 or 6 years it was great. Many opportunities for learning, and I gained new skills at every turn. I was in a very visible role and moved up through the ranks quickly. My team appreciated my work and I was well regarded even at the officer level. However, when it came time to reduce the workforce in a round of necessary layoffs, the decision was made to do it based on location alone. It didn't matter how good of a job I did across my 8-year career, how long I had been with the company, or how much of a bind my team would be in without me there. I became a number on a page and got the boot - my management even up to the Assistant VP level had no say in the matter. "
good,"Expect a lot of late days. Rain or shine. Safety is always first so if you dont feel safe doing the job, dont proceed.take your time on all your jobs, and dont rush it you're getting paid by the hour so do the job right the first time."
good,Typical days are wide open. multiple issues at hand and can causes a stressful day. too many expectations are forced on level 1 managers which makes it extremely difficult to promote team moral
good,"Pay is good but not competitive with oilfield jobs that are raising the cost of living in this area."
good,great for expierience! can build customer skills and administrative. if your looking to learn to handle accounts or the inside of a service great place to learn.
good,"I do enjoy working at AT&T.  However, due to lack of advancement opportunities within my department,  as well as a healthy work/life balance, I am encouraged to explore my options whether within the company or outside."
good,"The main advice for anyone looking to work for AT&T is be prepared for constant change. In COR (company owned retail) stores, Management changes too frequently. The commission structure changes far too frequently. "
good,"Loved working for the company. I enjoyed the positive motivation and the training. They also let me run my territory like my own business. But there was little opportunity for advancement.  I survived all of the reorganizations, but the last round they laid off 40,000 people. No reorg."
good,Overall Good company to work for. Benefits are excellent. High level of stress to excel and adhere to all guidelines. Fast paced 24-7.  Have to be detail oriented and able to take customers concerns and resolve their issues.
good,Hay buen ambiente de trabajo y buen esquema de comision
good,Love it here and love the work culture. Strong company. Great employees. The only drawback is the strategic direction as 2020 nears (ongoing layoffs into the formidable future)
good,"The people I worked with were amazing, dedicated and the funniest guys I ever worked with. Which will come in handy when you miss your family or when your friends ask you when you get out of work. You will not know. Summers mean even more work, which means more money but longer hours on the job. Management knows what it is to be you so they are proactive with solutions and know when you're running game, not a bad thing considering being lazy will kill your check. All in all might not be a good fit for someone big on home life but good for single folks."
good,I learned a lot working at AT&T and it was a good experience. Ultimately the career advancement opportunities required me to relocate and took longer than I was comfortable with so I ended up leaving when a career opportunity presented itself from one my business clients.
good,I have always wanted to work here and feel like I've had positions that helped my growth.  It has been great for my family and career.  The industry has changed over the years.
good,Started off great but more of sales job they don't care about anything only sales.  If a elderly person calls in who can't afford there bill they still want you to sale her a bundle of services even if it means raising her bill. You are constantly micro managed and someone is always listening to your call always on pens and needles wondering if you will be called in for a meeting .
good,I learned a lot at AT&T and grew my skill set tremendously. I would recommend AT&T to a friend for sure. They offered plenty of opportunities to work remote. They are an established company with great protocol and processes.
good,Get to meet new customers everyday. Run new lines from poles and inside houses. Learn something new almost everyday and learn from different jobs. Overtime is almost always required.
good,"A typical day at AT&T was usually very interesting. There were no ""typical days"" as with any job where you have to go into peoples homes. Going in to the peoples homes was never the hard part, nor was doing the work. The issues that a lot of us techs had was that we didn't always have the correct tools for the job."
good,"Typical 10 hour work days, answered billing and technical call. Also did troubleshooting for customers, add/remove programming, activated equipment, ordered equipment, and scheduled service calls."
good,"Very good company. I learnt management skills. Attended many meetings and how to handle multiple things."
good,sales clean maintain inventory they demand that you meet a quota and that you stick to providing the best service you can. If you dont take the time for the you can be let go.
good,good pay and benefits. not good work and life balance. lots of discounts with many companies. unlimited overtime. company vehicle and company paid for all aspects of training
good,it was a long work day from 8 am until 8pm. I learned patience. I also learned that every one is different so your approach should also be different each time. management was very supportive. hardest part of the job was not giving up on sales
good,"Very fast pace work environment. The last 6 years were in environmental, monitoring and repairing fuel storage tanks in California. I learned a great deal about environmental responsibilities as we had a $25 Million dollar injunction on us from the State of California dumped on us in Texas as the California people were falling down on the job. Within 24 months we had the messes cleaned up and the injunction removed. New standards were imposed."
good,Don't work for AT&T unless you can easily find work elsewhere. They like to lay people off often. So job security is not something you want to look forward to.
good,happy place to work but sales are getting harder to committed since there At&t has the mobile app so customer are using the app to simplify their needs
good,AT&T can be a fun place to work and can provide a good work life balance. If you perform well and build a strong network opportunities for advancement will always be available. The downside is if you have poor management the job can be very stressful.
good,"you have your days when you love it and hate it normal call center enviorment high call volume, lots of prizes given away for sales, car stays parked inside gated lor down stairs food lobby so you dont have to leave for lunch bathrooms clean breakroom sells breakfast and lunch food"
good,"typical day is receiving up to 80 calls a day"
good,There  is a lot to be done all the time so be prepared to be busy.  Overall it is a great company to start a career in.  A ton of training is be done always.
good,great job with a lot of benefits but it has mixed scheduled dependent on seniority. If you have not been with the company for many years. you will be stuck always working on the weekends.
good,You are provided the necessary tools and resources to be successful in the position. It is a challenging position.  Your performance is based off the customers opinion of you.
good,"This company was the start of my ""career.""  It was the first job I had that I could see a career develop.  Strong leadership, great sense of promoting within to allow for employee development."
good,You will get plenty of opportunities to learn on the go - frequent access to new technologies.  Team work is a must and highly encouraged.  Need more formal organization to be able to address needs when deploying new technologies.
good,Really Fast-paced and must be able to multi task... must also be able to be on time as scheduled every day or you will have poor attendance and rated unsatisfactory
good,"The company is changing, not necessarily for the better.  Downsizing continues.  I am being laid off after 21 years, while others get to stay and collect their benefits and retirement."
good,Nothing to say  honestly only a good paying job management in that specific office had no good work ethic... being surplussed and made the choice to take payout didn’t see it getting any better
good,ATT was a good place to work.  There was a team spirit that I appreciated.  There was a nice blend of meetings and actual work. Management was easy to get along with.  Overall the experience was good.
good,"contractor for at&t digital life i was the last main tech for the Nashville market."
good,"Log in to laptop retrieve jobs for the day, brief meeting with supervisor. Get supplies go to first job complete job ,lunch break. Drive to second job complete job. return to yard close out ."
good,I did not enjoy working at the retail level at AT&T management was slightly inappropriate and inconsistent. I felt as if the expectation was to sell people things they didn't need or want in order to make the comission necessary to make a living wage.
good,"Depending on your drive and ability to deal with politics within a company, this is a place for you.  I always am looking for something better, but have trouble leaving when it doesn't offer more than what I'm currently getting."
good,It was a good place to work and good working environment  but I had to move to seek for better salary opportunities. I would like them to have better opportunities to grow inside the company for qualified employees.
good,"When the company first started uverse it was great. We had jobs that can be completed at a respectful rate. As years go on they now they bulk load the order to make technician a super star . We Atnt  have integrated Satellite Tv with AT&T causing prem techs to take on a task of CHANGING PAIRS COPPER,ADSL,FTTN,FTTP,BP,SATELLITE, INTERNATIONAL SATELLITE. When I first started the company it was just Uverse service. Now we are just slaven "
good,"There used to be a time where i saw people at AT&T flourish. That is no longer the case. Morale is low and people are laid off constantly. The Technical Development Program for entry level positions is a way to get recent grads into the door, and never give them any other opportunities to move up the ladder. The pay and benefits are good, but it is not a happy place. People are great, management has no clue what is needed."
good,It's closed now but was a very comfortable position at the time. The work was just as any usual call center where you are taking calls. The customers were mostly pleasant.
good,"was a chill place to work with some good benefits like maternity leave, discounted rate for services, and flexible hours... was hourly plus commission"
good,"It was a stressful but rewarding job.  Through company purchases, technology changes, and CEO change, the company/employee relationship changed.  Employees went from respected to disposable."
good,"Very good compensation and benefits, an on going effort in affect to improve the culture and customer experience,  Moderate to high turnover is a norm in my experience,"
good,AT&T is a large company i was originally an employee of DIRECTV and then AT&T bought the company. I was recently surplussed because of to many managers after the merger.
good,"More opportunities for advancement in the company are needed & competent management is needed to help reps excel.  "
good,"Most managers I worked under would bring personal problems to work. They where quick to throw you under the bus to save themselves. I know several employees who where yelled at and consistently told to quit because the numbers they made each month would hurt the bonus of the managers. After the company went into surplus (layoff) it literally turned into every man for himself. Management turned on employees that had bad months just to make sure they kept their jobs. My very last manager was very straight forward. On the clock its strictly business, he followed policy to the T. This was respected, because nothing ever came out that wasn't expected. The manager before came out one morning and griped out the whole crew, after talking to the union Stewart his response was ""Yeah I know his sister was just attacked by a dog recently, hes bad about bringing home issues to work... I'll have to have another talk with him."" Two and a half years with this company and I was under good management for 4 months."
good,"not much too growth within not understanding of having a life outside of the company, stole ideas and made them their own and finally closed the center i was in"
good,* A typical day was helping frustrated and mad customers with their account and disconnected services.
good,Worked there for 13 years before laid off. Fun place to work. Loved the people. I have a few friends still there.  Would love to go back if the opportunity presented itself.
good,Often stressful; some expectations seem arbitrary and ineffective which can be extremely frustrating. Pays well and can be rewarding if you work hard and well.
good,Great place to work but too many management changes. Injuries come but seem like they don’t want to accommodate injured employees. Union is great to have
good,"Standard work day with lots of emails and meetings, however, collaboration among your peers is promoted making it a great place to come up with new ideas and process improvements to better support the customers."
good,Great manager but not great co workers. Co workers were not willing to help me learn. Often fustrated with helping me and treating me like a non team memeber.
good,People are nice and talkative. Their is lots of activities to keep everyone motivated to work. Interacting with people is always a plus. Managers are not that bad.
good,Liked it up until the point where i found out the one day i needed to have off i couldn't ever get off because the schedule is based off of seniority.
good,You work in a huge call center and take calls from people who are frustrated about their cell phone not working right or bill too high..  You have to read the policy every time to know the exact words to say time consuming and takes away from the call ratio which they get mad if you don't take so many calls and if the people don't score you well and they may be upset with the company and you did all you could.
good,"Good place to work.Most weekends off.Fair pay.Structured work environment. Good teamwork.Many benefits,including paid vacation,sick days,referral bonuses."
good,Punch the clock do your job and don’t make the company look bad or you are fired. Then on top of that it’s a union job and the union is absolutely useless when you really need them.
good,Massive communication company with horrible communication problems. Specific jobs weren't bad until you had to rely on another department. Management was hit or miss.
good,"There is a lot of politics with advancement. Even at the entry level. If you just keep to yourself then you should be fine. You sell whatever products the company wants you to, if you don't then naturally you get written up. The sick leave is awful and seniority can take years to accrue. However, if you don't have any sort of higher education then i would highly recommend this job as it has the potential to pay someone $50K+/year."
good,"I enjoyed working for AT&T, but am at the moment surplussed so I need to find another job in the company or leave it.  I have a wife and three kids to support so I must work!  I don't know why force reductions must happen but upper management get raises... It is a neat place to work if you can manage to work in a position that wont ever be outsourced or done away with. Sometimes the hardest part of my work was waiting on other people (workgroups) to do their work.  But some of the people I have worked with will be lifelong friends. I have learned and relearned that you can learn to work with those you would not choose to break bread with, because the work must be done. Looking for the good in people with usually end with one finding what they look for.  Sometimes you have to look really hard. The best part of working for AT&T were the management phone concessions (which I will miss) and the Contingency Training.  We got to learn other jobs in case there was a work stoppage by the labor union."
good,"for several years it was a great place to work. in the last several the culture has changed, employee's are no longer valued, there is constant change, no work group is safe. Intended on retiring from the company and finishing my career there. Company decided otherwise. With the big merger coming up, it's all about the $$ to this company."
good,In my best words to describe a typical day at work would to break down a customer needs to what we offer. By bundling other great entertainment products and demoing them for them and lastly to close the sale.
good,It was okay working there. It can be good at times but my management sucked so I didnt like it. Pay is decent none the less. Enter the cult at your own risk.
good,"Fast paced environment activating cellular devices and provided customer service to all customers. "
good,"Fun work stays challenging. But recently has become extremely micro managed. Worked being written up for taking 51 minute lunches instead of an hour. Being tracked on how long our van is running (disciplined if for longer then 5% of the work day.) If you're company vehicle is wrecked at fault or not expect suspension/termination. Random Layoffs per the ""needs of the company"". 1st level management is awesome though and will try to cover you as best they can."
good,Good environment for receiving hands on experience with the cell phone industry. Was able to learn a lot of new things being apart of the at&t team.The only issue I had was the management being that it was third party I didn't feel like they handled situations correctly
good,"good benefits, decent pay. If you want to advance your career with this company be open to relocation. Goals are always changing and you're always asked to do more. Fast paced evolving company."
good,Having the opportunity to work in a high volume call center gave be the ability to utilize and improve my customer service skills. Having the ability to handling high volume calls as well as making sure our customers are satisfied after resolving issues.
good,All my years of working for At&t most of my day were very good but like all jobs you have good day and bad days.As i was there for all most 15 years i learned of lot of things with the changing of technology with the internet boom which is good for my career.
good,I interned on the video development / strategy team in Austin. I expected a formal internship program filled with various networking opportunities and 1:1 discussions with leadership. Unfortunately this internship consisted of me sitting in a room with 2 other senior employees with no real tie to the larger AT&T organization or other exposure opportunities.
good,"Great pay and benefits. Made it through training but whenever we got to OJT, we were very unprepared, and there was very little help from supervisors."
good,"During my time at AT&T, I learned so many things: process compliance, business process reengineering, process performance and requirements analysis and management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things and staying on the cutting edge of project and program management."
good,"A typical day begins with extracting data to format a report that is published for Senior and Executive Management to review. After review is complete report is returned to fund projects from $2 to Millions of dollars. "
good,"There is a lot of fun people that makes the environment exciting. It is a very fast pace job and you have to be meet multiple goals.You learn how to adjust how you take your calls and to improve on those goals, ie. handle time, transfers, and callbacks."
good,There is just too much going on with this company in general to even fairly rate this company. Other than that this is not really a bad place to work.
good,You get to meet great people and interact with customers a lot. You also get to try out some of the new technology that is coming out. The owner of the store could use better personality
good,The industry has change so much in 12 years that I cant Accurately speak on it. I do miss customer service and problem-solving. My experience with this company was very good and I met a lot of great people
good,La parte mas difícil del trabajo es convencer a los cliente de un servicio que no les funciono .
good,"AT&T has great work life balance.  Offer great training in your field"
good,Good times and good working culture is experience here at AT&T. But needs to be fast paced compared to the current market. A typical day is lots of brainstorming followed by some productive work.
good,It's a very fast pace environment. It's all about numbers and productivity. If you don't produce numbers you will be written up. Also there is no sick days.
good,Help customers with their need (s). Sale even if it's not a sale. Management does reports. Be knowledgeable on products. DirecTV made it more difficult. Most enjoyable part was making good connections with your customers.
good,When hired ot was Ohio Bell which was employee and customer focused. However over the years the company changed directions. I am more customer focused
good,Micromanaged to the point it was a problem. Thank goodness for Union! They tried to manage how long it should take for you to go to the bathroom.  Didn't give credit where credit was due.  EXTREMELY STRESSFUL!!
good,"With the ever-growing field of electronics the work environment is constantly changing and so are the needs of the business constantly hiring and laying off employees in different departments to match these changes. Good job while you have it, as long as you have it."
good,A lot people quit while I was there because you get a new shift every 6 months and you can't change what you so it conflicted with a lot of people's life like school or their kids
good,"Ko work/lifebalance. Long hours. 6 day work weeks, no testing of requirements and how they work before entered in field. Not treated as a person just a number"
good,I performed collections on customers accounts along with selling company products. The hardest part of the job was warfare between management and the Union.
good,i learned how to deal with cable wires and use the different tools used for the equipment we had. i learned to work harder. i had a good group of guys to work with to complete the projects we had to do.
good,"competitive pay, but it was a very high stress job. very mentally exhausting. You always had to worry about your stats and had to worry if you got time covered. They had great benefits and it is a job to look for if you have no experience because it pays well in the area"
good,"sales heavy with incentive bonuses, not right for everyone but can be good for some. hardest part is trying to sell while lowering bills for the customer."
good,I felt the pressure to always produce more.  My supervisor was relaxed and let me do my job but didn't like to step up when needed.  My position ended
good,"On a typical day I would answer phone calls and answer questions about phone bills and try to sell other products to qualified customers."
good,"worked as a Service Tech. for 20+ yrs and found the work gratifying,  felt pay was comparable for work performed, and work group well managed. After returning as a Premises Tech learned more technical skills through company training, but found workplace culture and employee moral very much lower than previously. Pay definitely not comparable with job requirements and management not as concerned w ongoing issues or always qualified for positions"
good,"Union, Full benefits. Hours are retail, typical day is 9:30-7:30 with an hour lunch. Huge focus on selling Directv. Little to no room for advancement unless interested on relocating. No time off (black out) from iPhone launch in September until the New Year, extended holiday hours."
good,Horarios accesibles. Oportunidad de crecimiento. La comisión de las ventas es muy buena.
good,No so supportive management team. Difficult to handle offshore calls with work load. Good chance to new technologies.Very supportive team. Lack of unavailability of Product managers  in handy.
good,Had a lot of downfalls to it. Would not recommend to friends. Plenty of opportunities for advancement if you're willing to put in the time (i.e. years).
good,i enjoy my job but with little to no advancement left and jobs leaving the country job security is sketchy at best for the future. its a union job though the union hasnt kept a monopoly company from hurting workforce and customers
good,managers ranked weekly and monthly within center and organization. constant stress to improve and exceed goals. Job revolves around performance and numbers
good,"This job was cutthroat, and all about how much money you could squeeze out of every customer. They wanted you to sell everything to everyone, weather the customer really needed it or not. You could sell 9 out of 10 services to a customer, and they would want an explanation as to why you missed the 10th opportunity. You fellow associates are also paid on commission so the fight for good hours and good customers was fierce. Sells and being shady about the truth to earn business was never what I wanted to do."
good,"At&t used to be a great place to be employed but they are not cutting more than 50% of their workforce, making it a stressful environment. I've learned a lot. The employees are great but the upper management pass down a lot of processes that don't fit the jobs that employees are paid to do because they don't do the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the compensation. You are well compensated at AT&T, however with all the changes being made and the acquisitions of new companies such as Direct TV there is no room for advancement and NO job security."
good,"Be patient, be courteous, follow troubleshooting steps and take nothing personal. Good people to work with. Can be stressful AT times. Good speaking voice and good hearing a must. The better your multi-tasking ability the better off you will be."
good,hard to balance home and work life but overall pay is decent. Overall upper management does not know what it is like to work in the stores and put unrealistic demands on sales
good,"Good place to work. There are some in higher positions that like to think that you will be able to drop what ever you are doing and tend to their needs right when they ask. "
good,The pay was good benefits were available but is it worth the daily grind?  The retail world can be a tough place to convert your time into $$ and I wouldn't call it a dream job but it may be a stepping stone.
good,"they are constantly changing the compensation structure, making it harder to earn money, the benefits are good and discounts are as well. their sales focus changes every few months"
good,I survived the Directv merger as a legacy Directv employee. With the merger we saw AT&T come in and downsize nearly all of our perks and benefits as well as employee appreciation programs.
good,The job was a good learning experience. I became more of a people person and learning how to search for information faster. Co-Workers were friendly and customer were a bit challenging yet the product sold its self.
good,"I didn't mind the call center environment, but I do think they micro-managed too much. Manuevering to so many different applications to solve problems with cell phones and time given to rectify problems."
good,"Long Commute, too many shifts, frequent changes, zero focus on customers, only focus was on TV add-ons for Direct TV and U-Verse, other than that is was great"
good,At&t overall was a great company to work for management was overpowering and stifled employee growth. Many instances job growth was impeded do to  measurements which were unattainable
good,AT&T has a good culture to work for and pay is great. enjoyed the training aspect of the job very hands on and willing to work with you to get threw the training.
good,"The company as a whole employees really fun people and they really like to acknowledge accomplishments. The pay can be better but as a whole, I have enjoyed my time with this company."
good,"Good paying job, good culture, needs better managers, great benefits.  Good people to work with.  Have to be a people's person to work here.  Very fast pace but also has a lot of down time.  Have to be with the company for a while to get a good schedule.  Just like any other retail job."
good,Would recommend to a friend to work. I worked there for 8yrs and was able to go from store manager to district  MGR in 5yrs. AT&T will provide you the tools to be successful.
good,"phones were always wringing non stop."
good,Very thorough and extensive training. Management constantly listened in on your collection calls and critiqued everything you did. This is not a place to work if you don't like to be micro managed.
good,"A typical work day in the remittance center is always busy and moves quite fast. The day starts by checking the board to see how many items were delivered by the post office. Once that number is determined we're able to see how many representatives will be required to process the work. Throughout the day all opened mail is transported to another department where the checks and stubs are ran through larger machines while the images are captured for the bank. Once the checks and payments are processed, these checks and stubs are stored in a highly secure area until they are ready to be purged. "
good,Management is a joke. You only get to be a manager by who you know. Supervisor's do not try to improve their employees but degrade them to keep them from moving up into their positions. Unless you fit in their click...you don't fit. Pay is not based on your experiences and abilities but if you have been accepted into your supervisor's click. The union is just name's sake and WILL NOT defend you as a union member but defends and backs the company.
good,"there is no work life balance, they pay good but they suck the life out of you, there is a really nice environment with coworkers, it depends on the store."
good,"This was an amazing opportunity until the current management staff was put in place.  The pay is awesome because you set your salary by your sales.  no weekends, minimal travel."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work if you're a ""company man"" type. They focus entirely too much on numbers and metrics, often times unfairly and not objectively acquired from angry customers.  The outsourcing of call centers only slows progress and angers loyal customers.  The recent acquisition of DIRECTV has backfired on the customer service front. Long time DIRECTV customers are either ""dealing with"" the change or leaving and going to competitors. My hat is off to all those who have made money in the business deals made over the last couple years. The workers in the field, installing and servicing the infrastructure, are not paid nearly enough."
good,"productive and fun, really good work/life balance. most of the manger does not have technical back ground which is not good! their offers are good....."
good,Meeting new people and being able to help them. Most days are busy and fast paced. You get your breaks and lunch. you will do allot of standing for long periods of time. Things are always changing so you are always learning new things. Management can be fun and helpful. There is diversity in the workplace which makes it fun and interesting. The hardest part is probably dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable part is those angry customers leaving happy!
good,"ATT has lots of room for advancement, but schedules are strict,  and they rate your absence/tardies on a point system, which frustrating for unseen events."
good,"Had fun working on three different systems including the mainframe.  Dress code was casual, variety of work from simple data processing to complex software development."
good,the company provides many perks that are above average. the work day can be stressful and very long based on your placement within the company. If you are in the areas that are growing or which embrace change and openness--you will enjoy your time with the company.
good,"Got a good exposure on hadoop environment and got a good chance to learn about data ingestion techniques."
good,"Dealing with the public day in and out had its ups and downs, fun meeting new people and seeing different things everyday, not so fun when customers ask for the impossible, have dirty houses you have to work in, numbers and quotas are ridiculous at times.  Depending on the type of manager you had, some are more laid back, others degrade you and threaten you for making 1 mistake, unfortunately had the latter, very well paid and great benefits, schedule can be rough, a lot of forced OT, expect to work on holidays too"
good,Call center is structured with not much flexibility. He hours are better than retail hours. Not much opportunity for advancement or commission. Not much excitement and can get boring.
good,be prepared to work for every dime. good career very fulfulling and rewarding. requires a lot of your time so be prepared to not have a life but have money
good,"I loved AT&T; I really did. I didn't want to leave. However; the management was very strict. Almost too strict. They have  so many metrics and stats that you have to meet; and if you do not; you are placed onto a ""written notice"" which basically leads to termination in a few months if performance does not improve significantly. And that does not mean that you have to bed bad at your job to be on one. You can be very good at your job; and make all kinds of bonus' and still be on one. Yo are protected by a Union; you get great benefits; your start pay based on experience averages $13 as of March 2017. Raise every 6 months; and a raise every year. So a raise 3 times a year.  Days were very good; if you dont let the customers get to you emotionally. I held 2 jobs with management positions in my work history; and I will say that the customers at AT&T in the finance dept; have to be the worst group of customers I have ever worked with. It was very challenging. Work life balance at this job his not possible. I wish I had nicer things to say about AT&T; however; I pride myself in being honest. Its not all bad; there are good days; but  bad days seem to be the majority."
good,"Depending on if your supervisor truly cares about his/her techs, management is good/bad.  Mine was horrible.  Only showed care and compassion to an extent when up-line management was present."
good,This place is all about what you make it to be if you go in to work hoping that you make sale the odds are you won´t get one but if you go in to work knowing that you will hit your numbers the odds are you will.
good,"No day is the same and each different.  Complex, large environment, fun teams and always looking forward to more collaboration.  Great folks and initiatives!"
good,"I remember when my parents worked for Pacific Telephone company, the manager would come get my dad if he had car trouble. Now it's every person for themselves and if you don't meet the numbers you get written up."
good,"Telecommunication business has changed since the last years I worked here.  Benefits and work hours were great. To advance, one has to seek the information on their own because Management will not advise otherwise."
good,Benefits covered myself and child sufficiently for our medical needs. Compensation package was also sufficient for the area in which I live. Management within the local company is very supportive of employees.
good,"overall a good place to work, good pay and benefits, was able to retire early, physical work and love being outside no matter the weather"
good,"Retail hours are what to be expected. This includes weekends, holidays, nights, etc. Great benefits and pay. Raises are at least twice a year. It sales, so keep selling and it will be fine."
good,"Loved my coworkers there."
good,"I worked for Directv for 5 years. The company politics were not fun to deal with when it came to management BUT I loved my co-workers. The environment was great but the commission structure changed as well as management, too often."
good,"Being a Project Manager and having the opportunity to deal with cross functional teams, it is wonderful to work with such talented individuals in each domain. You have a great work life balance, working for AT&T and an exposure of lifetime."
good,I worked in three corporate locations in Northeast Arkansas evaluating customer's needs and negotiating with the customer to find and sell the correct cellular plan to meet their needs.  I provided customer service by giving explanations of billing and by showing customers how to use the available features on their cellular equipment.  I also acted as mediator between customers and customer service reps that involved both parties.  These were usually billing issues.  I was also in charge of scheduling appointments for the installations of cellular equipment in vehicles which I did on my days off. Reason for leaving:  Owner sold out and I didn't want to continue with new management.
good,"Typical day at work was spending time with my direct reports, whether in team meetings, attending classes, side-by-sides and one-on-ones, etc. Most of my career was developed at AT&T, by some great managers and mentors."
good,"Good place to work just need more of a work life balance. friendly environment work with customers hands on everyday. My co-workers are great, helpful and reliable"
good,As a representative it was a job that was easy to do being that I am a sales and service type person. I never had to deal with discipline or was on the managements bad side so I came in and did my job and left.
good,"Management team will organize, participate and chairs conference meeting with team members who are working at various countries and will bring up to date information regarding the work we have achieved so far. "
good,"Loved working for the company until they laid me off 8 months later.  Don't get too comfortable because you never know when your job is in danger.  They hired me for skills, but laid me off for someone of less skill to move into my position because he was there longer than me."
good,"Overall..pretty good company to work for.Although it's in a retail setting,it's pretty sales driven.Everything is weighted and has metrics for the company.Company has been increasing sales goals,but decreasing commissions,making it seem like RSC are slowly becoming customer service reps,with sales goals."
good,There was only one member of the local staffed management which cared about its employee's career development. I was fortunate that my director report manager did care enough to help me climb the ladder of success.
good,"Upper management only concerned with breaking the union, bottom line.    Employees and 1st, 2nd level management are great"
good,"The most rewarding part of my job was knowing that my customers were well educated on everything that I installed in their homes and knowing that I performed a high quality job. Also knowing that in the end, everything was installed/repaired to the highest quality as a standard"
good,Fine place to work. Management hours are long but flexible.  Demanding.  Good benefits.  Long career.  Options for change or advancement.  Would recommend.
good,"The company changed when AT & T purchased DIRECTV. The scheduling isn't convenient for anyone with a family. They forced us to work crazy hours, very inconvenient."
good,The job was well paying with great benefits but the environment was not fun and the way the company treated the employees was subpar and the customers were degrading
good,"AT&T is a company that is so large it's difficult to provide and accurate review, however, the department I worked in we were under appreciated and the company morale was very low. Every year we were faced with more and more company downsizing and being told that you livelihood was in jeopardy every December right before Christmas doesn't sit well with anyone who has a family depending on them. So many bad practices and decisions by upper management made life as an employee stressful and unfulfilling, making the benefits and salary the best part of my employment."
good,Good company in retail. Commission chart needs to be steady and not change so often. Love working with customers to help figure out problems on their day to day problems. Great co-workers and day to day life at the company.
good,I enjoyed working with the customers & selling our newest products; it was a great experience getting to learn the new decives & showing others. The benefits were good as well.
good,Good job out of college to gain lots of skills.  Once progression becomes stagnant its time to leave which can push your salary up to industry level.
good,"Great pay and benefits but chance for advancement is ridiculous. I ended up applying for over 25 jobs right after I got an MBA and a Master of Science in Leadership but only had 1 interview, because people had over 20-30 years experience there was no recognition in El Paso, its not what you know but who you know."
good,"the job itself was quite enjoyable & stable, a perfect mix of job life & family life. Management was friendly & nurtured those who were new in the industry. Each day consisted of a work load that was to be completed before employees could leave for the day, not to exceed 12 hours. This was good for pay for those looking for the money, for those not obviously not so much."
good,"Good place to network and build experience. Despite the propondereance of engineering work and technology, there is very little core engineering functions. Expect to move around alot and be flexible. "
good,Working at AT&T was very educational. I learnt to tie in customers needs to our products. The hardest part working at AT&T was learning the channel listing for U-verse although I mastered later on. My co-workers at AT&T where great I got to learn about different cultures. I enjoyed working at AT&T because of the challenges.
good,"Great company to work for, unfortunately management directly affects job environment whether it be good or bad. Commission structure changes twice a year which in turn yields a pay cut for commissioned employees."
good,"fun young group of people to work with but pay is low and hours are hard. Training was three weeks, pretty easy job and laid back environment. Moving locations"
good,"I held many different positions within the company, I enjoyed my work environment and teams."
good,"Got an opportunity to learn about cloud technologies and be part of a large team."
good,"Earnings were great but keep in mind, you will get lost in the numbers. The company was so big that they did not identify you by your name but by a number. You pretty much are on your own with not much support from management."
good,"A typical day was answering incoming calls and handling guest phone and service issues. I learned that being in a call center that you can not get distracted, have a tentative ear and pay attention to details. My co-workers and I were in close proximity and had to be respectful of each work space. The hardest part of the job was to handle international calls. The most enjoyable part about the job was learning all the services and products, and how to trouble shoot technical issues."
good,Management was good. I learned a lot about the telecommunications world and it's equipment. The hardest part was dealing with the miscommunication within the company as a whole.
good,The people make the the job great and its really simple i loved it when i was there. Also its an awsome environment.
good,I have learned a lot about satellite TV. I really enjoy knowing that I can help people over the phone with technical issues. The best part of the job is providing excellent customer service.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my tenure at AT&T.  I spent 35 years with AT&T and would not trade the experience.  I learned so much about customer service and enjoyed working w/both internal and external customers especially in the problem-solving arena.
good,"great work, fun enjoyable work, management and corporate greed and needs always increasing, new metrics to meet, no extra time to complete extra added work, punished for everything,"
good,"Go to jobs,  see what material that we are going to need for the job.  Put the sate lite on the house of poll mount it.  Make sure its pointed south.  Go into the house run small amounts of wire because its for the most part wireless.  Hook up boxes to TV with a hdmi cable make sure everything is correct.  Call direct TV company get them to turn it on program the remote and it finished.  I dont think any of it is hard.  I have learned everything about hooking and programming direct TV.  I enjoy getting too meet different people, its just one guy and me that work together."
good,"Great pay. Great union. hard working job, could be worse, could also be better. A lot of flaws in the fine print. a lot of changes in the company."
good,You'll make great money and the atmosphere is fun and inviting. but you have to have a really high self esteem to work here. you cant let words hurt you. the words will come from management and customers.
good,Fun workplace/but also very professional. boss's were very nice and perfessional. The company itself was a good company just not enough hr's
good,"Well-known for substandard pay. Benefits eroding on a yearly basis. On the other hand, a well-managed, fiscally conservative company that's making a lot of right business moves. Managers vary from great to pretty bad. Sad to say they often boost the bottom line by taking away from employees. CEO will say anything, true or not, to push the company's agenda: ""If we acquire T-mobile, it won't reduce competition in our industry."" Are you kidding me?"
good,"aprendi a desenvolverme mas con los clientes "
good,Overall a fun great place to work! Very family oriented and caring to their employees. Awesome health care benefits and others including half off AT&T products and services. Free Directv. Best part of the job is being able to assist external and internal customers with any and all technical issues.
good,I learned a lot about sales and business development. My co-workers and manahers were great and very supportive. I found that there was alot of opportunity for growth if I performed and worked hard
good,High Stress environment in day to day operations from user management.. Love the People tat worked under me.. love working with customer to remove issues with service
good,"Enjoyed helping people with problems, worked hard and made some great friends. Learned a lot about people skills and working with management to create a good work environment for all."
good,"The most enjoyable part of Directv was the cultural in the call center.  Directv employed a vast majority of people.  A typical work day would include inbound calls assisting customers with billing, programming or tech support."
good,done work in comfortable and convenient zone. delivered projects within the deadline. to do that met with very tough times but crossed them successfully. didnt get remark from clients.
good,long hours management is ok sometimes they can be a bit rough.  I learn a lot with this company.  If i need to rearrange wires in my house i have no problem doing so.  The co-works were ok some was positive and some was negative.  I also like the fact that they had a union.
good,company is not considerate of people they say they care for during restructure process. other than that its a great company. good discounts and strong stocks. Global leader in technology
good,"Working here was rough; long hours each day and constantly having a lack of balance between work and school. If you are trying to go to school full time and work here, I do not recommend it because AT&T does not do part time in retail."
good,"I am an exceeds to far-exceeds employee. I get an incredible amount of work done in a typical work day. I've been told that my output is more than 3 people. I LOVE to be busy - I'm efficient and my work activities vary enough that I don't get bored. I have fun every day. I love the folks that I work with, though some of the management are concerned with ""knowledge sharing"", poor communication skills and taking credit for other's work. Most management(myself and MANY others) enjoy giving credit to our teams and pushing them onward and upward and helping them reach their career goals. I love sharing my knowledge, mentoring and collaborating. I don't know it all - no one does. I love being challenged. AT&T's Leadership is phenomenal. It's like almost anywhere you go - there are your high performers, your 1 or 2 low performers and then middle. I prefer to work in the high area, work with my low performers and challenge them and also develop my middle folks. I am and have been a high-functioning/cross-functional, Agile, etc team developer for over 5+ years and the best part of my projects and teams are to see folks grow and move upward!"
good,"learned new methods and skills always opportunity to grow. team leads and managers were always available to help or answer any questions. had daily goals that needed to be met, incentives"
good,great job if you love working with people and love selling! Quota can stressful sometimes but overall its a nice job to have.
good,"being on the computer all day entering customers data into the DirecTV system. I learned how to get Satellite positions for different states/cities and or counties. The hardest part of my job was sometimes not reaching desired amount of accounts. The most enjoyable part of my job was the experience,my paycheck and the friends I made within the company."
good,"This was a typical call center environment where you answered inbound calls and helped customers with questions about their bill, advised and recommended products and services.   Enjoyed coworkers and managment"
good,"Goals are hard to teach, the shifts suck. It's not consistent. They etch you like a hawk, and you are threatened daily that you could lose your job. Very stressful."
good,"I appreciated the opportunity. It's a great start for anyone interested in sales and making a lot of money. Very stressful environment that's super fast-paced, but if you're into that it's perfect for you!"
good,Attend sales meetings and go door 2 door to sale att uverse. May also be required to train new hires. We had national calls once a week to talk about the progress of our market as well as others.
good,"I worked here from the time the store opened, until almost a year later when I realized business was not going to pick up. I would sometimes go all day without seeing any customers. During that time  I would clean the store, do inventory, and whatever else I could to keep myself busy."
good,"AT&T is a very large company, and it operates as such. I work with many people from all different places and walks of life, and that has enriched my work and life experiences."
good,I have a team of tech that love what they do and the AT&T help me to get more education that will help me because good at what i do...
good,I was handling over 100 calls a day being screamed at by U-Verse customers. My favorite part about the job was building rapport and solving their technical issues. The conversations always started rocky but by the end of it we could joke and laugh because I did my job.
good,Very competitive job but well worth it. Comfortable and very easy to learn everything you need to know. Hours are kind of rough if you have a family. Everyone is friendly and training is offered so there's no need to worry if you don't know anything because you will learning anything and everything there is to know.
good,A typical day is very busy !!! All calls are monitor for time handle you have to handle the call within 3-5 minutes. It can be very frustrating especially right out of training.
good,"Great company. Great pay.  Not sure how much they value their employees, Every year there is a fear of being .laid off.  If you go in as a contractor, don't expect to be hired as a permanent employee."
good,Love the job and the people. Good company to work for to get a stepping stone under your belt. If company were to up the pay or not take away bonus structures would be a most desireable job.
good,A typical day would be running reports and creating forcast models for the sales and service organiziations looking at potential sales as well as potential revenue spent for the month
good,"My experience here was not the greatest. I only got paid if I made a sale. the hours were horrible, but grant I could make my own schedule."
good,"On going learning to keep updated with all the new product."
good,"On the phone 8hrs, learned what customer service truly is, management styles varied based on the individual, not a standard, co-workers were catty, hardest part was being on time due to traffic, most enjoyable were the incentives"
good,"Directv provides an opportunity to advance within the company, but taking phone calls up to 7 hours a day can be mentally exhausting."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work as long as you're focused entirely on your numbers and sales metrics rankings. Career advancement, even to non-sales positions, is only open to top-level performers."
good,Company doesn't care about the employee well being or family. Expect their employees to work at least 60 hours or more weekly without and thought.
good,"Mobility is a fast paced environment with constant change. If you are quick to learn new skills, you can survive. Projects are started and completed at a very fast pace and can be overwhelming in the beginning."
good,"Strict with punctuality. Cannot be more that 3 mins after logging in to start taking calls. Two 15 mins break, One hour lunch. No down time unless systems go down or if there is a management meeting or training in new products. Took an average of 40 calls a day. We logged off the phones if we needed to call a customer back to resolve a difficult issue. Paid vacations, medical, dental vision were the best. Regular salary increases. Systems, company policies kept changing frequently,with a email reflecting the changes. Not much interaction with co workers on a daily basis except during breaks or group lunch outing. Average handling time of calls and sales per cal were rewarded with bonuses and incentives."
good,"A typical day at work would be selling, educating and troubleshooting customer's products and services affiliated with AT&T."
good,"The work reporting system left much to be desired as it was easy to manipulate and most workers could get away with not doing very much work if they knew how to manipulate the system. The work environment was very safe, the project managers were very good, but I heard there were a few that could be hard to work with. My observations were that AT&T is very wasteful with their money and didn't care much for their customers. They tended to overspend a LOT on projects and that could have been easily avoided. If they don't correct their ways soon I see them going bankrupt or the victim of yet another government ""bail out."""
good,"It's a stable place to work."
good,"fast paced"
good,The work was satisfying but I had to use my own car and gas but did not get  reimbursed  for it.
good,"Not the company for me, the management was horribl ein my eyes."
good,I was promoted with in two mouths and i was training on a daily. Up to about five to seven people
good,"Very Fast pace work, Back to back calls however, they do give you a very in depth in class training.  You are provided with skills that we be very helpful on your calls.  There is one on one reviews weekly and an opportunity for growth to floor support or management."
good,"Typical day was providing advice and counsel to all levels of management on Employee Relation issues from workplace, performance and misconduct issues related to management and non-management.  Also provided training to all levels of management on Human Resource issues or information."
good,My rating reflects the life of a Wire Tech or Prem Tech. NOT other positions or the company itself.
good,"Alright place to work. Full time is too much, but they give you lots of breaks and make sure your getting everything needed."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of answering the needs of customers concerning their device or monthly plan, We merged accounts, as well as worked on business accounts. There were inquiries about billing statements, and request for new accounts.The co workers were friendly. The hardest part was an irate customer. The enjoyable part was the staff, and having a pleased customer who enoyed your service."
good,"A fact paced call center. I took collections/customer service calls involving billing issues, payments and payment arrangements. It is a stressful job. I enjoy being able to assist customers."
good,I have enjoyed working with the managers and employees. I have made alot of friendships here. My job can be stressful and I just take one call at a time and one day at a job. I have learned to put myself in customers shoes to fully resolve their issue.
good,good place to work. with advancement opportunities and good pay.
good,"Always learning new things and strategies to do better. Great environment to work in always able to elevate up the ladder,"
good,"Receives 70+ inbound business/residential customer calls per day."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"Good place to work. I learned a lot from the manager. I feel the company should provide other facilities, atleast provide paper cups."
good,The best part of working for AT&T in my opinion is being a part of new and exciting technology. Sales team sharing your passion for this common interest.
good,"good job, good pay good benefits. Management was poor, but I don't think its a universal culture, just in one store. The superiors will only approve advancements within company only if they like you, your performance, tenure, and experience means nothing."
good,"Competitive, fun, and busy atmosphere. Very busy fast paced and extremely overwhelming. Lots of money to be made!"
good,"There is no typical day at a cellular call center.  Dealt with billing questions, sold phones, plans and features."
good,I enjoyed my 10 yrs at AT&T because ive met some very interested people while there. I also learned alot and achieved peronal goals when i was greatly edged on.
good,"Laid back atmosphere, fairly monotonous work, but very low stress."
good,This job took away all social life that I had. Managers were not very understanding and often times would nitpick work. The pay was good but not worth the work.
good,"They do not pay enough for what they demand of you. Very stressful. The company expects so much from you, as well as the customers. Working on the phones all day is not the bad part, as long as you can understand that they are calling to yell at the company, not you. Management always wants from you, however they do not help you when you need it."
good,"Working in the field was fun for me because of the variety of the jobs, until recently I could make most decisions by myself on the job to get service to the customer and I felt that was the most rewarding, also when a customer thanks you for a restoration to their service, I felt a sense of accomplishment."
good,"I have been with at&t for nearly 14 years. Job responsibilities require you to keep current up with technology(greatest part). Great place for that, but not much as it relates to advancement opportunities into management or job relocation. Very disappointed in that area for sure.Have had good co-workers to be with, although my job was usually preformed on an individual basis as a rover for 12 years as a comm. tech working midnights. Currently typical day at work is to monitor the U-Verse feed into the metropolitan area, which there are only two of us that do this and I am one of them. We monitor all related eq. such as power plants, video eq. and all related servers and multiplexing eq in our office. The most enjoyable part of my job is keeping up with eq. monitoring and maintaining the office for reliability to better serve our external customers.Please read resume to get a full understanding of complete background. Thank you."
good,"Good place to work, I learned a lot about the wireless phone industry"
good,"AT&T was a nice company to work for, but they started a program for efficiency, and productivity that does not really apply to the work load. Considering the industry is going to fiber based structure, the daily work we normally do is disipearing daily. They do have good pay and benefits."
good,"This is a job where you have very high goals but with effort can be done easily. However, it is still a very stressful job because of those very high goals themselves. One pretty much lives at the store so say goodbye to your family."
good,"Just like any other fields not everyday is a best day but I always kept a positive attitude, vibrant smile and friendliness. Always give it 100% and let negativity slide right off. Learned a lot about new tech products popular nowadays and educated customers with new gadgets. Reading people and being to identify and connect with them was part that i enjoyed the most. Coworkers were the best to work with, always team players and they always counted on me. In the sales enviroment the hardest part for me at AT&T was the demand of ""quotas"" keeping up with the numbers was a tough task, some months good some bad months. The reduction of our commission pay and increase on numbers was not acceptable. I personally believe that i can give you my 110% in the field but i'd also like to see the same in return. Companies depend from the customer as much of the employee. Any businesses."
good,Working AT&T was a great experience. My co-workers are extremely nice people. Working for this company just isn't for me.
good,A typical work day is hit your sales number. No communication between management and workers. I have learned to master the customer service realm. Co- workers are great and help each other. The hardest thing of the job is when your partnering with other departments you end up on a very long call. The most enjoyable is interacting with the customers.
good,"Answering phone calls all day, I was technical support for AT&T DSL service. Based in San Salvador, E Salvador."
good,"my work day consists of resolving customer issues and returns and exchanges, account and billing corrections and changes."
good,"sales are never good enough, commissions change frequently (always chasing the cheese)"
good,"While making top-scale pay, it was the least enjoyable position.  There was no ""ownership"" of the position; very constricted call-flow disallowing much personal interaction or customer relations.  The atmosphere was professional when on the phone, but very casual when off."
good,Great Pay and Benefits and a very high pressure environment
good,"When I joined the AT&T family it was a very good place to work.  The benefits were outstanding and so was the pay.  These last few years with SBC buying out AT&T, it is slowly becoming a place where only the top dogs in the company make any money.  Each union contract that comes up they take more and more of our benefits and hurt our retirees.  You can no longer live on your pension if you retire...oh that's right...not many of us get traditional pension any more.  The cash balance program that most of us get now won't hardly pay your electric bill after 20 years with the company.  They keep moving people in and out the door so they don't have to pay benefits or decent wages any more."
good,I enjoyed the benefits and the compensation.  I had the pleasure of working with a great staff that was like family.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers and meeting sales objectives.
good,My experience working at Directv is relaxing at times and sometimes not so relaxing. Benefits are good and sitting in nice cool environment. 
good,"- Gained good exposure to Telecom domain."
good,"boring to work, waiting on customers to come into store in a really small town "
good,Upper management could not seem to make up there mind on what they expected of representatives. So you never new if you were doing your job properly because they could have changed a rule yesterday that you didn;t get a memo about yet. So although they paid you well they made sure you worked for every penny of it. 
good,"Abililty to sit at your desk and ansswer incoming calls from customers with problems with the phones, internet, bills."
good,"The telecom space is competitive and challenging. The projects are complex and keep you on your toes.  "
good,"AT&T is an overall great company to work for considering experience gained, solutions, tools used at the job and management's commitment to customers.  However, the company is not innovative, company focus products and services constantly change, and bad planning causes problems with budgets, and employee advancement.  Employee morale is low but AT&T does a great job with distracting employees' attention from low moral by holding company funded gatherings."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was helping the hard of hearing place calls to their loved ones or to a business or whomever it may be to communicate.
good,"Customer service assisting a variety of cultures. Every day was something different . Management was sales driven, Hardest part of job was over coming multiple times when a customer stated not interested. Enjoyable part of job was customer satisfaction and the atmosphere and co-workers"
good,"Great company as far as compensation, but it has a price. Mostly minimal free time, moderate stress and sometimes annoying coaching. The sales process is very monitored, if you miss one step expect managers to critique you on it with almost every customer you cross. There are a great deal of rules that must be upheld daily. Be sure when you clock in, you thick skin and happy face is on lock."
good,"talked with 50 plus customers awering billing questions, servicing their every need"
good,Team working environment with advancment possiblities. Lots of areas for advancement and growth.
good,Working at AT&T was a greatexperience for me. I learnt few HR techniques which i had only studied.
good,i had fun at work and did my job some time. my co-workers are really cool. i really get along with them.
good,"A typical work day starting as a tech consist of picking up needed equipment (coax cable, receiver boxes, dishes, connectors, etc.) pre-ordered to warehouse fax the night before after route is faxed to home. Techs wait in line hoping that warehouse has the need equipment, if not techs are to call other tech who may have extra equipment. Routed jobs (1,2,3,4 room installs, dish moves, upgrades, etc.) are scheduled as AM or PM and must be done by assigned time window, which is the hardest part but techs done early may help other techs. Team work is a major part of the job and management (Team Leaders) must be available at all times to make certain installation decisions and occasionally calm down angry customers that were disappointed by previous techs work and request to speak to a supervisor but 99% of the time experienced installers will fix of clarify any customer problems."
good,I enjoyed working with Direct TV. I got to meet a lot of people while attempting make the sales. I learned a lot and strengthen my knowledge about customer service and sales.
good,"Overall a good company to work for if you are single and have no children. Again, training was excellent and well organized."
good,I was a facilitator for 10 years and enjoyed transferring the knowledge of sales and service to my clients. I also transistioned into the role of Events Planner and traveled extensively to promote the company.
good,My job was from 6am-2:30pm m-f/open for inbound calls for the mid west from 6am to 8am then to blended incoming and outgoing calls. Rotation to work on different aspects of A/R for different states of the US.
good,AT&T was the highest paying job I've ever had. Great commission incentives.
good,"Advised and informed customers of endorsed products and services, generating new sales and augmenting established accounts. Attentively assisted customers with orders and/or billing-related issues. Aggressively achieved sales quotas and service objectives in a fast-paced call center environment."
good,"As long as you are a rule follower, you will do great here. They have rules for everything. Which actually helped me out and helped give a better foundation of work morals and ethics than I had when I started. I received a lot of training which I have been able to apply to other jobs I've had since."
good,A good provider / pretty good employee discounts.
good,"A typical day at work includes working in an exciting, stressful, fast-paced, and ever changing environment. I have been able to maintain and improve communication skills, problem solving skills, managing and motivating subordinates to excel. The most difficult part of my job is being away from my family for 10+ hours a day. The most enjoyable part of my job is inspiring my employees to excel and out-perform other teams."
good,"I would take calls from customers having issues with there phones or wanting to check status of orders. I would have many different systems i would have to use on the computer daily. I used billing systems have to note accounts. Sometimes call other phone carriers. I enjoyed most of the people I worked with. There were some managers that would assist if needed it, but they were some that didn't care if you knew what to do.I enjoyed speaking with the customers and resolving their issues."
good,I would recommend working for AT&T if you want to earn a decent salary. You will feel the sales pressure from the top down. Must have thick skin and the will to sell. Sales positions are unionized and management jobs are not.
good,A day working at at-t was wonderful. I learned so much. The management was fair and right.Co-workers was outstanding peoples Some of the fine ness.the hardest part is when you can not get alone.Enjoyable part is when you like your job.
good,This company use to have values toward its employees. However doing the merger it begin to slack off and the employees begin to feel no sense of commitment.
good,"Very paced, always had a set time to start, breaks and going home. Love that I had my own desk, hated that nobody knew how to mind their own business always trying to start drama, as per the company itself, excellent training, benefits and time management."
good,I learned a lot about customer service and the ATT products.
good,Good company to work for other than ever changing ways to hurt employees commision such as cutting down number of lines a customer is allowed to have or raising prices on home products. Not all bad though they put you through lots of ongoing training to ensure there employees are educated on all new product and services.
good,The job its self would be great if you can handle being trained to do things one way then learn to do them totally different. Which I am able to do. The stats however are something you can't meet everytime. Your success is not your own the customers view on the company and your interaction determines your success. So unless you have a way of changing the opinion of every customer you can't have good stats all the time
good,"have sales meetings every monday,wednesday,friday at noon and after that usually the team goes to lunch together then heads out into the ""field"" together where you have a packet of around 80 doors to knock on and try to sell your product"
good,"I think ATT Wireless headquarters need to revamped with educated employees instead of their friends. The Texas office had the most qualified people in the IT department but was the first to be let go! It was sad how they treated us, Texans. However, we were treated as we still rode horses to work but we had more degrees than employees from Seattle, Washington. At the end, the Texas employees were happy with the layoff!"
good,"Company micromanges and not very well as it attempts to engage employees on a level of expenditures. The office is a great location and is very community oriented but corporte politics often changes and is expected without proper training or explanation. AT&T is a wonderful company for benefits and compensation, but offers very little job security and advancement in my current field."
good,Great Salary & Benefits no opportunity for advancement or career growth.
good,Oveall this is a good company to work for. They offer an excellent benifits package and competitive wages.
good,AT&T benefits were one of the very good things. Salary also was competetive.
good,"The pay is good and the benefits are great, but a lot of times people get micromanaged( i fear because managers really have nothing else to do). And theres always lots of pressure for sales al the time."
good,"I originally hired on with AT&T, noticed a big change in culture/management once SBC bought our logo."
good,My co-workers make this job easy. You feel a real sence of team work here. Everyone is always welling to help each other out.
good,"I believe ATT is a good start up for anybody, but lately it looks like they're much older group of people working fiber. I worked on copper for over a year, once they let us go, it seemed difficult to find work that's similar without being contracted out."
good,La paga es muy buena y los compañeros muy bien la verdad
good,Came in under SBC great work environment.  New CEO and now AT&T work environment and attitudes slowly went down hill for managers and employees alike.
good,If you are in management you are always concerned about lay offs. The compensation is good. Managing frontline employees in a union environment could be a bit difficult
good,"AT&T is overall a good work experience. On the Retail and Sales side, the schedule includes long hours and nights and weekends. Growth is limited and is not a fast track."
good,Everything is good can’t complain good company . Can’t go wrong with this company the people are great and the benefits are even better ! If you looking for a good place to work at&t is the place
good,"I did not start with AT&T, but worked at DirecTV until they were bought by AT&T.  Once AT&T took over, we noticed a drastic change in the way our employees and customers were treated.  Employees were forced to come to work in horrid weather conditions, resulting in some employees getting in accidents.  Helping customers seemed limited compared to when we were DirecTV owned.  Though I started to see traction moving up in the end, I decided to leave and pursue my long awaited education."
good,"Great company to work for but due to issues with a supervisor and HUMAN RESOURCES not resolving I will not return ever! I miss the pay,  my clients and the friends a made while working there but beware supervisors as some will talk down to you."
good,"Hours and pay are great, as well as benefits only downfall is it is very stressful and driven environment. If you are great at sales would be a good job for you."
good,"Center closed and people have been laid off. So I would not recommend employment in a call"
good,Loved working there at first. Once the center got new manager they took away all the percs to make extra money an activities we had at work for doing good job and morale went down hill. No one I know works there now.
good,There was no job security. Over 18 years 3 departments I worked in closed and I had to find other work within the company until March of 2018 when I was laid off
good,"Determine what the customer’s issues were and what their call outcome was."
good,Great place to work. Have to be coachable and consistent. Work life balance is only possible in fully staffed store. If not you’ll be having a lot of overtime and fatigue
good,"Working with the company was fairly complicated. A lot went into the process, but once i was settled in it was a good feeling being able to help others get the technology and things they wanted in a price and a convenience they loved."
good,"Good atmosphere to work, but very frequent and high layoffs.  Very stressful wondering what group would be affected by layoffs next.  Felt appreciated by direct manager, but not corporate management."
good,El ambiente laboral es muy bueno y aprendes mucho sobre las actividades que se llevan
good,I have nothing to add to this. I would not like to say anymore. We are currently going through a surplus and that is whi I am looking for another job.
good,"Work for the company almost 15 years. Recently left only because of sales. I hate to force sales into the conversation. You work hard to get the customer issue resolve i.e lower bill, fix a problem that had the customer upset then you have to turn around and sell them something. Even if you pitch it and they don’t take it you are penalized. Most people who make it use word play to get sales."
good,The position of outside plant technician had great pay.  the job was fairly easy once you learned what to do.  But there was absolutely no job security.  they cut the position and laid everyone off (regardless of how well you did the job) and only gave the employees a weeks notice.
good,"There would be plenty of times I was stuck at the customer house waiting on my on the job supervisor to come help, however that would take hours;s. Eventually you get used to it, but it's still back breaking"
good,"AT&T offers a very sturctured sales environment with proper coaching and training. If you want to have a taste at sales and see what it takes to have success in the industry, AT&T is the place to be. They value employee success in addition to preparing you to meet attainable goals."
good,"Typical day is taking technical calls, assisting customers on how to fix a problem. Take payment, go over billing questions, change packages, schedule technicians to go to houses and correct systems issues."
good,3rd Party store so we see the challenges one could face hopefully my experience did let me see the potential At@T have to offer due to overall circumstance of not being the Corporate store
good,"I’ve gained a lot of experience in my time with AT&T. I’ve had a lot of freedom to run my day to day business the way i need to, within boundaries and suggested outlines. The culture is definitely suffering at this time due to cutbacks within the company and an unsteady market/future for the product. Overall, I would recommend the company to anyone, and it’s been a great opportunity."
good,"Working for AT&T isn't a bad job but times have changed since working for Directv. "
good,"For the most part, working at AT&T was not a bad experience. The managers were always very helpful and supportive. I worked with a great team and could always count on my coworkers for assistance if I needed it."
good,"AT&T feels like a stepping stone to me. The culture is very friendly and welcoming. However, there is not too much opportunity to advance or get promoted. There is no travel in my position and most of the people I work with everyday are not even in the same state. It seems odd to work with someone everyday for years and never actually meet them face to face. There are days that I have absolutely no human interaction."
good,"At&t on a daily basis was a fast paced and high call volume call center. It could be stressful at times as there are certain monthly call metrics that are to be met and customers are not always in a very happy mood if they have no phone service or their cell phone is not working. Benefits are ok, and compensation is fairly good."
good,"The ability to work from home when you work with teams international is a major benefit due to traffic in Atlanta. However, different SVP's have their own rules on when and how often you can work from home. The more old-school your new leader is, the less flexibility you end up having. Because of this you spend a lot of time dealing with what seems like executive whims."
good,They want you to basically forget about the customer's needs and SELL them DirecTV. No matter the problem of the customer. Instructions are never clear. Training was really unorganized.
good,"Working with servers dell hp and sun Solaris, monitoring applications creating Unix scripts helping senior administrators setting servers and adding new applications."
good,"•	Supported Application Infrastructure Activities for ATT MX Project, E-bill Application and Brite: Bill Application."
good,"It was a very great place to"
good,"●	Analyzed and helped in developing System Requirements for business."
good,Your morning begins with  a morning saftey meeting(huddle)  where you talk about road blocks you might encounter during the day. Then you dispatch and complete jobs throughout the day
good,"I enjoyed working for AT & T.  When the company did well, the employees would benefit. Productive work environment. Would have stayed with AT& T if it wasn't for me relocating."
good,Difficult to recall specific details considering its been a long period of time since my employment in that location. It was a wonderful job opportunity with great benefits.
good,"If you need a job, you do what you have to do. I found working at the call center to be a stressful environment .  I worked there for 9 years and went through many different managers. Its difficult to work in a place where your only a number and your constantly reminded of that by upper management and the decisions they make. Loved my job but disagreed with some of the policies which caused a very high turnover rate."
good,Poor management since AT&T (Dallas) took over in a semi-hostile take over from BellSouth.  I would have not retired if BellSouth was still the boss.  Employees outside of Texas were not fully embraced.
good,Working for AT&T has its perks but sometimes management can be really bad. It comes from their managers that gets it from their managers but sometimes they pressure employees so much that it makes the job hard to do. They expect a lot from you but are not willing to help you out when you need it. Sometimes when they are short staffed they make you work over time and sometimes it’s open to close. I loved working for AT&T until they began to pressure us and most times they would basically tell us to do it or we’ll ger fired.
good,before at&t bought directv I enjoyed the culture there a lot more they begun firing a lot of people after management went on a trip to south America to train a large call center there.
good,Great place to work coming out of college. Great pay for the level of work. The hardest part is finding a work life balance. The company is always changing.
good,Secure with good benefits- experience really depends on your manager and coworkers. Enjoy paid vacation and overtime / holiday pay. Mostly a good job but can be very stressful
good,"If you are willing to give up all weekends and nights to make a ton of money, this is the job for you. As a full time student it is no longer working for me, however it could be perfect for someone entry level in sales."
good,I was hired not knowing much about drafting..after 7 years experience  i'ver grown professionally and personally within the company..Great hours and friendly staff people
good,social skills and being productive. Giving the customer a great experience. Meeting your goals every month. Have to get used to change all the time. And enjoying working with my peers.
good,"I met a lot of talented people, the schedule was very flexible and the work was fun and easy. The place of work was very accommodated, it was a training facility so we have the advantage to have a cafeteria on sight."
good,The communications industry is still going through many changes and AT&T hasn't seemed to manage them very well when it comes to mid-level leadership - at least the areas of HR where I worked.  Talent Development has been reduced to on-line and web-based-training.  Workgroups are virtual (spread out all over) so you often don't know your co-workers.  The focus on reducing costs has resulted in a very cold and impersonal work environment.
good,"Too many changes with time sheets and rules. "
good,"The Order Manager position requires collaboration with many different groups throughout the organization on a day to day basis.  My job function included weekly conference calls with customers to update order progress. Fill out technical questionnaires w/the customer and software designers, writing the orders in numerous systems and tracking their progress to completion.  Coordinating and Scheduling the team members for the test and turn up and participating in those turn up calls."
good,10yrs with Directv and 1 under the AT&T umbrella.  That last year was rough.  A lot of “we’re not going to change a thing” chatter bunt in the long run cuts were made...it’s “par for the course” when companies merge.
good,"To be successful at AT&T you must be willing to work off the clock and if necessary relocate as regional offices consolidate. "
good,"Remote Network Provisioning for Voice, both Analog & ISDN, permissive Data.    T1 Provisioning, Test & Turn-Up.   Voice channels provisioning, Test & Turn-Up.   800, SDN and Local ""Digital Link"" routing Provisioning, Test & Turn-Up.   Very Detailed.  Many great Managers and Supervisors, and Co-workers.    Had to learn what to pay attention to, and what I could Ignore.    Eventually learned enough to assist Out-of-Service customers back to ""In'Service""."
good,"I was a Customer Service Representative, so I answered incoming calls. I went through 6 weeks of training in the beginning, and then was set loose on the phones. The amount of inbound calls were atrocious, and usually very stressful. Their scoring system on your performance was absolutely ridiculous. You were expected to keep almost every call to a limit of 3 minutes, which was hardly ever possible."
good,Great Coworkers to work with always willing to help each other . Great goal and incentives to keep the workers motivated to achieve all goals and great perks and benefits
good,Able to work in a relaxed environment and able to cross train with team members.  Interface with Clients directly to provide the best service available.
good,"Its a good company to work for, but it is very fast paced and very stressful...sales is the number 1 priority not good customer service. It seems like they dont really care about the customers issues.   I have great customer service skills but not so much on sailing aspect.   They have great compensation and benifits.   Attendance is very strict.  I missed on day in 8 months and was written up.  I was in the hospital.   I think they could improve on customer service rather than the sales aspect of the job.  I think that they should be more lenient on attendance when the workers are so sick they are throwing up   they shouldn't be at work"
good,I enjoyed my role at AT&T but outside of my team there was a lack of processes and poor leadership. In tech these things are crucial to successful campaign launches and quality builds.
good,The account overall was great but the company was very poorly maintained.. I would never work for this company again but would consider working with AT&T
good,"While may aspects of At&t are good such as good pay, discounts, benefits and people to work with, the company does not have a safe feeling of job security as they have been recently laying off many technicians in the field service area of company"
good,"i liked the job. was different every day. pay was good. was allowed to take work truck home. saved on gas. i was not happy with the union, we worked out of contract for over a year, and i think was the main reason in as laid off"
good,The job is good. In a call center environment there is not really opportunity for advancement within the same office. Any type of advancement requires job relocation. ATT does not offer work at home options for non-management employees
good,"I used to start at 3pm and usually finished at midnight. Tho job itself was ok, but AT&T as a company has many problems."
good,"I don't have anything positive to say but the benefits are great. If anyone decides to work for Digital Life, DO NOT. The moral in the center is totally dead and there is poor management."
good,working in a call center was a challenge but the atomosphere and managers made it doable. If werent for schedule i would have stayed. advanced quickly.
good,"Not a bad company to work for when they are growing. Now, as they are changing the way they do business, it's become stressful. Mostly it is a good company."
good,"Loved my work, it was challenging and fast-paced.  In December 2017, AT&T eliminated all IT Tech Dev positions that are not in their select cities.  This isn't the first time AT&T has cut people rather than offering an opportunity to move to another position.  Very disappointing."
good,"I worked at AT&T for 16+ years. When I first began my career there, it was Cingular Wireless. I went through many, many changes with the company. It's fast paced and ever changing. Some days would be slower and we would take 30-40 calls, others, it wasn't surprising to take 70-90 calls in a day. I actually had more managers than I was there number of years. My last manager was by far the best that I had. He was kind, understanding, and super positive always. The culture is very diverse. Everyone feels welcome and supported there. The hardest part of the job by far is the call volume and handling customer calls. We handled collections and with the ever changing policies, customers' often became irate and had to be de-escalated. It was very emotional at times to be called names and be cursed and screamed at on a daily basis.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. The people I worked with were always amazing. Our management team was great and we had wonderful benefits and were celebrated for accomplishments with food, snacks, and offline time. I learned after the many years there, that call center work isn't for everyone and it can really take its toll on you."
good,"This is a very stressful work environment. The pay si great, but you earn every bit of it. It is high paced, with a high sales objective.I held several positions with this company and there is opportunity to grow."
good,"- Self managed throughout the day. Going to customers houses and either installing AT&T services or repairing their service"
good,At&t was a very good paying job and at one time we had unlimited overtime.  Since telephones are regulated you signed on to mandatory overtime as in a regulated utility.
good,"A very friendly and professional working environment. You can have chance to work with professional team, and learn so many new technologies. A huge company."
good,I have to say that working at at&t has been one of my mostchallenges as far as working by myself as a splicing technician high speed data circuits from at&t central office to business customers.
good,The company is actually a fairly good place to work.  Compensation is more than fair and there is the opportunity to take various training classes. The biggest downside is job security.  They always seem to be reorging departments and you never know when your position might be eliminated or outsourced.  Lately they are on the kick that everyone needs to be collocated in the same location with the belief that this will speed up time to market.
good,"Good work environment, great teams.  Compensation and benefits are average.  Fast paced environment with continuous learning opportunities.  Job security is lacking a bit and advancement in many areas is slow or non-existent but is average in other areas."
good,Working at a Directv call center had it's up's and downs.  The pay was exceptional with many perks and incentives but the expectations on sales were very hard to comply with; jac
good,"Throughout the last 10 years I have worked with an amazing company, a company who has invested in me. AT&T offers many amazing opportunities when it comes to empowering its employees. Trainings and Web-based sessions are awesome. The company is headed to do greater and bigger things."
good,The people that work there are absolutely fun to be around on the day to day basis. The managers are okay. Some like to micromanage and some let the job title go to their head. The goals are unattainable and they make it hard for you to actually get you incentive check.
good,"Gained more experienced and knowledge at this position then I did my two years taking Cisco courses, be prepared to learn, and feel mentally drained at the end of the day. The knowledge is worth it!"
good,I would have stayed if I did not need to make more money and have more job security. This position will not be hired as an in-house position. Advancement would be as Management or a lead.
good,"Hard to balance work and personal life. Probably job security is better than other companies. Like the management support while working at at&t. Benefit is good, too."
good,"great company good benefits and easy going. Hours are reasonable no work on sundays which is great for those with families and to make any plans . Pass there test , interview and background is a must"
good,"As a sales representative for AT&T products & services, it is safe to say that every day is pretty unpredictable as far as customer interactions go. The company provides ample resources to ensure you are well-equipped to handle your day to day tasks, and to that end, it will fall on the individual to call on those resources when required. To be fair, my review may be biased due to the fact that I work for a highly-ranked authorized AT&T dealer and not AT&T corporate, but the products & services we sell and the problems we solve for customers who come to our stores are no different. Being a sales rep for this company has been my first full-time position since completing my 4-year degree last year and for better or worse, I feel that it has been an ideal position for entering the workforce. Opportunities to prove oneself and to demonstrate the desire to advance will occur on a regular basis, regardless of whether or not management explicitly present them. Working for a corporate AT&T store or otherwise requires reps to learn how to balance the many responsibilities of being a wireless product expert, a general-purpose technical support specialist, and an effective salesperson. The curve is quite steep even for those who consider themselves highly skilled in any one of those areas, so provided you focus on staying afloat for the first 2-3 months, you should be well-positioned to move up in a timely manner."
good,"Fast paced environment,varied job skills required day to day. Every job was different.  Problem solving skills helpful. Technology training was kept up to date."
good,"A typical day in my position was assisting my customers with inquires they had regarding troubleshooting or billing questions. "
good,"Great opportunities and job security for representatives. The company offered great benefits such as 401K, tuition reimbursement, health care benefits and discount."
good,"The rate at which AT&T lays off is astounding.  I was laid off 3 times in 6 years.  The work was some of the most challenging, but rewarding.  It was a fair days work for a fair days pay."
good,"You take between 40-50 calls a day for customer's issues.  You handle their problems with their bills/service or devise.  You have to be able to stay positive and not take things personal. "
good,Training was amazing. Cudos to the trainers at ATT. This is a retail job with benefits. If you cant handle retail hours such as working weekends I would not recommend this job.
good,"AT&T is a world leader in telecommunications, and with that comes an enormous amount of responsibility. I consistently monitored my personal sales numbers as well as the numbers of stores in our district. Average day included helping customers find the right device(s) for their needs. Heavy push on Directv sales, as well as adding new lines of service. Assist customers with troubleshooting of devices. Constant training and knowledge of current promotions and devices. As MOD (Manager on Duty) I am in charge of store operations, driving sales, deposits, and customer escalations. I have manager codes, and am able to override transactions according to the policies of AT&T. The best part of my job is being able to help customers, when you find that perfect solution for them or are able to fix a problem for them. The worst part of working there is the lack of consistency between departments and the attendance policy."
good,"My co workers are absolutely amazing. I'm currently stuck in the position of loving who I work with, but absolutely hating how much I make. Most postings for the job state ~$30k-$45k, I currently am making ~$14k working full time. The way their structure their commission means that if you happen to be at a slower store it is difficult to even get a commission paycheck. The overall job is a great sales job if the store gets enough traffic to make a good commission, however the amount of work you do is not at all worth minimum wage."
good,"Installation and repair uverse services, regardless of weather. Work until last job is gone from load. Rotating weekend ,decent pay. Work alone ,hands on with customers.good training"
good,"I enjoyed working here because it was very fast paced and competitive environment. There was lots of room for growth. When your quota was met we got bonuses, which I received every month. I left due to getting laid off"
good,This is the perfect job for a high school student or college student working their way thru. The bad thing about this company is there is no room for growth.
good,"The company did a program in place for advancement and training. However, advances were rarely given. My opinion is because of exceptionally sales skills."
good,"They had various schedules which accommodated college students."
good,"Your key job is to assess the clients needs, discover what they currently have for connected services and provide options to the client. Commission is involved for a little added income."
good,"Union job. Come in get out only hear from management when you did something wrong. Working as a night tech you get forgotten a good mount. Union likes sto stir the pot and cause issues. "
good,A typical day at work consisted of taking inbound call from AT&T customers who were possibly looking at leaving AT&T as this was a retention group.  I learned how to sell the company and add value for the customer to stay with the company.  Management far as at my level was ok. They really wanted the customer agent to succeed because the supervisor got bonuses based on what the agent did.  The workplace culture was one of change. The running joke was that AT&T stood for at this time.  The hardest part of the job was that my former department was a dumping ground for other departments to transfer a dificult call to if the agent did not want to deal with the call or the customer asked for a supervisor. The most enjoyable part of the job was the great people that I got to work with.  It was a fun environment to work in.
good,"great benefits, flexible schedule, customer service is the most enjoyable part of the job.  On and off the job training has been adequate and have been able to use this training on the job."
good,Overall great place to work. The hours were late they had great benefits. I worked with the public I received great benefits. The management could have been more professional. The environment was very diverse. The most enjoyable part of the job were the parties and pot lucks.
good,"The things that are the best about the job is the ever changing environment. Some days are longer than others, but the people make it worth while."
good,"Good pay,benefits, constant change to industry. Upper management is more concerned about what Hollywood thinks than employees. Customer service has really taken a hit the last few years."
good,"It's a call center, call center are hard! You are always sitting and only have small breaks. The sales they want you to make are hard to achieve. Especially when you have angry customers."
good,Good company but it's corporate USA. Well compensated but you feel just like a number among the ranks of all the employees. This company has stated they want to reduce the number of employees by 70% by 2020.
good,A typical day is what you did every day.  Answer calls and fix issues for the customer.  The hardest part of the job was when a customer  called in with an issue and instead of handling the problem first AT&T required you to sale a product to them. My co workers were great to work with.
good,"Worked for AT&T for roughly 8 months and it was a very up and down time. The pay and commission plan was good, so were the benefits and co-workers, but the sales practices and management styles got progressively worse. Every month you had to give management your commitments for the month and if you didn't hit those commitments exactly as they expected you were constantly taken to the back for discipline. It made for a very, very stressful work environment."
good,Poor polices for veterans not a safety net company must be married to spouse for benefits policies and management changed yearly with strict guidelines
good,"I answered customer phone calls, and resolved their issues on a daily basis. I also had to maintain stats on a weekly basis. The hardest part of  was working the long hours. Their was no work/ life balance."

good,"Good communication, friendly environment, interaction with other country clients helps us to improve knowledge and understand other country payroll structure also."
good,"Company was a door to door sales representatives but didn't last long. Took the best out of it and moved on. This Company wanted someone in town to own or rent a n office to keep working but the profit and sales didn't reward that yet. Not enough sales to provide an office, rent to expensive."
good,I loved working here. My manager was extremely sweet and my team (fellow coworkers) were awesome. We were always laughing and enjoying work. This would be a great place to work!
good,"long hours, stressful work, customer service, posititve attitude to rude customers, willingness to recommend to customers, crazy goals, youre always tired even o  off days"
good,AT&T its a great company with excellent growing opportunities. Benefits are excellent. They need to improve they work-life balance policy for retail employees.

good,inbound calls for billing services or technical services and/or sells services. I learned about different products and how they work and learned to be multi-task. This job allowed me to improve my customer service overall. The hardest part of job was to maintain high sales. The most enjoyable was to work as a team with other coworkers and helping people with all types of services.
good,"Typical day at work will be assisting AT&T customers with paying their bill/review bill, trouble shooting device, ordering new phones, changing rate plans, extending payment arrangments, transfering calls to correct department, etc."
good,"A typical day on the job was taking calls from customer who had their phones lost, stolen or damaged.  The thing I learned was how to deal with all types of customer.  The co-works were very easy to work with because we were a team.  The most enjoyable part of the job with when a customer was satisfied with the service they received."
good,"working for teleperformance as a secondary agent had an has a big impact on how i deal with cx everyday. just listening and having a proactive work ethic helped me through many days and always keeping a smile on my face even behind the scene cause your smile can show up and give your cx a comfortable transaction.. one of the hardest parts or the task at hand would be to sit next to someone who is disrespectful while your on a call, is a big no no.."
good,"handling inbound calls concerning billing, promotions and complaints form AT&T customers. learned to resolve issues in a high pace environment within a timely matter. co- workers were great to work with. the only con i can say about the call were the non-stop calls but on the other hand made the day move by swiftly. the most enjoyable part of the job was the many diverse people that  you come in contact with."

good,Productive java web application developer in telecom domain
good,"Great Benefits"
good,"A typical day at work would be answering inbound calls to sell services to former DirecTv customers. The direct management team is great, they are very helpful and are always willing to assist you with anything they can. The hardest part of the job is finding those customers that are willing to sign back up with DirecTv, we are usually talking to customers that are not actually calling to reconnect service, they are calling in to dispute billing issues and are usually upset and finding a way to turn that into a sale is the most difficult part but very rewarding when you do."

Management gave the correct tool and info to do my job. Co workers  was there to team up with me to find and fix leaks in cable or remove a defective case. The hardest part of job is trying to find leaks in cable. what I enjoy about the job is working with little supervision
good,A typical work day at AT&T was 9 hours.  I learned the foundation of the communication industry and was able to see technology increase from just a dial tone to all that is now offered within communications. The first line management team was there to help make the daily environment pleasant. The co-workers became an extension of my family.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the acknowledgement that we were the company.
good,The call volume is typically very high & demanding. The customer can be a little rude sometimes. The co-workers however rally around each other to boost each other up & help support one another. The management is also caring & considerate.

good,empesabamos atrabajar a las 8 am instalando equipos y antenas hasta las7 de la tarde.
good,Start off with a morning meeting with your crew manager and fellow crew members discussing safety reports from incidents across the country from work hazard and going over the work load for the day. Going from customer to customer either installing services and product or repair issues. Management is typical of any other workplace some managers are impossible to work for and others like mine are easy to work for and willing to help you improve and advance your career. Fellow co-workers are diverse recent high school grads to people closing in on retirement offer a wealth of personal and professional knowledge and a willingness to help each other out. The hardest part of the job is negotiating difficult crawl spaces and attics and dealing with the occasion rude or difficult customer. The best part of the job is not having a manager hovering over your shoulder throughout the work day.
good,Worked with engineering team to met customers communication needs.
good,"I saw many good people walked out the door because the missed to many days of work because of legitament personal or family problems. Instead of posting the names of top performers on a ""Wall of Honor"", the posted low performers names on a ""Wall of shame""."
good,Its customer service the benefits are great and the managment is great to work with also. My time spent there was valuable i learned alot about true customer service.
good,"I felt that work/life balance was very good. Management truly cared about the employees. There was also room for advancement in the company to move up. I have a dual B/S degree in MGT/MKT, there was room for me to move up in the company. I didn't feel stuck in my position. I loved coming to work."
good,worked in the converter warehouse for 12 years. Everyday warehouse work. Co-workers were great.
good,"Show up a little early to turn on lights/products, do cash-ins, make deposits, do phone count, and make calls to clients. Learn and study products offered by the company in order to close on a sale. If you are on an experienced team that is hungry for money, then relationships can seem somewhat untrustworthy being that it is a dog eat dog job. The hardest part of the job is waiting on the monthly commission paycheck. The most enjoyable part is that it is easy money and it is a secured industry for the most part."
good,"Enjoyed working there, the hours was somewhat flexible and I had maybe every other weekend off. Great training on different wireless products."
good,It was a learning experience every day. New things to learn with the way technology was changing.We were a team organization. Every one got along with one another. The hardest part of the job was when someone didn't want to do their part of the work that was required. The atmosphere was what I liked.
good,I learned a lot about being a manager and owning my own business from my Supervisor who owned the company.
good,I appreciated the job in the economy. But job security was not a part of this job. There were always things changing that hurt your progress to move forward in the company.
good,A typical day at work I would report to the office get new leads then proceed into the field. I've learned quality customer service tactics and sale closing techniques. My co workers were very helpful wanting to ensure overall success for the entire team. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually seeing contributions being made to the teams success.
good,"We were initially taught to be on time and come to work everyday. By following this principle, you valued your job. Even if you were given new tasks that deemed impossible, by showing up to work it was 1/2 the battle."
good,This was a inbound call center even though the pay was great here in Mississippi so most people will put up with the lack of corporate leadership when it comes to Customer Service for ATT
good,I enjoyed DirecTV and their was never a dull moment speaking with customers.
good,Not a bad company to work for just get worried about possible lay offs or them just letting you go one day  other that that it’s a pretty good place to work
good,"todo bien, solo que te cambiaban las comisiones por eso decidi salirme"
good,"Very stressful and not flexible with hours good benefits-sales are a must"
good,The training was really long. I noticed some people had forgot things by the time we got on the phones. If they split the training up as half classroom time and the other half on the phones it would be perfect.
good,"Work activities were generally the same each day except when special activities were to occur or there was a need to address some work issue."
good,Buena empresa para laborar y cumplir cada uno de tus propósitos.
good,"Great company I thought I would retire from however with jobs going over seas and Mexico for cheaper wages, offices being closed and/or downsizing...I knew I wouldn’t make my 30 year mark. Great career to raise my children and run my household. Too bad corporate greed took over and customer focus isn’t number 1 anymore."
good,Each day at work offered me with a new challenge while allowing me to creatively find solutions to help provide every customer with the best service possible.
good,Management was amazing. The overall work environment was pretty stressful and had a lot of overtime. Flexible hours were a double edged sword. Some days you get home at 3 other days its 10 or 11 at night.
good,the manager is good. job is good. learned how to negate negative customer emotions and turn them around. the hardest part is selling dtv. most enjoyable is the commission
good,"In the beginning the job had plenty of benefits and perks, but as the company growled and acquired other companies the dynamics of the job changed drastically."
good,"my typical day at work was providing an outstanding customer service, meeting my daily goals. "
good,"They are currently downsizing and outsourcing which affects American families. Which is going to affect my family. so for that reason . where I thought I had job security, these changes make me feel lest comfortable to make this a recommendation for anybody."
good,"It's all retention now. You're required to push for cell phone sales with people who were calling to cancel. Not enough training on the cell phones at all. I was let go, accused of not disconnecting the account, when we work with a system that's 15ish years old. I was given no proof that I didnt disconnect. And it could have easily not gone through. The account system they use is the same one I used at Sitel when I worked there in 2005, so it could have easily been a system issue. Regardless, I was given no way to contest the decision."
good,Nice place to work company kept getting brought so name changed several times in 10 yrs..management was smart promoting dedicated employees instead of hiring outside
good,"The job at a call center is very different from my other customer service job.  The management was great, fast paced, but make sure you hit your numbers."
good,"The most stressful part of working for this company is the fact that you have to troubleshoot minor tech issues, and if the customer is unwilling or unable, it goes against you in a negative way on your metrics."
good,"aprendi a resolver problemas, trabajar bajo presion y trabajar bajo metas"
good,"Answered an average of 45 calls per day addressing customer inquiries, solving problems and providing new product information. Investigated and resolved customer inquiries and complaints in a timely and empathetic manner. Assisted customers with payments and bill inquires. Assisted customers when ordering AT&T products and services. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly competition between teams. The hardest part of the job is maintaining your composure and being polite when a customer is being extremely rude."
good,"You are a number everything is based upon stats. They don't care about personal or family problems. Be at work, or be in trouble. Strict script policy-like a trained robot,"
good,Hardest part of the job is it is a giant corporation that doesn't know or care about employee jobs.  Pays well and allows you to provide for your family.
good,"Management only cares if you're making money, which is expected for a big company. The compensation is great but if you're not making sales you are constantly under pressure. It's a very stressful job."
good,It was ok as far as call centers go. The training was thorough. The benefits were awesome. They compensated for flex scheduling and offered a variety of schedules to choose from. The teams were set up nicely with easy QA goals to meet per shift.
good,Directv was a great place to work. But a family matter came up. Forced me to move. They really take care of there employees. The benefits ate awesome.
good,"Hurry up go go go."
good,"not a fan of dying from the heat/cold. customers houses are generally a nightmare to work around and dont have any semblance of uniformity, but what can you expect on that front. job is not for people that are allergic to 17 types of grass."
good,Lots of fun working everyday. Always something new to look forward to. Great atmosphere to meet a lot of friendly guests and also costumers. It was a really nice place to toy with the new phones that become released frequently.
good,"It was okay, handle customers with electronics in a solution basses. Customer service with capped commission at that time, probably changed by now I believe."
good,It is stressful. It takes a thick skin and the ability to multitask and adapt. You could work in 2 to 14 different systems at one time. You could have a customer personally attacking you for their bill or technical issue. The calls are often back to back with no time allotted for after call work. You must note the accounts while you are on the call.
good,"cafe da manha reforçado feito pela esposa chegando muito alegre sempre agradecendo mais um dia de vida e trabalho,iniciei aqui o trabalho em telecomunicação aprendi o perfeito alinhamento com o satélite,Direção e Gerencia ótima de  trabalhar,cultura familiar.na época era ficar nos matos e pedras  em Jacarepaguá para colocar as antenas, a gentileza dos patroes mãe e filhos."
good,I worked for AT&T for 17 years and my last job title was eliminated. I was offered an upgrade position that was a pass/fail title. I did not pass the last test in training and was forced off payroll. No one from management even thanked me for my service they simply took my wrk ID and walked me out the door.
good,"Great place to work, very fast paced, and competitive environment . Good benefits, Union backed for non management positions, and aways room for advancement."
good,Customer service quickly turned sales. Good job that does help people if you have the drive and motivation to sell and make extra money. Sales is an absolute requirement on all calls no matter the nature of the call coming in
good,"Company is good if you like to work and have good people skills, self management skills, and technical skills. If you’re a good tech management will still go visit but mainly for safety."
good,"Utilized operational systems to process purchases of AT&T products and services"
good,"Good pay, bad hours, if you don't sale you don't have a job overall good company to work for, easy advancement with or without a degree!! If you have small kids I wouldn't recommend"
good,"They tend to lay off at least every two years, and fire the people that have been loyal for decades, and keep the new managers that make less. When they buy another company, they keep their employees."
good,"Every day is different.  I meet different people every day and go to various places to do installs and repairs.  Some days are challenging and others are easier although it does require physical activity whether easy or not.  As a technician, I sometimes find myself in attics, crawl spaces, 24 feet in the air on poles, and mid spans.  The job is not for the faint at heart.  Sometimes I have to cut limbs in order to get to terminals on poles or spans that have not been maintained by the city nor AT&T."
good,I like the work I perform and am pleased with the relationship with management and my fellow employees. The problem lies in the job security. The company is actively trying to reduce the workforce and is laying off technicians statewide.
good,I have no review at the moment. I would like to do that next time. Thank you
good,"I was a csr for Direcrtv , I also handle ATT call I was often tasked with reviewing customers bills and explaining to them what ever their dispute may have been."
good,AT first working there was enjoyable. Then it changed & it went from customer service first to hurry up and get the customer to Uverse. So I went from call after call of customer service & technical support to sales pressures.
good,Allow you to be your own boss and make money for the company and or suspend client phone service and or take payment or make payment arrangement. Up sale client better service.
good,The Telecommunication's Industry keeps on changing .It's was great to test all types of phone & data equipment.Working at a call center I dealt with a lot of customer complaint's .
good,We were in a constant state of learning and testing in our jobs to improve our abilities. Although this was an enjoyable part of the job it was also what made it difficult.  Management was always there to help and guide us.
good,"in the 12 years that I worked for core, I was promoted into operations which I did for 9 years, and absolutely loved doing.  My job was to make sure the daily operations of 12 call centers went smoothly."
good,"A typical day at work was to answer customers questions regarding their programming or modify installation orders for the technicians while on the job site."
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for with great benefits, and they provide extensive training, however the training doesn't completely prepare you for what you will experience on the floor. The call center floor is a fun, energetic, and competitive work environment, although it can occasionally be a stressful environment as well. The management staff is always there and willing to help you, but there is always more staff than management, which can cause issues sometimes. There is always something fun going on whether it be a potluck, or team competition with the entire call center, celebrations when you make a sale. Though when sales are low managers become stressed, which trickles down to the reps and can make the environment stressful for all."
good,"This was a great career. I wish I could have stayed but the benefits center messed up on my paperwork for insurance causing me to be charged 80% of my salary for health insurance for an entire year so I was forced to move on to another job. I was unable to pay my bills and the benefits center was no help in fixing the issue they caused. I really don't like to point blame but it really impacted my life. Other than that everything else about my time at AT&T was awesome, great training, great manager, just overall I would even go back without benefits if I didn't have a job."
good,"Overall AT&T was a good place to work at.  Communication, mentoring, classes, and culture were all good.  The one thing that I believe needed improving work allocation."
good,"Working here brought about fun times, incentives, memories and life lessons .Working help mold my communication skills and ability to work with others, which inevitably influences my nursing career greatly . The work environment was impeccable and allowed people to have fun on the job and work at the same time. It is enjoyable and one of the best jobs I've ever had."
good,It's good pay and benefits but the job itself is not easy. The goals are a little unrealistic and you are basically competing with the same company as in all att store locations and customer service reps on the phone.
good,"Unorganized management. Manager made schedules at last minute, did not provide proper training and had to learn the system on my own. I loved my job and what I did, just not the company"
good,"Good job active in the company, you get to know many people and see how the company works, but most jobs are becoming contracts so jobs become less and less"
good,Great family atmosphere in the workplace. The company benefits are also very good. The employee training is also extensive.
good,A typical day involved logging in to the phone and computer systems and taking customer calls. Mainly to adjust and assist with their cell phone bills. At the time the establishment also sold uVerse. I feel like they cared more about getting someone to agree to the sale than customer satisfaction sometimes.
good,"AT&T was one of my first professional like jobs, I loved the environment of other coworkers, but did not like the favoritism the management team showed towards their employees."
good,"During my time with AT&T, I learned the basics of strategic sales, cross-selling, upselling and federal regulations in the wireless industry. I was introduced to wireless technology and gained experience needed to expand my career. Management was very involved in daily operations and was helpful to those struggling to meet expectations. The hardest part of my job was the language barrier with much of our technical team, while the most enjoyable part was working with customers to help them understand and maximize the benefits of our services."
good,"I enjoyed working for this employer.  I met many people while working with the company.  I continue to reach out to many of those I worked with in the past.  These people have become lasting friends.  During my time in this position, it was sometimes hard to get people to pay their bill after it was referred to collections.  They felt that since their telephone was cut off, they didn't have any reason to [pay their bill.  It was after their account was sent to an outside collection agency that they realized that it would have been easier to pay the bill. My most enjoyable part of the job was trying to convince the customer why it would be an advantage to pay the bill and allow them to restore their telephone service."
good,"At one time it was the best job I ever had.  But after a couple of mergers, the quality and support level dropped off noticeable."
good,"The customers were not the easiest to deal with, but that did not take away from the relaxed and sociable environment (loud at times but feels like a typical run-of-the-mill call center."
good,"Great pay and benefits, lots of visual learning of new products and services. Typical call center job. Provides games while on break and quiet rooms."
good,hardest part of this job was the angry customers that would call in on a daily basis and to receive those calls back to back on some days.
good,"good place to work, good people, Just a lack of direction in what they want to accomplish as on organization. Would have liked to stay on."
good,"Good training facilities, good safety policies, good customer service."
good,"Good company, worked for them for a long time.  The biggest problem is the way they re-org so frequently.  Anytime one has three different bosses in one year, like I did, this can be a source of stress."
good,Talking to customers all day for 8 hours or more a day. Great Customer Service is almost important. Management is ok. My co-workers are team players. The hardest part of my job dealing with an angry customer. The most enjoyable part of my job making a customer happy.
good,"Skills acquired: Excellent communication skills, Problem solving, Excellent listening skills, Time management and computer skills, Being patient."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work, with the exception of Job security.  There's lot of motivation, great future expectations. But unfortunately as soon as there's ways to cut expense, they won't hesitate to outsource the position and it won't matter if employees has provided years of dedication and excellent productivity services. Highly recommend working for AT&T, but beware about the surplus risk yearly."
good,I have been employed with AT&T for 14 years and in the past 2 years i have seen more job cuts than ever. You would think that they would move employees around instead of having employees compete for positions that they have lost.
good,Getting to know the Technicians. Understanding the different positions. I enjoyed the supervisors & how helpful they are.
good,working at dtv it was always busy bt a fun place to work. co workers made it a lot easier to cope with. working in my department ( retention) came with it's stress learned great customer service dealing with upset customers
good,The work is great and the people are outstanding.  The only drawback is the wages are below market value.  Benefits are great.
good,"Great work environment , timely updates while covering work assignment ."
good,"there were always contest and i believe the company had the employees interest at heart but not to extent of capitalizing on the bottom line. Big business mentality , employees concerns are over looked and no one addresses the issues until after the problem has effected the bottom line"
good,very exciting work environment. However I am not pleased with compensation structure always changing.
good,No 2 days are ever the same.  Job is quite challenging. Co-workers help you and train you when requested.
good,"I really have no complaints. They treated me well. It is a very hard job being an inbound call center rep.Sounds easy to just say I answered calls all day and did my best to help a customer be happy,but it's a lot more challenging than that. I usually can make a great rapport with a customer pretty quickly. Some just don't want to be talked nicely too. I took a lot of unnecessary lashings from disgruntled customers. Just had to kill em with kindness as they say. It was not an easy job by any means but I was there for 6 and a half years doing all sorts of different types of inbound calls. I loved my co-workers and most management was amazing. some didnt know what the right or left hand was doing but overall I enjoyed everyone i met"
good,low morale at this place its almost depressing. the company is great overall but the call centers are really tough to survice in
good,"educating customers on equipment and plan purchases, i learned alot of patience. I loved my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was the hostile customers, they would come in irrate over their bill. The best part was meeting new people everyday"
good,el tiempo se maneja como uno lo desee aprendí a que se debe ser responsable por si mismo sin que nadie te este exigiendo ya que era necesario llegar a una meta pactada
good,"high volume calls , fast paced call center, multi task , nothing hard about this job, enjoyed resolving customers issues"
good,Great place to work and they offered tuition reimbursement for employees.  I was able to start my Master MBA program while working here.
good,"I've been with the company for quite awhile, but there is currently a lot of change happening.  Some for the good, some for the bad.  "
good,"I liked the work at AT&T. Typing, talking to customers and being able to give the customer what they wanted is a satisfactory feeling."
good,On any given day we could get atleast 70 calls...which could be stressful but the staff was great at making light of the situation and distracting you from how stressful it was.
good,no consistancy with company policy so made it very frustrating for those of us trying to follow that policy with customers. They knew they could call in and finally get some one who woukld break the rules fro them
good,the company is excellent for young new hires from college between ages 23-35
good,would enjoy working there if they worked with you on your family issues better.
good,During my time working with a private collector for DIRECTV. I learned how to multi-task. As well as my management skills. It was not unknown to pick up on the left over slack. No matter whose taks it actually was.Team work is the best work.
good,I learned to deal with very pleasant & very irate customers in a timel
good,a typical day was making inbound calls entering data based on esponse from customer. my coworkers were great
good,This company has great benefits. But was not able to give customer service. Only had time to take payments and if customer had question about account I had to transfer to different dept.
good,"Secure company, family oriented, good vacation time. Opportunity to advance tremendous."
good,"I was proud to work for a Fortune 500 company, they prided themselves with integrity, customer first and valued thier employees, Have great benefits, hours and room for advancement or internal job transfer-relocation to personal interest.Had plenty of job availabilty and position all throughout the state. All that changed 5 years ago and spiraled down since, poor investment decisions that now affect our jobs ending in california to makeup for the loss."
good,Great company and great corporate structure. This company was excellent at meeting the needs of its employees as well as mentoring and growing its every employees potential.
good,Es una empresa comprometida con todas las áreas de trabajo y te permite crecer o desarrollo dentro del mismo con diferentes tipos de puesto.
good,Typical day includes logging in to my phone. Calls are nonstop. You take calls from irate callers for the duration of your shift. There are two 15 minute breaks and a 45-60 minute lunch. Shift is typically 8 hrs or more if mandatory overtime is required.
good,Art was a great place to work I always was taken care of by my upper management team and am extremely grateful for them. The work life balance isn’t that great but if your young and need a job you won’t find a better one
good,Just be confident know what it is that you want and do it. Always be on time be ready to work and always be considered of others feelings be empathetic
good,"Great place to work, I would recommend applying. Good benefits 401k, health care and paid vacations. You also get to enjoy all the seasons working outside."
good,"I had a great 3 years at AT&T. the benefits were great, work life balance and overtime were great. ONLY thing I dislike about AT&T is that it is a large company that makes bad business decisions. I was let go after 3 years because they needed to but losses after losing a ton of money on their TIme Warner and Directv purchases."
good,Great pay and benefits. Opportunity for advancement. Loved working there until the upper management switched and things became all about making sales and hey focused less on the customer service part
good,AT&T has great benefits and being part of the union was great. If you’re comfortable with running wire through someone else’s house this job is for you.  Most customers are very nice. Sometimes you go into very dirty homes. Also you’re by yourself all day. No help if you need it.
good,not interested in reviewing prev employer job was very fun to learn but company is conglomerate that doesn't put its employees or customers ahead of its own needs
good,the work is great easy job to do but the management is where the bs starts.  a lot of im he boss listen to me that happens but its basically asserting yourself from the start. also dont get hurt they dont offer disability
good,Excellent place for work-life balance.One of the best place to sharpen your techniocal skill. Management is super friendly and they give us pleny time to refine our work.
good,Customer experience and employees satisfaction severely degraded due to poor interdepartmental communication. There needs to be more alignment among various departments within the organization.
good,"At&t has a lot of perks, they offer a lot of knowledge and opportunities but I personally feel like it’s very cut throat and mostly sales driven. I hate that they allow customers to treat you terribly just to get the sale. I don’t think the company cares enough about its associates only it’s sales."
good,It was fun while it lasted. Majority of my peers and upper management were great. Towards the end new employees wanted to be treated as tenured employee which I'm against. I'm sure this still makes it difficult for many employees to stay within the company. Fix this and I'm sure your turnover will drop drastically. Everyone isn't equal when tenured employees are given less respect.
good,att is a company that sell internet phone and cable tv they just got dtv and now time warner they really f'd in it up right now i dont know what else to say
good,"It is a community essential service and therefore mandatory overtime is a factor sometimes, but there is also plenty of voluntary overtime."
good,"I liked it the compensation is excellent. Along with rhe continued training and honing of your skills. However, the store i worked at was very cutthroat and caused troubke for ambitious employee's"
good,greeting customers and seeing how they are and what was needed if not made calls to businesses and passing flyers out to companies . had some slow days which we went to apartments and neighborhoods and gave quotes and flyers
good,"Fantastic work environment and benefits as well as a competitive compensation plan. Very poor attendance policy. No stipulations for serious illness or family emergency unless you have been with the company for a year and qualify for FMLA, or have been with the company for 6 months and are out for more than 7 days consecutively for it to fall under temporary disability."
good,"I enjoyed working in the Business call center.  the pay was very good.  Working as a Territory manager was very competitive as well.  I did a lot of traveling, and received advanced sales, and it training working for AT&T."
good,"Top provider of multi-platform multi-media."
good,"Fun workplace , great atmosphere , enjoyed working there, but I do dislike the point system. Management helped with difficulty using the tablets. Great fun place"
good,AT&T is a great place to work but it would be nice if management was fair with everyone. I enjoyed my short time there although I did not have a life with the schedule I worked.
good,Enjoyed working here.. had many roles and people were awesome. Awesome pay and benefits dtsryed out great. As economy change so did Att. Great discounts for employees
good,I enjoyed the job itself the pay was not enough for the work i was doing. I installed DirecTV systems and was only paid 10.65/hr while everyone else was paid more. It wasn’t enough to live on but since i enjoyed the work so much i stayed longer that i should have. If you would like to work there be sure to negotiate your pay before you accept the job offer. It will save you trouble from the jump
good,"Incoming call center for cell phone service. Taking care of customer issues , complaints and requests , but also required to sell other services even though this is not why customer calls in - DTV, Home internet, U-verse Cable service and add a line , required to always be selling"
good,"I worked at AT&T for the majority of 2016 as a contract project manager. While I enjoyed working there, it felt like a lot of decisions were made that weren't based on data, nor were they well thought out. This includes hiring decisions and implementation of projects or campaigns. "
good,It is a tough environment but if you are motivated willing to learn new ideas and have a love for customer service this job is for you. You will be working most weekends to start out but the pay is considerable especially when you stay with the company for a long period of time. At the end of the day its just business but if you are goal oriented you have a shot at doing something great
good,They will never fire you for under performance and will build you up to be successful. It is on you how much money you want to make. The manager that I worked for was absolutely amazing and cared for you as a person and you could tell he would go amazing far and it gave you hope for how far you could go.
good,"Good working environment. They would work with you and school schedules, family situations or any emergency. I would definitely recommend the job and work there again if i could."
good,I was able to learn a lot about the corporate work style but the team I was on didn't have much for me  to do. The job culture wasn't great we did move a new office to try and build a team collab environment. But most of the staff is too set in there ways.
good,Over the last 16 years I really enjoyed working for AT&T.  I have learned a lot of things with the company. The management team was very helpful and understanding
good,"Software Quality Testing of Web Client/Server and Web Services applications using Manual and Automation Test Tools to develop Test Plan, Test strategy comprising for Automate Test Scenarios, Test Scripts, Testing Methodology and Test Reports. To build my carrier in the sector of Quality Assurance"
good,They lie about bonus and never pay them. They also steal commissions from the sales reps!! Any company that lies and steals doesn't deserve to be respected.
good,Loved working in different places of the metroplex while meeting great people on a day to day basis. I was able to change platforms to gain more knowledge. I loved the challenges that i had to over come. My teammates were very supportive an knowledgeable of processes needed to complete work order from day to day. I really enjoyed all my customers.
good,"La empresa era en ciertos días buenos, y había otros  incomodos, ya que había supervisores los cuales debías tu pedirle que hicieran su trabajo para poder darle solución al cliente.Aprendí a tener mejor trato con clientes y lidiar con cualquiern tipo de persona, aprendí a usar mi paciencia. La dirección o generencia era mala, debido a que la persona encargada no es la más apta para el puesto. Era una persona que no se preocupaba por sus asesores, sino se preocupaba más por numeros. La parte más dificil del trabajo fue la ayuda por parte de los supervisores, ya que tenías que estar tras ellos para que hicieran su trabajo."
good,"Making a base pay plus commission is great money, but you have to make sure that you meet your numbers not only for yourself, but the store as well otherwise your commission checks are not very big."
good,the amount of jobs is not there no paychecks wont make the bills at the end of the day great coworkers they will help you out if you need anything management did what they could to help you out so nothing bad to day getting to meet so many people is pretty nice tho
good,i loved being able to work from home. The hours were good and the pay was decent. Being able to help customers that were upset and turning their attitude around about the company i feel was one of the best parts of the job.
good,Lo que aprendí de directv son las actividades que se realizan en una empresa como todos los miembros trabajan por las metas propuesta por la empresa
good,"AT&T Corporation offers ongoing training.  There are many different shifts available.  The work atmosphere tended to be stressful in our sales environment.  The management tried to lighten the atmosphere with contests and competitions.  "
good,"Answering calls about phone bills, troubles with phones and new activation's on phones and so much more. Co workers were amazing, as my team leader. Most enjoyable part was helping people."
good,"sin duda que tras 14 años de experiencia laborales con DIRECTV, representa una gran escuela  para mí."
good,Working in retail for AT&T is a great opportunity to start your carrier. For me personally it is very hard to keep the balance of work/life with the retail schedule I get...
good,as a sales representative I would assist customers with their wireless needs and help manage their accounts to best fit their needs.. great environment to help your sales and customer service skills.. worked with a team that taught me a lot. best part for me was getting to play with different devices and informing customers on the different features of each.
good,"Working with AT&T land line department was so much fun. Great people to work with, great benefits, great pay, and the (my) bosses were great. Learned much about electrical, safety, and how the land line system throughout an area in made up. You'll never look at cables on telephone poles the same after working for a telecommunications company."
good,"Do your job, follow coaching instructions, learn your product, maintain knowledge of trends with wireless, iphones, etc and you will make money and have a great time with a customer base and referrals for life."
good,"•	Recommend products to customers, based on customers' needs and interests."
good,AT&T is a good solid company and lots of room to grow. The most enjoyable part about working for this company is the employee growth you in your team.
good,"Worked at this company as a temporary assignment, while awaiting another field assignment. Company was very fair, paid well and had good benefits."
good,Great benefits and pay.  Work life very unbalanced due to monthly scheduling changes.  Would like to see a better process for scheduling to make it more consistent.  Makes it difficult to further education if you are unsure what your schedule will be each month.
good,trabajo de lunes a lunes de 9hs a 23hs sin franco por eso quiero cambiar de trabajo

good,"this Job is very stressful.they are all about them selves, they hate to give raises, alot of of people shouldn't be a teamleader."
good,"AT&T is a really fun fast paced environment. I was a part of the Retail Leadership Development program and loved every minute of it. You will work a lot of hours and your work/life balance will be off. If work/life balance is important, this is not the job for you. Overall, great company to be a part of."
good,"This is a fast and hard pace work,very demanding both from customer and from managers. Took at least 100 calls a day, had to switch from residential customers to business customers, different computer screens,different plans,cost, with each call. Loved it!"
good,Work was always fun at the elk city location but that was because of our managers and the coworkers. The higher ups suck and will throw you under the bus to save themselves.
good,"no había mucho movimiento en al punto de venta donde me encontaba y pues nos era muy difícil cubrir las cuotas, no habia mucho que hacer tramites del mismo plan y verificacion de IFE O INE."

good,"very busy, very hard to take a lunch"
good,this job could very between long and short hours depending on your disbatch. this job can make you a lot of money if u have a real hustle type mentality
good,Good place to work. Always very competitive with salary and benefits. Management was a little difficult to deal with due to all the different levels of upper management.
good,"Great company to work for, they make sure to look after the share holders interest. the company also make sure to make sure all customer service is met"
good,The culture of most AT&T retail stores is built on teamwork. Great place to work that offers great benefits.  Fast paced environment with monthly sales goals.  Excellent pay!
good,Face paced phone customer care. I think they worked very hard to show their employees were appreciated and to have fun. The pay was very good. The benefits were ok.
good,"I enjoy working with the public and answering phone calls, Helping people with there problems. I enjoyed the people that I worked with, we always had a good time and enjoyed working with each other."
good,i am looking to move closer to my parents per getting older with moms parents being older and have numerous life threatening illnesses i would like to be closer to them all.
good,"Management provided an excellent atmosphere. They provided incentives for employer, for example, team work, incentives, lunches and dinner out, games and activities."
good,Provide customers with great service. Focusing on one call resolution!
good,"prepare food"
good,Couldn't immediately adapt from collections over to customer service missed commission checks so moved to Arizona after giving 2 weeks notice
good,I answered inbound calls from customers concerning thheir bill statements or maybe experiencing phone technical issues I would help resolve the issues. Also there were really friendly co workers who made my day even more brighter.
good,"My hours varied a great deal in this company. Some Saturdays and mandatory overtime. Transititon from customer needs, bill breakdowns etc to sales per company needs.  "
good,"un dia en libertad era exelente ya que era una constante emocion hacer lo que me gusta prensa, el periodismo, saber q siente la gente."
good,Call Center with great hours. Sundays off! The management is not the best. They really don't care about their employees.
good,"It is an okay place t work for, just not my type of jib I want to do."
good,"Short meeting with management first thing,then out the gate.Dispatched on residential and business orders and troubles,usually not knowing what's next.That can be part of the fun.Worked with a great crew,you could count on help if needed."
good,"I was. Not judged fairly after I worked them for three years especially I was knowledgeable of their systems,I think I show personslity also customer service and support in helping customer to have a device to rnchance third dveryday lifestyle"
good,I liked the people I worked with and it was nice helping people. I would be the first person to talk to customers about there internet and tv issues. I like the challenge of fixing the issue first
good,"good company to work for at the time.  company has changed alot since I left, but learned alot about selling and working with business accounts while I was there"
good,"No Call Center job is easy. Definitely not for stressful people. Building provides employee parking, healthcare benefits are good. Incentives are really good if you're able to meet or exceed your monthly call goals. Employee Discount is very welcomed."
good,"un dia laboral implicaba mucha disciplina y esfuerzo para lograr los objetivos requeridos. consegui aprender estrategias de venta y cierre de ventas, de tareas administrativas"
good,Coworkers are great to work with as is management. Extremely flexible with scheduling as well. Need to be mentally strong to be able to handle working here.
good,"I learned how to input customer information and notate account basically multitasking . I posted payments to accounts by check, cc. I trouble shoot equipment if necessary. I enjoyed helping customers and calming angry customer's if necessary. My co-workers were always willing to help."
good,This was a great company to work for. This was a great experience.
good,Continuous Training on updated Computer Applications and enjoyed working with many team players helping to resolve customer issues
good,"I love working for this company, I just wish it was more pay and better benefits."
good,It was a overall busy but stressful job. Great benefits and perks.
good,At Southwestern Bell I learned a great deal of information about the customer service industry. It was fast paced but it was fun.
good,Lots of data entry lots of training learning of the bills and precise answers to any question of the bill having to read the bill fix any problems the customer may have our finding out if any mistakes were made on the bills never leaving a customer unhappy or not understanding any concerns with there bill adjusting bills andbeaable to malty taco
good,At&t was a excellent job. I learned how to read a bill and explain charges. I also learned how to handle a angry customer and how to calm the customer.
good,There are great benefits working at ATT. My biggest complaint has to be the fact that they push for sale without taking the customer into consideration.
good,I really enjoyed the job because I was able to help people with not just cell phones but giving them an affordable plan and saving people money to make them happy.
good,my work day start off with exercising it was a requirement. Then we go get our RF gun and get to work and I always pick the busy lines to work for one it passed the time and also it was a competition thing going on to and my co-workers was the best we look after each other.
good,I loved all my employees. Everyone one made this job fun and happy to be there. I would go back.
good,"great 1ST time job just no job security, no chances for advancement"
good,there was a lot of Chaos and very unorganized people and company
good,"This company is a very good company to work for in regards of the challenges it presents to you on a daily basis. It also provides very good benefits. However in this ever changing business, ie mergers, partnering etc, comes a lot of combined departments, which leads to force reductions. These reductions do not come to anyone's fault, but it secures the financial ability of the company to continue to grow. So, the reductions sometimes affects the worker more than business."
good,"Got closer to each of my agents. Helped them improve which was not only beneficial to them but to the company as well. Learned to pin point the weakness and gains. Was not only their Quality coach, but also their friend and co-worker. The hardest part was having to give low scores, but What I enjoyed the most was how the agents would apply what we discussed in our coaching's and watching them go above and beyond to get that first call resolution."
good,Delivery AT&T to houses and apartments within the New Smyrna Beach Area
good,"just fairly completed the training.There was a seriously scheduled training conducted and after which,the exam was done online.Very limited time offered."
good,This job was probably my favorite. Until i had gotten sick 2 days and was let go because of so. Even though I was preforming at the level of all the others who joined when I did.
good,"Not sure if they'll every hire anyone there because theres been an hiring freeze for almost three years now they constantly hire overseas reps that are poorly train most of your day your training those rep n how o do certain things while you still have a customer on hold, which causes you stats to be higher that leads to less of a bonus, other than that the ppl I work with was great it was hard to see ppl get let go everyday another department was making cuts"
good,I was a short-termed employee. Contractor basis only - no long perm positions available. The company moved into IBM building and had no given length on how long they would keep their contracted employees. Didn't give us much of a chance or faith in job promises.
good,its a good starting job. not good if you go to school. some of the managers are ok. they want a completely flexible person. not ok if you go to school
good,I really wanted to like this job.  I love electronics and everything about them.  I gave this job 100% and i feel they took advantage of what i was trying to offer.  Under the circumstances i had to go back to what would pay more.
good,"Pay is great, if you can sell things to customers that they don't need or want. A typical day starts with a sales huddle, where you're told that you aren't selling enough of the right product."
good,"Management is brutal and quick to reprimand. co-workers are ok, but everyone is on the edge of their seat there. Hardest part is having to leave because of pay cuts. Best part is making sales and getting the checks."
good,"In the old days, people would buy DirecTV right off the bat, but because there's other companies that come in and low ball, you end up giving equipment away for free."
good,"At&t has potential ! it pays well or fairly well. The problem is it has a very old good ol boys uneducated climbed up the ladder managers, which makes things very complicated . I worked in the South , no love just fake grins .The old telephone mentality runs deep, it's the 21st and that mindset must be adopted. Otherwise the company is only surviving through rendering tele serv. to govern't."
good,"Es una empresa joven en México, necesita mayor infraestructura para poder competir con las demas companias en nuestro país."
good,Good pay poor management you never know when your manager will be cycled for another. Do yourself a favor don’t take the employee discounts biggest mistake you will ever make
good,"Forced to work 50-60 hours a week due to lack of staffing. Just receive a pat on the back and an ""atta boy"" Location was ""credit challenged"" so you basically had about a 10% approval rate. When you only see 12-15 ""guests"" a week, your odds of successful selling in not great. My area is also very high in fraud so anyone that wanted a higher end (1000 dollar plus) device, we would order them in even if we had them in stock."
good,This company doesn’t make you feel like a human.  They believe anyone can be replaced even if it means training three people to replace the one they are losing.
good,"I typically got a lot of negative feedback from my customers about this company. Not true 100% of the time, but I did notice a general lack of respect from this company for its existing customers."
good,AT&T was a good job because it paid well and had great benefits. The expectation for employees was not attainable.  I do miss working there but I do not miss the stress it caused.
good,They don't let you know that this is a sales position until after the 1st day of training. I did not agree with their selling techniques.
good,"I was contracted at At&t, it was a great way to learn new things, but that's about it the culture is not inviting to contractors. It's about what you know and the management is extremely manipulative. The managers will seem cool at first but will use you and your ideas and you have a very slim chance of getting in before an ex at&t person or before someone else. Work life balance does not exists, I worked every holiday, birthday, night, weekend."
good,"Top level Management is bad, Hardest part of job is no job security at all."
good,"There was no communication between store managers and upper management. Goals were set and expected to be met, regardless of conditions in the local area. Rushed through training and expected to perform and meet goals as soon as store was opened."
good,Typical day includes installing and training customers how to properly use equipment. I learned a lot about how cable television works and how to install satellites. Management is a family oriented group. Co-workers are very supporting and always lend a helping hand if needed. The hardest part of the job is learning things that wasn't taught. The most enjoyable part about the job was interacting with the customers.
good,"My typical day at work is going door to door trying to sale U-Verse cable."
good,Very slow at this location. The management style was like a dictatorship. The hardest part of the job is working with 8-10 different goals to hit all in one month. The commission shifted a lot. We never knew exactly what we we were getting paid for.
good,worked there for a while n every time our commision was due they would find some reason not to give it to us.
good,"was a great place to work,but the new managment knows nothing about customer service"
good,Installed Uverse six days a week over thirteen hours a day. Poor training and conditions to work in.
good,No social life. No bounds between employees. Employees are isolated and everything goes over the phone. Lack of training and a better support for contractors. Layoffs without any warning.
good,"Actualización de base de datos día a día, realizando llamadas de seguimiento o de atención al cliente, incremento de clientes por día, visitas a clientes las cuales se observaban sus necesidades y se ofrecía el producto o servicio más óptimo, la presión era bastante tensa."
good,"Upper management is relentless in its pursuit of the golden egg, and on their way they have adopted the philosophy of ""punishing all because of one"", which after more than a hundred years has reached a point of diminishing returns. Employee churn is at an all time high and morale is low in light of the threat of even further lay offs being touted on social media. Over all pay is just above average , stress is high, work balance is low, and a clear disconnect between front and back end employees. Hats off to the men and women that grind it out daily at such a high level; we deserve so much more."
good,"sucks that the wifi world is doing away with jobs for us installers, dont tink its rite, but this is the direction of the world. so whats an old guy like me too do."
good,"first project in ATT was very good, my ATT manager gave me complete flexibility and would appreciate all work done. 2nd project at&t was not that great. No Fun at work."
good,"It took me a while to admit this to the public but the only thing AT&T was good for was a decent comp plan before they revised it. But when I tell you that you had to sell EVERY product that AT&T offers in order to get aid decently well, it is an understatement."
good,Leadership at the AT&T Call Center do not lead and do not act as leaders. It has become a free for all. I worked there for fourteen years. I started as a rep and then moved to management. I had more tenure than my supervisor.
good,I still have friends that work there. I loved working there ... management was very cookie cutter style I was happy to have work due to we were in a depression like economy
good,"This is a horrible place to work at. People are bad, management is even worse and no one cares for anyone. Pays well so if that's what you need then this place is good."
good,"At&t in General takes care of his employees, but the amount of pressure they get to complete quotas is overwhelming, lots of micro managing and because of the pressure lots of employees go for the easy route and sometimes lie to customer or ""twist"" the truth. all they care about is numbers not much employees, as far as advancement there is none unless you kiss a.. the money is ok but for the amount of pressure and all the stuff you have to deal with I would say the pay is not enough."
good,"After 20 years of service, I was downsized/laid off.  Most of my managers were professional, but most of the upper management directors are hostile to their subordinates."
good,"Pay was horrible and very unprofessional environment, I would not recommend this position if you are seeking entry level"
good,"A typical day at work in Hoffman Estates was extremely stressful to the point of causing many of my co-workers to need time off, often due to illnesses worsened or brought on by the stress. The end result of the time off take because of illness was our office being shut down and the work being moved elsewhere. It didn't matter we were the best performing center in the nation doing our job, but our attendance was the worst. What I learned was how to always maintain a calm and professional spirit at all times, never taking the abuse from our customers personal, and to always be empathetic. I loved the my co-workers who were the best group of people I've ever worked with. The hardest part of the job to deal with was the style of our management on all levels. What I liked most about the job was knowing my customers were well satisfied with my service to them by the end of our conversation."
good,"Interpersonal Skills: acknowledges the needs and concerns of others, promotes a positive working environment, has loyal and committed workers, manages different personalities, is tactful and sincere"
good,"I was Working with Authrize Dealer ""My Wireless"" they are California based Dealers they are trying to increase there business"
good,"every started working with directv , my health has not been the same any more , cause i have to work in heat and in the attic , cause the attic is worst place you can be during the summer time and if you not careful when working in the attic you might end up falling down and slip of the ladder during raining season."
good,"Great benefits. however, commission has been going down annually."
good,"Spent 4 years here"
good,All we were required to do was take calls and follow verbatim CSP
good,"to many jobs a day ,dont have time for home projects or family.Jobs not hard just to many hrs.Management needs to learn how to distribute jobs"
good,"Company did not care about the technicians. Company policy was to ensure a safe work environment, but if conditions were unfit I was still expected to do the job."
good,AT&T's main focus was to hit forecasted numbers based on traffic from a year ago's pace. Was educated on numerous ways to convince the consumer to purchase products and peripherals along with ways to diffuse potentially explosive confrontations due to billing mishaps. Working with and educated customers on new technology was the highlight of my day. Turn-around was a big thing at the job which gave testament to how the company invested on it's employees.
good,You feel like your job is on the line every minute of the day. cut throat sweat shop.
good,contact previous AT&T customer in attempt to regain a business professional relationship
good,It was just a typical day at work you work for about 10 to 11 hour days installing dishes on roofs and commercial buildings then having to set the dish to a certain degree point to satellites to be able to get the cable to be sufficient then i would run lines through the house in order for tvs and computers to be connected then i would connect remotes and then run broadband for the internet to be connected then after all that is done i would double check everything then i would clean what mess i made and make sure that the customer knows how to work then ill pack my truck up and then head to the next destination.
good,The company is trying to change the culture to be more agile. No free food or events really that help facilitate the great environment. Many of the colleagues can't even work from home
good,I like the job just the distance everyday an the money you have to put in gas as being a self contractor an the wear an tear on your vehicle I like the point of making our customers happy.
good,AT&T was a good company overall to work for. The store location I was at had a large turnover rate for both management and staff employees. This makes it difficult to establish consitency
good,"after 9 years at the company and getting closer to there 2020 vision which includes the removal of 40 to 60 percent of the workforce they haven't put anyone in positions to succeed and continue with the company as a career,"
good,AT&T hires some of the most dedicated and friendly coworkers I have ever had the opportunity to work with. Also they provide many benefits for full time employees as well as plenty of time off. Management has to negatively coach representatives when told to by higher ups. A lot of the times it can be so number driven it destroys the motivation within the store.
good,"It was a good place to start, it led me to a better place and it was fun on the way. Pay was good, management did whatever it takes to hit your goals, even if it meant lying. This was in 2015"
good,Good company to work for if you never want to change job titles or move up in the company. Absolutely no job advancements in union represented roles. Was in the same position and pay for years with over 75 internal transfer requests.
good,Buena empresa para laborar a excepción de las jornadas laborales extensas y demandantes.
good,AT&T has a great mission and direction.  Execution and local management is lacking.  Sales targets are set in March and changed 4 times during the past year.  Sales product improvements are ignored.
good,Time on job was more important on advancement in job rather than job ability.  Sales became more important than customer service.  Management shut down office.
good,AT&T was a great learning environment and really enjoyed working for the company.  There was a lot of change which resulted in the layoff of many people including myself.
good,"A typical day at work consists of coming to work, picking up equipment to start the day. Contact first customer and schedule service or installation. I learned that training needs to be more thorough. The manager doesn't give you enough time to grasp the job nor enough assistance to help you become a better tech. Hardest part is getting to every customer when you're stuck at you current customers house. The most enjoyable part is when you complete the job and it's done correctly and the customer is happy."
good,at&t is no longer in our area. however why there it was a very stressful environment however the pay was excellent and i became friends with a LOT of people
good,"AT&T is a great place to work if you are under good management or outside of sales. Sales staff is highly paid, but is under constant stress. Many of the factors that go into your stress are out of your control, yet you are expected to solve and take them on. They are held to unrealistic expectations many times. "
good,"This particular AT&T position did not allow for proper career growth.  In my opinion, more attention to what the employees needed to further their career was needed."
good,"The job was very stressful. I worked as a salesperson in the customer care position for two years. I found that working in that position was very stressful as I was not trusted with doing the job I was hired with as well as friends and other coworkers. I was very good at what I did, but my boss was usually behind me telling me what to say even if what I had to say was always better worded and worked every time. I couldn't stand being micro managed."
good,A typical day at work starts with a team huddle. Your manager reviewing your daily goals as well as where you are MTD. I learn how inconsistent a sales job can be. The management isn't very helpful> management sticks together it's like management VS employees. They ask what are professional and personal goals are but then do absolutely nothing to help you obtain those goals.The hardest part of the job is selling. Helping customers resolve the issue which is why they called to begin with. At&t should pull the contract they have with Sykes Inc
good,"I think its good to have this company under your belt."
good,Good place to work with good opportunity for challenging opportunities.  Most enjoyable part of the job were the varied types of assignments and the people.  Opportunity to relocate with world-wide locations.
good,"My old company was bought out by AT&T, and everything just went south from there. AT&T came in and proceeded to lay off important folks in the company and customer satisfaction just went down the tubes. I was forced to go on disability and then the day I returned (after doing EVERYTHING I was asked to do) I was placed on a surplus status and my position was eliminated. Now they are leaving an entire state without a trainer. "
good,"Overall a very good company to work for.  Benefits were good, management was good. High Concentration on team efforts and goals.  Team meetings were uplifting and Managers cared about their employees and worked hard with individuals that may need some additional training."
good,During the time I work there I had to drive between 3-4 a day round trip and that did not worked very good for me and i was stressed out  by the time I was getting in the office and even though my job function was that I had to be on the call or my computer all the time they did not allowed me to work from another office near my house or work from home.
good,working for at&t was okay. i love that i was helping people with there problems and sometimes saving them some money. but a lot of people had problems that could not be helped. would work for odd hours and won't get pay the right way.
good,Great pay management makes terrible decisions from products to discipline practices. Prem techs are treated like second class citizens compared to other titles.
good,When I started in 2007 it was a great company but over the years they got money hungry and lost track of what the company stood for. Management only hired and promoted those who you be robots and the company slowly got rid of anyone who was a free thinker or wanted to do things slightly different that what their robaric system required.
good,A typical day at work is very fast paced and stressful.I have learned how to multi-task.Management is not that good in my dept.My co-workers are great.The hardest part of my job is to sell with partial training.The most enjoyable part of my job is the salary.
good,"Your work day was never the same you always have the opportunity to meet new and amazing people."
good,I worked as a Directv agent for 1 summer and I would not do it again. When being promoted they do not educate you on what your new responsibilities will be and once you accept the position you can not move back down. It is not a professional setting many employees where pajamas and use inappropriate language.
good,"It was an educational job, learning about sales over the phones. Working on a busy ACD phone system. Working with irate customers, resolving their issues."
good,"Working on high attention and BIG Agile projects."
good,"Interfaced with over 20 customers a day and led clients in selecting and purchasing products in a retail environment to meet sales goals."
good,"Work environment is okay, there are a few short-comings with leadership being disorganized and it shows with some employees."
good,"no day is typical it depends on the types of customers calling in"
good,"Dealt with daily clientele on several purchases on a daily basis."
good,"decent pay, lots of over time. you're blamed for any mistake such as customers not understanding how to use a tv, bad equipment, just generally working with crazy customers. everything you do is tracked to the minute and there's no time for any mistakes, you're basically worked like a robot. working 12 hour days isn't taken into consideration."
good,"They don't care about their employees. The customer's money is all they care about. Very hostile work environment. A lot of bullying and harassment. Management does nothing to stop it. All they push is numbers, numbers, numbers. It's a very lucky thing if you get your breaks. Lunches are 1 hour long. The only good thing about it is the money and benefits. If you can work somewhere else do it."
good,"install and repair tv internet and voice services"
good,"Loud and unorganized"
good,The department is new so its not very well organized. I enjoy my job but there is little to no room for advancement.
good,well learning technically..yes its good and i have got the opportunity and when i got i have grabbed it but work culture is not that good and coming to the management is not helpful
good,Scheduled work times continuously change. Wage increases and job advancements are not readily available. A typical day involves troubleshooting residential and business internet accessibility needs. The most enjoyable parts of the position are my co-workers. Unfortunately I find the management extremely unstable and often not well advised
good,"Good company to learn about new media.  As it goes with several large companies, change is slow and painful."
good,to begin the days you sign in on the computers. You do learn how to handle the upset customers which you get often. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. Hardest part of the job can be the customers and when the systems fail. They make the job fun most of the time we would play games while taking calls to boost are calls and or upgrades
good,"The company is, overall, a great place to work. Benefits and pay are among the highest in the country for this industry. Don't be a manager unless you are not interested in a ""Work/Life Balance."" I spent 3 hours awake at home, 8 hours asleep - Total 11hrs out of 24hrs. The demands have caused most of the people I know to either retire from the company on disability, go on disability for months at a time, quit out right, or get fired for ""COBC Violations."" "
good,"ATT was a temporary assignment. The people there were relatively nice and helpful. If given the opportunity to work there again, I probably would. The supervisors made it easy to pick up what it was that you were learning and doing."
good,Work Life balance is highly visible but not allowed. The training that is given is very good and well organized. co-workers are great but upper management is very unorganized.
good,"Receive calls from customers regarding new activation's. Once a week we would have an hour team meeting. Maintained emails from management regarding sales promotions and quotas."
good,"The overall company is great. The benefits are excellent. I learned the importance of tech support assistance, the importance of communication, and the true value of our consumers. Management was not so sufficient. Many of the managers showed favoritism, were not as supportive, and not available. The hardest part of the job was trying to utilize new tools without proper training. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. "
good,hard on the family but if your single and dont mind the constant sales pressure its ok.
good,"The Training with Direct Tv is great, and the best thing about working for Direct tv was that you get free Directv"
good,Love the people I work with and customers. Love the outside work
good,Dispatcher spoke with techs about daily routes closed out jobs when tech completed it was a call center and sometimes was very exciting place . The hardest part of the job was when couldn't close out job due to issues that could only be handled during regular business hours . Really helped others in need with counseling if needed time off for family issues .. The most enjoyable part having free services the premium package almost a 200 dollar savings !!!
good,"giving customers information, long hours, several breaks through out the day.."
good,Worked for att for 14 years. Not much opportunity for advancement. use employees for Management responsibilites with out compinsation.
good,"AT&T changes everyday. In goods ways and also bad. Its repetitive work, with no motivation from management."
good,"AT&T used to be the company you could work for 30 years and retire and now it is downsizing really great employees and keeping lazy technicians due to ""Seniority"" I was in management and was downsized with thousands of others. They keep the managers who are friends with the seniors and have little regard for performance or initiative."
good,Answer inbound calls for AT&T had to deal with current and new customer accounts also had to pitch sales for u-verse and internet whenever it was available to the customer
good,mid-level managers worried more about their bonuses and not very compassionate about their employees. but upper management always sided with their supervisors there was no doubting that you had to work out the issue or just give up and do as you told
good,"Intense, fast paced environment. The work load requires the physical ability to be on your feet, lift a ladder, and pick up to at least 60lbs. You have to be able to keep a professional relationship with AT&T customers."
good,They have no work life balance and are unionized so they reduced the amount of PTO. You cannot take a sick day without getting a point. You get 10 sick days but at 8 points your fired. It made no sense
good,"Very big, hard to work in company. There is not alot of opportunity to move up and progess within the company. I would look elsewhere when searching for a job."
good,"Job was okay, management makes things worse. I like the coworkers I had but just didn’t feel that anyone above me actually cared about me or my advancement."
good,"Las llamadas en el área de crédito y cobranzas suelen ser de lo más sencillo hasta lo más complicado, hay que tener muchísima paciencia para manejar a los clientes. En AT&T se escudan de que hacen cambios constantes, sin embargo lo hacen para justificar su falta de organización. El salario es bueno, puedes recibir bonos por producción, pero el tiempo que pasas en el trabajo es muchísimo y casi no hay tiempo para estar con la familia y/o salir."
good,I changed from a tech to integrated solutions consultant and transferred to another state... awesome benefits but cant sustain a lifestyle from one area to another it just isn't possible as a tech I could sustain a lifestyle of independence with pretty good benefits and the best part was job security due to having the union in IHX not so much
good,"Trato con la gente"
good,goal oriented company that really cared for their employees and making them feel motivated to work for this company. They provided their employees with benefits
good,Good company for beginner experience. You can really meet a lot of good people during the course of the job. Terrible imbalance between technicians and sales depts!!
good,"Job is what you make it.  "
good,"I liked my job with AT&T, unfortunately, it was always ""someone else's fault"" or the techs fault for faulty equipment, or faulty infrastructure, I just got tired of the finger pointing, and unless you have relatives further up the line, you will not be going anywhere.. promotions are based off a waiting list, so no matter how good or bad you work, you wont be moving until the person above you moves up,promotions are not based off the merit system.."
good,"Very unprofessional place to work at. Alorica is not a good place to grow. They cut your hours when ever they want to, they give yo really low benefits and its a very messy call center."
good,"No work life balance on retail, and no realistic goals vs compensation. Employees are only numbers. "
good,"I have worked with AT&T for almost 7 years in 3 states and 4 stores. It is a good job with the right leadership that is team oriented which I experienced in the first state I worked in. Once I transferred, it was a totally different market. The leadership varies from market to market. The bad leadership I experienced fraternized, had an inner circle, power tripped, threaten to fire you but then laugh like they were joking, and back stabs. It is hard to sum up the experience because everyone will have a different experience. You may be a suck up because you may need to be cut some slack for lacking job performance or you may be hard worker and focused on the tasks. But these are just 2 examples of what might be. I am the latter. They try to get me to conform to the former. But don't forget there is good leadership but you have to see for yourself. I suggest reading the HR policies and staying in touch with an Employee Relations Manager (ERM). Know your rights and read your polices and don't take anyone's word for it. It might be a manager telling you and they may not want you to know how things work so they can exploit you."
good,After Hurricane Katrina in 05. I would go door to door helping customer to get phone and help them help switch to SBC phone company to lower there bills.
good,"Sometimes stressful.  Heavy call volume.  Great people.  Metrics are important.  In the call center environment, career advancement is very limited.  Dead-End job."
good,"middle level management were horrible, they were all shady sales representative that sucked up to other management and treated customers horribly. I would never listen to their managers"
good,"While making a profit isnt bad, generally a good thing for a business, ATT upper management is driven to make profit at any cost to the employee. And will accept network degradation if the profit increases in the short term."
good,"I loved my job until we got a new director. This individual liked to walk around as though everything was rainbows, sunshines, and lollipops. Behind closed doors, this individual was anything but that. This person also fostered a snow flake culture where the agents on the phones had more sway and influence than the managers managing them. Every minor complaint made by one of the agents was magnified as though it were the end of the world. This director also created and fostered a clique within the building with the managers that this person liked. If you were not part of that clique, it was not a good place to be in."
good,Very high turn over rate.  Selling was more important than customer service.  some managers micromanaged for this reason.  unprofessional attitudes and behaviors. But it was a job and one of the highest paying in the local area; which doesnt say much at 16/hr.
good,"Happiness here depends on what you're willing to do for a buck. Far from satisfying work, and moral is low. It has given me the tools I need to provide for my family and that is all."
good,The company is good and I loved my job. But did not have any job advancement and the management did not back employees against customer complaints no real future.
good,"Everyone is constantly on edge because of a serious lack of job security.  Constant ""downsizing"" causes to worry more about job than enjoying the work."
good,"buen ambiente laboral, en este trabajo aprendía  manejar excel, a realizar formulas cruces repoteria"
good,A lot of work to be completed in one day. fun part are meeting new people every day and being able to help them with the services they like for their business or personal life.
good,"Union job, you are held to the letter of the contract, if you are in the wrong work group layoffs could happen every three months, pay is OK but it's tough doing more work than other work groups do for less money"
good,nice loving environment. They had flexible hours and clean work place. they gave us nice lunch. the manager were extremely nice and the understood if you could not work. they always paid us on time
good,A typical work day at AT&T was long from beginning to end. It consisted of numerous client appointments with very little help from management. Some days were better than others but you make do.
good,"Working at ATT MOBILITY was good money , however environment was very stressful from time to time. Sometimes employees felt over worked but environment was what you made of it."
good,"If you arent used to working outside being exposed tothe elements and dealing with angry customers and know it all tech wizards, this job is not for you"

good,"Long drive to work everyday 1 hour commute, in the winter with bad road conditions at times took 3 hours to get to work."
good,The job itself gives no sense of security with theur attendance policy and other rules and regulations within the center. Overall I love helping people but it's not a great atmosphere where Att males u wanna come to work. We are a new center so this may be why. So many have came and gone!
good,My experience at At&t was horrible. My manger was a theif and was not fair at all. Overall i love At&t and would work for another store that was corporate.
good,"DTV,DTV and DTV is all. As ATT and Direct Tv merge, Stores are pushing Cable even more their DTV NOW app, so prepared to get a lot of no's. But the most enjoyable part was get commission which is great in the fast month but after the holiday season it gets super slow and it hurts your pockets. As long as you know the plan and the promotions and get a couple of DTV's a week youll be prepared."
good,Compensation and benefits kept me here for 3 years management is really bad in the 3 years working my location went through about 6 managers. And they all use scare tactics to get you to preform l. No life balance and weekends are required to be worked. Must lie to customer to close sales and keep yourself out of the line of fire. I feel The Moto for At&t should be “You are replaceable “
good,"It was my first time ever working in a call center and my last, it was a strict and very stressful environment, the perks however were great, the benefits were awesome, but a Peace of Mind is ""PRICELESS."""
good,"Lo que aprendí en esta empresa fue que al realizar los procesos de manera correcta, dejan una satisfacción en los clientes, la cual te proporciona a futuro más clientes potenciales por recomendación de los primeros, lo que se traduce en ventas y en mayores ingresos."
good,"	Provided first line of support for TAC Tier II Mobility. Work with Remedy AOTS to open, update, monitor and close existing trouble tickets after the problem is resolved"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job at AT&T was working overtime. The compensation package was also really good. The hardest part of the job getting upper level management to understand what we were doing and how their decisions impacted us
good,"I worked there over 20 years  Great benefits,  Low Compensation  long hours  sometimes  not compensation for your extra  work."
good,"I worked inside of a mall. I worked different holidays which were very busy. Management at this job were good, always making sure their employees were learning about the new gadgets that came into the market. The hardest part of the job was to persuade a customer into purchasing a phone along with assessors and different plans. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting a lot of people."
good,"I learned a great deal in AT&T , Looking forward to use my skills to further my career . I developed my management skills during my time in ATT. I love the great benefits of ATT"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my 20 years at AT&T was the innovation of our products and services that evolved over this time.  A typical day at work was busy with a lot of multitasking that included selling, training, last minute project for management or answering customer related calls or emails. The hardest part of the job was ending your day when it should end.  The phone and email never stopped and you had to decide when your day ended.  Overall, I learned quite a bit of life/business lessons.  Training on our products and services were always top priority so I was always up to speed on products.  Some other key attributes were building business relationships, merchandising, customer relations-escalating and diffusing concerns, one on one with our existing customers/potential new clients."
good,"Great job if you succed in sales, no work/life balance however. Management was mostly wiling to help with your needs, but often times felt I was being micromanaged."
good,Trained in many aspects of telecommunications they AT&T. Work with people throughout USA on many types of circuits. Also able to work in many different types of equipment at many different levels.
good,I worked here for about 9 months. It was an okay job. There is not much to complain about. The company pushed us to sell stuff that was not going to work well in our market. So it was a constant struggle to make numbers. We made it work though.
good,"Learned a lot about AT&T, but low pay, no room for advancement.  No recognition for meeting goals.  It was a job and got me through."
good,okay job to work at. great incentive bonus structure. lots of coaching with manager to help you with the sales to achieve over the phone.
good,"Great team of developers but release management was not the best. Actually, the worst I've seen in my 20 year work history."
good,Upsold prior Bell South clients AT&T products so that they can improve and upgrade services they already had.  Also handled trouble tickets that customers may have had with there service.  Assisted with escalations.
good,"A typical work day would consist of using two software programs called Siebel rio and OMS along with outlook. I learned how to use Siebel rio and oms however , the training was not the best. They do have an assistance line to help with any questions while on a difficult call. My co workers were great and the hardest part were the hours. Overall it was a great work experience."
good,"Sales thats all this job was based around. I had a team of 5 employees constantly pushing to get people signed up for DirecTv. Management was good, if there were any issues they were usually dealt with very fair and fast, Co-workers were great sometimes you come across someone who doesn't have any idea how to sell and then you come across your natural born go getters."
good,"Working for apple was like magic, very cool until i knew how the trick was."
good,"work a full day respect, your customers and the client,have and maintain a positive attitude,work your territory correctly."
good,"falta mas gestion en la parte de direccion de la empresa, hay muy buena calidad humana en la empresa, pero la direccion hace que el ambiente de trabajo no sea el adecuado."
good,"•	Involved in requirement gathering, estimation and project planning "
good,"worked for them as the SWIM system started  to get big, was kinda fun, flet like an attic crawler at the end of the day."
good,pays good. However you do not have a life. byt the time you get out of work you are very tired
good,"A typical day at at&t begins with and ends with providing outstanding customer service.  The work is mentally stimulating and enhances problem solving skills.  I have learned a tremendous amount about information technology and have developed skills in this field.  Co-workers are great and eager to assist in helping to become a great technician.  The hardest part of the job can be satisfying customers who have issues that are out of your control in a seamless manner.  The most enjoyable parts of the job are the people we meet and work with, and the information technology skills that are acquired in the process."
good,Great management. Nice place to work. They care about their employees
good,"The position as a wire tech is not fulfilling at all. Though i did learn about the infrastructure of AT&T. The treatment of the techs is horrible! No consideration for the mental state at all. The constant negative feedback god forbid  if you forget one little thing! You can have 100 straight passing surveys but you get one failed one then it's the end of the world. Most of the managers never did U-verse so it is hard to respect there logic or advice. "
good,Management isn't a monarchy here. All the employees are involved in decision making processes.
good,The job requirements change very often. They are always telling you new things to do or to stop doing. It is very easy to get in trouble. The hours are very long. You work in undesirable areas into the night. Overall not a job i recommend for anyone with a family or social life.
good,"trabajo de mucho tiempo y sacrificio escaso sueldo,muchas responsabilidades ya que pase de chofer a vendedor y encargado todo por el mismo sueldo,fui resposable de gente la cual les enseñe a vender"
good,Normal fortune 500 company where the only people who know you are the ones that work directly with you every day.
good,"daily contest on sales, super focus on each call making the most of opportunities.  Every caller was different.  Retention was becoming the focus by selling each call."
good,Constantly busy and sometimes unachievable sales goals. Hard to advance.
good,"Work day was 8 hours of retail sales, viewing additional training videos, merchandising, assistant manager duties."
good,"I have learned that it is all about the customer, if their happy your happy. I love helping people and being able to confidently help them. "
good,"Daily job functions included; answering phone calls, assisting customer and new clients, established new service and maintaining existing accounts, meeting and exceeding sales objectives, and lastly, navigating through many systems at one time."
good,"I loved that AT&T gave me the opportunity to gain sales skills and more importantly gave me the opportunity to work with basic customer service experience. This however was 5 years ago, now if you want even a Sales Support Rep (Greeter position) somehow you have to have experience opening a door, signing someone in and placing product on shelves. That being said AT&T has become too good for the little guy. Most employees are disgruntled and this is because of an ever changing commission structure that keep your annual take home pay exactly where it was when you started. If you want to develop new skill, you better take a class or go to lectures outside of work because there is no opportunity for continued skill development. It's sales and sales only. I am a go getter that was looking for more and was not given anything that was useful for any other position. I applied internally for Management training program so it had to be signed off by the Market director who was too busy to review my qualification and give a yay or nay. After 6 months of trying I received a call from my current employer and already I have been given 10 times the amount of skills in 5 months than I gained at AT&T. This position is great to maintain a decent average income but impossible to advance your career quickly and there is no environment for new skill development, which is required in order to advance ones career."
good,Every customer and call is unique. calls are steady and tone has to always be upbeat.
good,Went for sale rep to asistant manager.. and learn how to sell mobile phones...
good,"The pay for a premise tech is decent. ATT offers plenty of ways to get involved with community, etc. Hours are difficult and not for everyone. forced 6th days are common. As new hire, you likely will not get to select your off days."
good,Management is micromanaging most of the time. Corporate refuses to fix small issues while creating more issues that wastes company time and money. Benefits include company truck and good healthcare. Each year requirements for the job increase and wages trail behind.
good,"I want to be a tech for ATT,iv been a tech for 20+ yrs ,AtT is where it's at.i started in NY State doing underground,then drops,premiering houses,now installs,I like my job but need more securety."
good,"The company I work for has its ups and downs, I will say the department I work for is a good environment but lacking in certain aspects for the agent as well as the customer"
good,"Take incoming calls as customer service, solve problem while trying to sell them more services.it is a stressful job, hard to make goals on steady basis. Work culture was poor. Everything is great when you are doing good, but when you arent it is the worst."
good,It is better if you are single and have no children because there is absolutely no work/life balance.  The pay is good and so are the benefits.  There is not a whole of room for advancement though.
good,"Spent a decade there, culture had changed over the years but a lot of good memories. Pay was cool in the beginning but the commicap took a toll on all employees, this affected the moral."
good,The In Home Expert department could be a great position if management had a better startegy to win customers over. Uncompetetive offers and pressure to sell at any cost stiffles true development.
good,"Good place to work at as corporate level.  Being able to work remote is great.  Downside, if you are a contract, expect to be possibly replaced due to how AT&T handles their dealings with contract companies.  It is possible to be replaced mid-way through a project because of AT&T deciding to go with another contractor."
good,"If you want to work somewhere, that you can't build or grow in a career then work in telecommunications but if you want to move up and grow there are other opportunities out there"
good,Guidelines were always changing and meeting up to standards that you had no control of. If a customer called back in within 30 days of you installing their services you were dinged for it which would affect your bonus. Managers looking for reasons to fire technicians and treated their crew with disrespect.
good,"Union Run Company  job tenure is not certain , to much politic , always laying off employees every quarter, contractors sometime terminated in the middle of contract term"
good,"Not interested, At and t is a good company....Doing good job is good, it puts food on my table and I will be able to work for the company again. I love the"
good,Not really concerned with employees personal lives. The shifts were horrible and leadership was not concerned about the amount of hours worked as long as the job got done.
good,"Cool job, pay was pretty good but techs deserve more. Management sticks together and think that they are drill instructors. Just be glad these a union that think they are helping, there not"
good,Ok company. Comp plans change all the time. if your not in with management it’s not good. Really no work life balance when you first start off and you get split days off. You have to work late during holidays.
good,Hard work does not matter good ole boy system in place. work in rain snow doesn't matter. work till it is all done no set time off. Will miss many birthdays if your a parent.
good,"Over 34 Years AT&T provided me with a consistent income, moderate benefits and a career.  I was promoted in place 3 times due to additional knowledge and workload.  Unfortunately additional workload was because so many people were being laid off.  And then after 34 years was laid off because of where I was located.  Not being given the opportunity to move to an acceptable location.  Fairly suddenly and unexpected along with several thousand other employees March of 2019.  The impact on company morale of not knowing when you are next is devastating to the workforce.  Anyone that is left is terrified that they will be next.  It's a sad situation for what was once an awesome company to work for."
good,"Good pay, good place to work temporarily. Will get burned out pretty quick...but overall not a bad experience. You'll learn a lot by working there. Not much work/life balance."
good,I worked there at a time of transition in the communications industry. Lots of regulation and changing technology made for uncertainties in profitability. That created a very stressful work environment and a relentless pursuit of profits at the expense of customer service.
good,"10 years in company , management is the worst , most managers dont know our job , or have no experience on the field.   Have no respect for hard working technicians .    was a good company to work for once upon a time ."
good,"Money can be made but environment is bad and advancement is almost impossible. Only a thirty minute lunch break. You're set up by teams. Very competitive, but not trustworthy conversations from employees for customers to receive packages for U- Verse TV/ Direct TV and/or phone services."
good,"No dan sueldo base. Por lo cual me tuve que salir , lo cual yo busco un nuevo trabajo relacionado a mi carrera."
good,"AT&T was a good company until about 5 years ago. Since then, the senior leadership appears to have forgotten they are a telecom. The upper management wants to transform into an entertainment company. Customer focus has diminished."
good,You work a lot of overtime. Life outside of work is pretty much non-existent. Learn good troubleshooting skills. You are the face of the company. You take the blame for everything AT&T does.
good,A typical work day at  AT&T consists of back to back calls and lots of multi-tasking. The job requires that you are able to work between multiple software to retrieve and document information about the call. All calls are documented through a ticketing system.
good,If you have a family just don't. Money is good but you work a lot. Not really worth it. They will have you take on several roles to get you ready for management then not follow through on their promise.
good,"employees are not made a priority by the company, management needs an overhaul. We do receive good benefits, but like anything else at AT&T, they are slowly being taken from us as the company grows."
good,Fantastic Benefits and Sales Training Processes. Income is higher then normal....but then again they layoff one third of their workforce each year so job security is non-existent. Became too much of a monopoly.
good,"Working with customers consultations on the technology ( from Caller ID to voice over IP, to fiber optics) industry was fun.  A lot of learning and changes on an every day basis. Sales was a big part of the job after assisting customer with all the billing and technical questions."
good,Att has a lot of work to go around. Working hours tend to be long and learning curve high. If you have some experience in this field it will be easier to get into the rhythm here.
good,Received good on the job training with ATT.  Was also sent to training classes in off site locations and some on site training classes. This was a technical position and ATT seemed to be trying to downsize their technical workers at the time.
good,What can I say. The title says a lot. You will make money here and for me in tuscaloosa this was far more money than I had ever made in that city but it came at a cost. The cost was hours on my feet. Having to pressure sell down for hours and hours on end. I am not one to want to pressure someone into buying something if you are not either than this is not the place for you. You have to sell to get anywhere and I don't like to pressure people.
good,"Company is good, management lacks knowledge and hands-on experience. Being a billion dollar company it lacks material in critical times and also management that can handle the pace."
good,"Being a wire tech at AT&T means that you're outside the core contract and your job title becomes the catch-all for new work the company wants done. In five years my job went from glorified cable and IT guy to include fiberoptic work, satellite work, outside plant work, and more. This is fine with the right management, but for some reason the Baton Rouge area likes to keep switching up management of teams regardless of success, often putting known problem managers over teams that were previously doing well. It has often been said that people don't quit jobs; they quit managers. This cannot be more true given my experience with the company. "
good,attendance policy extremely strict. Daily job duties were consistent but communication lacked between agent and management level. Training was exceptional
good,"Great training to learn the trade. AT&T demands long hours, and I routinely worked 12 hour days. Paid well, but all I did was work. Schedule changed from week to week."
good,The company actively looks for error and sometimes other managers will be so cut throat they make errors up and right you up for no reason. Managment is under the gun to find any and all errors. No matter how large or small they are.
good,"I worked for at&t for over 5 years. For the most part it was a great company and I enjoyed assisting our clients. However, there is a lot back stabbing."
good,I was a DTV contractor for 2 years until our pay went 80/20 to 60/10. They've called me twice already to come back but because of lackluster management that will NEVER happen. *********************************************************
good,"Pays well. scheduling is not ideal for the beginners, and its all based upon seniority. compensation is nice, but it depends on what you are willing to do for it."
good,ATT culture is all about the end game for the big dogs.  There isn't any opportunity to move up.  The pay is great as are some of the benefits.  There is no
good,"the careers with attmo can be stressful and at times demand a large commitment away from family.  at times we have to choose to put family first.  I am at that point now.  I don't have anything negative to say, only plan to work long hours"
good,It is a very Great career opportunity for sales position and good money to be made. Training is also extensive with a lot of material but helps a lot on the phones.
good,"I truly liked working for this company, however they give Store management positions to children who are in no way ready to lead people.  They only care about selling direct tv and will lie cheat and  steal to be ranked."
good,"The hardest part of the job is no loyalty within the sales team management,without that its never a great job.  Doing the right thing goes a very long way, Sales management does not do that."
good,Mala organización en la forma como se distribución a los centros de ventas
good,current job expectations and pay are not keeping pace with competitors and technicians are leaving for better pay and job/life balance.  emphasis has shifted from work quality to quantity.
good,Loved installing cable just didnt pay the bills. No room for advancement. No drive from management to ensure proper installation. He said its qauntity over qaulity. I did not agree about that.
good,"Great company.I have  only the greatest respect for the company AT&T. I have worked fir over two decates for at&t."
good,"- Typical day at work: Worked normal business hours, had the assignment to test mobile apps at for a 2 week cycle for every build."
good,"When I first started at AT&T I loved working there, commission was great, and from there it even got better.  Then they bought directv, and everything went downhill.  The commission you'd get for hitting your goals got cut in half.  Which brought the moral of the store way down.  My store went through several managers in a short period of time which made it even more difficult.  They didn't want to promote the top sellers to management because they were too valuable to them on the floor, which is what happened in my case.   I was passed up for several promotions because of my ability to sell"
good,"Shifts are 10 hours long, leaving very little time left in any day. No sick leave, but the pay is great for the position title. Easily best of retail."
good,"The position at the time had to high of expectations for sales goals and the manager i had was not very supportive,but i was able to maintain as long as i could. The company had a reputation and good poroduct."
good,The company was great but the district managers were another story. when you were off you were still expected to work from home and that included your off days.
good,"Some business and service centers are ""clicky"" and that outsiders may walk into timid waters. Most individuals are good people to work with. Good work/life balance. Good benefits."
good,Lugar bueno para trabajar pero sin estabilidad laboral
good,"Eager to learn the ropes and guidelines and help out the franchise. Everyday began to get better and easier as I profected my craft. Only down call was the pay, it wasn't exactly a good minimum amount"
good,"I worked this position installing Uverse services for AT@T, this is an hard job and it compensates well, but no work life/personal life balance. But i enjoyed the experience/"
good,"A typical day at work was very hectic specifically in AT & T U verse process."
good,The staff made it hard to work do to the fact that they wasn't professional at all the lied about hours and also lied about bonus pay and staff was not inviting at all. But work it self wonderful
good,"Manage day to day operations, Inventory, direct sales efforts and reach the goals for daily, weekly and monthly, recruit and train employees, handle bank deposits"
good,"I worked with medical records putting them on microfiche."
good,This job gave great communication skills. I also gain technical support experience that is still useful until this day. AT&T offred excellent insensitives.
good,"with the buy out of att they have downsized a lot and its better to just work here as a part time, not as a full time career, there is no job security."
good,". Typical retail sales and retail sales management. "
good,good place to work but management was not good they made up all there own rules and didnt stick to company policy.  Uverse was the best service that i ever had. All wire techs were team players. hardest part of the job is having to climb telephone poles. Most enjoyable was that you met a lot of great people and it wasnt the same thing every day.
good,"spent most of my career there. If you're making money, the job is tolerable, but if you're not it's very challenging. Little work life balance. Environments constantly changing. A lot of restructuring and commission plan changes. It's hard to keep up with."
good,"This was a good path for me to grow, and help me on with my career. It gave me an opportunity to show my marketing skills, and to help develope the associates that worked under me."
good,This jobs main focus was elimination of the weak and keep the strong as it relates to sales and customer service. We were told one thing and then was expected to do something totally different.
good,I based my rating on the specific location I worked at. But the company overall is a really great company and have a great 401k match and great benefits.
good,First shift Monday through Saturday. Management was great and i liked every moment of it. Being responsible and being able to work with 25 different At&t technicians was a great experience.
good,"A typical day at work can be fun and exciting for those with good people and technical skills,  The path to moving up within the company does require that you become a manager of a store in order to branch out into other areas.  Not everyone want to go that route.  Not enough time developing RSC's into potential managers when only looking at numbers and not communication skills.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of work balance life."
good,I went thru a company transition and was looking at lower hourly pay and compensation after only 3 months of working for the company. I wish that I would have had a heads up when I took the job.
good,"It was a very laid back place to work. AT&T was served by OneTouch Direct. They wouldn't have benefits until after a year, but they were flexible with making up hours"
good,IT Operations was outsourced. There was massive layoffs as well. No real opportunities to move to a new department. Management was allowed to use lay offs as a strategy.
good,At this company I learned about networking fundamentals and how to apply them. I also learned about routing and was able to gain valuable hands-on experience. I work with a great crew and enjoy interacting with my customers.
good,"great place to work if that's all you want to do is work- after almost 6 yrs and 159 job submissions within the company, I'm still holding the same position! keep the best techs in the field kind of deal.."
good,You are always in classes learning about new products and how to implement them. Its fun and faced pace. I worked in the billing department for business clientele only. The bills are printed in mass format so mistakes can and will happen. Policies allow you to fix those billing issues and retain customer. The hardest part of the job is dealing with transferring the customer to other departments.
good,"I loved my job, but the management wasn't so great. They were rude to staff as well as customers and just didn't have a good workplace attitude."
good,"Horrible management "
good,"como empresa es una buena empresa en cuanto a clima laboral solo que le afecta la mala selección de personal para ocupar niveles jerárquicos mas altos."
good,this is a good second job... nothing more nothing less. pay is ok but not enough to live off I you have a family. You're probably more tan management.
good,"The role of the CSR in this area is very structured, however, management is constantly overturning. This is usually followed by discovery of things previous management were not following up on."
good,"Company is all about numbers, don't have any connections to employees as people. If you don't need personal connection the benefits are great and you can make great money. If you want work life balance their response will be, well you work retail... deal with it."
good,"A typical day at work was to come in 15 minutes prior to my shift and clock in on time. I answered about 90 calls within an eight hour work period. I had to sell AT&T products which was mandatory."
good,"We have to know a lot about different products and services. AT&T's services are constantly changing, since we have to stay in competition with such a saturated market. I learned that some people can be extremely shaddy when working with customers to make sure they get the highest commission check they can. Management there is room to grow as long as you are performing and you stay on top in the district. The atmosphere is really fun for the most part. The hardest thing about being a sales consultant is that with services constantly changing, you get a lot of upset customers. You have to have the ability to position selling Directv/Home security, adding lines to a customers account as well as selling at least $200 a day with every single customer that walks in. The most enjoyable thing about my job are the customers that I get to talk to every day as well as work perks such as, getting a new device and the latest technology that comes out that we get to play with."
good,"AT&T is a demanding, fast paced environment. Some work is much harder than other work. The customer service part of the job is very good. In many instances, techs are told to do less for the customer to increase productivity numbers. This usually leads to more repeat service calls. That is the most difficult part of the job. There is very little balance between awesome customer service and some made up productivity number. This is very independent position. 99.9% of work is done by a single technician."
good,"I had a great job and I enjoyed it it a lot but the the job culture is intense with too many rules on what you can and can't say to a fellow employee and there are ""snitches"" everywhere! I'm not saying that I ever violated policies per se but most of the employees are women and you must be politically correct at all times or you'll find yourself in a ""meeting"". The corporate atmosphere was horrible."
good,"I come to work for that, to work. Daily I am excited about life and the blessing to be working. A typical day at work here is laughter with my co-workers and work when that time comes into play. Management was good. My co-workers were amazing and I enjoy working with them! The hardest part of my job is actually nothing. I tend to not let anything get me down. I enjoyed working here for the past 15 years and would have remained if my office was not closing."
good,"Great place to learn new technology, you have the opportunity to develop a sales team, great for customer interaction, constant positive changes"
good,"On a typical day I receiver about 50 calls inbound and make 15 - 20 outbound. I dispatch the following days work orders, activate receivers, give ETAs, reschedule customers, and assist with scheduling of new installs and service calls."
good,"A typical day at Directv:"
good,"The hours were great and convenient, however the pay and management weren't that great. They hourly pay and the commission wasn't reasonable for your job requirements."
good,"It's a great job. The horrible side is management. If you have a terrible manager the best thing to do is transfer, because a terrible manager has the ability to write you up for any or everything and it will go in your file and may remain for up to 3 years. The union does the best they can, but in the end, a terrible supervisor will cause your career harm. The hours are decent in the not busy months, once things pick up, and that's usually in the summer, when the days are longer; be prepared to work at least 10 hours a day and a mandatory 6 day work week. If something goes wrong with an install or repair within a certain time frame, you are the one to blame."
good,"A typical day included a quick 2-3 minute meeting, gathering your stock and loading your truck, and dispatching out on your jobs. What you dispatch on varies, you may dispatch on an install or repair, depending on what is in the load for the day. Jobs are not predetermined. I learned a great deal about phone and data wiring, how to create ethernet patch cords, troubleshooting a phone network, wireless network and a basic cable systems. "
good,I was a contractor with direct tv i had no problems with the company just wish i was getting paid hourly instead of by the job. Its a lot of labor work putting up the dish and customer service calls for the techs was horrible you always was talking to someone from India with a bad accent and you stayed on hold for a long time but other than that ok place to work
good,Overall the job was fun. The lack of a good management team was the reason for I wouldn't reccomend
good,Work environment hasn't been my favorite. While work has always been plenty the administration is lacking. Rivalry and favoritism are rampant throughout the managers and senior management. I usually felt I was working alone and against the current.
good,The Pay here is very bad. The top management is so confused that they keep on changing the proses rules all the time. Every year there will be a top management level changes for managers and they will eventually change everything from top to down. all the rules process. and with in a year again.
good,it was a good job to start off at. i learned plenty from working here.
good,typical was babysitting at least 20- 25 adults who could not think for themselves or even make simple decisions management was fractured from the top down. there was not much about this job that after 14 years was realistic or even attainable.  .
good,Was able to learn in a comfortable environment. All material was taught in a professional and understandable manner. The instructor was very knowledgeable of the material needed to be taught. was able to prepare each agent for the call center floor.
good,It's been a really good experience to work with so many good people to include the field techs and most of the management. The work days were fast paced for the most part and made the time go by fast. The hardest part of this job is learning their system; it was mostly about metrics; based all on numbers. The best part of this job has been working with field techs and assisting them in their jobs; a lot of great people out there.
good,Sales Agents would send over the order for credit review. Once reviewed existing credit account with us and/or a DB credit report for credit desion. We also did take security deposits and explain the terns to user on how that could be refunded.
good,"I joint ATT as a QC member for FFA CTO Volte project in Chicago."
good,working for the company enhanced my customer service skills
good,"Día típico, llegar sentarse y empezar a llamar ."
good,"AT&T is an awesome company to work for, especially with the benefits/compensation package that's offered. However, there is a downfall with management positions and opportunity for adavancement"
good,"Going to different homes to install cable tv, internet, and phone.  Great customer service used to be the focal point, but now its all about quotas and numbers.  Management does not offer much training, but discipline is strong and swift.  The job consists of long hours , 50- 60 a week, rotating schedules.  Sometimes its hard to plan things with my family."
good,"Great pay; however, all pay and scheduling resolves around tenure not performance."
good,Direct managment had no real abillity to effect change for employee or company benifit.
good,Was a great place to work until they stopped promoting from with in.
good,At&t was great except for the management. They were shady when it came to paying out comission and when you asked about it your job was threated..... NOT COOL. But the job was awesome becuase I got to teach people about new advancements in tech
good,"I don't think there is anything typical in the day of a business account manager.  Everyday is a new adventure.  Naturally, I always had a road map and gameplan to each day, but normally my days went longer than expected and you didn't stop until the last customer was satisfied."
good,"The work is challenging, with great people. Uniforms, vehicles, and tools are supplied by the company. Overtime is a regular occurrence and sometimes abused. The best part of the job is not being in one place for very long and meeting interesting customers."
good,"Cold, bottom line results. Good foundational instruction, but limited."
good,i learned alot when it comes down to international roaming and how it works
good,Great place to work but had very little training. Was laid off with in the first year of employment. I would go back if opening was open.
good,it was a okay job if you like to sell and promote items and the plus sign you meet new people and learn new stuff everyday
good,Hardest part of the job is trying to meet quota on a bad day. A typical day at work is reaching your sales quota and work on other office numbers. Enjoy the people i worked with.
good,JOB DESCRIPTION:
good,"This job can be high stress, starting pay is great for the area does increase with education and experience"
good,"A typical day at work would find the communication assistants sitting in their cubicles at their computers relaying calls for customers. The calls could be of various lengths from 2 seconds to several hours, all according to the will of the callers and the subject matter could be anything under the sun, from births to deaths. The management and co-workers all were dedicated professionals and always stressed the importance to stay invisible on the calls as we were not part of the calls we were just facilitators of easy communications between parties and we were not to edit or offer opinions on any subject or person involved in the call. The hardest part of the job was sitting for long periods of time or staying interested on slow moving conversations. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping individuals communicate to each other and reading a cold script and acting it out over the phone and making the conversation flow smoothly."
good,"I learned many things do not get me wrong on this, but going to war, and then being court martial, and then 3 years later after living in miami and working for at&t, get called in to get deported. Not a good experience, but this made me stronger, and hungry to learn something."
good,"Just not enough management opportunities. Fun place to work, just typical big company that doesn't know what the wireless and wired sides are up to on either end."
good,"very hard company to work for , very poor managent very good pay and benefits but no work/life balance"
good,The typical day at work will involve difficult installs with orders that need to be modified. On the phone with customer service to resolve issues that present themselves out on the field.
good,I steal from prospects all day because I sale products to them and then the programs dont work and they hate what we set up. AT&T has issues with all products and it makes the sales men look bad
good,I was not in sales with AT&T. I worked at a smaller company that AT&T merged with. With that smaller company I did in store customer service. My role at AT&T was very minimal since they don't have in store customer service. I helped the customers adjust to the new AT&T.
good,buena empresa solo que falta apoyo altrabajadro y entre areas para un buen funcionamiento
good,"I have worked for the company for  15 yrs and I have worked in several departments. I have met some wonderful people and made some life long friend. "
good,"Preferentemente solteros para trabajar en ese lugar, ya que su salario base es de $1100.00 a la semana."
good,good job for pretty good money bad schedule unless you have a lot of seniority                              hard to get promotion unless you know someone
good,Good job and learned a lot and I would have stayed If I didn't get surplused.  The job was enjoyable overall other than upper management directives and decisions they made that resulted in job surplus.
good,"AT&T is a fantastic company to work for if you're interested in developing your sales pitch, time management, and prospecting knowledge base. A typical day of work would look like this:"
good,"This experience could have been improved a multitude of ways, but the branch manager was an excellent employee. There was a lot of turnover, in my stay. The pay system could stand to be improved, and very well may have since my leaving. Primarily, second shift hours. No outside sales after dark, during my stint."
good,"There seems to be an acceptance of high employee churn, the call center is run with a very meager budget.  There isn't any focus on employee advancement."
good,"Worked for prime communications for 5 years and would constantly hit goals, but no praise or any form of encouragement. Upper management is a nightmare to work for and would have to fight to get paid drive time for a mandatory monthly meeting 2 hours away from my location"
good,"A typical day of work...I like the flexible hours.  I like the weekends off, but will work them if available. Bonus and Commission is nice as long as you track your sales."
good,"They don’t fully train you on what YOUR going to expect but instead what to expect from the job as a whole which varies depending where your stationed. They receive 100,000 per child that attends from public school & the only people working hard are those in the classroom. People will lie on you if your not liked & most people never want to lend a helping hand and show you the ropes. Nobody wants you to get in a better position then them. Overall this was the worse job I had and my first time I truly felt like nothing but a worker and not respected."
good,"Promotion is far and in-between. Continue to add more to your work load as they cut departments but the pay stays the same. No benefits, no insurance, no raises."
good,I enjoy the work I do and I am able to work alone and figure out how to fix things.  I enjoy the direct tv benefits and being avle to watch sunday ticket
good,"It is a great company with great benefits. The only down fall is they dont plan ahead, and advancement only happens if you are in with the managers, so it's very hard to move up if you just show you are great at your job, and are the right candidate. It is very sad, but hopefully it will get fixed"
good,"Management was very good in Phoenix, AZ. "
good,"Has lots of friendly and helpful employees."
good,"Alot of training tools are available to do most any job within the company, if/when they arise. Could use a more structured management, but every person has their own way of handling things."
good,"The culture is for young, energetic and driven people.  For those that enjoy competition and thrive on stress to meet numbers and sales goals. Not for the weak or sick. The stress will make you sick."
good,"AT&T as a whole is a very good company to work for. It would really depend on the department you were hired into to understand your work life balance. I don’t have any issues with the company, just the constant changes and disregard for work-life balance."
good,"El trabajo es un poco más complejo que otras vacantes del mismo tipo, las prestaciones son buenas, pero hay líneas de negocio con pésima organización."
good,"very high pay and excellent benefits but absolutely no job security at all. no matter how many years or how well you do your job or how much you know you still have absolutely no security and AT&T has no loyalty towards you either."
good,"The job is really stressful, schedules are not really flexible making having any type of home life not a option. Benefits and pay are good. Job also has the perk of being part of the local CWA Union."
good,"Make sure to inquire about the actual role of your position. I was hired as customer support but all they wanted were more sales pitches. When I was there I was rated #3 overall in customer support, however because I didn't meet their sales quota i was let go."
good,"I started at AT&T in 2007, the company has changed so much in the past 12 years. It used to be fun & interesting place to work with many other job opportunities. Now it's much harder to advance. At the call center I am at we are union so our pay is regulated. When I started the company offered a pension I'm not sure if they still do. But they still do offer a 401K option & you do get health care. Although the health care plan is made more for someone who is young with no medical issues & single. For a family it's not so great. And the work load has increases to the point of people getting sick due to the stress of the job."
good,Its not bad but still its whom you know not how much you know. Its the kind of world we live in overall pray and hope for the best sometimes its all a out luck
good,Learned a lot worked a lot had some travels but stayed on over time most of the work year..no sick days management was really good but just no advancement
good,"the benefits and discounts with att are great. however, the monthly goals and disciplines and be VERY stressful. some managers are amazing..some are not. cool coworkers/team mates tho!"
good,"La administrascion es lo unico que deja que desear, de hay en fuera la empresa es muy buena"
good,Always changing groups - some good projects with good manages and resources and some so messed up that resources changed almost daily and did have a clear path
good,"I learned a lot there, but politics will be politics in all work environments. That said, the pay was satisfactory, the training was good and the benefits were great."
good,I worked there for almost 4 years and the employees are great. management comes and goes and usually are very distrusting. Sales goals were extreme it was almost as if you were being set up to fail
good,AT&T has a great culture. What they stand for is amazingly you will find your coworkers pushing you as well. It’s not hard to fit in at all just be driven.
good,Union and seniority based schedules not flexible..they don't work well to find balence between work and family life. Great discounts and benefits. Long work shifts.
good,"Working with ATT was a great opportunity, in my case, at the wrong time.  Unfortunately politics within the company exists on all levels.  If you're a talented political gamer this position is for you.  Training is 10+; you know what you need to do and shown how to do it.  People are going to be people, so that's how it is.  Everything in this company is measured in metrics and there is always something ATT is pushing...a bit TOO hard.  "
good,AT&T has provided a secure career up to this point. My future will be determined if I relocate. I have enjoyed working for AT&T as they have provided educational opportunities and advancement.
good,Helped to prepare me for my career outside AT&T. Pay was amazing compared to where I have been since at AT&T. I would recommend it as a place to start your career.
good,"At&t pays well, has good benefits and the amount of paid time off they provide is excellent.  It is a competitive work environment because they are in a very competitive market.  This means everyone is held to tough performance targets.   The benefits are good.  The main down side is that they are having to downsize due to changes in the business.  This means there is virtually no room for advancement at this time."
good,"money was good, hours are long and hard to reach goals are in place.  i had several managers, so never really got into a set routine with a leader whose expectations were clear."
good,"The subsidiary of AT&T, Cricket is very fast paced and tends to over run their own process and have to back track sometimes. AT&T is sometimes slow and behind the game. However the two combined are good. I worked in Atlanta Ga"
good,"Lots to learn, poor management. It really depends on the department you end up working for. Vertical chain management mentality. No space for defying the status quo."
good,"I really enjoy my co-workers and working on cutting edge programs. However, the company is so large it can be difficult to achieve specific goals laid out by the company."
good,"AT&T is a very generous account to be honest, its just that, most of the company that has AT&T has a very low compensation regardless of the work load they are giving to the agents."
good,"When At&t completes the acquisition of other corporations, there is always a reduction in COR non-exempt employees,   I have personally had my career title and pay eliminated 3 times in my career.  Management encourages you to network with other departments, but there is never the opportunity to actually network for other possible career opportunities.  This is due to the fact that each location has a daily goal and revenue percentage to meet, so if you do want to go to a corporate function you have to do it on your day off or take off the day the function occurs with no quota relief. Typical retail day, is 8 hours on your feet speaking with customers and assisting them with their new purchase."
good,good company to work for at the time poorly managed as far as the premise technician position constant conflict between union and management work was active every day has a different experience great work for those who like technical work and being in a social environment
good,this company provides decent wages as well as benefits. They require lot of hours and is a very competitive work area. They are very good with working with your schedule and understand the pressures of balancing work and home life. The y provide scholarships for their dedicated employees. It is an equal opportunity work area.
good,Call center was stressful due to higher ups lack of management knowhow. Peopke love to have a atress free non mico managed environment that is helpful.
good,"A typical day at work is interesting.  On-the-job learning occurs.  Management is okay.  Workplace culture is okay.  Hardest part of the job is scheduling meetings for participants in multiple, different time zones.  The work is enjoyable."
good,micro managing employees leaves a lot of their employees stressed. A lot of the managers with direct reports are not people persons and have a control ego.
good,"You can learn a lot from this company and can be a great work experience for better jobs. Their sales goal can be so unrealistic, most of the time you will get complaints about issues that has nothing to do with you or are out of your hand like wireless towers, dead zones etc."
good,It's a hit or miss depending on which cycle of reorganization senior management choose that year...or which way the wind is blowing - it's kind of like playing the lottery.
good,"Its all based on commission so you make your paycheck. Good benefits. But to advance is very hard. I have a masters degree, and have been trying for a year and cant even get an interview"
good,"If you are not a full time employee it might not be as great , you dont get any benefits you dont get vacation time you are literally disposable ... not to mention the pay never changes,"
good,"Great job for someone young looking for great pay and benefits. "
good,AT&T is a good place to work and there is a lot of benefits but hard to balance life and work due to the hours and mandatory overtime for business needs.
good,"Great pay and benefits, no work life balance. Lots of discounts on products and services. Management at local level is OK, but managers higher up make decisions without asking the people who actually perform the tasks. Very stressful environment ."
good,"Career was good, at the end, I retired due"
good,"Company has good pay and benefits but will work you to death, no matter the weather, temperature or situation YOU ARE expected to finish installation."
good,"a typical day consist of repeating the phrases ""what city and state please?"" and ""what listing"". searching a national database for listed numbers. the hardest part of the job was the accents and dialect of people from around the country"
good,good place to start out. work life balance is not there but for go getters and people with a lot of time on their hands money can be made. at&t was a great place to work in the past
good,buena empresa con malos lideres tanto gerentes de tienda como de zona
good,"Expect to be micro-managed."
good,"Empresa con mucho personal, en donde no se puede crecer fácilmente sin tener contactos."
good,Does not offer an opportunity for enhancement for those who want to excel in the company.It is not a good work life balance especially if one has a child
good,"The job within itself is great.  Management needs a lot of work. Employees are not kind to one another.  you just have to come in and do your job and go home.  there are some knowledgeable employees who are willing to help, but there are some who are not."
good,The company doesnt know how to treat employees like human beings they only look at you like an asset & thats the biggest problem with AT&T they act on numbers not on realistic situations
good,"I enjoyed working with AT&T but as a contract employee, I cannot honestly say anything positive about working for my contract company.  Need to feel that someone has their hand in your wallet? - work as a contractor."
good,"Being in a 24/7 operations role support model with limited headcount resources, work/life balance can be a real struggle a majority of the time."
good,"constantly changing in the worse way, not paying the front liners and make their job harder and harder each month with less pay, letting go people and then making others complete their work!"
good,"I am and always will be a shark. I was one of the best managers but unfortunately, when your managers are afraid that you will take their jobs and their managers job. They limit how much you can do. As a shark i can recommend it for the money to be made, but i don't recommend it if you're looking to move up the ladder. They're afraid of innovation and new ideas."
good,"When I started the company was very community driven and worked very hard to maintain employees and train them. About 15 years ago, the company continued to lay off work force focusing on people who were in or near retirement. TO get promoted inside of AT&T has become very difficult because AT&T is relying on contractors to replace workers and outsourcing."
good,The work itself was sales mostly and that involved a lot of customer relations which made the day either pass much swifter or become hectic. The environment was also cut throat since our salary depended on sales. The hours were long but I was single and no family so it was fine.
good,"Fast paced work environment. Culture was good. We had fun on most days. Compensation would change quarterly. Once you have max out the current comp plan, they would change it."
good,So I love working here as a 3rd party dealer for solcom but the at&t corporation fights itself so much it is reduculas like if you walk into a store they will talk badly about the door to door reps an refuse to help customers out that are within their own company because they did not make the sale in different and several situations. If the company made comunicatation more company wide and mandatory it would be much better. Also if they made benefits a priority for all their dealers mandatory a lot less people working under them would be doing much better. Underpaying employees threw 3rd party dealers is a problem set a standard.
good,One day they’ll have you focus on one thing and then the next day comes and that one thing didn’t matter because someone had an idea on a conference call that the big boss liked.
good,Alot of drama. $11 an hour I worked 1-10PM monday through friday. Lots of overtime was offered. It was for the Premier department of AT&T’s Business Call center
good,Not very family friendly job. 2 days off per week. Not able to attend most events for family. Anytime taken off has to have a doctors excuse or you will be written up. Your job is contently on the line. You will get fired if you get into a accident in 9 out of 10 cases.
good,"AT&T overall is a good brand that delivers a good product. Benefits are standard compared to other huge global companies. That's why I would say it's a good place to work.  You get all the benefits of a Fortune 10 company.  Downside that I experienced is that your work life depends on how good your boss is.  If you have a great boss it helps you get thru all the pressure & stress of the job / company. If you have a horrible boss (which I had for the last 2 yrs on the job) it's a miserable place to work.  You endure all the stress (as when you have a good boss) but the constant negativity, pressure, demeaning attacks daily most workers ends up breaking.  At that point you just have to leave."
good,"I worked at an authorized retailer, a lot of people are know it alls, rude, drama. I was not comfortable, especially knowing that corporate stores get paid $18 starting for the same amount of work we do."
good,"The work culture was good. We started with the telephony, which was a new to everyone in our division. As a whole, I really enjoyed prizes games, and swag."
good,A typical work day at at&t consist of getting your vehicle prepared for the day before you leave the facility. Making sure your have all the necessary equipment and starting your day. From there you never know how your day is going to go.
good,"Large organization, with a lot of opinions and and conflicting strategies. Upper management will tell you one thing,and your manager will tell you the opposite. "
good,It is a nice place to work but hard to advance. I have worked there for 2 months. I am a hard worker and work all hours and have missed some days for being sick but was declined room to advance with the company when I asked.
good,"This company lays off their employees in a heart beat."
good,Was with the company for 18 years and I was surplus in 2018. Company is going through a lot of changes with the purchase of DTV and the department I worked no longer had the work
good,My ratings does so for me. Great money for those just starting a career path. The hours were demanding this was back in 2013. I'm not sure what it is like in 2017-2018 besides they've cut alot of jobs.
good,"The people I worked with were great. You have to be open to constant change. Their ""sick"" time is a joke, they use a point system instead of giving you sick time off and after you use so many points you get fired. Even if your have weeks of vacation time available."
good,Was a good place to work if you don't mind working Saturdays. Management wasn't great. Job was all about numbers. Some of the environments you are required to work in are nasty
good,"If you are a bargained employee you do get some great benefits. If you work in the field you are expected to meet which is fine but as soon as your workgroup is able to meet them they shift the goals. At&t is a constantly evolving company and at any moment your job could be eliminated due to business needs. "
good,"Constant change to metrics, direction and focus. Either mid year quarterly. Had to spin on a dime for what ever hot button was at that moment. Upper management no understanding of front line day to day needs."
good,Six day work weeks were mandatory for over a year during my tenure at AT&T. Training was great and there was opportunity for advancement. I have family who put in their 30 years with the company so if you want a career then AT&T has good benefits and can be a good place to work if you don't mind long hours in the field that come with a good paycheck.
good,"If you like sales its your kind of job, but if not you will be stressed out because its a sales environment, its a have to sell no if's or but's, good pay"
good,"Buen trabajo en equipo , capacitación constante,"
good,"The Corcorpate culture of doing more with less is what i feel is an over used tactic with this company. Rather than retaining those employees that are most proficient  and know the job, AT&T will always and only do whats in the best interest of the shareholders. The truth is that all of the major Telecom companies operate with similar tactics, and the feeling is the that because of the shear size of their network the customer ultimately has no other real options."
good,"Great benefits and discounts."
good,"I loved my job over the years more and more, however, over the years poor management changed the culture of the business which made it more and more stressful"
good,"I was promoted from within at&t as a RSC which is unheard of, the standard career path is entry level retail sales consultant in a store for a couple years then assistant mgr for 1-2 years then store mgr for 4-5 years and then most employees are so burned out that they either get fired for low performance or quit. I refused to be a puppet and follow that path, I took a P/T position for six months in the National retail dept. then was able to be a shoe in for a fulltime position. I had a great team, district manager and director were all great and help in my career development. Unfortunately our dept was laid off and given severance. Over all a great experience"
good,Frequent firing and change in the management. There is no work culture as different companies have been bought and have been asked to work together without creating proper environment.
good,Management sucks but it pays well and coworkers are great. I would recommend the job to anyone looking for a well paying job but who can take the stress.
good,"Not a bad job for a work-at-home (WAH) position unless you have loud pets such a dog or cat. If you have a stable internet connection and have good customer service skills, highly recommended."
good,always on your feet. managers only care about sales even though we are graded on 27 different metrics which are treated like the flavor of the month/week.
good,General information not a lot to describe or time to describe a typical day at work or what I learned from management and workplace culture including the hardest part of the job
good,"It all depends on which group you get pulled into and if you are able to stay with the good groups.  Some are cut throat with no direction, be careful"
good,"The physical work wasn’t too bad. Yes it is hot some days, and some days it will rain on you. But the managers put too much pressure on the tech and not enough support."
good,"Nothing to share."
good,"While there is definitely money to be made you will absolutely sacrifice pretty much all of your time with your family to make it. The job is challenging which can be rewarding but the metrics can also be unrealistic and management often isn't super supportive likely because upper management isn't well structured either and as the old saying goes ""BS rolls down hill"" You will get excellent benefits however as all the managers are in competition with each other and techs are in competition with each other and other teams the environment is ruthless especially for a woman working the technical side. Especially for a minority. Make sure you ""CYA"" with every aspect of your job. Also you will learn quickly that what you make is honestly a bit of a rip off for the ever growing list of job responsibilities but you won't notice it at first due to the outrageous amount of overtime you accrue."
good,"great company losing many good people due to poor management"
good,"Working for this company has had its ups and downs, the positive part has been the opportunity for travel and the raises you automatically get every six months.  The negatives are dealing with the micromanagement of your corresponding supervisor."
good,tiene buen horario de trabajo y el de comida te dan muy buenas comiciones pero al igual gastas en los cambaceos y gatos de estos .
good,I gained a thorough first hand knowledge of the wireless industry plus the ability to successfully handle customers under stressful circumstances.The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving the praise of customers for helping them.
good,"I enjoyed working here although it was stressful. It becomes very routine and repetitive after a while. They base your attendance on points and everyone i worked with disliked it, it's very unfair and hard to keep up with. You can only have 7 points A YEAR! 8th point equals termination.  All my coworkers got along and were fun, we were like a big happy family."
good,"I am a contractor so I do not get at&t benefits.  However, contractors are treated very well and no differently than employees for the jobs they are contracted to do."
good,"Getting to know the people at the Games. I learned to make it fun for the guest, at the game.management was  great. the crowdes  control was the hardest part was the of the job.the workplaces culture was very high pace lot of walking,"
good,You shouldn't play at work anyway. My point is that AT&T was you to live to work and not work to live. Other than the awful work hours it was a great company.
good,"In my opinion, the most enjoyable part of any job is knowing the team shares the same high level of pride and purpose while performing work of the highest standards with special concern to safety and integrity.  It is a great experience to work in a communal environment where your efforts are not only appreciated, but also rewarded on a daily basis.  The greatest satisfaction is in working together to complete tasks, however challenging, in an efficient and profitable manor.  I also find it even more challenging to be successful in creating such an environment while leading such a team to achieve those goals."
good,"Call Center environment, fast-paced, monitored calls. Great location. Most difficult part of job was the call volume. Paid holidays and excellent benefits."
good,Great company to work for especially if you are willing to relocate to Atlanta or Texas or you want to work in the retail environment. Company is continues to evolve to ensure it remains viable and competitive.
good,Every Person who was good at their job eventually left so their for it left you with people who assumed they knew their job but in all reality they didn't.
good,Stay on your ps and qs at all times.. You never really know when your last day. I was fired over a safety issue i never knew was a issue and the Branch i was working in started running out of work and to many techs.
good,The job was a mess to begin with. No one including managment ever had any idea what was going on from one day to the next. They lost the at&t and directv contract shortly after i stopped working there. They fired a lot of good people because they couldn't keep the contract. very unfortunate.
good,The work is steady and we are all happy with the job.  AT&T is a good place to work however this company does not promote from within.  I am doing the same job here from when I started.
good,"Great Company ""Legacy T"".  A large company focused on Global Networking and Data that has migrated to wireless and consumer driven business."
good,Can go from 0 to 100 in about 3 minutes on the sales floor.  Great people to work for but unrealistic goals that have dramatically decreased commission payments for the same results.  Culture is team work at the retail level but higher leadership only cares about shareholders ans slamming unnecessary products on customers to get the bottom dollar.  Loved the sales reps that worked for me and my direct manager and co-managers in the market.
good,"sales, sales & sales!  A typical day is taking in bound phone calls, resolving customer concerns & sales!  The job is fast pace, changes daily but the compensation is well worth the pace"
good,"Mala, es el peor ambiente laboral en el que e estado"
good,very good company to work for. at the time it was very long hours. I was working 80 to 100 hours work weeks. gained a ton of knowledge about installing and correcting satellite on homes.
good,Typical motivated team members to achieve and exceed sales expectations. Implemented sales techniques for sales conversion along with growth of company products and services.
good,6 Layoffs since 2001. Must be willing to move to larger city to advance. No jobs outside of large metro areas. Used to be a great company to work for.
good,"You learn pretty well as you go along. The compensation is not the greatest, but it will open doors to other opportunities. Lot of patience required with end-users."
good,"I worked in the Directv Loyalty Group. In general I liked the job. Our primary job was to maintain customer relationships and retain customers who were shopping around. At times I felt like the only adult in the call center. The majority of the agents were very young. I also felt some of the ""rules"" were a little over the top but understood the rationale. The hardest art of the job was de-escalating a customer who was screaming and swearing on the other end of the phone or telling a sweet elderly person their account was past due and that was why their service was interrupted or the only way to lower their bill was to change their programming package."
good,The system was not explained .The accounting of sales was bases on brands that they no longer sold so the numbers year to date meant nothing because you can not sell what you do not have.
good,The AT&T company is an awesome company to work for. Management team should keep communication open and honest. The work environment was professional ans stringent. No grace given in regards to tardys.
good,management is 50/50 some are really good and care about there employee development and others do not. senior management needs changing to improve culture.
good,"DIRECTV was recently purchased by AT&T after leaving DIRECTV."
good,"Good people, no advancement unless you are old wireline side."
good,"Lo unico que puedo decir es que apesar de que las comisiones son buenas, el trato hacia el trabajador no es el mas adecuado"
good,"Ive worked many years with this company , given true blood sweat and tears to make every penny ive earned. The most disheartening thing about working for At&t is that they hook line and sinker you in to believing that you can advance into upper MGMT when you truly either have to be the biggest brown noser or have to work more hours than any person in your market to get recognized. After many years of attempting to make this a career, and getting an "" atta boy"" once in a blue moon when you are the only consistent person is quite taxing"
good,"It was amazing the first 6 month in training. After I completed my training, first year it had came with a huge amount of micro-management and meeting sales quotas. They have attempted to bring the moral up a little however it was hard when you were worried about the hardest part of your job, meeting sales quotas"
good,"abrir el punto de venta colocar los celulares en el aparador"
good,"I managed the call center for AT&T in Miami, Fl. Pay at ATT is great but it does come at a price of high levels of stress. ATT does not have an actual customer service dept. instead it is a sales group that uses your questions or concerns on your bill to upsell you on more products or bundles. Starting pay and bonus are excellent and you can achieve a very high salary. Unfortunately management is instructed to weed out anyone that isn't extremely productive. This involves yelling profanities and belittling you on the sales floor to make you quit!  I saw 1 to 2 ambulance daily to handle stressed induced breakdowns or heart attacks.  Enough said."
good,"Subject Matter Expert for implementation, issue resolution, all IT National Retail Programs/Projects"
good,"Very laid back environment. Your pay is based on your performance as a sells representative. Easy job if you're good with sales. Cellular world has been bought out by Gamestop, or Spring Mobile. Spring mobile has cut down wages tremendously."
good,"can set your own schedule "
good,Manged my time to be out in the field face to face with customers half the day and the other half of the day dealing with administrative work such as clients proposals and contracts.
good,"I arrive at work about 6am. Have a meeting with management and Ericsson Team ( Tier 1). Login to my computer. Look to see if there are any major issues within the network. I'm more of a team leader, driving key issues. Nothing about the job was hard , just a little challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping other fellow co-workers tackling issues."
good,He estado viviendo los cambios de AT&T desde que era Nextel anteriormente y los que están realizando no los están haciendo adecuadamente porque considero que deben de eliminar viejas prácticas y proponer nuevos esquemas laborales. Le falta mucho desarrollo y planeación. La empresa estará estabilizada por lo menos en 5 años.
good,"Applied most of the statistical techniques using SAS from graduate courses, however, I learned SQL, TERADATA , TABLEAU but my Senior Management was inpact focusing mainly on timelines at the expense of quality and innovation"
good,"Management cares about their numbers, not the tech.  The techs are trying to do the job right for the customer but may complete the job beyond AT&Ts cookie cutter time frame, thus getting slammed by their boss as being inefficient and killing the teams numbers.  The customer may be very happy with the tech, but the tech is in trouble for spending too much time getting it right."
good,The Company is too focused on numbers instead of its customers and its employees.  Customers are getting less attention because of time constraints placed on every technician or customer service representative that come in contact with.
good,"ATT as a whole is an awesome place to work. If you are seeking to gain knowledge on the technical side of things, this is a great place to begin."
good,I learned the value of working  in/with a team. I learned Advanced technical knowledge of telecommunication and networking systems and exceptional customer service skills. I worked in a fast paced and ever changing environment where processes changed daily or hourly depending on the current project or assignment.
good,"Day to day duties included all requirements to ensure National Retailers and AT&T were in a successful relationship of sales.  Work duties included building daily, monthly and yearly sales action plans for retailers.  Duties also included all training of AT&T products and services to sales associates and implement strategies to motivate sales."
good,"Good pay and good benefits, no much in the way of growing your career unless moving across the country and that is not an option unless pay outweighs family locally."
good,"	Positioning and expansion of the company in the commercial sphere. "
good,"no work life balance at all you live sleep and eat att, not good for single mothers or people with younger children. Sales are the biggest factor here if you cant sale its not the job for you"
good,You go into work log in to your computer and the supervisor will tell you what champagne your on and your outbound calling DirecTV customers to upgrade there programming packages. Giving customers promotions to up grade the consumer.
good,enjoyed talking to customers all day and servicing them while they were shopping. also providing very good deals from direct tv.
good,AT&T has a good atmosphere to learn about sales and a good way to learn how to interact with customers. They have some intense trainings that eventually will teach you the way they want things to be done.
good,Good pay and good benefits.  More emphasis is needed in work life balance.  Some tend to work during their vacation.  Workload can be challenging to balance.
good,As a worker for Direct TV the job was great it was just long hours. We worked in retails like sams and bj whole sales we had to help there customers on top of are own
good,"Great money bad management, you are pushed to your breaking point everyday and never rewarded for your efforts yet you are punished for things out of your control, targets are way to high which make your day to day very stressful and your job is not promised if your manager doesn't like you."
good,salary is very competitive with a great hourly pay. commission structure was great and seems to be less every year. very high stress level environment.
good,"El ambiente es acogedor, son días dinámicos "
good,The management at the Metairie Location needs a lot of training.  They are messy and instead of helping agents progress in their work life they entertain mess in the agents personal life and help spread the gossip.
good,It is the hardest job in the company dealing with customers directly high stress with high reward on your paycheck.  Always have rumors of office closures due to jobs are being outsourced out of the country
good,Get to meet and work with great people daily. I learned a ton about customer service and sales. Management is great. The hardest part is not knowing you schedule with more than 3 days notice. The most enjoyable part is learning great things and management.
good,"Awesome team of people to work with. Great social environment, not enough staffing, as required. No benefits or paid holidays."
good,"AT&T has been on the decline as a place to work since SBC bought AT&T and incorporated AT&T policies.  Their plan is the cut pay, reduce workers and their benefits, and outsource."
good,MaBell was great to work for until it got broken down due to being a monopoly.  AT&T Long distance started outsourcing jobs in mid 90s that is when morale were at its lowest.
good,AT&T Mobility is a very good company to work for and develop great leadership skills. I'm happy to have been apart a great organization.
good,"This company had its ups and downs. The benefits were absolutley great, it was one of the best thing about working there. The pay was GREAT considering what we really did."
good,"Overall a great experience. Though lacking in benefits, and a very very competitive environment, I enjoyed and am grateful for the knowledge I gained."
good,As a manager long stressful hours. Better ways to get to know your employees. Teamwork is key to a successful business.Upper management looking for ways to discredit my work was the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part was when team successfully achieved No.1 rating in our call center. Being awarded for job well done.
good,"Its a wonderful job, new places  and terrific people. A vast new knowledge of technology and telecommunication. The daily task of installing, repairing and educating cx TV, internet and phone service. You'll indulge  in rich friendships from both coworkers and customers. The thrill of new and exciting areas and homes are to die for culture, fashion, art etc.. the down side is management was the biggest they don't really work with the techs, they took allot of power away from the tech to give other departments that crashed or didn't know how to use the programs."
good,"A typical day at work was troubleshooting or installing new equipment for various customers while a technician was onsite. I worked in the ITAC department at the time. Learned a lot from routes, to equipment configs, cidr notation, using Linux, etc. Management just depended on what manager you got. There were some good ones who would help you with issues or let you know what is going on. n the other hand you had some that would brush you off or tell you to go talk to someone else. Co-workers for the most part bonded together and tried to teach you anything you didn't know. Everyone had their wikis or knowledge base, most knowledge was shared. The hardest part of the day was getting everything installed, we had a lot of installs per day at that time. The most enjoyable part of the day was finishing an install."
good,Working with AT&T can have its amazing moments and can be generous when it comes to its commissions but if you get stuck with that bad apple at your location or if the location is slow then your experience of AT&T can drastically decline.
good,"Build long lasting relationships"
good,"I love working with people and constantly being on the go.  However, I found that because my position was not covered by the union fully and the particular manager I had, my job was more so overwhelming than any other job I had ever had.  The work load was always 10+ hours a day.  You will never see the light of a weekend again.  And consistency isn't a word that exist anymore.  "
good,worked varies ten hour work weeks. Was a team leader for 12 agents. Did weekly one on one meetings with each agent and listened to at least one call on every agent a week. Held weekly team meetings to go over team performance and graded a call as a team and discussed the call afterwards. Since i was not at my 5 year mark i was let go as an emploee of Directv.
good,"I've been with AT&T for over 16 years. The one thing about this company is that it is always changing. "
good,The job is very demanding physically but outside of working in the elements of summer and being in a attic or winter under a house for hours at a time its a fulfilling job for someone who takes pride in a job well done. You usually work solo but the big draw back is trying to reach unattainable goals because leadership is allowed to manipulate production goal quotas for bonuses and passed the burden/deficiencies  responsibility to the technicians. Speaking up only resulted in job loss or added pressure to make on quit.
good,The hardest part of the job was never knowing who was going to be on the other end of the phone when a call came through. Sometimes you had genuinely sweet people other times you get overly IRATE customers who do not care what you tell them.
good,Was a very exciting happy place to work until it came to balancing life. Family emergency could help loose your job due to the strict availability policy.
good,"Good place to work, Great work culture, Good people."
good,"It is a wonderfully compensating company to work for, but there are always it's drawbacks. "
good,Overall I enjoyed working at AT&T.  The only thing I have that could be perceived as negative are all the changes that were in the process of being made.  A lot of good sales people were forced out because they made to much money or had been with the company to long.  And the management they hire are completely incompetent.
good,The typical day includes non stop interaction with clients requesting advice and counsel to resolve a wide range of issues.
good,"Even though AT&T is a known company name, working with an Authorized Retail has its downside. I was only given 3 days of training and was expected to excel with no proper training. Even though my coworkers were great, it was not enough. Management didn't seem to be helpful and training was a laughing matter."
good,"answering calls from customers who had technical issues"
good,The company specializes in lease administration for cell carriers Its great job for Administration not so good for sales. Not much job security.
good,"Typical day in coming calls billing question or tech/issue with equipment unable receive calls or make , data connection or txt msg....having device issue they on phone no other way call to assist ....working with employees working & encouraging each other"
good,"My typical day consisted of call center life. Answering inbound iphone calls and assisting customers with technical issues, network, issues, bills, and retention. The hardest part of the job was having people curse me out for something that is uncontrollable, but it taught me how to deal with irrate people and how to calm them down."
good,"Great in terms of job security and development. Though ascending to higher levels of management can be a tricky process, opportunities exist. Proper work life balance is difficult to achieve."
good,Recognition of employees and mild stressful environment.  Management and employee relationship was low.
good,Taking inbound calls for the phone company.I already had a background in customer service so this job just allowed me to add to those skills.I really enjoyed dealing with the public.
good,"The pay is horrible for the amount of work that you are suppose to do on a call, the benefits are great, and I would only recommend the job to someone that is needing a job desperately because the job consistently changes. And it drives everyone crazy. Really hard for anyone to advance anywhere with in that call center"
good,This job was very helpful in learning to multitask. There were three chats at one time and there was a small time frame when it cam to responding to the customer. I learned a lot about phones and plans and to really listen to what people are saying.
good,"AT&T has great benefits, but moving on to a better job and opportunity is limited.  Not based on merit but based on who you know!"
good,"The hours are very long, management is too young and inexperienced with how to work with other people."
good,Great company however depends what department you are working in also depends on management team as well.  Can say my co workers were great however upper management was youthful in thoughts and action thus demonstrating a impatience attitude when it comes to sales.  Would recommend if you don't like sales this is not the company cause quotas have to be hit or you will be fired.
good,"Account Manager/ Sales representative. Responsible for direct sales of DirecTV service to Costco Wholesale members. Focus is primarily new customer acquisitions as well as customer service."
good,"A typical work day"
good,"I worked in the Customer Retention Dept. Once your there, there is no turning back! Your at the highest level of customer support until you apply for management or something. You get stress from the customers, then stress from the company on there constant changing environment. Sometimes its not in your favor as employee. However, this job does pay well."
good,"Company (Particular my team) is operated differently in AT&T. As we serve 24x7, there is unbalanced life due to shifts. Also US company follows US calender for holidays so there are very less holidays you get in India. There is totally black box which processes promotions & ratings, Employees are not aware of the process at all. Medical Insurance & Other benefits are also not up to mark related to other MNCs in Bangalore."
good,"Directv was a very high volume call center with expectations to meet every month. Training was outstanding  but need  some improvements .  Co workers kept each other in Good moods, The hardest part of the job would be when systems went down and not able to assist customers."
good,ATT is a great company to work for. Things have changed over the years.
good,"Great pay"
good,"I've learned a lot about conducting B2B as my current location"
good,"I give my best on a daily basis and feel as if my efforts are for not, however I am not deterred by the different decisions made by upper management that are not for the good of the customer."
good,"A call center environment is hard to work for.  It takes a special person to be able to do everything that is required.  It's a special balance and losing on certain ends one day and making it up the next.  The management is the hardest to deal with they know the balance and then accuse people of not doing their job, but then they does not show you how to balance; it's due to the fact that its cheaper for the company to turn over, then offer the benefits for long periods of times."
good,ok company to work for they just believe that the needs of the business is more important than your life in general
good,"I would start my day off with a meeting with my team and find out my city and store I would be working out of. I learned everything to know about Directv products, programming, and promotions. My co-workers keep you motivated. The hardest part was to be alone in a different city. I loved to deal with the people in the Wal-marts, Sams Club, and Best Buys throughout Georgia and Florida."
good,loved Att would not ever go back to a authorized retailer again .. no structure and no leaders.
good,"el dia tipico de trabajo era ir hasta la empresa o directamente al punto de encuentro , podia ser en el local que habia en ezpeleta o sino en diversos puntos de almirante brown , de ahi en mas era todo muy normal , la direccion era buena , pero llego un punto en que no pagaban a tiempo y empezaban a echar a empleados sin razon alguna yo me senti usado que me decian que tenia que ir de un lado al otro y sin ningun aumento o algun tipo de biatico o ayuda alguna , la parte mas dificil del trabajo era cuando venian las quejas de los clientes que estaban mal entendidos y nos amenazaban o hacian intentos de juicios hacia la empresa o hacia el grupo de vendedores , lo que mas me gusto del trabajo fue que gracias a ello conoci una buena forma de trabajo , como levantar una venta que estaba estancada , muchas lecciones para la vida cotidiana y un grupo humano que solo buscaba dar buenos consejos y opiniones laborales , pero por culpa de varios tratos de la gerencia renunciamos varios empleados porque nos sentiamos usados"
good,"•	Sale Consultant/ Small Business Specialist "
good,good pay but extremely demanding. contract ended... very good overall
good,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with your supervisor who is stressing everyone about how much products being sold at any given time. Of course that's what a manager does but in the process, a professional supervisor wont make more than one person on the team feel like your speaking to your child. Also, attendance.. I never had a problem with attendance, but when others around me had trouble there was no understanding by management. The guy went to the hospital and had a serious issue with emergency paperwork and all.. They still wrote him up and said it will be in his file for a year... also preventing him from looking into other areas of the company."
good,"Long hours, rules & regulations are always changing, management can really be a bully. They dont tell you about the long hours & no benefits. They go by seniority and part-timers have none basically you will be closing ever night!"
good,"8am until whenever they feel like releasing you. "
good,"We received our work assignments via conference call ( boss' office in Arlington,TX).  After getting ice & water, we proceeded to our most pressing job order.  You mainly worked solo, but could call other techs on crew to help with end to end testing."
good,"Normal day would break down as follows ... "
good,AT&T is a good company to work for but very demanding. Benefits are great but there is no life outside of AT&T because you are there so much.
good,"•	Assist customers with their billing issues"
good,"This was a 1 year temporary position due to 3 people waiting to retire.  The personnel on the team did not retire and so the 3 personnel did not stay on as full time.  I left early to take a full time permanent position.  The other 2 had to find work elsewhere.  Benefits did not start until after 90 days.  No leave until a full year of being there.  AT&T provided all the training, tools, transportation and shirts.  The manager was friendly and easy going.  The other AT&T team was great to work with.  Strenous job outside in the sun all day.  Overall I would have stayed but it was a temporary position."
good,Everything was good until management changed then it went downhill from there. Broken promises delayed pay and false hopes.
good,They helped to pay for my college education which was an added bonus. Good company
good,"At&t is an amazing company to work for, but they are very short staffed in certain locations. Being short staffed leaves the current employees very poor work/life balance. We sometimes work 6 day weeks and 10 hour shifts with only a 45 min lunch. My current shifts are 10AM-830PM with one 45 min lunch break in the middle. I usually do not get out of work until around 920PM. Once again I love this company, but being short staffed doesn't even allow me to take the vacation time I have earned. The hardest part of the job is to deal with upset people all day long. "
good,definately a learning experience for sure. you will talk to people all over the world in this position and resolve many issues for them.
good,AT&T turnovers in employment as a company should be reviewed.
good,"AT&T is a GREAT company overall. Great pay, ok benefits, management needs to be restructured. There is no consideration for those employees with small children or personal obligations outstide of work."
good,"a typical day at work is dealing with customer issues and selling them wireline and wireless as also selling them other products.What i learn is how to deal with customers on a professional level.My co workers we work as a team,we help each other when i in need to complete sales.The most enjoyable about this job is meeting diffrent people."
good,"Working with customers directly, handling all issues for Internet Protocals, digital fiber optic television, and Voice over IP telephone service as well as training co-workers in the field. The hardest part of the job was really just in the initial phases of the career, grasping the concepts. Once you have obtained the appropriated knowledge in this field, the most enjoyable part is satisfying the customer!"
good,"Over see direct reports and overall operations Direct communications vendors, suppliers and Director of operations."
good,"fue una experiencia donde aprendi mucho de mis compañeros y de mis jefes,me gustaba tratar con clientes dificiles y convencerlos de contratar nuestro servicio."
good,In the uverse dept of the company they treat you like they own you. Take that however you want.
good,"Good experience working with AT & T , with highly professional individuals."
good,I remember i basically just was on the phone and really didnt take my lunch often was just ready to complete my job duties and leave. This position was bad very easy pprovide the clients with the correct information to retrieve their w2's for filling there taxes. I really didnt communicate with co-workes because majority of the calls was on a dailer so they came in constantly. There wasnt a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable day of the job was when my shift ended.
good,"I enjoy very much working with the public and get along very well with people, so this job was easy for me to learn. The hourly pay is horrible, however if your just at this job for the hourly then don't even apply! The commission is where your real check comes from and if you meet your quota then you know this job is for you. By saying that I mean that customers like you, they refer people to you all the time and will continually buy from you only! In all the years of working there I only missed my quota 1 time and I think we all did because that was when the economy really started hurting..."
good,"This was a good job overall, i spent almost 6yrs there. the management was not that great , they were never on the same page. the best part was working with customers face to face."
good,Very poor communication between departments creates very inhospitable working environments. Lots of waste and very little ability to be innovative. Rigid and antiquated policies and computer systems that just seem to get worse as the communication breaks down with outsourced talent that is disconnected from the group.
good,I work as a customer assistant the schedules are based off seniority so if you have young kids at home this may not be your ideal job because you will work late nights and rarely get a weekend off starting out. The pay is good though
good,"Typical day is helping customers with all their cell phone needs. Account information, learning the equipment, educating customers on new devices and features, and meeting sales quotas. Upselling everything is what management likes to see. You learn a lot about cell phones! Everyone will be asking you questions every time they have a glitch in their phone, your friends, family, strangers, etc. Management seems to change a lot and they are very forceful about the corporate law. Co-workers are decent. The hardest part of the job is just staying on top of every new device that comes your way and knowing everything about it, and past equipment, and meeting grueling quotas that rise every month. Pay is adequite for the work you do, and benefits are decent. The most enjoyable part of the day is helping others."
good,"Back when I started with Southwestern Bell and came here from Oklahoma to Southern Bell the job payed well and the future was bright. As time and technology progressed, landline phone service started plunging. Technology, including telephone service and computer service started becoming more wireless. By the time A.T.& T. bought out the company jobs were going south. Hiring stoped and jobs were dissapearing through layoffs and attrition. I have very few friends still with the company and their future is not looking good with the company, according to them. They say I got out just in time. I wanted to start my second career in something that will always be here and wheere I can be of true service to my fellow human beings. That is why I chose the health field."
good,"For such easy work, the environment at Converges was extremely uncomfortable. Every aspect of my job felt like participating in a ""Favorites Game"", and even my best accomplishments were ignored."
good,Structured enviroment with room for growth..Typical work day is 8 to 5 mon-fri.
good,Worked and managed cross functional departments to bring new product sets to fruition.
good,"The job consist of greeting, establishing rapport, asking questions and providing solutions for customers. Building a sale and educating the customer on what they have bought. Great Job, you never get bored. You must be the kind of person who wants to dedicate their time in the working field. The hours are not conducive for family life and they are long, you must be able to stand on your feet for 8 to 14 hrs a day with 30 mins. for lunch and most of the time their were no breaks. I worked for the company for 13 years."
good,"I would arrive at 8:20am. I would then log in and check to see what had to be done by the end of the day. Have a short chat with co-workers and then start working. I would email or call my counterparts if any issues needed to be resolved or would check to see if they had resolved issues I had made them aware of. I usually take a late lunch-usually at 1:30. After lunch I'd continue working on what had to be done and before you knew it, it would be time to go home,"
good,-Good firm but I don't find anything great for myself in coming years.
good,You make your own money. Company is sold to another company and things are vague.
good,AT&T is a very fun and competitive job to have but it also has a high turnover because of the exceptions of the position. This company also has a problem showing loyalty to it's employee's. they will terminate you no matter how hard of a worker you are or how dependable you are.
good,"AT&T is a pretty good company to work for. Your job role is clearly defined and you have plenty of opportunity to excel. The peer group is very diverse but upper management is a little inexperienced. Overall, I would recommend anyone thinking about AT&T as a potential career move as a place they would like."
good,AT&T Mobility is a great place to work. I enjoy what I do. I however do not enjoy the work/life balance and the retail hours.
good,"At&t company helped me grow as a customer service representative, working with customers helping them to resolve issues, with a computer systems being friendly users."
good,"Looking to get out of the wireless business, At&t is not a company I would like to work for anymore"
good,"Overall, my years with this company were very productive financially and fun/friendly atmosphere with co-workers. AT&T is a great company to work; however, it is also a company that claims to promote from within but hardly do so. Was told I would be in management within two years, I stayed a little over six years and it never happened even though I tried and tried. Kept asking what I was doing wrong so I could improve if need be, was always told I was doing everything good, that it just wasn't the right timing for me."
good,"Great compensation and benefits, but lack of consistent scheduling and inflexibility of management makes little time for family life.  Would recommend for young people, but not for those looking to advance rapidly."
good,Unfortunately my store lacked better management. Caused a whole team to walk out. Nothing wrong with the team that stood behind my manager. They needed someone to be in that position so they chose loosely.
good,"Directv was a very fun place to work at for many years...up until the merger with AT&T. Once the merger was completed, we began to see very clear signs that management wanted to outsource many of our jobs. That, along with the idea of impending layoffs, took a toll on many employees and contractors."
good,"Management support is excellent depending on which team you are on."
good,Union versus management environment should say it all. Regular paycheck . pressure packed environment with people cheating by working thru their lunch and breaks to have better efficiency and productivity numbers
good,"Fast pace environment. Helping customer with new services, upgrades, and there current devices . Att was a well rounded company and offered every product a customer would need in home and mobile."
good,"The good and the bad. What stands out about working at this company? Review the content above, the company and the questions asked should give you a clear ideal  above my exp."
good,"The workplace was underground and uninviting for work or progression. Management was great for the most part, maybe don't have people strictly follow scripts and allow them to talk to the end user like a human being."
good,"Overall working in At&t is great, but there are often company restructure happened that may cause your career unsecure."
good,"This is a good company to work for. They have great benefits.  It can be a fun environment to work in. They provide quiet rooms,  and a gym. You are watched and recorded at all times."
good,Overtime is great in the summer. Every winter upper management doesn't hide the fact they want to get rid of you. Constantly trying to cut hours even though union bargaining doesn't allow it. Constant feeling of dread concerning your job. Goals change day to day because someone somewhere who's completely delusional wants to augment their bottom line.
good,Essentially a strong company with good pay and benefits but poorly managed. The immediate management team received extreme pressure from upper management and in turn that pressure was transferred to all employees.
good,Great job in areas that required or desired the service. Not so good in rural areas with less than adequate service. Good company but loosing ground in the industry do to focus on cellular service as opposed to the TV programing.
good,"Rolling layoffs have really created a rough environment. You can notice people at all levels are very stressed trying to do more and more with less.The best part about working for AT&T are the employees. Everyone is truly dedicated to the customer! Job advancement and the ability to move around used to be easier, but with recent cuts- it has made it difficult."
good,Overly saturated now. Managers are ok can't seem to get a promotion . Been with company probably too long at this point. I stayed because the money & benefits were pretty good.
good,Great place to work however the management team can ruin it. Customers just need that understanding person and then they'll buy once they feel safe...
good,"Typical day you're helping customers and trying to sell them new products or services. Good customer service doesn't matter just sales or bad interactions."
good,Application retirement  and security compliance items are part of my daily routine.  I enjoy programming new features and those are not being introduced in the old DIRECTV stack.
good,"Overall, AT&T Prime Communications is appreciated but when it came to advancing an internal employee with more qualifications, they failed. I personally, for years was asked to run and operate stores with the pay of a sales associate, goals of a manager, and high turnover staff. I was left alone, sometimes 12 hours or more to run a store with no real lunch break, unreliable employees, and zero thought for what I was bringing to the company."
good,"Siempre fue buena la comunicación con los compañeros, trabajamos bien en equipo el problema eran los planes mal elaborados por nuestros supervisores."
good,hard to advance your career and there are a lot of politic in the company. Even as a top rep it has been impossible to get promoted but people say because of pay and benefits.
good,"great place to work, but of late lots of outsourcing. work life balance is good. find innovation groups to work in for latest cutting edge work and experience."
good,"It great to have Leaderships that are supportive of their employees, some jobs has a good work/life balance, the company need to value the hard working employees"
good,"This is a good job to work and pays very well if you push hard. It will effect your work / life balance.You can more than double your salary if you push hard. "
good,"pay people more , hire people you can understand.  Most days were boring because I would talk to the client and order their items instead of being at the business."
good,"Fast Pace enviroment. Business class is very stressful because not only is the volume of calls are extreme, the customer are very entitled, demanding and rude."
good,"Except for some management personnel, I overall liked working at ATT, They have great benefits and the pay is good.  I would recommend the Job and have recommended the job to several young people."
good,AT&T is a great place to get the skills and training to become an expert in your field. They have a great wealth of resources to aid in development and have cutting edge technology and a vision to connect everyone everywhere and do it better than anyone else.
good,"You will have plenty of work and fairly well paid for your time, however you will not have time to go do anything with the money you make as your working for a ""Utility"" and the laws apply differently towards this industry."
good,"Good compensation, stressful work environment, lacks support of current information and staying with current policies.. Attendance policies are guarded and not shared"
good,"not stable for a family, must relocate to stay with the company, small pay raises, trucks may be older than you, closing many places of work, selling many buildings"
good,I have had an overall good experience working with the company. The job has allowed me to provide a good life for my family. I have enjoyed most of my time here.
good,"The best parts of working for AT&T, in my opinion, were my fellow techs and my managers, a feeling of accomplishment when I was able to get a customer's device working correctly again, and the company culture. The worst parts were the constant shift bids, the divide between management and the union, and the drive towards resolving calls as fast as possible over true customer service."
good,"The job itself was fine. Normal retail sales position. Help customers who walk in, and take phone calls. Do your shift duties and go home. Low pay and management were the problems."
good,a huge company with many moving parts. its hard to get anything done or approved. Nothing much going on in Austin but if you move then you can have a long career if you done then don't get fired.
good,Ensuring the experience of the customer is the goal everyday at At&t which can sometimes be difficult. It is challenging work but I enjoy taking the time and effort to install/repair their service to the best of my abilities following all guidelines and processes.
good,Good place to get your money up but management can be messy. If your looking to advance fast there are opportunities but things change a lot so be great at what you do
good,"Se enfocan en el cliente, el servicio al cliente es lo primero y mejor de la compañia,"
good,"Despite a demanding daily call volume, it was a very decent job with good pay and excellent benefits, The training was intensive and lasted three months, but the instructors were helpful and knowledgeable. If you're a hard-worker, this job is for you. You change managers every three to six months, which is a little inconvenient. The most enjoyable parts of the job were the independence of your duties and talking to a variety of customers."
good,There is no job security.  This organization has had persistent and continuing layoffs for the last two and half years.  They are currently off shoring American jobs.
good,"Aside from not having a set time to clock out, the job was enjoyable. There was many times we lacked the equipment needed, or the equipment had hardware/software issues. Some systems the company used would often stop working altogether. The only real major issue I had with the company was being forced to move shops and their ability to relocate their employees without the employees having any say so."
good,"Learn how to be indifferent and to not take ""No"" so personal. Know the product of what you're selling and be able to answer the right questions. Being s sales representative takes a lot or confidence in self too."
good,Overall experience was good because I met some really great people. I feel the company is going in the wrong direction now and their focus is not on thriving as a company but recouping money loss from buying so many other companies.
good,"When you're a new employee, your work schedule is prioritized over your personal life. I found it very difficult to spend time with my family because I was forced to work on days where i wasn't available."
good,Its loud in the building. The schudule changes every 6 months. There are good managers and bad at least when I was there that's most places. If the schedule and sick time was different it would be the perfect job.
good,Att make cuts when ever they see fit that creates a negative impact in people's lives unfortunately  who ever in upper management probably only considers him making money and they don't mind screwing some families apart
good,This organization prides itself on moving forward however the business processes are antiquated and slow fast moving development and progress. Internal department infighting is also common. For that they do a good job helping people be successful and progress through their job
good,"AT&T was a great company to work for, for many years. I owe them a lot of my life and career. However, as time marched on and Until they started it became obvious that my career was going no further due to corporate decisions being made.  Namely, have to be in the right location with the right characteristics. Not necessarily skillsets."
good,"Not a lot of room for advancement as all the great jobs are very tenured people; expect twenty years to advance. Good experience to have! Good pay. Good Benefits. I got a new manager which put unnecessary stress and focus on our all new crew. Under normal circumstances, it would have been better. I learned a lot, which started my career in the IT world. AT&T looks really good on a resume!"
good,"Used to be a great company to work for while it was still Directv, not so much anymore. They got rid of their actual hardware engineering groups and instead focused their energy on a failing streaming model that still has not had any success."
good,Most positions aren't secure. It's difficult to retire as the business continues to change and downsize. If you're in a good long term spot then the pay and benefits are very good.
good,I worked there for 13 year and thought it would be my forever job but life and business do not mix sometimes. It broke my heart to leave the job and people I worked with.
good,I was not an AT&T employee.  I was a contractor on 3 different engagements.  The people are smart and hard working.  Some engagements were satisfying.  Some were highly competitive.
good,company went through a buy out and restructured and outsourced many jobs and departments.  as a result many people lost their jobs.  not many opportunities internal for wok so had to look outside the company.
good,I enjoyed working there but it works good only with Permanent employees get all the perks. I enjoyed working from office and being traveling from Rochester to around 30 sites.
good,Retail Based so working holidays and weekends is a must.  Can be a great opportunity for income and advancement.  People with families will find the work life balance to be a challenge.
good,Each environment is either poor or great based on the comradeship and team mentality of the individual crew. There's definitely a strong focus on safety and this is key.
good,Worked 18 years and company restructure created surplus conditions so with older tenure employees were let go with severance package and att retail store may be in a down sizeing period at this time and will continue to stream line in my opinion over the next few years job growth may be slow at this time and movement in promotions may also slow at this time until restructureing is complete. Overall I enjoyed the challenges with my carrier and would return if a opportunity arises for myself
good,THis was just a typical call center job.. Answered phones provided customer service took payments did pay per views answered questions and provided excellent customer service
good,Customer service calls and billing. they always had overtime available and lots of incentive. the hardest part of this job was the irate customers calling about billing issue
good,"My work life time span with ATT was long but unfortunately I was just recently surplus.  (Laid-off). After almost 26 years."
good,the problem is the culture that UPPER management fosters with unrealistic sales goals and turning a blind eye to the people cheating to make the numbers (like Wells Fargo). Because of lack of hiring people with 20+ yrs of service were still working the closing shifts and Saturdays.The pay is what kept people there.
good,Excellent benefits and good company to work for paid vacation time. Stock options and education repayment plan. Convenient location and safe environment
good,I came on as an intern and was not privy to all the benefits and promotions that AT&T had to offer but truly I felt it was a great opportunity and learning experience.
good,"El clima laboral es muy agradable, con una gran calidad humana. A veces se dificulta el crecimiento, pero siempre todos están dispuestos a ayudar."
good,"I climb poles, run wires through houses, lift heavy objects and work in all weather conditions. we work over 8 hours a day, 5 to 6 days a week. we are also the face of the company so we have to have good customer service skills."
good,Very Competitive and Sales goals are the main focus. However the pay is good and the benefits are good.The miss comes when they have employee focus on escalations and still expect Goals to be met with much less time available.
good,"Nice entry level job. Employee perks such as discounts, tuition reimbursement, discounted products and services. Job flexibility is pretty great. the point system/attendance is pretty strict."
good,Company has great pay and benefits.  Lots of opportunity for learning new technical skills. Hardest part of job are frequent re-orgs and layoffs.  Overall great company to work for.
good,This was a temp job.  This was a fast pace environment with much overtime. The management was nice and the work schedule was good.  I learn a lot of things about customer service by working here
good,"As with all large corporations, if you have an effective management chain your career will be fine, if you have ineffective management you will have a hard time."
good,No! Perhaps this just was not the job for me. I worked on the DSL platform. Training was short and the customers were all technologically challenged. This was not the job for me.
good,"Jobs are demanding "
good,"Long hours and tough work outside. Overall the actual field work wasn't the worst of it. It was generally corporate policy and inefficient automated call center programs and dispatching programs, plus under trained or outsourced live agents that made the job more difficult in the end."
good,"I hope to get hired to show the potential I can bring to the team without the interference of any merger and acquisition. At the end, everything starts and ends with the customer. My hope is to bring value to the team and to the customer."
good,There is no work life balance.  Remote eimployment to them means available all the time.  Company has good benefits but the senior leadership only looks at the employees as number and not people.
good,"Its an okay job, but not for long term, unless you have a ""friend"" in high places. Be punctual and make them calls for sales. Be professional at all times. Stay away from gossip, make sure you treat each customer individually. Know your technology. DO NOT come to work hung-over and then proceed to tell the world of what you did the night before. Be humble."
good,Generally a good place to work. Pay is good. Benefits are okay - used to be better but seems like that is most places now. Work hours are starting to be more flexible.
good,it was an alright company to work for...management needs a bit more personable conducive for raising a family...especially when you had to work on the holidays
good,Working at AT&T was an opportunity to work with amazing engineers.  This was a chance to use many of the skills I've gained in my experience as an RF Engineer.
good,"REC Silicon, a Norwegian company, sees Moses Lake at the center of a high-tech manufacturing revolution. But that vision is likely dead unless Washington and Beijing can settle their differences on trade."
good,"ATT is great but bad at the same time. just make sure you have time to spend away from home in some times. Just understand its a business. The managers will treat like you are replaceable, and you are, but the upside is if you show that you have the right skills then you will be harder to replace and longer to train if you were let go."
good,Competitive wages. Good work atmosphere. Plenty of work to do during the day. Location was good. Benefits were good. training was in depth and helped you be knowledgeable
good,"AT&T has always allowed me to work with exceptional, professional, technically sound engineers 90% of the time I was with AT&T.  Management, I have to say, was very good at addressing issues and going to 'bat' for me when client issues surfaced.  Overall, I have had a good career with AT&T."
good,"great company to work for.  Great compensation, benefits, and leadership. goals are clear and incentives are fair.  like most organizations, it is extremely political. once in management, read books: The first 90 days, 21 Laws Irrefutable Laws of Leadership, how to win friends an influence, people."
good,"drove company work vehicles to biz and residential customers, install and troubleshoot telecommunications services (copper, fiber, satellite). climbed utlity poles, crawled under homes and in attics"
good,"AT&T can be a great place to work. Has provided me a nice life. Working in some departments are fun, at times stressful. But most of all it was a great place to work. My comment at this time is due to being in a layoff status so close to retirement."
good,Great company for entry level individuals. Great benefits and advancement opportunities. High turn over rate with store managers which turn the store into chaos.
good,"The job pays really well, and the company and union have a lot of programs in place to aid employees. However, management is lackluster from the top down, and many have little idea what it's like to be customer facing in this industry."
good,"AT&T would be a great place to work if not for the revolving door of leadership.  Expect great change every 18 months as the VPs exchange position.  Overall, sales managers are good people that are over-worked and not listened too, but they treat their teams fairly."
good,great company to work for make sure you apply to corporate and not third-party retailers. not really much else i can say about this company other than go head apply
good,"I was there when it was Cingular and also as att it was great and fun, it was easy to make money while having fun, then att made changes to the commission structure and corporate started to cut the pay that is when it all changed for me due to losing commission."
good,in 2003 it is making me do a review. i worked collections and if a person was calling about a tech problem and had a balance they were automatically transferred to collections... i was REQUIRED to ask for a payment which would make people mad. very irritating
good,AT&T use to be a great company but over the years they have tried to push the old out and bring in the new.  The company wants people that they can make robots.
good,Productive and fun. The diversity is amazing. Team work skills. Building rapport. Developing sales and product knowledge. Move through change wheels efficiently
good,"I had a great experience working at this company, despite the hard times.It was nice having the support of team members; paid holidays; own work equipment; etc. Enjoyed the ability to travel to other parts of the state for three-week loan-outs to help another area."
good,"A typical day at work is doing boring and repetitious work with a micro-management team.  Some co-workers are not the friendliest, but our workload does not require a team effort.  The best part about my job are the consistent work hours, benefits and paid time off."
good,"Depending on what department you worked in, it was very fast paced and competitive. Changes happened pretty frequent. Sometimes the manager were not true leaders, just had certain skill sets that allowed them to be promoted."
good,At&t has good benefits and compensation. I believe in At&t products and think they are the best telecommunications company. I believe At&t could do a better job at reassuring its employees and customers that they are appreciated.
good,"Sure, everyone eats but the cost is extremely high. Having fire insulated clothing is beneficial due to the management fire constantly blowing on your neck by way of upper management."
good,"This job is designed for people in their late teens, 20""s and 30's. It is a fast paced high noise (music and noisemakers to celebrate sales) environment. There is very regular feedback on calls. All calls are taped, and the computer screen is videotaped while you take the call."
good,"It was a good place to work. Corporate mindset meant they would move employees to new locations on short notice regardless if it was in their best interest. Aside from that point, it was a great work environment and fun place to be employed. They had good financial and personal benefits."
good,"Only con, the AT&T service is focused around making sales and money for the company. If you don't sell as often, they fire you and replace you almost immediately"
good,I enjoyed working from AT&T for short period I was there plus you are put in different position.  It was very fast paced.  Wouldn't mind going back AT&T.  You start in the mailroom then proceed to the computer room to run the transporter.  After every documents has been process you will need to key in the information concerning payment.
good,"Working as an install technician for AT&T you are responsible for internet, VOIP phone and television services. You as a tech must determine how to install equipment and choose the best route to run wires when needed to be ran to activate service and tvs."
good,"It really depends on your Manager - it's a huge company. They have you change shifts quite often and with that comes a change in manager, most Managers I would have to say were not very good..they were not helpful or encouraging. Also changing shifts all the time was not good. I will say that the benefit package was good."
good,Entry level positions pay very well. Company does a good job of promoting from within. Company evolves to match demand. Leadership development should be focused on. Happy to have learned collaborative techniques and coaching philosophies.
good,If you can handle constant change and a total shift in rolls and responsibilities this is the place for you.  New positions are created and others are surplussed.
good,When you are integrated into a team at at&t you are allowed to have a great experience. Creating solutions and trying to integrate those solutions to customers both internal and external. The company is huge and is always looking for more talent to take it new heights.
good,It’s a good job not to much room for advancement and there’s a lot of bickering amongst coworkers due to competition and sales goal also just around the work place drama . Schedule is based on seniority so coming in the door expect the worst schedule . Pay is pretty good commission changes a lot but if you are a good sales Man U can pretty much gauge how much you will earn so that u will be able to budget accordingly.
good,Been with the company 5 years and you're nothing but a number. Everyone including management are always in fear of losing their job. I would love to move up and learn something new within the company but no jobs are available.
good,"Even though I worked for 9 years with this company, and did the companies offered training to equip me for the future, there was always a fear of being surplussed, to which i was a long with hundreds!"
good,"It is a very demanding job. That requires your full attention to detail in order to have a satisfied client. The hours working here are very hard to deal with, especially if you have children."
good,"Actually loved the job and culture. Employees don't quit jobs, they quit managers... applicable in my experience. Would work there again if I ever needed the job."
good,ya no la recomiendo solo buscan vender y vender no se preocupan por el personal.
good,"AT&T is a good company overall. Great training, great benefits and they attempt to do what is best for their employees. But it is a stressful place to work with long hours and an ever changing commission structure. While the corporate hierarchy claims that they strive for a work-life balance, the company is not capable or willing to fully commit to those claims. "
good,"Pay and benefits are good but it is a high-stress environment. Even technical support reps are expected to sell products and services. Quotas increase, payouts and bonuses decrease over time."
good,you get negative treatment from upper management and from the customers. Management turns a blind eye to the so called policy of AT&T.  Your co-worker becomes your outside family.
good,I worked up from being a technician to being manager and can. Honesty say that the stresses of manager life far outweighs the benefits.  Began searching for a new job as technicians are being surpluses and confidence level in job security dwindled. Hey
good,Repeated downsizing only reduced headcount but did not reduce work. Ongoing workload was continuously distributed to managers left after completion of force reductions.
good,Each job was a different experience. They were each a challenge to repair. Install was a way to think and plan the job for the future. To avoid repairs as much as possible while making it easier to maintain and add on.  To ensure long term customer satisfaction.
good,in bound call-center. focus is sales. if you are self motivated and thick skinned you'll be fine. Excellent benefits. competitive pay.  hours based on tenure.
good,Days off based on seniority. Most shifts required to work Saturday or Sundays. Required to work most holidays except Thanksgiving and Christmas. Stressful work environment
good,So it all depends on the group you're in. My issue is with the culture as I am in a legacy/older group. Do things the way they have always been done and sit and wait to retire. This is not my style and doesn't meet my career ambitions. Promotions do not exist and advancements are a giant no go.
good,"The job is scheduled. Meaning the work list is made 2 weeks prior. Do not miss any days of work for any reason. As long as your manager is an approachable person, the job is great, but it is a lot of work."
good,"Everything was fine. I was a RSC with AT&T. I left to take a management position with another company. I have tried to come back recently, but it appears that AT&T does not want previous employees to be rehired so they can pay entry level employees at a much lower wage."
good,"Had the pleasure to work with AT&T for over seven years in two different states.  The people in the area make all the difference.  When I moved back to GA, the culture in the Atlanta area was drastically different, no team effort, no support from anyone else.  The overall culture is to cover yourself, and use any means necessary to promote yourself over everyone else, no matter what the cost.  There is no team building, only personal gain.  Unlike my old market out of state, where everyone worked together."
good,No major complaints. The company is a great place to work with it just does not provided flexibility and family time. You can  not have kids and work for them because there will never be anytime for them.
good,"typical work day. you sign into phone and computer at start of shift.  you are on a point system. mangers write you up without giving you an opportunity to change habits. once you are hired, it seems they spend the rest of your time there trying to find something to fire you for.  It takes a year to get a point taken away."
good,"Huge company. Culture varies by group. Depending on the job and group, the work experience could be great, or not so much. They keep doing reorgs and it is hard to keep up who are you working for, or what are the goals."
good,yeah i enjoy working with at&t because the team I work with is very friendly and supportive. We do many of the team tasks and enjoy each others company.
good,Morning meetings for an hour. Then employees go to different big box retailers and represent the company for 5 hour shifts. 30 minute breaks. Need a positive attitude and self motivation.
good,The company only cares about a number not the employee. They pay good and good benefits. you never know if you going to have a job the next year or not. I order for to keep my job I had to transferred 3 hours away from my family. now I only see them on weekends.
good,"Again, it was quite a few years back so the experience and culture was vastly different than what you would expect nowadays. I did learn quite a bit and it helped me in my future career."
good,"Great company, there is definitely some things to be improved upon in the upper and middle management area. Fast paced place to work, be ready to keep up."
good,"It was great working at AT&T,the environment and work culture was very friendly.very competitive.lot of things to learn.friendly management.team lunch"
good,igh volume and fast paced environment. Pay is great but there is no security with AT&T as they're always laying off and sending jobs overseas to under qualified employees. I've participated in several calls where Customers were not pleased and refused to continue due to language barrier and the intricate nature of their business.
good,At AT&T I did not feel valued as an employee. I was just a number on corporate reports.The benefits are what kept me there as long as I stayed. Most of the Team Managers I encountered were unprofessional.
good,Ok place to work for a younger person who doesnt mind change. Joob security does not exist here so it is not for someone who is looking to build off the job
good,"Great paying retail position but has issues with work/life balance.  Will really be a good fit if you are personable, flexible and driven to succeed in sales."
good,"hard to advance your career."
good,"What you would expect with a company in transition, a lot of changes, lots of new ideas, few that stick. The company is on the right track, dealing with all the mergers makes it hard at times."
good,"There are still a lot of old timers at AT&T and they don't always make the best managers, many do not understand the way the technology of today works and the pace things need to get done is the slow pace of the past."
good,"I worked for AT?&T Mobility and also for Cricket during my 19 years there. AT&T Mobility is more structured and manageable as Cricket prides themselves on being Agile, but some times they are to a fault. I have been surplus 9 times in my 19 years with the company. That is way too much and reflects poorly on the company."
good,"Prospect new business clients"
good,"Micromanagement is not for me intimidation and threats about your job were a regular part of business.  Favoritism is clear and management does not want to help only to find a way to make you feel like your job is in jeopardy making me feel less motivated.  I did have one supervisor the last one before I was out he was great however his boss in Chicago was an opinionated person with no regard for his employees and set people he did not like up for failure with assignments, quotas and goals that were unrealistic and it affects your commission and your family."
good,"Many stores may different, but I am giving my opinion of my market and my actual store. Management was poor. They lacked human empathy to make their employees happy. Instead of employees, they had salespeople. They didn't care about your life outside of the workplace. Turnover was high so it was hard to train new people of all the services of AT&T. It was great pay and great benefits, but I am glad I no longer have a career path there."
good,The company that I worked for was great for a person who already had benefits. The products were great. The flexibility was great. But unfortunately no base pay and no benefits.
good,"Over the years, the work environment changed from a fun place to work to a it's-just-a-place to work. I began to see the change in the direction the department I worked in began to go. It was as if they were taking my promotion away and busting me back down to a customer service representative."
good,"Poor management. Employees are all mean and uptight. No one will help you. You will feel left alone. It is a very weird and basic environment. Employees are like hostages held in a jail cell. This is not a good position to hold (Glendale, CA). Management is horrible and all employees lie to their customers. Manager must be fired immediately."
good,I worked at att for 3 years . Started as a retail sales consultant and 2 years later promoted to manger . I met a lot of amazing people working there and Through the training process to refine my selling skills
good,"Was at one time a company that you could advance your career.  Customer service was VERY important.  In the past several years, that is obviously no longer the case."
good,its a great place to work more training is vastly needed  and high turn over rate pressure of high and unteachable standers wrecked our  garage and over half of the people there were gone with a year. but great benefits
good,"At AT&T I learned a lot about telecommunications and tv, phone, and internet installation.  They are primarily a team based environment by which the technicians all work together."
good,"This organization compensates their employees well.  It's a quick-paced environment, but you learn a lot.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers."
good,"Good place to work. More than fair wages, Good crew. Assigned jobs everyday. Very steady work. Sometimes mandatory overtime, great compensation. Rain and snow would sometimes present a challenge to getting a job completed and done well."
good,"AT&T provides great benefits and opportunities for career advancement.  Surprisingly though, there are some out of control processes within all levels of management that create an employee moral issue."
good,"AT&T as a company is great to work for, but the Call Center in Ocala, Fl is not. The company itself was great, amazing benefits, excellent pay, regular bonuses and commission. Management in the call center however was hit or miss, some were good in a lot of ways that make you actually want to go to work, the rest/most of them though make it very hard to enjoy your job or even want to be there. Before my time ended there things had gotten to the point where multiple employees were finding other work and leaving, the overall morale of the call center was mediocre at best. The work environment became stressful and it felt like management was looking for and using any excuse to get rid of people as well. I've got a lot of mixed feelings about that job, all I can say is if you're looking to work there to just keep a Plan B in your pocket at all times."
good,"Typical day is fast paces, engaged in multiple projects with various departments. Learned effective communication skills. The workplace culture is hierarchy oriented. The hardest part of the job is coping with various departments shortcoming and working around some inefficient processes and systems in place. Working with co workers in a team environment and good immediate management behavior is mostly appreciated."
good,"Loved it.  It paid very well and had many benefits, including 401K. Job advancement is a great probability and the diversity of the work flow if great."
good,"Good place to work. Good Schedule. Nice people. Jobs can be challenging. Fast-paced environment. However, there is no room for advancement within this location."
good,"Was an ok place to work, The union and lower management had a spat between themselves, The average employee doesn't really register on either of their radars."
good,"Great place to work and make  a lot of money by commission and hourly, it also fun when your very good at it and rewarding, in 5 months i made $30000 with out even trying. great beneifits and discounts."
good,"I loved my manage, although he could not get me better hours.  I felt that better hours should be given to team members that busted the but, however, they did not see it like that.  Seniority rules.  It could be cutthroat at times.  Other than that, I loved this job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
good,Good company to work for as far as benefits and compensations. Long hours most days and not knowing what time you will be getting off can be discouraging sometimes.
good,"It wasnt really particular att, but i was working in one of their sister company spring mobile. Now this company is something else because the performance metrics they use will make a sales representative lie to the customer."
good,"As a corporate retail store manager my daily workday consist of arriving before the staff and opening the store or arriving just before noon to be the closing manager. I learned how to strategically coach sales reps in increasing their sales and how to think outside the box to resolve problems sales reps themselves could not resolve. I managed the store’s money, staff of 22 personnel, and inventory. Workplace culture was mostly positive, however that was dependent of the morale of the day. The hardest part of the day, with which I enjoyed the challenge, would be balancing multiple sporadic issues with resolution time frames. Most enjoyable part of the job was having customers come-in looking specialty for you because they enjoyed your customers service."
good,If you are full time don't expect to get a better shift than part timers. The management plays favorites and if you work hard then they don't give you any more consideration than the slacker.  It's a dog eat dog world there with unobtainable goals.
good,"If you care for a M-F, 8-5 job, AT&T Retail is not for you. "
good,it was a good company to work. worklife is balance. the management was good. they are many contractors working here. the job security is not there. thats all i can say
good,Es buena empresa solo q para seruna empresa con un fin de comunicación les hace falta dar una clara idea de lo q te piden
good,Learned how to sell as individual and when promoted to mgmt. learned how to look at store as a whole instead of just my own individual sales.  Hardest part of job was dealing with inept management and unrealistic expectations. Most enjoyable is the customers and coworkers who most were very interested in cell phones and electronics.
good,"Work life balance horrible , very long hours. Management says they're there for you but in reality there there for themselves. "
good,"Great job benefits, minimal experienced management on the floor.  The best part of working at this company was the fact that you could get as many hours in as you would like, over time was always an option."
good,"I worked managing agency partners and was on the campaign that launched the vote casting via mobile phone for American Idol. It was a fun, fast paced atmosphere but there was not room for me as an FTE once my contract was up. Loved the work though!"
good,a typical day at work for At&T was working outside installing internet tv phone sometimes aerial and sometimes running cable underground terminating cat5 wire and running cat5 fiber and installing tv boxes modems nids on sides of houses and terminating fiber ends educating customers on installation and or repair process.
good,I got fat because it was a desk job. The pay was good the pay was pretty good for a entry level job. Management was on point they took care of you. very stressful.
good,"* Cada día es bueno y con bastante por hacer"
good,Your experience here is entirely dependent on the manager you have. It can go from great to awesome to horrible. As is life change is the only constant.
good,"I've enjoyed worked there.   The management gave us no job security, many of friends got laid off after 28 to 29 1/2 years.   I started from zero experience in telecommunication fields but learned a lot from the Company.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the number of vacation days and paid personal days which you won't get it from any other companies out there."
good,I enjoy my position here as far as the day to day operations. There is a big void in most employees that have a family or life outside of work due to the ever changing schedules. Pay is good but every 6 months your schedule changes and you never know what you may end up working. The changing schedule s why I must seek another job and why most end up leaving.
good,"Pros:"
good,A typical day at work is producing.  You are held accountable for every minute of your time.  You are required to manage your own time wisely.  You are not micromanaged.
good,"very easy but consuming job, worked from the time i woke up to ten pm at night ,keep files and created my own rosters for account management..........."
good,AT&T stands for at this Time. everything is changing with little to no notice. they keep adding more things to our plate with out the proper compensation. team managers are great. upper management is lacking.
good,When I was hired the company was Directv.  Att bought the company and commenced to fire people.  They sent US jobs overseas.  They created a tough environment for the people who remained.
good,Loved all my direct supervisors. Due to a company merger the rules all being applied at once left confusion to run rampant. Always scared if i was going to be let go due to company downsizing. Never knew what time i would be off and schedule was so crazy that you always had to plan to work the weekend unless you were told otherwise.
good,"Good people but it was very stressful"
good,Upper management sometimes provides misleading information as well as miscommunication. Management team tends to not be as flexible with employee's work /life schedules.
good,"ge pay, i hated the hours, there was night and weekend pay differental. the center is now closed. no appeared to see it coming, i learned alot, met great people"
good,Es una excelente empresa pare tener creciemiento laboral
good,"Every year the company will work you harder to lower your commission. When I first started sales I was making 80,000 a year but after 2 years loss that thru change of commission structure to 55,000 a year"
good,You have to meet AT&T's performance standards through metrics that are always changing. Long days and strict bosses. You find out quickly that you are to blame for a lot that is out of your control. You're coworkers are the best thing about the job besides the pay.
good,"Sales interactions, good customer service. Mentally very stressful but compensated fairly. Could have better pay for some of the work and work life balances"
good,"Balanced Work/Personal Life."
good,"working for att distribution center was a nice experience , the workplace was always positive there wasn't really no drama and mess going on simply working and growth"
good,"A typical day starts with a morning meeting 5-10 min. After, you head to your first job. You'll work in all elements except lighting, also confined spaces and heights. Never knowing when you're going to get home from work is the hardest part of the job, you can never make plans after work. Management is hit and miss, thats all I can really say about that part. The most enjoyable part about the job is helping the customers, and being able to step back and look at what you have created. It gives a great sense of accomplishment."
good,"Your coworkers will become like family. The benefits are wonderful, and I truly enjoy helping a customer with anything they need. To make it and get to stay, however, you will need to be less than 100% honest with customers and basically brow beat them into buying everything you've been told to sell that week, whether they need or want it or not. Their employee feedback system is built so open ended, no matter how well you do positioning with a customer, if their final answer is no, its always due to your lack of ""X"" step in the sales process. That blind gentleman would be more open to purchasing the VR Gear, if you would have........ "
good,Worked here for a long time. Only downside is the call center floor has 2 faces. One face telling you to do everything you have to in order to get a sale. While the other face is reprimanding you for doing everything you can.
good,my job is good but management and processes need to be improved. the company is stable and growing rapidly. the culture could be better but there is stability.
good,"Great culture and employee development. The perks, salary and benefits are amazing. But you are nothing but a number and if they want to get rid of you they will find something. The hours are awful and there is no work life balance."
good,"Good place to work, especially for a call center. Good pay and great benefits. Your main focus is to sell customers anything on each call. Don't get me wrong, if push came to shove I'd go back. My only gripe would be in my interview they said it was customer service, but it's really a sales job."
good,"Pay and overtime opportunities are there for whomever wants to take them, working holidays is the best way to earn extra cash at double time and a half."
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for in terms of the pay and benefits that they provide to their employees, but it can be especially difficult to advance beyond a first-level management position."
good,"This was one of the most satisfying jobs I have ever had. It provided challenges and rewards unlike any other. There was a balance between work, community and family that allowed for location, remote and virtual workspace give a sense of accomplishment and truly made me feel as if I was making a difference. The culture and values of the company made me more socially aware and active. To this day I still involve myself is community affairs and helping people in need."
good,A typical day at work is wondering what kind of installation or repair work will be in your job queue. I have learned to be patient and just expect the unexpected at any customer site. Management works to make the work flow even and train everyone on everything. The hardest part is dealing with a day without work. The easiest part is the desire to help customers have a better day through courteousness and professionalism.
good,This was a very stress filled job. The sales quotas were hard to achieve which led to a very stressfull work environment. i will say that there pay scale was phenomenol.
good,I've worked for AT&T 16 years now in various roles. A lot has changed since I've started but the pay and benefits have been very good throughout my tenure. The company as a whole is a great company however; some departments and how they operate need a little guidance and leadership from the higher ups.
good,I enjoyed this job but was basically made obsolete by the increased use of cell phones and lack of access to jobs of the future.  In particular I was not retrained in fiber optics and had limited exposure to high speed internet.
good,A high paced selling environment. Not a longterm employment solution for people who like to do the minimum. The Union provides som coverage but its best to sell what they tell you to sell
good,All together decent paying job. There is a lot of micro management that goes on seems management is always out to get the techs not to help raise the techs up like a manager should.
good,"Have had a great opportunity to work in many functions within the company that taught me a tremendous value of teamwork in the workplace.  It's a partnership and together as a team (even thought I had title of Manager) we can accomplish both team and company goals."
good,Decent workplace environment.  Benefits are great.  Overall work-life balance depends upon location and leadership you are under.  Advancement opportunities are there at times.
good,"All co workers were fun and easy going, the work environment was a respectable one. Greet customers, inform about new products, very straight forward. It was just our manager who would go against union contracts and put us in tough situations, and once i started to complain he did everything in his power to get me out of there."
good,"benefit good"
good,"I loved my job with at&t, loved the leadership, but the direction the company is going has required them to cut multiple jobs and no one feels safe in their roles anymore."
good,be aware that for many years your schedule will be nights and weekends as long as you are ok with that great job good to great benefits
good,"Every day is always busy, helping customers about their problem. On technical issues and billing concerns. I learned a lot when interacting with people and connecting with them. Also with communication skills. Hardest part of the job is to control your emotions because there are times that there are angry or irate customers due to their bill. But I do my best to control my emotions and try to imagine if I was also on their shoe, I would also feel the same way, especially when the bill is high. There are also perks that we enjoy, incentives and GC's, etc."
good,A typical day at work was a different experience each day. Every customer brought new challenges to be resolved. Management changed daily and could work on employee team building. My co-workers  were fun to be around and team members. The hardest part of the job was when I was not able to get a customer connected due to their service area. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy.
good,"I handled all aspects of telecommunications needs for small business owners. From ordering, installation and or repair.  answered customer question or complaint. resolved all issues for customers. Met strict sales quota every month 100%"
good,"Great place for technology oriented. Management and managers with no schooling make it difficult to advance. Huge buddy system where if your not part of a click, things will be made difficult for you. Now im not sure if it's like this in all departments but the three that I was in it was pretty obvious."
good,"Sales goals are extremely high. High pressure sales. Your time off is based on seniority. So therefore if you are a new hire do not plan on having any weekends and closing every night.  Benefits are good. However, they constantly change commission structure making it extremely hard to get paid."
good,The typical work day was a standard 8 hour day with some evening work on device launch nights.  I learned a lot about project management and the E-Commerce space.  The hardest part of the job was the uncertainty of career growth.
good,"•	En el soporte a la operación es difícil encontrar algo como “tipico” ya que nuestro trabajo era enfrentarnos al problema con el que nos desafiaba la Operación,"
good,This company deals greatly with the gossip of its employees and management despite confidentiality agreements. Extremely personal matters were commonplace in conversations at work and at manager meetings. Other than that the compensation structure was not bad and attainable. The store I worked at was lacking in foot traffic due to the town it is in.
good,Superior Asset was a continuation of Cingular Wireless at the time. Great place to start if you are moving toward corporate jobs. It was not only a stepping stone but a move towards my future goals.
good,"~ Take over a 100 calls per day, one call resolution ~Excellence C.R.S.~~ Same supervisor for 10 years. Co-workers made a great team. ~  Leaving ~People"
good,Hard company to work for if you have to plan anything to do after work because you have no scheduled time to be off. One weekend off a month. No room for advancement unless someone quits or retires.
good,"Union job. Good benefits, but bad store manager. Hard to take time off for family emergencies, sickness, etc. Hardest part of job is customers being mad, and you having to deal with their cell phone issues. A lot of trouble shooting. You must be tech savvy. Also, there are big sales goals you have to meet for the month."
good,"es buena empresa, el ambiente es muy agradable, sin embargo no hay mucha oportunidad de crecimiento, el salario es muy bajo"
good,The job was very demanding and required hard work to exceed expectations. Had to give one star for Job Security as I was surplussed in February 2016 and job security was a concern the whole time I was working there.
good,"en esta empresa aprendí a manejar personal a mi cargo y a hacerme cargo de una tienda yo sola, adopte más responsabilidad."
good,"Daily conference calls, learned about cell phones and networks, i enjoyed my co workers."
good,"Overall AT&T was a good place to work, however in the last 10 years the company was only interested in the bottom line and not the welfare and security of the employees. Very Stressful environment."
good,"-Typical day consists of answering phone calls, managing inventory,hitting sales goals,and ensuring a positive customer experience."
good,"Good old company."
good,"I first started working for AT&T when I was 20 years old. I was tired of having jobs and wanted to find myself a real career. I was excited for the chance to do something new and looked forward to the challenges it offered. Over the course of the 8 years that I have worked for AT&T I have watched the culture shift rather aggressively to be one that seems to chase the profit and the appearance of a desire to be a leader without doing the work. Moving up in the company is something that we all imagine we want to do, but more often then not we see that those who look to venture past the first tier of customer support of broken down and often many leave the company.  "
good,"My job at AT&T involved going door to door and trying to sell our products to families. It was a difficult job, especially because the nature of it involved having to travel to different areas at dinner times when most people were either gone or did not want to be disturbed. The only way one was paid was through commission; it was therefor not a very secure workplace unless one was extremely qualified and adept at selling."
good,Not pleased at all with the new pay structure. This job demands a lot from you physically as well as mentally. Ready to find other work
good,"I loved this job. Meeting new people. Being a waitress had its toll,but making nightly money was great. My coworkers were amazing. The hardest part was not going to work so I could make extra money."
good,"Go to work pull up all my systems, over 20 systems had operate each day, then I would log into my phone and began taking calls with customers, handling customer complaints and selling products and any other questions or assistance a customer may need. I learned to how to operate over 20 systems daily, take notes and handle customer needs. Co workers pretty easy to work with. The hardest part of the job would be nothing, I enjoyed everything about the job. the most enjoyable part would be helping the customer satisfying their needs."
good,"Many changes, with concern on how they are being approached.  This is a great company to work with and currently experiencing growing pains with their new focus of being our customers primary choice for entertainment services."
good,"A typical day includes signing on and answering calls, assisting with network issues.  "
good,"It was a good opportunity for me to understand and learn technical and customer relation skills at the same time. We had monthly training which helped me to enhance my skills. I learnt a lot regarding the products and the also get chance to understand customer behavior and their attitude. I am using those skills in my everyday life in every possible way. "
good,"This job teaches the importance of meeting weekly quotas, being aware of current events and teamwork. This position requires you to work with a team, daily, to provide assistance with customer issues, quickly and efficiently. Interns also have the opportunity to lead the team with the goal of resolving as many customer issues as possible. This internship provides a very relaxed workplace with friendly co-workers."
good,After working some many years from the device side of the Mobile Network Platfrom this gave me the chance to perform end to end with the Network Platform.
good,AT&T is a good place to work but advancement in the company and change in compensation has really discouraged many employees
good,"Great benefits and good pay, tough retail work schedule, inflexible hours, high sales goals, good opportunity to move up, but it can be difficult if you don't know the right people,  it was very political"
good,"The company has recently been acquired by AT&T and my position was eliminated. Directv was a great place to work but the culture changed when the acquisition was announced. Prior, I worked with the Technician sites nationwide and really enjoyed my work and my clients. It was a very team oriented environment. My schedule was flexible and my immediate Manager was great. I worked with the Payroll and HRIS teams and we did whatever it took to make sure our clients needs were met. I enjoyed being able to participate in the leadership team meetings and help with the Incentive Plan designs. I also was able to travel to our sites for Engagement Surveys and Benefits Open Enrollment meetings. I learned a lot about HR and Compensation while I was there. One of the hardest parts was my workload."
good,"I started at Wayport INC, in 2008. AT&T bought us shortly after learning I had joined the team. The company was small and full of bright talented people. Once corporate had assumed control (Four years after I started) everything went down hill fast."
good,"gotten very boring working from home needed something else to do I couldn't say home all day but hours are flexible, no benefits get paid based on calls"
good,"AT&T was a refreshing job experience which taught me a lesson of sales dynamics. A typical day at work would be unlocking the doors, taking out all the products to display on the sales floor as well as tidying up the shop in general. After this was taken care of we would then review our newsletters of the month which we would review to know the sales and new improvements or changes to our business. Being prepared for what the customer would say & how we as sales reps would come about explaining the benefits of being with AT&T. My co workers were focused and motivating , urging the team to always be aware of anything us as representatives should know about our marketing to the customer. The most challenging part of the job was to constantly be aware of the changes in plans and depicting to the customer that it is beneficial."
good,"Learned to be a better in sales and customer service."
good,"They have good benefits and pay is ok, but the work load can be very stressful at times and sometimes if feel like they don't even care."
good,A typical day at work here is extremely stressful. There are high expectations and no consistent delivery on how to meet the expectations. Depending on who the director is at the time the atmosphere is nice and there are nice people who work here. The hardest part of the job is being verbally abused over the phone most of the time and the center setting unrealistic expectations with no legitimate meaning/purpose/support behind them. These expectations cause stress on top of the stress you are already dealing with from the highly abusive customers who have no limit on what they can say to you and how they can say it. They always preach that there is room for advancement but only around every 3-6 months will they open 1 position for 300 people to apply for. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay and benefits. I give 4 stars because of the pay.
good,"If you like a fast paced job and you love technology then this is the place for you! Cant take this job personal, you'll run into plenty of disgruntled customers everyday but you have the option of turning them around and making something happen"
good,Work environment was fun enjoyed management they let you grow if you asked. Some red tape but that's to be expected in such a large corporation. The most enjoyable was my colleagues they all had a since of humor even when the job was on stress mode during rain season.
good,"Working for Directv is a fantastic opportunity for growth and development.  There is great access to knowledge bases to increase your own development.  Traveling across the country is near necessary to advance.  However, the more you become capable of the more expectation there becomes, however not at the same rate.  For some reason there's a disconnect between the scope of your skills and the expectation of how many hours in the day.  The number of project and task deadlines always seems to increase, but the time allocated to do it shrinks."
good,I was a contractor for this company and did not enjoy being one.  I really did not enjoy the work.  The company I worked for was ran poorly.  I would have enjoyed being an employee more because I had to pay for my own small parts.
good,Working with this company I really enjoyed helping the customers with At&t billings. A typical day at work would include me speaking with other peers inside At&t stores to resolve either billing or technical concerns for customers. Working here became repetitive and easy as to I like a challenge.
good,"Sales planning sessions, training vendors, goal setting, Awards for best sellers. "
good,"I was a Contract Specialist I assisted sales agents, managers, customers with needed paperwork so that the process of getting them connected with run smoothly through other departments such as credit, provisioning and billing."
good,"A typical day at work would be to deliver/exceed daily sales targets while managing and holding a team of 12-15 representatives accountable in accordance to company policy. Would provide a source of energy and sales strategy to provide representatives with a positive initiative to exceed daily expectations of sales quota while obtaining an above satisfactory rating for customer service. The hardest part was the fact that while responsible for so much income, the job did not provide a clear avenue to grow as a creator, nor did it compensate at the level as it should. Knowing people you are teaching and assisting as a sales expert is making more than you while working in a negative environment is draining both professionally and personally. The most enjoyable part was building the relationships and providing a platform to people both as employees and customers to better there experience one interaction at a time."
good,"A typical day began with a phone call as soon as you log in. We helped customers pay there bills and also trouble shoot any issues that are current. From what i learned from my manager was how to stay calm no matter what the situation is, always try to find a positive in any negative situations"
good,"Customer call customer where they call in regarding their bills and you try to sell them products.  Learned there are added fee to bills that we all need to keep close eye out for on our cell phone charges. "
good,"AT&T is an amazing company to work for however over the last 5 years they've become more robotic. By this I mean they don't allow there sales personal to be true salesman. Everything you say and do on the sales floor is scripted. They don't give you down time, or time away form work. AT&T wants to have access to you 24/7 to do conference call, emails, and various sales issues that should otherwise be delegated."
good,"Typical day at work; come in get passdown from previous shift to see current issues and any work needing to be done. Work on your own or with others to complete daily tasks. Keep channels on air and minimize any down time."
good,"Working for Directv was a very enjoyable experience. I enjoyed waking up and getting to work in the morning, knowing I was going to be able to make someone's day better. I worked doing inbound Technical Support. Customer would call and say their service is not working and I would be able to identify the issue over the phone and assist the customer to enjoy their service. When complex situations would present themselves I was able to get the customer to the necessary department tp ensure customer satisfaction. "
good,Base pay is great and commision is even better.  Even for part-time you can get benefits but you have to work every weekend.
good,"Going into work, I would check out my standing  on all my merits the company is most concerned about.  I was always at the top 5% of the company wide in my golds and accomplishments right out of training, and received special recommendations for such. I then checked the system to see if I found out any outage or problems that we would be expected  affect or call volume for the day, or any promotions that we would currently be running.  I always like to be a step ahead of the customer if possible and always have the correct and accurate information to start out my new day on a clean fresh slate and build up from there."
good,"Not a lot of job security and managers need lessons on moral but the pay and benefits make it hard to want to leave.  Co-workers make it worth the time, great people and many friends have been made here."
good,There is nice pay for the ones willing to work hard for it. you can make great money if you are focused on your goals. You will work holidays and weekends though.
good,though ive enjoyed my time working with AT&T the working relationship between management and employee was little to none. they were not interested in helping the employees advance and learn and they were unconcerned with many aspects of the job other than the bottom line. I feel they are like this because every employee to them is just a replaceable commodity. but still I would recommend the job to anyone looking for work. however also be warned their concern for the customer is only given when they threaten to leave and move on other than that all their promises are hype and they are most worried about speed rather than customer satisfaction. they do tend to take comfort in the knowledge of their customers naïve knowledge.
good,Co-workers are great. Helping customers was the best part of the job. Higher management doesn't seem interested in promoting a good working environment with the workers.
good,This company provides extensive training in all areas of chosen career path. Energetic and loyal co-workers create a team atmosphere with new and tenured employees. I learned many aspects of the wireless technology and it's place in future lifestyles. I enjoyed merchandising the sales floor for the customers' experience. I experienced extreme micro management that was not always necessary.
good,AT&T has great benefits and compensation packages however if you  obtain your degree while working for them you will make approx 25-35k less than you will if you came in the company with an degree. They do not compensate their employees for obtaining their degree however they do offer tuition reimbursement  only for employee to go to other companies and apply the free tuition aid AT&T paid for to other companies.
good,"Customer Service in a fast paced call center. Providing Informational Technology in an inbound call center, assisting customers with trouble shooting internet connections, modem/router support and computers."
good,"Great people. "
good,"great tips and cash money every in pocket"
good,Typical day at work would be running daily audits and work on any urgent adhoc reports. Great place to work and flexible to be if you have family with young kids.
good,There is a lot of new technology you can learn and you are always in a situation where you have to figure out how to solve an issue for a customer.
good,"Love my job , have been with the company along time . Planned to retire but the job is moving out of state , and hard to advance in the company. Good company to work for if you are willing to move out of state"
good,I love my job but honestly feel like this company is out to work over their customers. I have run into a lot of moral dilemmas for myself with this job.
good,"I learned a lot of the technical aspects of DSL technology along with web browser, webmail, and computer operating system configuration. I liked the learning aspect of the job as well as helping customers with the proper function of their high-speed internet service. My co-workers were absolutely awesome and always willing to assist each other whenever possible."
good,I really enjoyed working with the customers to fix a bill or any problem with their service.  My last boss really didn't like the military or anyone who was in it. when I was being let go I tried to tell upper managment they said they were aware of the bias but couldn't do anything about it
good,This job is awesome with acknowledging their employees. They allow you to feel awesome about everything that you accomplish. I personally was promoted after the first week of working here because of my work ethic and consistency. They allow you to feel good about being yourself and they will teach you how to be very successful. A typical day would be getting rejected by customers but through the job surprisingly they help you to feel good about that. As long as your main goal is to close every customer than that one yes will pay for the 100+ no's that you have been receiving all day. I loved the people that I worked with and they loved me. The hardest part is learning how to deal with all different types of customers and being able to have a quick response to everything. The most enjoyable part is also the customers because you get to connect and meet different people. I have actually cried with a customer and that is something we both will forever remember.
good,"There is not a typical day, everyday is different."
good,"For advancement, one has to play the ""political game"". Knowing someone in a position of influence rather than based on experience and shear numbers"
good,"You have asked me to "
good,"Typical day would entitle trying to meet a quota of new lines, upgrades and amount sold in accessories. I was the 2nd top selling sales Consultant in my store."
good,If you are into analytics this is a great place. The company behind the big company. A lot of knowledge.
good,AT&T FTTN Conditioning of distribution areas (DAs) for Light-Speed project.
good,Management is there to help you succeed. Learned about how call centers work. Enjoyed my managers and coworkers as people. Most enjoyable helping customers lower their bills. Hardest part of job fulfilling all of the jobs goals to 200%
good,Promoted from Directory Assitance Operator to Telecommunications Specialist by testing. Outperformed peers scoring in the 90% bracket.
good,Typical work days are long but the pay is great. The hardest part of my job is the need to be on the phone over 8 hours a day
good,DTV is a good place to work if you're in the right department and have the support of your management and peers
good,"Been with at&t for 12 years through all its transitions from Pac Bell,SBC, then at&t and I have to say it's been a good place to work as far as the benefits and wages. Super stressfull with all the micromanaging and monitoring but they pay great!"
good,"-A typical workday consists of managing union technicians responsible for completing projects in the outside plant environment."
good,"Good company, benefits, culture"
good,"Fun job, great training. Work/Life Balance can be exhausting but. Benefits are fantastic."
good,"My typical day at work is started w/ whats going on in the company and then collect my supplies and go out to service the customer."
good,I grew and devolved personally and professionally. I have had the pleasure of heading up some really large projects and the dissatisfaction of menial assignments and age discrimination.
good,"Poor management, but great pay. High monthly goals that even the longest lasting sales reps weren't safe from being fired if not met."
good,"The money was great. However, the rude customers were not worth the pay. I would rather flip burgers."
good,"A typical day at work consist of heavy call volumes of calls that were very challenging and callers with multiple problems. "
good,"Customer Service Representative/ Customer Care - I loved working and helping satellite past and present and potential customers about any or all their complaints or concerns about the services they have received. Activated satellite equipment such as receivers and satellite software. Technician Dispatcher - tracking installers daily installation jobs and placing times they would arrive at each customers appointment, such as placing them onsite and assist completing appointment survey with customer, completing account via computer with technician, called each customer to let them know when the installer would arrive at each appointment."
good,I recommend this company to anyone seeking employemnt. It's a technological and innovative company that provides many career opportunities
good,My most favorite part of my job is that I have a chance to communicate with different people everyday. I am happy that I'm able to help and serve them.
good,Great place to work but sadly management is very much so out for themselves rather than being a team type leader
good,"Working was always busy. Creating accounts and explaining new devices was a big part of the work day. Co-workers were always great. hardest part was activations. Most enjoyable was helping customers setup their new devices, and see them leave smiling"
good,"The sales floor can vary wildly from conservative to spontaneous and fun. Work consists of a multitude of different clientele that can range from funny and engaging to furious and demanding. But it's what you make of it. The managers are the same. From horrible dictators to ""team friendly"" bosses it's really random. I had several years of wretched stressed out managers who took their stresses out on the sales staff. I also experienced the kindest of bosses who bring back your hope in people. This job is a mix of repetitive daily sales goal meetings and corporate buzz words and the behind the bosses back team who works there. The hardest part of the job is leading people to spend more than they should for things they might not have a burning need for. It gives your morals a work out. But I guess that's what ""creating a need"" is all about."
good,"DIRECTV has the best satellite product in the business and in most cases much better option than cable. I travelled up to 3 weeks per month and my days were spent visiting properties, meeting with property managers and leasing agents. As a brand ambassador I learned how to host events as well as direct merchandisers to perform thier duties remotely. My management staff are very caring individuals, but they lack inter-personal skills in developing relationships. Communication was also a large issue.As with any organization, some of my co-workers were outstanding and others did not care if they were there, just a pay check. The most difficult part of my job was all of the internal fighting and mis-communication between customer service, the agents in the field and the customer themselves who did not know why everything seemed to be so hard to complete. The best part of my position was building tremendous relationships with all of my contacts in the 29 states i worked."
good,"I was hired as the Compliance Specialist. "
good,"I enjoyed speaking with customers over the phone, Some customers were very nice to speak with."
good,"Manage technician staff, look for potential opportunities for training and/or ways to achieve operational goals."
good,Great compensation and benefits while I was there. Virtually impossible to move up within the department.
good,"1. We went to at least 30 doors a day"
good,A typical day is calling on existing customer base and non-advertisers.  Consulting with current clients to create a marketing strategy for their business and providing added benefit.  Approaching non advertisers to inform them of a great products that will provide them directional and promotional presence in the the market place. Also focus on relationship building with existing clients and new. Work with teammates to help assure a plan of action for success. Also help train and mentor new hires. Serve as a point of contact when manager is not available.
good,"Very strict work environment, high stress, nice coworkers"
good,At&t is a great company to promote upward especially on the retail side of the company.  The company offers vast programs that give each representative the opportunity to build their leadership characteristic and the necessary skills to promote.
good,"I worked there many years ago so some things may changes but ultimately you are a cable installer. Uverse is very difficult in the fact that such a high bit-rate signal being sent over 30 year old twister pair copper can cause serious troubleshooting issues . I was a connectech which is like att's version of geek squad....i received no additional pay and worked extra hours on chronic trouble jobs - sucked....so don't go above and beyond, unless you love overtime. Company expectations are very unreasonable and if you did everything the way they wanted you to do it, it would take you 10hours to complete a job. Managers are ""company-men"" so they are not to be trusted - ever."
good,"Results driven company, that's why they are so successful. Typical day was non stop with customers and operational tasks. Multiple daily conference calls. I learned a great deal about coaching and developing a sales staff. Co-workers could be challenging but in the end together we got the job done. Hardest part of the job was the hours. Retail hours can be difficult; late nights and weekends and few holidays off. Enjoyable part of my job was the praise and recognition when our team was successful, it was a great payoff!"
good,aprendi a desenvolverme muy bien con migo misma y con mi cliente .
good,AT&T is a very large company with a ever changing corporate structure.  I enjoyed most of my time there.
good,Program Director and AM Managers our not helpful with advancement. The hardest part of my job is being comfortable to talk to my Program Director and Area Manager about anything.
good,Able to advance to management within 2 years. Fast paced great product.
good,"AT&T is a dynamic company with great opportunities at the management level. Union positions are very limited in terms of growth and opportunity, and are not work/life balanced. Working environments are fair to poor."
good,"Customers have a high level of expectation when placing orders for communication services within their home or business.  With millions of customers, and multiple systems those on the frontline may require additional assistance during the ordering process.  A duty to make the process seamless for the customer is mandatory. Order fallout or order error must be corrected in a timely manner with little to no customer impact."
good,"Fun environment and diversified working environment"
good,"AT&T is like a large cruise ship.  It is effective at moving in the same direction, but it difficult to change course quickly.  Change is hard to accomplish, so innovation and creativity is too often stifled."
good,"I was taking calls daily, assisiting with Billing Inquires, Changing Rate Plans, making Adjustments, and Purchaseing Items. The hardest part of the job was when my computer would freeze or act up, during a call. That would be the only thing I would say. The Call Flow wasn't anything I couldn't handle. I loved the rush. "
good,"Every day I traveled to a different cities ensuring that the Directv systems were installed properly and helping people understand and fully enjoy the best that television could offer.  Great products and great people."
good,"When it comes to training and expanding your knowledge , this job is the perfect fit. you will be given many difficult situations starting out that you will carry with you for the rest of your career. If you preform your work correctly you will learn vast trouble shooting knowledge , Efficiency with a emphasis of quality. If you want your work to be the best and run smoothly , taking the time not to shortcut is the key. A non family man this job is ideal for the fact you'll average around 80 hrs. a work week with plenty of opportunity for overtime and travel. There's zero tolerance for any violations and your expected to know how to handle your situations , u wont find much help from management on unknown issues but there other techs there become your family and offer a lot of insight. Be where your suppose to be doing what your suppose to do and you will have no troubles with the company. I would recommend them anyone that is a hard worker."
good,AT&T has become a vendor maintained network.  A shrinking number of employees still maintain parts of the network.  Most is engineered and maintained by Alcatel-Lucent and other manufacturers.
good,"Depends on where you are at and live. It really depends on what job you have with the company."
good,"Good money but no room for advancement, management is heartless"
good,"Everyday is a new puzzle to solve and offers a great challenge in which to utilize skills and logic. Very good pay and great training. Little tolerance for any mistakes and very high turnover rate. Very long hours. Benefits were disappointing, however their is fairly young but determined union that had been born that are committed to the well-being of their fellow employees. I really loved the job, however the training involved involves about three months out of state to become certified which, in conjunction with the six day weeks and 12-16 hour days can be very stressful on family and personal life."
good,"Assisting customers with thier connections to DSL interent is fun and rewarding. I enjoy having a customer tell me how patient and helpful I am. I learned that some places of business should not put pressure on employees if the main goal is Customer Satisfaction, then we should all work together to achieve that goal. Co-workers are very helpful and welcoming new agent to the floor. The whole job is overall easy to perform. "
good,Good solid company! Upper management could use more organization 
good,"Hermoso grupo,poco sueldo."
good,Working for an AT&T call center as a customer service representative was a great place to show teamwork abilities. Each team was able to win prizes once a month and we really worked together to be best by showing quality work. 
good,"Being as I work in one of their out-sourced call centers in the United States, we don't work directly for AT&T, so there is a lot of mis-communication within the workplace, however we can get the correct information regarding the proper procedure for a specific request/complaint directly from AT&T in a matter of minutes. I do feel though if I worked directly for AT&T I would have a different perspective on the company as well as management."
good,"I am responsible for taking all necessary steps to help track technicians and activities in order to ensure that company goals are met. I answer inbound calls from Directv technicians that need assistance with being placed onsite, closing work orders and assisting techs with directions when needed. I handle and resolve inbound escalation calls from Directv customers and technicians. I maintain the customer and work order database to ensure that customer appointments are met according to customer expectations and that customer questions or issues are addressed in a timely manner, and that communication with technicians is maintained throughout the business day"
good,"AT&T is honestly a great place to work. There are several areas of opportunities to grow as an employee. However, those opportunities seem to be given to those whom are completely not associated with the available position in the field. They are a company who believes in training and that training is all they need in order to make someone successful. I beg to differ, and I have my reasons. AT&T's benefits from the retail aspect are great. I currently work as a part timer and I must say, I was blessed to make more this year than I have at my previous jobs. Management does not necessarily require a degree, therefore, I am seeking a job that will recognize my worth with my two degrees. Overall Customer's are wonderful to deal with. However, there are still some who can be a challenge. This retail experience has taught me how handle hard situations and has further help me recognize my strengths and weaknesses on the job."
good,"learned alot about upcoming digital television, very busy and fast paced"
good,Worked day shift. No opportunity for advancement. Management did not seem to value employees very much or foster team environment.
good,"A decent wage, but very little room to advance with any integrity. Most internal advancement is a political game."
good,"fast paced high energy environment.Requires flexabiliy,high acheivers and people personality.Ienjoyed making my customers happy by helping them to meet their needsTthe hardset part of this job is dealing with unprofessional behavior from authority figures."
good,Standard call center: you have your cubicle with photos of your dogs or children or whatever will maintain your sanity. Customers call you screaming: my phone doesn't work. my bill's too high. I drop too many calls. I didn't know my plan didn't cover calls while in the congo.
good,"Typical workday includes applying customer payments accurately and proficiently in a timely manner. I've learned about the financial side of a corporation and how it impacts the customers. The management has to make decisions daily to accomodate changing workloads. Co-workers comply with production requirements and build teamwork environment. The job is not hard itself, just requires paying detailed attention to reduce errors. I enjoy providing customer service that goes over and beyond job duties."
good,"no work life balance, you can make a killing if you try hard."
good,High call volumes. Customers mostly angry about bills. Learned to desculate volitile clients. Management was somewhat helpful. Co-workers were extremely helpful and knolegeable. Hardest part of the job was the desculation of clients. Most enjoyable part of the jobe was being able to desculate customers and provide valuable solutions to their issues.
good,I loved my job. selling the advertising packages to the different business'.
good,This position allowed me to learn lots of things to do with coaching reps and management in general. I learned a lot of experience with supervisor calls and researching extensive issues.
good,"Taking Calls assisting customers with internet and computer issues. I am Business trained, help with IP pass-through and port forwarding. I have learned quite a bit from being employed through AT&T."
good,"Good people to work for, just wanted to be in a different location"
good,"Days are busy as we serviced customers, and reach sales qouta"
good,"Zero tolerance when it comes to attendance. If you have a reliable safety net of people to be there for you when the kids get sick; your car breaks down; etc, then this would be an awesome place to work. Inbound calls; unscripted; NO quality reviews. They're sticklers about handle time & stats, but then what call center job ISN'T. Compensation & benefits are phenomenal. Watch out for silly politics ~ don't assume management has your best interests at heart. That being said, AT&T is a great company. It just isn't a great fit for everyone. A typical day - calls, calls, calls. Customers for the most part easy to work with. Not much pressure to make sales. The work itself is a piece of cake."
good,"divertida muy unidos organizados y humanos ,, en eventos ... impulsando el produccto, a vender un producto caro, mi colegas bien mucho compañerismo, la parte dificil crearle la necesidad al cliente del producto, los eventos"
good,"I believe this is a good company to work for from the aspect of pay, benefits and paid time off. I do not believe the corporate culture is pro family as the hours are poor for individuals with families. Typically new hires work the latest shift and both Saturday and Sunday due to the company's contract with the labor union. It also takes years before any type of schedule change can occur that provides better hours and even then they still are not conducive to family."
good,"Workdays are 5-6 days a week. Begin at 7a.m. until finish. I've learned how to install cable wire in buildings for satellite tv, phone lines. Co-workers were ok. Some would help you, others wouldn't. Hardest part of my job was having to call into a call center with Indian employees and there being a language barrier. Management was poor at time. They would be sitting home at night and still try to send you out on jobs after dark."
good,Pros: good salary
good,"I learned a lot about myself and acquired and developed skills necessary to stay competitive in sales workplace. I loved interacting with new people and customers on a daily basis. The technology and constant change also kept it fun and fresh. I really enjoyed meeting all the people I've worked with in the Boston market. The Florida market went a bit different for me, so here I am looking for the next challenge."
good,"I streamline the process for customers in need of new home and mobility services in the ever-changing telecom industry. I utilize my excellent listening skills, attention to detail and communication skills to personalize the customers’ experience to ensure they receive the best solution for their specific needs. I meet and exceed very aggressive sales goals by maintaining strong product knowledge in the mobile voice and data industry which is constantly evolving. I play a vital role in growing the positive reputation of the company by working diligently to confirm customer satisfaction. I must balance and report cash drawer data at the conclusion of each shift. The hardest part of the job is formulating solutions for customers who may not be eligible for the lowest prices on new equipment, etc, as per company policy without discussing such policy with them. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning about the newest technology in the industry and conveying the accompanying benefits to others."
good,inbound call center where management is less than desired when it comes to their knowledge about procedures. So you are told to do one thing that could get you terminated. Best part is pay but you performed every duty of every other position in the company which is very demanding.
good,"The employees of this company was ok, but could have been better towards other employees and customers"
good,not a good expierence trying to sale a product in a market where the product was needed or wanted.
good,A typical day at work was challenging especially since technology is forever changing.
good,"The benefits were phenomenol, but as the years went by, job security and micro-management from Texas became a bigger and bigger issue. High stress work environment, with little work-life balance"
good,I began working at AT&T when I finished school. Then it was through a temporary agency where they employed a lot people beginning in the workforce. I enjoyed my experience there and it helped me with customer service skills.
good,"Develop new accounts and grow existing accounts utilizing advanced selling techniques to obtain desired results. Promote and market AT&T's customized solutions program to potential customers to generate increased revenue share. Execute on that marketing plan, and provide all follow up necessary to continually grow the business and build solid client relationships."
good,"Managers were great off the bat, got good hours, and co workers were good to work with. Sales was always good. Customers were very plesant."
good,Good place to work. High energy and genuwanine concern for customers concerns and needs. Managers are able to relate to employess and help employees thrive in the work place. The most difficult part of this job is late hours and weekend shifts.
good,"As a sales associate my first duty was to be on time for our training meetings. From there thats where my coworkers and I would work on how to better our saling techiniques for an hour. When our meeting is over I then go to my assgned store at a Sam's Club or a Bestbuy and sale DirecTV in a retail structure. On a typical day I would talk to over 100+ Sam's Club and Best Buy customers about the promotions and the deals that direcTv has to offer them. The hardest part of this job was to never take things personally and not get upset when customers did not buy DirecTV. Sometimes I would beat myself up when I didnt make a sale or when somebody told me no. But the part I enjoyed the most about this job was the everyday challenge of getting better everyday, I found out that I love to help people and through sales you have that oppurtunity to do so and get paid while doin it."
good,"I worked for AT&T for almost 8 yrs and there were a lot of ups and downs. The benefits and pay was great. And I loved working with most of the regular workers and most of the managers. Some had a real ego problem though. They dont give you much choice if they decide to weed out workers and you either pass certain tests and if you do, get moved to anywhere in the state to keep working for their company. I got moved 250 miles away from my family. After 2 yrs I took a buy out and it was generous, and moved back. I now wish I hadnt done it, I cant find as good a job as I had with AT&T."
good,"Lots of overtime,lots of heavy lifting at times.Management didn't communicate with the employers much."
good,"Its very comfortable for all employees since a personal desk is provided for each individual, I learned how to troubleshoot Customers issues with more depth and listen to each issue before assuming to know why they were calling, at times it was a bit hard to find a manager to assist us in completing a task that we were not allowed to override, however the overall experience and job duties were very fullfiling and enjoyed the fact that there was always a phone call to answer."
good,If you enjoy constant learning this is a good company to work for. The hardest part is they are behind the times in work/life balance.
good,"AT&T has many benefits to offer on the wireless side of the business. Great training opportunities, pension, 401k, etc. They just didn't have the yellow pages on their radar."
good,There is no Management. There is no clear goals defined. No job security. No possibility for improvement. Disorganized.
good,"This Company is great to work for, just make sure if you work in sales you never call out."
good,While working there I learned how to repair and test telephone lines. I later was promoted to do repair and maintenance for internet protocol.
good,while working with cingular wireless i never felt out of place nor alone they made me feel welcome from the first time i entered the buliding
good,good nature working over AT&T project. learnt new things and gained more knowledge in this two years. always be open to learn.  working over here is good finally
good,"Company provides many benefits and will help you grow as a person and an employee. 401k, benefits and time off are well managed and the company provides a lot of security."
good,Great staff and management helps one achieve the required goals the company acquire from employees. Learned many skills related to managing time and problems to benefit customer needs.
good,i loved working with this company because it was fun workplace and it was goal driven. I learned so much about managing people and keeping them motivated.
good,"good,flexible,Chance to learn and work on new tech.Flexible hours to work with..Followed Agile Safe.Team members are in diff timezones,hence working hours are flexibe"
good,"Amazing company to work at, great benefits and company teaches you so much about the technology aspects of growth with in the industry. Highly recommended for anyone trying to  learn about tech."
good,I was employed as a contractor in the role of a process manager.  I supported the operations team for a little over two years. I was able to have a work life balance.
good,"It was a great experience that I wish I could have extended for a much further career.  Unfortunately, my position was not longer needed and outsourced."
good,"Worked on trouble tickets and installs, while managing the next project to make sure everything was in place to meet due dates. Management was great in some aspects and not so great in others."
good,"1. Good job culture & environment "
good,"Flexibility, good benefits, I like working here. Company is currently having financial pressure due to high debt. This has been in media all over. Company is trying to reduce expenses."
good,Buena empresa y buenas prestaciones solo que en sueldos base son bajos
good,A strict attendance policy is the reason I lost my job. My husband at the time went into the hospital for a week unplanned and i had to be there for my family. I lost my job because I missed 5 days and even tho it was because my husband was in the hospital they didn’t care and even put me down as non-rehirable. They also make you use pushy tactics to convince the customer what’s best for att is what’s best for the customer even if it’s at the customer expense and doesn’t benefit them at all.
good,Great benefits and discounts offered to employees but there is no work life balance and they have a lot of unethical practices that go unaddressed when you are selling
good,"Basically you have to sell product to have a paycheck, it is beneficial if you are a social people person! Overall I enjoyed my time here as an employee..."
good,I worked there for over 7 Years and it is a great place to work for but they are always having layoffs. Never secure about your job. If your at the bottom of the seniority list than you are always looking over your shoulder because you are not safe.
good,"There is too much for me to go into about the job. Go see for yourself. :) ""The job requires a lot of dedication when it comes to learning new stuff about technology. The pay definietly makes any and all stress, worth it. """
good,"it is huge. If you are lucky, it could be enjoyable job. At the same time, the management decisions could promote group interests and be destructive. You can find anything and everything here including highly qualified people ..."
good,"The job was consistent with sales and customer walk ins. It was a good job dealing with a corporate setting but being a retailer store, the employees were helpful and fair."
good,"Change is constant and so is leadership. Multigenerational employees and management that can lead to an overload of work, meetings and conference calls."
good,"not a bad place to work, can get stressful at times, management can be better but not too bad."
good,"This is a fun company to work for if you are driven to bettering yourself and your skills. Speaking to the clients is always a wonderful experience, and helping them solve their issues always brought a smile to my face."
good,"I really enjoyed working with this company. The team was very nice. I didn't really have any bad days and what I enjoyed the most about working with at&t was just the enjoyment of talking to new people on a day to day! Again, great job, great experience!"
good,un lugar de trabajo agradable como también con su respectivo estrés laboral
good,"Do you love surpassing  sales objectives?  I also love hitting 200% of sales goals every month. But at AT&T it won’t be enough. The waste roles downhill to your managers and onward to assistant managers and they crack he whip on you for not selling enough prepaid phone insurance your not even paid nor ranked on. If you sell too many lines of business they will most likely be on you about why they weren’t business connects. I mean what?"
good,"This place is Fun, Easy, The best experience working for a job. Friendly and updated. I would love to go back. The staff is amazing for the most part."
good,Nice company to excel within. They really care about their employees. no complaints in my book. I worked there for many years and I really like the company and my team.
good,"I enjoyed working here, yes it had its up and downs but I won’t take anything away from working here. I learned so much and I feel like I made impressions on customers and the management was always available to help whether you wanted it or not. It was a good job overall would definitely work for them again but it was time to move on."
good,Great Job help me learn slot of my skills that I have today. They always have someone around if and when you need help. They are  flexible and caring.
good,"I work with good people. Pretty good benefits package. Hopefully I can reach 30 years, of service. I do enjoy what my job requires me to do. My co workers are supportive and are willing to help out at anytime."
good,I am getting calls all day from people who hate AT&T and me because I work there.. I like the people  and my team leader I work with but getting that much anger and hate from calls is soul draining.. I am good at what I do but I would like a weekend off once in awhile to spend with my new wife and I don't like thinking about driving my car off the bridge everyday on my way home..
good,A typical day at work would consist of dealing with issues and sales. Management was helpful when it came to training and the culture was very diverse.
good,"I worked at at&t for over 15 years and was very happy much of that time. As with most technology companies, there is constant change with products and technology as well as within the company via organizational and operational changes. Towards the end of my career with at&t, I feel like the pressure and stress to sell products and services that were not really the right fit for customers to keep up with increasing sales demand as well as constant bulling by upper management to maintain performance lead to me needing to walk away from a company I was with most of my adult life. Customer service and assessing customer needs was the focus when I first started with the company and now I am fairly certain that sales and performance how outweighed customer satisfaction."
good,"Nice and fun place to work at. Working environment is stress free and you will get the all the support that you rquire."
good,"Great teamwork and pay. However, micromanage some managers were not excited to help with some of the calls especially when we had to escalate some of the calls."
good,"I found the training you  through to be come a sales representitive to be extremely valueable in all aspects of my life. You learn how to truly interact with customers. If you work for a corporate store your experience will be nice. "
good,If you are looking for a fun and youthful place to work in then AT&T is the best place to work in. I liked it but to be very honest with you it was not what I was looking for. I am more corporate and more hands on.
good,This is a good starter job for someone looking to get into the sales field. You need good communication skills and can’t be afraid to talk to people. Overall I enjoy the job so far
good,You are just a number here. As soon as wireless technology is perfected you will be let go. Weak union in a dying technology field. I would not recommend becoming a technician here. Look for a real trade.
good,"Used knowledge and passion to deliver an effortless customer service experience while pursuing challenging and rewarding goals"
good,"typical day  would be meeting to review goals and Metrix  for the team and to discuss avenues to improve on company set goals, benefits were good. bonuses also when your were able to meet the requirements"
good,Great company and fun to work for. Tons of opportunities for advancement. Decent hourly rate of pay as well. Don't have really any complaints about them.
good,"Las comisiones no llegaban completas ni a tiempo, en caso de que llegase a la meta el salario se eliminaba para darme exactamente lo que comisione en el plazo predeterminado (era lo mismo que lo que tocaba de quincena pero sin comisión)."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work, however, the opportunities for advancement are very slim. They have been very good about balancing work and home activities which makes the work tolerable."
good,"Life at AT&T is just about the same as any other company, hard work pays off. To survive the annual layoffs you have to consistently improve your skill set"
good,"AT&T was a great company to work for. As a technician, the pay is above competitors in the same field. Healthcare is great and company provides an extensive package, as well as a good 401k program."
good,Very professional and an interesting job. Customers were sometimes irate but mostly they were easy to deal with. Supervisors informative and knowledgeable
good,"Good company to work with, Enjoy working here, Good facility, Good infrastructure, friendly colleagues and Eco friendly campus "
good,It’s a good place to work. I spent many years there working with a lot of great people.  The company really looking top people to work there so it won’t be easy if you don’t have the right education now days. When I started it was a lot easier. Good luck if you apply.
good,Great place love to be there would love to work a flexible schedule long as you make ur 40 hours will be the greatest thing they could offer would bring in so mine great employees
good,AT&T took over DirecTV while I was an employee. Directv was much better before. The amount of appreciation that they gave employees was much better before the merger.
good,So long you do your job activities they leave you along if you get a new manager or manager in training they try to impress upper levels and give you lots of issues even if you do your job
good,"Tener un gerente y personal bien capacitado"
good,Sales jobs are increasingly stressful. After a while it is easy to become burned out. As long as you are able to stay self motivated you will do well.
good,Learned how to co-ordinate with folks from onshore and how to work on a 24 hour 7 days a week project. Work starts from late afternoon and continues till midnight.
good,Fue un trabajo sencillo  y el ambiente de trabajo es cordial.  Con prestaciones de ley y cumplieron con el horario que me ofrecieron
good,"I learned more about helping others in my experience working with AT&T. The job was fun and fast pace, but I had been pregnant at the time and kept falling asleep. Yet a great place to work."
good,You will learn everything you need to know about becoming a tech. The job can be strenuous at times but the pay is good. Long work hours and out in the elements sometimes.
good,Gained knowledge of the cell phone industry. Learned troubleshooting skills and how to fix software related issues.  Learned marketing and sales oriented goals.
good,Es una empresa en constante cambio que cada vez reduce mas los beneficios de los empleados y aumenta las exigencias
good,Es una buena compañía para trabajar me fuera quedado pero pasaron cosas personales
good,"start at 7 am no end time, work until task is completed on your feet for more then 8 hours a day in crawl spaces. lunch time 30 mins, compensation ok for area of living."
good,"The job is not hard, pay is decent. Lots of people with high seniority make it hard to get a workable schedule, which throws off my work/life balance."
good,"I really enjoyed working with AT&T. I was part of the B2C campaign and we had to go Door to Door to make our sales. There is a minimum number of sales that you're expected to make per week which is not hard to do if you pay attention to your coaches and training when you start out. If you're stuck and having difficulties making your sales you have the opportunity every day to get with one or more coach to pinpoint the issues that you're having and help you overcome them. Overall I would say it's really a cool place to work, the atmosphere is positive and there are people who are there to help you when you need it. If you are in the process of Law School or looking for any sort of government work I would suggest getting your own Soliciting permits and the company does not provide them."
good,I was hired to sell ATT products.  The company has a very fair compensation package. I would recommend this position for anyone looking to achieve workplace success through commissioned sales.
good,"Exciting place to work, many new initiatives which come with constant change. AT&T (At This Time) Which is good and Bad. Once you get something figured out, it changes."
good,Week to week changes in focuses and management stills paired with the constant moving around of its managers make art interesting but not a job one might one to have for ever
good,Great job. Great money. If you can get employed here. Its life changing money. You can really get your life in a great direction. But they expect alot in return. There is no missing days. Or calling in
good,It was a great place to work when you had the right team. Management is great most of the time. You have a semi-flexible schedule and there is room for advancement. I would suggest working here.
good,"Por ser cambaceo, tu ganabas bien mientras más vendias."
good,Good place to work caring staff fast past management is great and cares about the employees pay could be a little better takes a awhile before you get a raise
good,just a job come get work and leave you might get a lunch most of time you dont .dispatcher dont the area that we work in sent you way out you area. It not fun place to work I have work for at other company that enjoy work there.
good,It's easy to find a place in a large company. There are many opportunities to find your best fit. Most who work there continue to be satisfied through many years.
good,"Participated in 6 surplus events in the last three years.  Good company but you need to be aware of desire to reduce headcount."
good,I do not want to complete this section. I do not feel reviewing my current company anonymously is appropriate. Forcing me to enter something here isn't the best way to get information.
good,Great Benefits but time off is based off seniority and a lot of people retire from the company which makes it hard to get holidays off. Other than that great company
good,Good work tempo. My overall experience with the company was very well received. As a high school student at the time my experience was very informative and gave me an insight into the overall daily operations in the telecommunication industry.
good,Few opportunities for advancement but at the same time was able to work on very interesting projects. Company is concentrating in only few locations around the country
good,"Muy buena empresa para trabajar, buen paquete de compensaciones."
good,"The actual job is not bad. Did not like the constant push for phone sales that made good reps work under pressure but, other than that, the 6 month shift the job is not a good thing all. Job provides a pleasant work atmosphere. Pay is now descent."
good,"I work hard at my job. But at the end of the day no matter my good performance, i am just a number on a seniority list. This company needs to take care of their employees better."
good,I have worked for this company for afive years now and really don't have any complaints. I enjoy working with the team that I work with on a day to day basis. only wish that the company had a better chance of advancement. I've held the same position for five years.
good,"I loved working at AT&T and would happily go back. Although it was a stressful place to work, I have yet to find anywhere else willing to pay what they did with the benefits and time off. The upper management does seem to have a plan but lower management reporting up doesn't explain the needs of the business and just agrees to whatever task is given and creates more stress for everyone involved."
good,"buen ambiente laboral capacitacion constante, buen horario, estimulos economicos"
good,"I worked for the mobility division.  I was very good at my job. I enjoyed my job and had average support. You have to be very resourceful and I am so I did not have issues with getting info. I enjoyed working there and enjoyed the team mates I worked with."
good,tienen un buen ambientes la boral el suelo me parece correcto para las horas de trabajo
good,"Trabajo bajo presión."
good,"Problem solving, technical support, face to face customer service, commission environment. I loved it. I was one of the best at doing this multiple hat wearing challenging job."
good,At&t is a great company to work for if you are a single person. They are not flexible enough if you have a family. They offer great  benefits and pay a great wage.
good,Always plenty of work to keep us more than busy.  Work/life balance was very good.  Lots of training available to take.  Enjoyed my time with the company.
good,I had learned slot of customer service experience at at&t not only am I taking calls doing customer service but also In person . I’ve learn the diversity on some customer service due to the individuals that come in the store .
good,Had a great experience with all of those I worked with and had much respect for the customers I came into contact with. I had to relocated because of school
good,Alot of waiting for customers. Mangers always micromanages. Had some fun activities. Commission was great at first but now its way way less than before.
good,I enjoyed the job very well to care the customers they enjoyed that they did not like the customer service especially with an American company talking to foreigners that was our problem in house was dealing with foreign people when we call in to get things fixed on our end or the customers and
good,Not very fast at my location and it was easy to learn to sell phones there. Training was online. Management was fair. Hardest part of the job is selling Directv
good,"Great place to work, days vary from being busy or slow never boring. Every store has a bit of a different culture so it may be something to adjust to depending on who you work with."
good,They try to make it as fun as possible by with  parties and game rooms. Truth is you take calls back to back all day fixing peoples problems that are usually caused by an error from the company. IT is mentally exhausting but they pay very well and have amazing people that work there.
good,"Good workplace culture. Flexible to work. Great client interaction and fun workplace. fast moving environment with good advancement opportunities.Easy Going to stay employed. Great supervisor."
good,"it was good working with AT&T through Amdocs,nice work culture and should be ready to accept challenging tasks.The perks and rewards (including team events, food (yes, it's free), swag, and culture make it an enjoyable place to be."
good,Only downfall to working with them is that they want to take presidence over your life when you're there.  It doesn't matter to them if you have a sick child or a flat it's still a point.
good,"Got a chance to learn a lot in my professional career, especially in dealing with technical challenges and resolving them effectively. I would recommend anyone to work there!"
good,Telecomm is where it is.   Loved the travel in the field. Id recommend anyone.   Great pay and great benefits  att is good employer.  And they train in areas you may need help in
good,"AT&T provides opportunity to grow and develop. The politics could be overbearing at times. Overall, the culture is inclusive and supportive however lacing in amenities."
good,Try to be on time always remember to deal with the customers with respect be professional at all times get the job done in a timely matter never panic on the job.
good,It was just another job. politics paly a huge role when it comes to advancing. I would recommend them overall than any other provider due to good customer service.
good,Good place to work in. Management very supportive and helpful. I will recommend working for this company. But outsourcing can happen anytime and you have to be prepared for that
good,Was a good job and really love. The people and management were good. Leadership  did come down on the ones who made mistakes and didn't get the opportunity to try again and learn from it which in my case makes a person better.
good,"The work culture is good . Good hold of company in US , India and other countries . Management is helping and good perks are being given to the employees ."
good,"little work life balance, stress from above to perfom at all costs with no assistance. new ideas are pushed thru with little notice. We know it will fail and still accountable"
good,This environment specifically the New York market sales and goals competitiveness is to demanding does not allow a work life balance for managers and does not seem to have a direction or a reason behind goals and expectations
good,Engineering organization very exciting place to learn and use your talents until headcount reduction takes place which happens 1 to 2 times a year so you are always waiting for the axe to fall.
good,"El sueldo fue bueno, y las prestaciones también. Tienen flexibilidad de horarios para estudiantes."
good,"Es una empresa con muy buenas prestaciones, lo malo es que su crecimiento laboral es a largo plazo, aprendes mucho sobre las diferentes marcas de telefonía, y se preocupan por su personal"
good,A stable company with good pay and benefits. The company is consistently rated among to he top of the most admired and best places to work.  They strive to be socially responsible.
good,"Culture✓ management experience ✓ "
good,"They are trying desperately to find work arounds with the union so they're only hiring terms and because of that your jobs is always at risk... one day they tell you ok this is your 3 week notice then 6 days later it's "" o wait we're keeping 3 of you""then 3 days later ""nevermind we're keeping all of you then nevermind your all gone"
good,"The commission structure keeps changing within the company. I used to get a really good check, but now it’s gotten much lower. My role also changed because they got rid of that ultimate position."
good,A typical day would consist of going inside a big market store such as Sams club or Walmart. but first have a meeting at the office and then drive there set up stand and cold call.
good,"Good company overall. Good pay and great benefits. Being one of the largest companies, there are a lot of corporate rules. There are positions you can transfer to, but no job security."
good,Mostly a good place to work except for the feeling of being strung along with very limited opportunity to gain a permanent position past contract term.
good,"A typical day consists of taking jobs from a random pool of available customers from your IPad. Call the customer, drive to their home, and quickly analyze best route to wire/setup the service. Each home is different, thus you must figure out the best way to complete it in limited time frame. Managers check-in frequently and are constantly on after you about your ""numbers"". Employees must cover themselves in write ups after a job is complete to avoid consequences. "
good,"Even tho my time at AT&T was good, room for growth within the retail side of it was not motivating enough to counting in this sector of AT&T.   Things change rapidly and over time the sales Reps made less and less money overall."
good,"AT&T is a professional environment. Workers are treated with respect. The biggest challenge over the last 8 years has been dealing with a sluggish, brittle culture, where little management feedback is given. The pay is competitive, but advancement opportunities are difficult to find."
good,The company had great pay structure in the past and now the amount it pays people the the store is way less than other workers like in home experts or kobile events team for the same product letting the retail side pretty much die
good,"Good company to work for. Work-life balance can be an issue, especially if you work at the management level. Great benefits and if you love technology, great place to learn about it and enjoy it."
good,"Great company to work for, however not too much work life balance."
good,"it is I nice place to work  they offer several things for employees to unwind like ping pong, basketball court,  and xbox to play. is a fast paced environment"
good,"I love that AT&T provides benefits like 50% off wireless and Internet service and $10 cable service. The work environment is very fun, casual, and updated on technology. You will definitely stay up to date with the latest info on devices and products as well. I just feel the area managers and Vice Presidents make the work environment stressful for managers when quotas aren’t met, which makes it stressful for the sales representatives. Other than that the job itself is great."
good,hay un buen ambiente de trabajo entre los compañeros
good,"Good benefits and constant changes and makes it challenging , Also has you constantly learning. Which was great and traveling is a part too . Meet great people working there"
good,"AT&T has a wonderful pay with Awesome benefits being employed with them. It’s really great to set your foundation, that way you can plan more out in career with them"
good,Love making sure the client is happy. Period!!!! Willing to help a fellow employee when needed. Was always on time to work. Dont believe in making excuses I make solutions
good,"Great place to see and hear about new phones and other devices coming out before anyone else."
good,"I have been working with AT&T for over a year now, and its great, benefits are amazing, hours aren't that bad, sales are good. Just wish the pay was a little more."
good,Good company to work for as long as senior management is on your side. The company follows a strict sales process that they want you to follow with every customer which is sometimes unreasonable. Sales targets are usually fairly attainable depending on the month.
good,"Typical sales job, includes face to face and web meetings with customer, spreadsheets, contract work, product and company training.  Good perks like free Direct Tv, half off cell bill, half off security system and decent health benefits."
good,The nature of this business has changed significantly since I worked there.  I worked in Network Operations development.  This company now focuses on Wireless services.
good,"work most of the day with customers. learn inventory, customer service, time management, coaching. workplace culture depends on the location. Hardest part of the job is the work life balance. most enjoyable part of the job is the people."
good,"This was a great company to work for. If hadn’t divorced and moved home I would still been there. This job taught me how to love people for who they are. Truly. First time I ever moved away from family and saw different things. This job was a start that taught me in and open ended questions, ask for help. Do your job at your best team work was a real good part here"
good,Interesting work- new technologies and on the start of new programs and services.  Great commute to office and a great deal of knowledge of environment co-workers.
good,"They’ve had layoffs all year definitely wouldn’t recommend. No opportunity for advancement either, layoffs due to guys that were actually sick that used their sick time just to get laid off not worth it."
good,"Great job with good benefits and pay vacation days and sick days as well as personal days. "
good,Lame stuck me in a back room for months to train while staring at a computer and then stuck me in the slowest volume store expecting big things. No hands on training and the pay was terrible.
good,productive and Fun working place. Had great times working with co workers always help full when needed.Knowledge transfers are easy and co operative.Good Work environment
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. They also provide great perks and has  a fun environment. They offer greta training so you never had to feel unprepared going into the position you applied for.
good,"Product and entertainment services sold to meet daily goals are attainable. Great way to build customer service skills, and move forward in a career path"
good,"A great company to work for, lots of opportunities to move up the ladder. Typically, begin the day working by yourself and may end up working into the night often getting a lot of overtime. Occasionally work with co-workers to resolve circuit issues."
good,"My review went wonderfully.Employees were respectful, friendly and willing to help with anything. The employees were always polite and I felt that they respected me for the very good job I was doing for them."
good,"The AT&T side of the business is awesome, the third party company however sold out with out telling us and forces us to work for another company which believed in not paying their reps over 9.25 an hour. I was making 16.50 per hour and was forced to quit or take the pay cut."
good,"Sale driven company. If you are not able to sell and properly inform customers of the benefits that the company has to offer to them, then you will not find interest working here. Great company, many incentives."
good,"As a contractor, I worked with a lot of permanent employees that were fun and supportive.  However I did not find the same level of expertise among members that I typically find in my contract positions.  In particular the management was not able to grasp project and technical ideas without some high level presentations."
good,"At&t provided job advancement, educational  and training opportunities for their employees. Pay and benefits exceeded many companies. Take advantage of the education opportunities."
good,"Work Culture is Great , they have good process."
good,good place to work just stressful. The pay was fair but they were really strict on their policy on their breaks. Some times you couldn't help going on break late
good,"as a young and vibrant cyber security auditor and risk assessor I was both excited and shocked to have had the opportunity to work there."
good,"I wanted to get more into technology, rather than sales. The income was really good, but the sales pressure was not quite what I was looking for. Strongly recommend for sales people."
good,"Good organization to work for. Not many opportunities for advancement without relocating. However still a good organization to work for, especially if you are willing to possibly relocate."
good,"very competitive, high pay and high paced. But no work life balance, poor management in some locations and high turnover rate. No paid sick time, vacation must be used for planned procedures. Excessive point system, lasts over 1 year. Poor disciplinary system. Sales quotas are reasonable."
good,"Would do it again if I had the opportunity. I really enjoyed the job. I recommend doing it if you can. Fun, different, and you never know what the next day will bring"
good,ATT is a good place to work and is moving towards the usage of more open source tools. The company has some of the most amazing telecommunications experts I have ever seen.
good,"I really enjoyed my job as a wire technician. The pay and benefits were amazing and there was something new to look forward to every day. Each job location made for a completely different challenge and added to the experience of really working in the field. The only downside to the job are the very long hours, often worked mandatory overtime, and management can sometimes be overbearing."
good,"Normal workday we worked, sold devices, diversity, Store is a authorize retailer so it is not a lot we could do. The pay checks you can not make a living off of it."
good,"I joined AT&T in the mid 2000.  As is the norm today, change was driving the adoption of new technologies...from Frame, Broadband VPNs, Hosting and remote hands data center services to Virtualization, MPLS, Wireless Broadband and new devices like the iphone, Cloud (PaaS, SaaS, IaaS), application services.  I managed client relationships  in a portfolio of business accounts.  Changes every year, year over year.  Business models change as do AT&T offerings and the business units needed to deliver the offerings.  I learn a lot.  Enjoyed my time there."
good,"AT&T offer great pay and benefits, most coworkers are also friendly and willing to help. However the management team in the store are not efficient and being I rule I talk style."
good,"fun fast environment, Meet new people, work alone, Outdoor work in all elements, Can be laid back at time and extremely busy at others. Job load is usually very high so plenty of jobs"
good,I enjoyed my time at the call center. I did miss the face to face interactions with customers however this job suited my needs at the time.  I could have advanced but we ended up moving to a different city.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo de AT&T no es estable, en unos momentos el ambiente es bueno y en otros es un abiente tosco y tenso."
good,"La verdad es que la empresa tiene buenas prestaciones, y las capacitaciones y ambiente laboral son muy buenos. Pero tiene muchas fallas en ser excesivamente burocrática lo que dificultad tu trabajo e incluso tus propios trámites dentro de la empresa al punto de lo abusivo."
good,"Good career opportunities and opportunity for growth within company"
good,The store I work at is very slow. A lot of fraud so charge backs will accrue. Very unorganized! No training after new hire training. No  leadership! t
good,"a typical day at work would be start with a meeting greet the employees and plan for the day, encourage and be energetic to motivate the employees for a great sale day"
good,"Definitely a grind out sales position! The job requires a lot of dedication, hard work, and an outgoing personality to speak with potentials customers at events."
good,I enjoyed working at this location however sales weren't realistic for the area. I did feel the bonus program was a great incentive for employees to help with compensation since overall productivity was low due to rural area.
good,"It was a great place to work--until they started with all the layoffs. Even if you're not on the cut list, the work environment becomes stressful, since you will be required to take on additional work from those that are laid off, even before they are gone."
good,"The technician roll at ATT requires you to think quickly on your toes, working safely at all times, culture can be improved for better morale at times."
good,"Great company, employees, benefits and compensation. Things are always changing which is expected to keep up with the customer demands and competition."
good,"friendly people and easy to learn new things even if you are not a tech savvy person. it has good pay and it can be competitive for commission based money, but still a friendly type of competition."
good,"AT&T used to be a great company to work for. However, lately, senior leadership seems to be losing its way. The company used to be ranked among the top companies to work for. Now, it's only rated that way for select groups of people. They've made poor decisions in purchasing DirecTV and now Time Warner. Sure hope they can turn the ship around."
good,"If you can find a great work group, where the favoritism is a low, I believe the overall environment would be better.  The hardest part of the job is consistently proving that you are good enough.  The best part of the job are the compensation and benefits.  Through my years with AT&T, I've learned that you have to document, document, document because you have to cover your own back."
good,The job is ok. I learned splicing fiber optic cables as well as copper phone lines. There are many aspects on the good side associated with the fiber splicing.
good,The team I got to work with at AT&T was great unfortunately due to constant re-org in the company Job Advancement and Security is very poor your time there can range from 6 months to at best 3-4 years regardless of how good your performance is.
good,"I have met incredible people since I'ven working here. Management is unpredictable, one day you are doing a great job and the next one your performance is not enough. Overall I think its a great fit for someone how's trying to figure out what to do next. I am a part-time associate so the benefits are not really a big part of the perks you can get with this position."
good,Its a job that would be great in my area if it had not laid off so many people.  I refused to relocate so I got laid off.  That all I can say about the job
good,"My typical day at AT&T was tumultuous, but fulfilling."
good,"it is a good company with great benefits, Demands are high based on  the pay. Work life can be a challenge at times. The numbers are the most important thing"
good,"loved working as a prem tech, learned a lot of stuff and got to meet different people each day.  This job is good for the person that wants to be outside a lot and working on their own."
good,Moved more to the  new generation and have moved away from the lifestyle that help build the company is now. AT&T has moved away from being the greatest Telephone company to a company that is focused on multi media.
good,Good place to start a career but can be stressful if not meeting company goals. Very strict attendance policy! If you're not an on-time person please don't apply.
good,Learned a lot.  It is great Fortune 500 company to work for.  You can go far with AT&T.  I met a lot of great leaders and co workers from across the company.
good,"I made a good living, learned a lot and met/worked with a lot of great people there. Ideally I could have stayed longer but due to circumstances beyond my control that wasn’t possible.  My coworkers were like family to me.  There was very little flexibility but that wasn’t an issue for me."
good,data and voice sales professional.  Corporate Account Manager role always responsible for getting referrals and provide customer cost savings analyses
good,"If you like dealing with people and problems and have personal sense of acknowledgment doing it, this is the right place. I would recommend you to go to Corporate side, it's better."
good,"Interesting and diverse work."
good,AT&T tries very hard to keep their employees invested in the company. However as a result of the consistent purchasing of other companies they tend to over extend themselves which leads to an abundance of surplusing employees to meet the banks obligations.  Over all: a good company to work for.
good,"Good place to work , new technology .. new initiatives are happening . Great learning for telecom industry . Working on the digital online sales team .."
good,Management afforded me the opportunity to grow as a leader by using a hands-off approach and providing support when requested and guidance as needed on new projects.
good,"As I contractor for 3 years in order to make it my manager moved me to a testing team which I had no experience but he thought I would be a good fit and learned something new which I loved but it was at the end of the contract and ATT didn't made me perm."
good,"buen ambiente, siempre al pendiente de sus trabajadores y buena calidad de equipos ventas etc."
good,"A typical day included data entry, analysis & research of expenses.  I was able to learn new software/corporate systems, e.g., Business Objects, Oracle.  As far a management, the style was not to micro-manage which was a plus.  The work culture was friendly and helpful.  The hardest part of the job was the transitioning to new corporate systems.  The most enjoyable part of the job was increasing my work experience and skills."
good,"Not going to write a review in a public forum, my view points may not be the same for others. They’re a Fortune 500 company that comes with benefits, and room to grow"
good,Not bad if your really foos at customer service and can make bonuses. But the rewards are too small for the amount of work. It has been years so these things may have changed.
good,"I worked for Cingular Wireless, not AT&T. I have no idea what how the companies but, as Cingular Wireless was absorbed and the only remaining remnant is the orange color... i would assume it is very different."
good,Working for a big client is always challenging and interesting.We get to learn interesting things.We get to work on Big Projects and get accustomed for challenging work.
good,AT&T provides good benefits and allows productive sales reps an opportunity to stay for a long time. There is a lot of competition with telecom sales.
good,Would love to go back but they don’t allow you time to build a family although the benefits were amazing management was very poor and would have you do things for them and yet throw you under the bus when things go wrong
good,"The work and culture at AT&T labs was great. The people were smart and accomplished; everyone was collaborative and delivery focused, yet relaxed. Timeframes were set and known in advance and there was rarely any mission creep. This led to a very good work-life balance for everyone. The only drawback was the compensation, which was way low."
good,Was a place to work for a little while in order to buy time in between employment opportunities. It wasn't really that bad but no benefits were offered.
good,"AT&T is a good organization to learn due to complex IT systems and their interactions. AT&T does not care much for it contracted resources and treats them as expendable resources, firing or hiring them at will."
good,With seniority you can pick your schedule and vacation time. I enjoyed the people I worked with and our customers. I learned a lot and the days went by quickly.
good,"AT&T was a fantastic employer for the majority of my 25+ years.  Unfortunately, a job site consolidation required me to relocate to an undesirable location, prompting my departure."
good,"AT&T is professional organization which provided me opportunity to learn programming, database skills and other necessary tools to be a good IT professional."
good,The place I worked for the other colleagues like myself treated each other like family and stuck by your side through the good and the bad. Everyday going to work was never really a struggle but sometimes others would make it hard depending on certain situations. Hours went by Seniority which is fine in that aspect because that was known before getting an acceptance letter.
good,many times working was not to satisfy the need of the customer but was to satisfy the needs of the bottom line. Make the quota and neglect the needs of what the customer is truly wanting.
good,"Learned how an office actually runs, food trucks came in, you learn how to complete projects, flexible, could work from home, got out of office frequently"
good,It was nuce working for a company whose name everyone recognizes. Customers trusted the produst being sld due to the name behind it. Didnt’t take much when a customer came into the store to pitch the product. Marketing theough commercials on television took care of the promotion of the product for us! Smile using natural sales ability and the cuatonwr was always leaving with a purchase.
good,Not any work/life balance for anyone without a few years of seniority. Management goes unchecked in their actions. Otherwise you drive your own money.
good,Awesome fu cool place loved it showed great care for employee helped me learn a lot a lot a lot so much it was outstanding just a great place to work at
good,good and fun environment. no pressure can be felt. all hard work is worth it. nice superiors. friendly and approachable. well conditioned tools and computers.
good,"Good pay, great atmosphere, lots of incoming phone calls, great paid time off and vacation perks. Opportunity for bonuses. Great trainers for your on the job training"
good,"The environment was good on most days, however, the management team wasn't fully open or truthful about employees benefits. Commissions were always changing."
good,The director I work for is a really terrific manager and person.  His organization is consistently the best performing one I have seen/worked in.  He fosters a good vibe in his team that contributes to the success of team as a whole -people work together toward common goals and help each other to grow.
good,"The typical day is full of ambiguity and rapidly changing priorities and project scopes.  Lots of hand holding for assigned teams doing the work."
good,"The days were all same, stressful, each minute we were watched, mgt remotely listened in, training was good, but customer service, inbound call dept not enjoyable. Mgt cared too pushy for their goals. Not how staff felt. If a minute late, penalized. Given warnings 2nd time. All day, attached to headset n computer taking incoming irate customer calls and resolving disputes, collect past dues, diffusing angry customers whose phones were shut off by AT&T for non payment. Evening n weekend hrs required and wouldn't change even after a year or 2. Hard to advance. Based on seniority, lots of senior reps. Werent able to talk much to others. Learned a few techniques about phone billing, fraud. Management had the best jobs, they mostly monitored us reps n only took calls if a customer was real irate n that sometimes was a negative point on the rep who couldn't diffuse the customer themselves. The best time of the day was lunchtime. An hour away, with colleagues, fun break."
good,Very supportive Management Team. Employees were great to work with. I was an integral part of the Team although I was a Independent Contractor.  I was able to apply my technical expertise in Telephony to my work and assist  other Team members.
good,"Pay is below average, compensation is poor, management is poor. Layoffs are frequent and the decisions are made at high levels and are very impersonal."
good,Good Union job but an insane amount of micramagement. Good benefits. Raises every year due to union. Paid time off. Healthcare. 401k. Tuition reimbursement.
good,The workforce on site at the Foundry is mostly entry level. The myriad of process experts tend to be at the top of mid-career. Management is at the top of their game in education and physically. I believe it is an excellent atmosphere to cut your teeth professionally while in a fun upbeat culture.
good,"The clients are entering most of the day in the store, I used to receive them and then, politely, I asked them if I could help with something and then they told me what they needed and I guided them with an executive who could help them."
good,I enjoy working for AT&T and think it is not a bad place to work.  The corporate culture is not for everyone though.  Work life balance is not always cared for.
good,"The employees not in management are great. Management on the other hand is unlearned, underhanded and conniving who lack morals. Its an occult. The input from the workers who handle the daily tasks are disregarded and tantamount to the downward spiral of operations that lead to big payouts to vendors. They layoff those who question unwarranted and ill agreed to terms with vendors."
good,"good place for work."
good,"I would go door to door in neighborhoods and sell at&t products such as cable,cellphones, and internet. I also interviewed on behalf of the company and my turn over ratio was amazing. I trained dozens of people."
good,Productive work environment that allows me to learn and grow in the IT world. The best part about my job is actually being able to interact with client and see the satisfaction it brings them when I complete my job.
good,"Pro and cons "
good,"Company has changed very much in the past 2 years. Which I dont have a problem with change, its inevitable. Work life balance is not bad in my opinion. Very sales driven company, which if you signed up for the company you should have known that from get go. Seems very hard to move up in the company. My opinion is it depends on who you know. Striclty my opinion."
good,"Fun, lots of giveaways, call load can be very heavy at times. People are nice to work with and willing to help if permitted. Clean office with all types of games and lounge rooms to refresh."
good,I have worked as a contractor for AT&T for almost 10 years in various positions. I had no issues with my positions other than how they would terminate the contracts.
good,"Good folks. very competitive and lots of pressure to attain sales goals."
good,"Typical work day was very fast paced and high energy."
good,It was great pay but having to change schedules every six months and the way the customers talked to you was the most stressful part of the job. I left because I have a child and wasn't able to get a baby sister at night
good,Traffic is slowing due to online options. Clients are keeping devices longer than ever before. New lines are few and far between unless ported in as new lines from alternative carriers.
good,Great job with great benefits.Trained on everything you need and rest you learn on the job. You gain experience and knowledge in the industry. Just not long term for me. No advancement was available in my area.
good,Hard to advance as a CSR. A lot of the positions were temporary. Management was great and worked with your schedule when issues arise. No real complaints tho.
good,"A typical day started with a meeting with managers where we would discuss the day's plan.  Managers led from the front, and made themselves constantly available to workers.  Snacks and refreshments were made available daily.  The work environment was a bit outdated in terms of facilities and equipment, however, ATT was making updates and upgrades as I was preparing to leave so things are probably a bit different now.  Hardest part of the job was the non-stop influx of customer issue calls.  If you arent a technical person then dont work in a technical work environment.  If you are a technical person, ATT is definitely the place for you.  Overall, ATT seemed like a pretty badass company to work for irregardless of technical prowess.  If you want to be there ATT will spend the time and money to train you properly and make sure you are successful."
good,"Great place to start your career, never had any issues working here. Pay is sufficient enough for early on in you career but plenty of room to grow in the company if willing to put in the effort"
good,OK company to work for. Decent commission. I would definately recommend this company to other prospective applicants. Pay is really dependent on your retail skills.
good,"Consult and advise clients. Demonstrated problem solving skills in problem recognition, research, isolation and resolution, technical research and troubleshooting."
good,"Worked as a project manager "
good,The diversity was awesome! The fact that they offered insurance for domestic partners was very much appreciated and many employees were able to take advantage of this benefit.
good,"Would be a great company to retire from if more advancement opportunity were offered locally."
good,"Great working environment in general; except for the new management that disregard one's knowledge and professional aspirations. Good paid vacation days, flexibility."
good,"The lack of job security was the biggest issue I had with them during my time as a manger, I survived well into a dozen labor cuts until the last one in 2013."
good,Great company with a lot of opportunity to grow and develop. There was a lot of change and you are expected to work long hours .  However it is a good experience.
good,Job was overall a good fit. If I wasn't laid off I would still be there. I would come into work and full day was focused around sales and learning new technology.
good,Great company to work for.  Compels sound ethics and transparency.  Positive inflection for all professionals of accomplishment for all levels of professionals in various careers.
good,"Workplace depends upon local leadership. Attendance is very strict, Leaders are sometimes underprepared for position, Pay was hourly and commission based."
good,"it was a challenging job, get to meet new people. hard work decent pay decent benefits. Typically the other techs are good people. managers are well...managers."
good,"Ok for a contract gig--not sure I would want to work here fulltime.   "
good,At&t was an excellent retail experience. I worked in the Mesilla Valley Mall in Las Cruces new Mexico. Great pay great benefits. I would work there again
good,Good environment with challenges to positively enhance employees' skills. Medium paced environment. Good working atmosphere and a good opportunity to develop in person and over the phone communication skills.
good,"Good place to work. one can learn a lot as its a technology savvy environment. Lot of initiatives, so good scope to diversify and upgrade ones skill sets."
good,Working here was fun and a learning experience. I personally wouldn't go back because I'm more interested in the food and beverage industry. Still a good work environment.
good,"Dedicated and committed / Honesty and Integrity / Perfectionist and result driven / Strong Analytical and communicative skills / Collaboration and Teamwork / Ability to utilize processes, tools and good practices to provide best customer service."
good,Overall a good place to work. very strict in policy. Must maintain a good working relationship with your co workers especially management or life can be hectic to say the least.
good,Loved the job and department I worked in. Actually loved the company. Sad the love not reciprocal. AT&T eager to outsource to other countries and close offices and lay off long time employees.
good,"I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work for AT&T.  I have experienced some great challenges, projects and co-workers.  However, I insist that I have the right to say ""No Further Comment.""."
good,I enjoy working for AT&T. I enjoy the people that I work with. I don't think they pay enough from a commissionable aspect. They constantly reduce the commission structure and employee lazy people who don't want to work hard for there money.
good,"I come to work and go through metal detectors and put my belonging in a plastic bag with my name on it. Then its stored in a locker, security check bags going in and out of the facility."
good,"- customers are have high sense of immediacy"
good,"What I remember is this was a fast pace environment, with a lot of customer escalation.  We changed ownership twice while I was there, through mergers made the work environment unstable."
good,"Check the network on all servers that have e-mail alerts in the A&T 13 state platform. "
good,first real job in the corporate relm....pay and benefits were great...there were a thousand of us in the one building but we were treated as individuals.
good,"It can be stressful sometimes,  a lot of pressure on performance.  Work isn't hard once you learn it. All tools and equipment provided. Can't be afraid of heights or crawl spaces."
good,Good company to work with with excellent teams working on cutting edge technologies that will help you grow in your career. Knowledgeable people to work with.
good,I really enjoy working there for the duration that I did. My team was more like a family and they genuinely cared. We really Incorporated our personalities in the sales process to make it feel more realistic and a pleasurable experience.
good,"It was a good job, however like any place there was area for improvement. I would recommend working there to other. Just not in the department I was in"
good,I worked at AT&T for nineteen years in multiple positions. AT&T as a whole has great benefits and overall work environment. Downside is the constant layoffs.
good,"The days went back quickly, everyone got along and eagerly helped each other, and there was plenty of very interesting work on numerous interesting projects.  I found the hardest part was commuting into downtown Atlanta.   My only negative is the constant cutting of jobs and downsizing. So while our team was busy, there was the insecurity that someonewould be transferred in to take your job."
good,"Buena en lo que cabe, sin embargo tiene sus contrar al momento de querer vender."
good,When i worked at Alorica for AT&T/ DirecTV my personal manager was great. But the overall management of the company was poor. The pay is not enough for what people deal with at that job. Bonus structure is poor for most people. The only department that gets good bonuses is the win back team. I was on the win back team for almost three years. For most people getting sales in the win back team is very difficult so the hourly wage needs to be higher. The only reason i stayed at this company is because i needed tenure and experience.
good,"Dangerous at times, got robbed a few times. Good pay, union, great benefits... but don’t count on having a life or privacy. You are tracked with gps and everything you do is recorded. Unrealistic expectations and glum work environment. If you like being a robot go ahead and apply! You’ll be compensated well but your boss will be up your tail pipe like crazy. They have to be. Good luck!"
good,"Money was great to start.  Pay plans changed regularly so that you had to do more to make the same money.  It eventually became impossible to maintain the same level of income.  Union benefits were far superior to those of non-union.  Assistant Manager position was a major step back in pay as well making it difficult to progress unless you were able to survive on less money,"
good,"At the time of working, I was a single mother, and they were very flexible with my schedule when I needed to leave early or not come in if my daughter needed my care. I was able to enjoy my weekends as well with her since the company was closed on said days. The hardest part of the job was getting promoted. Because the company was so young, it wasn't producing enough to promote from with in."
good,Big company with lots to do. They will always need warm bodies. The days of wild west wireless are gone. Everything is process oriented to drive the company financials for the Executive level. It's very difficult to break out from being another cog in the AT&T wheel.
good,"I was taking inbound calls assisting customers with billing issues and answering any questions about their accounts. We could take payments and also update their packages for internet, TV and home phone. Some customers would call in upset and it was our job to diffuse the situation and find a solution to the customers problem"
good,"When I started with AT&T, I had a minimal amount of customer interaction. They gave me the opportunity to develop those customer service a lot and a minimal amount of technical growth, a lot of which I developed on my own."
good,I enjoy working for AT&T. It has afforded me a ton of opportunity. I am grateful to have had my career there for 17 years with a lot of excellent benefits and mentorship.
good,Company is really looking to innovate in the product space and in process.   Ability to telecommute and working with people from all over the country.
good,"as long as your work is done on time nobody cares to bother you & friendly environment, new learning opportunities, good culture, decent salary package"
good,"Great salary, Bonus, Fair working conditions. Women equality. Great discounts and perks provided. Fairness in hours, excellent training, although all of this is based on the Directv prior to ATT takeover. I did not work there following the takeover"
good,I worked hard for this company for 17 years and they laid me off. I am thankful for the opportunities given to me and learned a lot. I am saddened that they have lost focus on maintaining and appreciate their long term employees all for the sake of a dollar.
good,"Pay was not that great at all, would clock in and have to get on the phone within two minutes of clocking in, daily meeting, overall was a very micromanaged and stressful work environment."
good,"Está empresa es buena, solamente que las comisiones no ayudan mucho al vendedo."
good,"The company isn't a fun place to work at but as everyone says, be thankful that you have a job. Is there a company out there that treats you more like a valued individual rather than a serial number?"
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for.  September 29,2018 will be my 4th year with this company, and there are plenty of benefits of being with the company.  I have been able to support my family, and further my education with the tuition reimbursement they offer.  I also like the fact, that from the time I started with the company, until now,  I have had consistent raises every 6 months."
good,"Great place to work, Great  environment , break room with ping pong table, Xbox, facility was nice, clean and well maintained, good security in and around the property"
good,I was in school while working for At&t and while the salary and benefits are great it can prove difficult to move to another location if the distance proves to be an issue.
good,"You need to be on top of your technical skills, as this is a field where  the environment is continually changing. If you are going to be effective in your service to the customers you need to adapt."
good,Everyone was very friendly. Management was very fair and understandable. AT&T was a stress free job and enjoyed working for them. Over was given everyday if wanted.
good,"Great place to learn customer relations. Learned a great deal about how to talk to customers, interacting with coworkers and managing stress in a fast paced situations."
good,"The AT&T calling center provided six weeks of detailed training and the benefits were great, but it was a difficult job. It is very fast paced and products, rules and regulations sometimes change daily. You are constantly monitored, rated and coached. You have to deal with irate customers fairly often. It is not a job for those that are easily offended."
good,"I have learned to work with Angular 4 framework, Typescript, Software Development Cycle and web development in general. It is comfortable to work and you will have good health care, and other benefits."
good,"Great money, wonderful managers, awesome incentives, prizes all the time but the goals were very hard to reach. Over all a great place to work with room to grow."
good,Good benefits and compensation but poor work-life balance. I missed out on children's activities because I was unable to leave in the evenings when they had games.
good,"Great environment for employees, providing resources to assist customers in a timely manner along with offering additional resources to reach out and better be able to assist customers."
good,Help customers with billing problems provide entertainment and phone solutions offered Insite on everyday question just all around tried to be helpful to all our customers
good,"Schedules are set for 6 months each and are based on seniority. No guarantee you will have the schedule or time off for your life/ family needs. Once you get used to one way it changes to another way and if you dont do it right you will be at risk of loosing your job. it pays well and has great benefits but stressful like they use scare tactics to make sure you do as told. It can be positive because they give many incentives for basically doing the job you were hired to do in the first place. Plus extra incentives for being the best at the job includes extra money, trips, or even flat screen tvs."
good,"The training is general, how to use systems and tools to help you with the job. But it doesn't totally cover what you will experience out on the calling floor. The guidelines of things you must say do get in the way of being personable at times. But, I guess that just means it's competitive. Gotta hit those quotas or your out of there."
good,"I worked with the company for 5 years as a project manager. There are so many micromanagement processes and procedures put in place it was exhausting. Other then that, great company to work for. Great benefits and pay. Everyone seems friendly just like any other big corp."
good,"Management loc=ves to hover over you when you are trying to sell. Not something that helps me preform. Opportunity is there for the most part, depending on if you are in your managers good graces."
good,Union is a joke. Tough to get a manager terminated that is being unethical. Goals for wireline sales were too high and caused everyone to struggle or be on discipline
good,I enjoyed the project I worked on and some of the co-workers. Management was lazy. Harest part of the job was the changing of management staff and promoting people that came in after you.
good,Satisfying job when you’re having success but you’ll lose sleep if you’re not.  You can hit 150% of your goal one month and the next month be fired for missing your goal slightly. Management makes it hard to want to work and enjoy work.
good,"Anticipate large reduction in workforce over he next 18-24 months,.  Environment will not be pleasant.  May be reducing workforce my more than 50%.  Sad state of affairs."
good,"Can be stressful with challenges of the day"
good,"AT&T used to leave you to be. You reported to your manager on a monthly bases.  Some flexibility on working at home which everyone loved. At the time, AT&T was failing. Today, things may be different."
good,"It was fun, i learned a lot about sales but had a lot of managers breathing down my neck about meeting quotas. Which is a little stressful, but expected"
good,I was a contractor so these questions do not apply to me.  I am filling this out to move on through the process of getting my information loaded into your system
good,"Typical day consisted of coaching and training sales associates to drive sales along w/daily managerial duties (cash, inventory, budget, time keeping)"
good,"Challenging always changing scenarios."
good,"AT&T as a company has changed since I was hired nine years ago. They frequently buy out large companies to grow their business and as a result, the nature of your job changes. For example, when I worked there it was mostly about smartphones, features, accessories, and the like. Now, it is primarily about entertainment, television, internet, and small business. The problem is with an overzealous management style that tries to drive numbers for their location that frequently involve themselves in less than ethical business practices and pushes their employees to do the same. The money and the benefits are good, however."
good,"The base pay and compensation at AT&T is amazing, especially being a college student. The only problem is the lack of flexibility that the job provides. Scheduling and time off is seniority based. Working in a smaller store is a constant challenge because I would not be able to have certain days off because the person with the higher seniority in front of me would have first pick. Your sales numbers help somewhat with advancement at AT&T, the people that move up are normally favorites to other managers. So it’s more about who you know and have a constant communication with inside and outside of work. The best perk out of anything at AT&T is that it is a union and someone is always there to have your back if need be."
good,"Empresa con oportunidad y un buen ambiente para trabajar , sin embargo hay personas no aptas en algunas pocisiones y afectan con la operatividad ."
good,It was a high stress call center but the pay was decent. It takes a certain person and attitude to be able to deal with  the high volume of calls and not take the constant insults from customers personally.
good,"We’re honored by The Civic 50 ranking us as the #1 community-minded telecommunications company in America. This marks our 4th time making first place, check out our highlights from this past year."
good,I had a great career at AT&T and would still be there today if they hadn't eliminated my position.  That is the one knock: they are always cutting staffing levels irrespective of the work volume.
good,"Many days are spent on new tasks, or at least new enough to keep the work fun. I learned a lot about hard work and management styles. I also learned that hard work and results don't always get rewarded. The workplace culture is very much about ""who you know"" and not what you do or how hard you work. The people make the work great, though. For all of their faults, the people are great and that can make up for many of the issues. Compensation is good, and employees are given the tools to succeed."
good,"AT&T has provided well for my career and offers many benefits to its employees.  I am please to work for such a generous company."
good,"During a typical day at work we worked with customers with billing issues, technical issues with equipment, we helped correct or explain customers bills. Sold cell phones, tablets and directv service"
good,"I have been working at AT&T full-time (More than 3 years)"
good,It was fun. Had a great team. Would have loved to stay but its about money and are office was over paid in their eyes. Corporate is what it has always been about money.
good,"The work was a door-to-door job, and even though it became difficult at times due to the weather, the managers were able to keep the workers motivated enough."
good,AT&T is a company that ensures the success of its employees. The training is about 1 1/2months. They assign career coaches that help ones to keep the focus on the success of the business.
good,there's always something new going on at AT&T. Supervisors are heavyly loaded with unreasonable task with very short timeframes to get the task completed from upper management which tend to make the supervisors focus on those task despite other issues that need attention.  Call center reps have unreasonable quotas and like Wells Fargo reps can get cretive to reach their goals and keep their jobs.
good,"Very good working environment, can take walk after lunch and this can improve working effect. at&t have a very good working culture, open working environment."
good,"It was exhausting dealing with customers. I found that it was not the job for me.the hours were flexible with the type of system that was in place, and the pay was competitive, however the incentives became harder to obtain."
good,"As a Customer Assistant, I delivered effortless customer service while troubleshooting inbound"
good,"Seniority based for scheduling, and poor chances off for holidays, hardly any advancement opportunities especially if you are in a union based position."
good,very easy-going to work for. pay has being slashed year after year with failed mergers and buisness aquistions by ceo randall stephenson and has taken out the losses on the sales reps. not worth working there anymore.d directv merger has been a bust as people are cutting cable. managers force and nit pick every sale to make you sell tv to customers
good,Great entry level job but not any room for advancement unless willing to move to corporate locations. Under trained and frequently incompetent management.
good,"Great place to work, with the potential to make good money. The management was good and they allowed you to express yourself and ideas without feeling a certain way"
good,"AT&T was a decent company to work for. Standard big corporate though, treated exponentially better the higher of a role you are in. I would work for them again, but overall you are underpaid unless you are top level management."
good,"good work culture but the work is little boring."
good,A typical work day consist of 2-5 conference calls to lead projects. There is very little job security at AT&T which greatly affects the culture. The constant workforce reduction puts a lot of strain on the remaining individuals reducing the work-life balance and adding to the stress level of those employee. You do learn a lot about how managing big projects and learn to adjust to the increasing responsibility.
good,"Great Place To Wok I really enjoyed being apart of the team.  Everyone was beyond fair, management was excellent.  Everyone was very supportive in my career moves."
good,taught me a lot about sales and working hard. It was a door to door sales job that required hard work and dedication. I became a manager over several locations and learned to duplicate myself.
good,this is a great company but not very easy to advance I knew people working there for over 50 years and were in the same position they started in. a lot of the managers were hired from outside of the company. they gave us so many training which was good for learning experience we had a fun work environment and would occasionally have potlucks in our building for the entire center. we were always asked our opinions on what needed to be changed to make the workplace better but the work life balance was terrible there was almost always mandatory overtime and the schedules were not so great for example I had 11am-7pm so my whole day was at work and when I got off it was dark another schedule I had was a split shift where i would get a 3 hour break for lunch but it also took up my entire day from 8 am- 7pm it takes years for your seniority to be high enough to get one of the better shifts because people tend to stay with the company for a long time due to benefits and recognition bonuses
good,This company made it fun to work and gain extra money while being there.  You were allowed to work overtime on your client accounts.  This was great because you had the chance to really get to interact with the client and informed them of other accessories that where available to the.
good,It was a monotonous job with not much challenge at work. Seemed to be stable except occasional lay-offs. There were not many opportunities to explore.
good,"It was a okay"
good,"fast paced work environment  ,management very helpful in providing training, great pay and discounts but no stability in job possible layoff every three months."
good,When i worked there it was many years ago so for a typical day we made sure we got right down to business our immediate team leaders did make work fun for us at the same time and just like other jobs you have target goals sometimes hitting those goals could be a challenge but for me as long as i was giving it my all i didnt worry too much
good,"Very hands on working environment, variety of acquired functional skills and tools experience.  Company will paid for training and vehicle upon completion."
good,I worked for an At&t authorized dealer. Fun working atmosphere & competitive. The company needs to pay more hourly & pay the commission once your sales are paid that week. The employees should not wait weeks for commissions.
good,"I enjoyed the wonderful pay and incentives. The benefits were awesome, but the personal treatment from the CWA union was not fair and very cold after paying into it for many years. Very political company. The most stressful job among them, full of pressure, but much worth it to some."
good,This job is better suited for someone young (20-30) and I wouldn't recommend it if you're trying to support a family. Hourly pay isn't enough to live on so you need to be fairly successful in order to get commission that is substantial enough for you to live.
good,"Culture has degraded over the past few years due to excessive job relocation requirements.  Many talented and long-tenured employees had to leave the company because leadership decided to centralize their workforce in 3 primary cities and force relocations there.  We're a telecommunications company, yet leadership is placing less emphasis on using it in favor of more face time in an office while other industries are doing the opposite.  Consequently, many jobs have gone unfilled, or replaced by less qualified/less experienced workers.  This is not how you build and maintain an ""A team""."
good,"A lot of process with many re-organizations that creates constant change and challenges to get even simple things done."
good,"Can be a fairly strict environment, but it is a good place to work. Has many options for different schedules and time off requests.  The people you work with are very friendly and it feels like a family."
good,I provided TV and Internet services with inner and outer areas; while providing a face to face customer service that met both the customer and company needs.
good,good company fior growth in areas. Great opportunity to become management or advance in the field as an engineer or to travel and learn multiple positions within the company
good,"Organized and fairly regimented.  Processes guide most, if not all, aspects of company operations.  Extensive training available for many areas of interest.  The hardest part of the job is following processes that are too big to always make sense.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the chance to help others - either customers with their specific business needs or other employees with gaining a better understanding of their jobs."
good,"I enjoyed working for AT&T. I felt that the company could do a better job of managing its 3rd-party call centers, as they could inadequately represent the brand."
good,Company was always focus on their employees needs they were very open to life situation and were always willing to work with their employees on a consistent bases.
good,"A very stress free environment, you almost feel like you’re in control of your entire day .. sometimes it doesn’t feel like work. AT&T is company that puts you in positions to satisfy a customers ultimate needs ."
good,"Overall AT&T is a good company to work for. As with all companies it reaches a point where there is a decline. It can be due to management, innovation, overall business, sales, customer service, benefits & compensation, lack of growth, etc.    What can you say?"
good,"Poor Management from the top, leaving lower level Managers no choices, no authority or flexibility to manage."
good,"AT&T Uverse, was a fast paced.  We had to install the cable and phone service.Some days, were long and cold or hot. MAnagers would push you. Some techs were nice and helped each other out."
good,This employer is competitive and quick paced. If your are interested in a sales environment and incentives att would be a good start. The management program needs a little work and more benefits.
good,"Environnement de travail très agréable, opportunités de développement."
good,"""Work is what you make it"", is what I think of when working at AT&T. I loved working their because work was fun and rewarding through their many programs and opportunity to win free stuff. But, I wasn't being challenged enough to stay and I found myself training managers who was ultimately getting paid more than I was. I became frustrated and quit to be a teacher."
good,Was great but not enough time with family. They need to become a company that is not a base of seniority and give people chances that aren't there for 7 years and not progressing but people that want to advance in that field career.
good,I did like working here but the work-life balance was insanely disproportionate. The unattainable sales goals caused more stress than the amount of time allowed for 'life'
good,"This job offer great incentives. They match your 401K contribution up to 6 percent. A typical work day is one where you manage installs and repairs. Some days have heavy work loads; others are light. You dictate your overall flow. Even though managers try to increase your pace to cover productivity. This job mainly care about the numbers you can produce. The hardest part of this job is not getting too involved with customers and keeping focused on your productivity. To me, the fun part of the job is having satisfied customers.Just know you can't please everyone, and it's not your fault. All the techs work well on the team. They are always there to help when they are available to. Time is your enemy. All jobs have a certain time slot to complete. Learning this will help you navigate throughout your day efficiently."
good,It is good place to learn new things. All colleagues are friendly and helping each other. Manager was also friendly and helping when we got stuck up. I recommend this place.
good,"Depending what was changing within the company, could be very stressful.  Acronym for ATT&T was ""at this time"".   Everything could change from one day to the next and notification of the changes was spotty and incomplete.  Would mean you could quote rates that were valid yesterday and suddenly find out they had changed."
good,It was a nice place to work. I didn't appreciate the job when i was younger but now with age I truly miss the professional atmosphere. You haven to make the best out of a stressful situation.
good,"Seeking a career where I can positively impact the lives of others though offering supportive services or personal care needs.  Observant and dedicated worker with ability to offer quality to my job, employer and customers."
good,"great work experience, friendly environment got experience working with the public, hardest part of my job was closing every sale unfortunately not every customer will buy a phone but that is normal,"
good,"Technology Leader in Telecom. Advance Technologies to learn"
good,Working at AT&T was great. Competitive salary. Good employee moral. Work and life balance was a key factor for the company. Management was very approachable with issues.
good,Did not see a real opportunity to advance beyond the Wire Tech position. As a seasoned telecommunications professional I was looking to advance rather quickly. Over all AT&T is a great place to work and grow especially if you are new to the business.
good,This is an excellent job if it weren't for the hours. You will work late at night and on the weekends. The pay is awesome the benefits are awesome and the lower to mid management is very helpful.
good,"Manage coach and mentor staff. Schedules for all staff. Regular meeting and training. Cash management, kpi, roi and all operation."
good,"In the 32 years I worked for this company I enjoyed my time there. I didn't want to leave but they needed to cut budget, aka employees. I learned so much and was able to meet amazing, intelligent, wonderful people."
good,"Walk in, attend an early morning stand up, get to your tickets and code your life away."
good,"When I was a technical CSR the company was still DIRECTV. I can't say much about the culture at AT&T. When it was still DTV I thought it was a difficult and stressful job but I appreciated the company as a whole. It was decent pay for the time and they seemed to value their employees. If you want to learn soft skills, take this job. Nothing teaches you how to deescalate a situation like starting 50 conversations a day with someone who is already upset."
good,working evenings will be your schedule for the first year to 2 years. compensation changes often so commission has continued to decline. this is not long term since att is closing stores and opening authorized retail store to trim there cost.
good,Always busy and if you like sales its great!  sometimes it gets too corporate and you will do things to check a box rather than do things with purpose or intent.
good,Good training program for job that you will work.  Call stats changed constantly and that can have an impact on your bonus potential.  Overtime is available.
good,I learned a lot from a lot of people and enjoyed working with everyone. Very professional but fun when appropriate as well............................
good,Overall my experience with the company has been fun and entertaining. I definitely enjoy the perks that my current position offers. I'm looking to promote within the year.
good,"The general manager does not care about it's people, he barely spend time in the shop. The management  always seems to be on training and they are never available but don't relay that training back to their employees. The work environment does not improve at all, even if the company strives to provide training to improve management. There is not much diversity in the management."
good,"enjoyed the ability to meet new people of all cultures.  Not only have I worked the past 10 years as a consultant, but I did work there for 21 years as an employee; AT&T is a great company."
good,"Excellent pay, little direction or discussion of future from upper management. Lacks individual employee accountability due to union. Managers are not familiar with field operations, therefore cannot assist in technical issues."
good,"Worked at AT&T for 25 years in various positions both technical and management. I learned a lot during my time there and would not have gotten to where I am today without that experience.,"
good,Get to enjoy representing customers. Help them decided what they want and need. Be friendly and get good feedback from customers. Get to know the customer will make them feel special.
good,"I worked at the Device Support Center."
good,Great place to work. Culture is always changing along with compensation pay outs. Great benefits and salary if negotiated correctly. Work life balance could be better.
good,"It was a new account with Convergys Philippines. We cater with retention department. We handles cancellation, bill disputes and some troubleshooting. The most enjoyable part of the job is whenever I resolved customer's concern and convince to stay with AT&T."
good,"Global HQ has pool tables, ping pong and collaboration zones. There is lots of movement/change happening in the company with all the mergers, therefore there is always change."
good,I have been away from this company since 2006.  I managed a team of Service Representatives and was responsible for coaching them and providing leadership to insure goals were met.
good,I enjoy working with the company of course there's pros and cons but the experience is great. I would like the work to pick back up like it used to. I do like the benefits the company offers.
good,"sad to leave, but layoffs are going to be the norm for some time. Additional surplus activity has been forecast for all of 2018 and beyond. Projects are often started with much fan fair, then AT&T will buy a competitor who does the same thing. Employees take it in the shorts."
good,Good solid company that has good opportunities for different jobs.  Pay can be good if you land in the right place and or are willing to travel.  Company is competitive within the telecommunications industry.
good,Aprendizaje dia a dia. Mucho conocimiento. Mucho trabajo fisico
good,Your boss is key....Your boss is key....Your boss is key.. Without a good supervisor that is not company driven none of those daily items will matter.
good,"Call centers can be vastly different from one another.  One of the real advantages to working in a call center is that it is usually pretty easy to get another job at another call center...but it is a hard cycle to get out of.  If you are a hard worker and have plans of advancing, it can happen quickly...or it can't.  It really depends on how good the management of the call center is and if there is room for advancement.  My suggestion would be to get in, and network as much as humanly possible.  If you can get in good with higher-ranking people, you can usually turn that into something positive."
good,my review is i worked hard as sub contractor trying to get more works but instead turn out charging from pay check for cable wires all other equipments after all when you get your check it is not matching with the hors you work and all expenses.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of managing orders from end to end. Typically, I partnered with other managers and Sales executives, to make sure that our customer’s service was delivered in a timely manner."
good,"I worked for AT&T Information Systems, in the computer division when the touch screen computers were first being tested.  It was interesting, to see the innovation."
good,"Productive and good place to work. The office is close to  Marta, and plenty of restaurants."
good,"This was at a time with AT&T divided their company into 2 divisions.  AT&T branched itself into a division in the wireless communications named AT&T Wireless.  A that time we had outside corporate sales individuals that were eventually replaced by retail stores.  "
good,AT&T did not acquire DirecTV when I was there but I heard the work environment changed once the M&A was complete. I enjoyed the team that I worked with and I found it to be both humbling and professional.
good,Great place to learn and fast track a career.  You must be mobile and willing to relocate if you want to advance.  It's a great job for a new college graduate and there are many intern programs.  Always looking for engineering/network grads.
good,"Working for AT&T is challenging, they pay very well but they don't promote having a career in the company. You have to be jumping from position to position in order to avoid being surplussed every three months."
good,It was very stressful with back to back calls. The managers did not care much for the employees. It paid very well but had no room for advancement....
good,I loved working at ATT for 15 years I was just married and reloacting when I left was a great place to work. Management changed very frequently. We were outside plant technicians so we worked alone most of the time and managed our time ourselves. When I lead a group of technicians on a rehab project lasting 5 years it was the most rewarding because I got to see things change because of the hard work we put in
good,The AT&T Call Centers handle a verity of products. The training is minimal but there is documentation available if you can discover the  correct phrase to get the information. It's frustrating.
good,Started out as a joint alliance between CSC and AT&T. Job was the same as CSC-AT&T more stress. Management was poor thus morale was low. Management was not involved.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, was my team. All team members were very supportive and worked collaboratively to accomplish the overall goal of improving the customer experience."
good,"everyone is pretty close in the different stores you work in and will work with you and help you anyway they can. Its competitive yes, but its a friendly race to see who can get to the top!"
good,I had a great time working for AT&T.  I met some great people employees and customers.  The pay was good as long as you were willing to do overtime and put in the work to find leads and keep up with customers interested in home services like tv and security.  Not very easy to move up at the store I was at.  As soon as you prove yourself to your current manager they'd be moved or promoted and you'd have to prove yourself all over again to someone new.  Overall I do recommend working for AT&T.  I'd like to break out of the retail space and work on other areas with them.
good,"Fun place to work with great business, bonus and community outreach programs. It was a great place to work with great people, I enjoyed my time there."
good,"I've only done contractual work for AT&T, never worked for corporate in any capacity. They have good products, good prices for new customers and good customer service. I have a background in selling mostly DirecTV, but also U-Verse TV, Internet, and Home Phone."
good,A typical day at work was productive and challenging with many activities to take care/attend and accomplish required goals. I learned to manage time effectively and work with diverse teams to better understand projects requirements. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my peers and being able to deliver the projects required goals.
good,"You'll learn many different skills while working for AT&T. Flexibility is key and as long as your willing to invest the time, training for new skills is always available."
good,I got in their trying to make some cash I liked it amd I stayed their more time then what I thought I was going to stay it good easy and fast cash I like it but looking to find some thing else
good,"El servicio y el modelo de venta es muy bueno."
good,"AT&T is a awesome place to work with a diverse group of people and customers. A typical work day in a call center setting was to receive inbound calls from business customers. Who would place orders for AT&T products and services.  I learned how to negotiated, resolved service issues and sale the company products. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you have another satisfied customer."
good,"Excelente relación con mis compañeros, muy bien desempeño laboral, culminando proyectos de grandes cambios para la organización y de gran responsabilidad para llevarlos a cabo."
good,The different area managers set the culture.  The culture for the Charlotte locations when I was there was stressful.  It was difficult to trust the management had my back in any situation.  This created a horrid work envirronment.
good,"Great place to work. I would still be here, but I got surplussed. IPTV is an ever changing environment. I have great mentors that take the time to teach as we work."
good,Environment where you need to be a great customer service rep  giving customers one call resolution. Need to have alot of patience and not let your feeling portray through the phone.
good,Great Company to work for.Great benefits.Physically demanding if you work as a technician.Paid training and chances for career enhancenent.Bimonthly salary review.
good,Many people retire after 20+ years of service. Family oriented to a degree. Has a union to represent the non-management Employees. Stable company great benefits.
good,"Working with the Spurs organization was fun. As a part-time employee, advancement oportunities were very limited. Some management leadership personnel showed favortism to staff that had been with the company for several years"
good,"As a Premise Technician, the environment is stressful and very numbers-oriented. There is very little room for advancement unless you are a top performer, because any positions that come open within the company are typically filled by people who have seniority to the majority of Premise Techs currently in the field, and preferences are based on seniority. Additionally, AT&T has a strong culture of personal networking, so advancement is nearly impossible unless you know someone to help you get a leg up."
good,"Days were regimented, old school style.  Learned how to function in a big corporation.  Management was very hierarchical.  Culture was friendly but again very hierarchical."
good,"They know call centers suck and make every effort to make it more enjoyable. They offer competitive pay and bonuses along with all the other bells and whistles you’d expect from a premium company such as AT&T. However, the opportunities for advancement are almost nonexistent unless you are exceptional at office politics."
good,The trainers were interested in making sure you knew the information before they tur you loose on the floor. The training should have been alittle longer and enthusiastic
good,"Very strict on levels of achievements. very competitive, coworkers were great and a lot of friendships were made.  Hours were good, managers good. Very stressful atmosphere"
good,I enjoyed working at AT&T and I met a lot of great people there. The biggest downfall would be the forced hours. I had a young daughter when I was working there and I felt like I didn't see her nearly enough.
good,Good for entry-level. Learned a ton and grew as an individual. Management was fair. Compensation was fair. Worked on your feet for long hours. Competitive workplace.
good,"AT&T is a good place to work. They provide great benefits and have a very diverse work environment. However, most jobs are stressful due to the heavy workloads. And, unfortunately, there is always a threat of lay off."
good,"They provided a comfortable environment in a really nice building, Cafeteria was awesome but the food options where very limited, Traffic became a problem, so I had to relocate."
good,Working for The Wireless Experience was a fun experience. Customer Service and Technology are two of my biggest strengths when it comes to work. I was passionate about being able to provide excellent customer service about great products.
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced, challenging and enjoyable. I learned to be patient and listen to the clients, co-workers and that allowed me to be more effective in delivering the desirable results."
good,"As a corporation AT&T is excellent, Unfortunately the Poor front line managers,  nepotism and retaliation rampant amongst level 1 and level 2 management make it a stressful work environment."
good,very fast paced loved it alot of great benefits and discounts available for full time employees. i would work there again if there was a local office.
good,AT&T was a great place to work for at first until new people came into place and the environment went from a fun loving organization to the total opposite.
good,"I loved working with the customers and fixing their issues, and installing new services. You were however micromanaged which made it a little less fun."
good,"I enjoyed working for AT&T. While there continued to be a lot of changes within the company and in-fighting between divisions, it was a rewarding career and allowed me to progress in my career and receive the appropriate training to perform my job and included a supportive environment."
good,dificultad para crecer dentro de la empresa y obtener un asenso
good,"I'm not sure why I am being asked for this review, however I would not recommend this place due to the lack of inter-departmental communication and management.  There is lack of ""team"", and very disorganized."
good,AT&T recently bought DirecTv making all technicians a part of AT&T. i usually work around 100 hours every two weeks. Pay has increased due to becoming union and better benefits as well. Hardest part of my job is everything is a number and the lower you are the tougher your job is due to management.
good,"good place to work, I have had the pleasure to work with very smart and hard working  peers and managers.  I had to relocate to Texas and would now like to move back to California to be with family."
good,"AT&T has been a great company to work for, I have gained lots of experiences. They are going through some reorganizations and it is leaving a lot of people without jobs. I would continue my career if possible with AT&T."
good,"Excellet company, fair and professional. I enjoyed all the experience and knowledge I gained from being there. The managers were all about training you to better improve your sales. The work place culture required commitment and hard work but with rewards."
good,ATT is a decent place to work. Easy to get a long with management and as long as you are performing good and your attendance is good they leave u a lone. Advancing is really hard but never give up. Benefits suck very expensive!!!
good,"My position spent a lot of time working processes instead of selling. Management had a ""oh well, we're lucky to have jobs"" attitude about it. We underwent annual shifts in the positions and silos were evident. The group was fantastic to work with."
good,I loved my job and was terrific at it. I believed in the brand and product as well as the world class client experience I delivered at a more exceptional rate then AT&T even expected.  I was a VO employee so this helped me to keep a work/life balance.  There was at times too much to get done in a day however I was able to manage this with my experience.  It was a bit difficult to keep up with the new administrative aspects of my job unless I wanted to cut into my family time to keep working.  The hardest part of my job was the constant threat of downsizing and being shifted to a new manager that did not know what I did or my value due to his or her lack of experience in my job field.  I loved what I did and my clients and peers and account teams appreciated my hard work and dedication. Upper management did not know their people you were simply headcount and easily dismissed at times of cut back. AT&T is allowing a generation of incredibly dedicated and loyal employees that want to work hard and smart go in order to save money.  It would be advantageous to replace these valued employees and use their talent in areas of business to help grow revenue and stability to customers and high level business clients.
good,Expectation very explicitly stated and team members were easy to work with. Management was great and accommodating with any requests presented. Some days went on longer than others but ultimately paid off in the end.
good,Plenty of money to be made in sales if you have the right skill set and personality.  Opportunity for advancement and free perks are more than abundant.
good,AT&T is really fast paced work place environment. The company processes are well establishe and due to well established processes it helps the product quality to be ensured at high level.
good,"I worked at AT&T full-time (More than 3 years)"
good,All my tasks were slowly given to management to do. Great pay. Lousy MGMT throughout. Always internal conf like it along departments. I miss Ma Bell but not AT&T.
good,"Fun place to work once you learned all you can about the phones and service. Dealt face to face with customers, some of whom were irate about different aspects of phone and plan."
good,"Set monthly goals for employees and set scheduling. Learned to be not only a top sales rep but also learned to be a team leader. Management was on point, made sure all numbers were met. Work culture was very calm and courteous. The job was difficult at times during the beginning of the year but we still kept busy pushing sales. The best part  of the job was the great employee discounts and services provided."
good,"Stress, fast paced, Not enough training on computer system but has very extensive and proficient Sales Training"
good,"At the time I worked for the company, things were very high stress, but the pay plus pay bonuses were awesome. The work was very physically as well as mentally challenging, but overall enjoyable."
good,"Building repor with customers to help ease the process of selling the customer something. All genuine and with a big smile . Customer Service always comes first . At&t trains us to be Friendly expert, In effort to sell all products. From Home solutions (Digital Life), to Internet &Tv (U-verse,DirecTv), back to Cell phones and plans."
good,It is a fun place to work. Nice co-workers.  Great benefits even for the part-time employees.  Flexible hours and days.  Discount on equipment and service.
good,"Great Company,benefits were good,competitive workplace ,you can balance your work and personal life without a problem sometimes management can be a little bump but you can work things out."
good,Great company to work for if you enjoy a healthy competitive sales environment. Great sales managers who provide great coaching opportunities throughout your time there.
good,At AT&T their lots of opportunities to grow as long as you show you are willing to learn and stay with high consisting ranking. Management is willing to mentor and advice employees who wish to grow.
good,"It was a good company overall, however there was some favoritism.  I feel that as much as sacrifices I made for the company it was not at all taken in consideration when it come down to cutbacks."
good,Was  very good job with great oppurtunites but had many flaws in the pitching that they were doing to other companies but other than that very enjoyable place to work
good,"Great for beginning and ending a career if you are willing to move up the corp ladder! Great benefits, no payday worries and many opportunities. Mostly daytime jobs, but some other jobs allowed options for nights, weekends!!"
good,"Responsible for design, implementation and maintenance of the mid- and long-term growth strategy for AT&T Cybersecurity Business Solution. Facilitate innovation, market analysis and complex negotiations for new and emerging products, technologies and applications. Directly manage multiple projects as well as mentor team of senior security product managers."
good,Our department is being surplused which has forced me to pursue jobs within and outside the company. I've learned about property management and contract management.
good,"A great place to learn the basics of sales. Fast paced with constantly changing technology. Though every customer is an ""opportunity"" realistically the job is about 70% service 30% sales."
good,Description of cell phone towers and how frequency of 3g and 4g capabilities is the main knowledge they wanted me to leave knowing. customer service was also a key in detail and service
good,"The company overall is great, so are the managers and the people I met on the job. The training program is thorough and incredibly helpful. The no fault attendance policy and zero accommodations for a college schedule are ridiculous though...you are also tracked by the minute so if you use the restroom  for too long you will have a talk with your boss about it. The culture overall used to be one of team building and success comes from within sort of thinking..after the AT&T merger that all changed for the worse."
good,"Excellent experience for those who'd like to explore the telecom business.  I've worked here for 15 years and there's many opportunities for making a solid career.  Having said that, the culture is difficult to change and many employee hang on for the benefits.  Change is inevitable and it's difficult to build relationships with customers when your role changes every year due to re-organization."
good,"great job for balancing home and career. Able to work from home full time. Lots of challenging projects over the past few years, working with teams all over the globe."
good,Una empresa que brinda oportunidades laborales en la medida de lo posible
good,"I'm a contractor here so options for the 'cool' stuff are limited, but employees are treated to off-site events, more communication with overall mission, etc."
good,"work place was very stressful, the pressure to produce and succeed was great. unfair expectations on technicians. Mangers had much better work place atmosphere"
good,"Learned a lot working at ATT. I was there for 13 years as a sales rep and it was challenging hitting all the numbers they wanted, but the job is stable and if you can handle being cooped inside all day then id say go give it a shot"
good,"Working there was not so great. Bad atmosphere. A lot of layovers.I didnt like all the office politics. my managers were fine, but overall the amount of work based on the compensation was not good."
good,It was good working at AT&T. Was not a full time and worked as a contractor. Enjoyed the work and the team very much. learned new systems and had an opportunity to work on devices.
good,Arrive at office for quick 10-15 meeting go to job picked up depending on type of job you could be there from 1 to 5 hours installing about 4 hours repairs around 1.5 hours once job is completed to pick up another until all jobs for day are completed
good,"The job at Pacific Bell/AT&T as a Maintenance Splicer Tech changed from day to day, hour to hour, in its sense of urgency to get a customers communications lines back up and running.  The pay was good, the hours were long, and the weather was at times wicked.  Splicers do the best they can as expediently as they can with regards to their accessibility to the cable to get that customers services re-established."
good,"Good work environment. Good management."
good,I was there for over 4 years in Sales the money was my motive but managers became to greedy lost all morals and values when it came to other people to busy chasing a dollar.
good,"If you can't handle stress and mandated hours of overtime, AT&T is not the company for you. I think that this company offers great benefits and is great job for someone who enjoys high stressful job."
good,At&t is a good company to work for as a sales rep. It pays very well at entry level. It can be hard to advance within the company due to limited positions available.
good,"Be ready to work overtime and expect changes that go along with ""the needs of the business"". Always changing. Management needs better training. Everything and everyone is numbers driven."
good,"My Early project i enjoyed with my team also very good suporting with me,i involed for my team what they will assigin work i will do asap ,i deployed dailly applications"
good,"Some days were on the fast paced side of things, however for the most part it was more slow than anything. It may have to do with the location though, but whether slow or quick paced there was a lot expected of us daily. Especially during the slower times of day, because we could take our times with our customers. I did learn so much from working here when it comes to sales and communicating. Management, depending on who it was, was definitely helpful when it came down to it. Sometimes some management was out to get you. Some would tell you certain information that wasn't accurate at all; they would do it to build up a case to terminate you. Working with the people I did was the mos enjoyable part of working there. They really made it all worth it especially during the stressful times. As well as the discounts on cellphone plans and on internet and TV."
good,It was great team and Manager working there. I was a Contractor but the team worked seamlessly whether you were a Contractor or an Employee. It was fast paced work environment but team was very focused on accomplishing the work and were helpful to each other
good,"I was a self starter,  needing little to no management interface.  "
good,job is pretty good due to the pay and benefits. company requires a lot out of its reps. there are always changes with policys and such so it can get annoying
good,Stressful as well as productive place. Sometimes very hectic and typical day to work. Management sometimes push us very hard to complete the targeted work.
good,"Productive and good place to learn"
good,"The saying holds true if you do what you need to do you will pretty much never lose your job at ATT. Long as you can deal with the bureaucracy and constant badgering from management to meet their numbers even if they don't truly affect you."
good,"It is a Good Company , I learnt how to coordinate and mange with team. Worked on different technologies like SOAPUI and rest client and Putty. mostly involved in  end to end."
good,Helping others to reach `their potential and improve their goals is a Very satisfying part of a job. The hardest part is to see potential and not be able to motivate it.
good,helps customer find solutions to their problems. Make the customer happy while also making the company money. When you feel like you are better than the people above you its time to apply for a new position or move on.
good,Workplace is enjoyable. They provide a cafeteria with food options for to please a number of eaters in the building. The location of the building also allow for quick lunch breaks between meetings.
good,"Good pay and benefits but due to constant restructuring there is no job security unless you are willing to relocate.  "
good,Was just Directv at the time. Fun working with customers and installing satellites. different range of people in and out of the company. Felt like management played favorites
good,Very challenging global environment in a highly competitive set of industries.   Large scale and financial resources to get things done are often at odds with bureaucratic processes.
good,"This was during the early stage of the cell phone boom. New technology invented each year. Mostly the services were phone call and text messages. However, there were some very large phone bills. My job was to collect on those bills. While there were many friendly customers, there were some who overused the service and were not friendly at all when asked form payment. The hardest part of this job was collecting from individuals who found themselves way over their heads. the most enjoyable part of working for ATT, was coming to a good and friendly resolution."
good,Life as a wire technician is just that. not much time for family. all about the numbers for the company. not much room if any for advancement. Do not seem to be on the technicians side even though we are the backbone of the company.
good,"Great place to work, I met alot of clients. Helped a lot of people achieve their fitness goals. I set my own hrs plus I did more than what we required."
good,"AT&T isn't the company it used to be.  Pay has gone down and expectations have increased.  Benefits have been reduced, productivity expectations have increased."
good,"I absolutely loved working here. I worked independently with little supervision. On a typical day, I log into all necessary systems and get to work monitoring calls. I typically review between 40-60 calls of varying lengths depending on the days goals. My main job was making sure agents were complying with FCC regulations. It was simple, didn't have to talk on the phones, just listened, and the calls were recorded so I could rewind as many times as necessary. My managers were AWESOME! Always honest and upfront, and they genuinely seemed interested in seeing us grow. The most difficult part of the job was keeping up with the constant changes in procedure, but that's minimal considering how easy the procedures generally were. Oh and it was a part time position so I did not qualify for health benefits. That was truly the only REAL downside. I absolutely loved the job and I would still be there today had the department not closed."
good,Overall AT&T is a good place to work. I would recommend it if you are one for the corporate environment. Coworkers are very friendly and helpful. AT&T has been trying to improved the culture over the last year or so
good,Great opportunities for advancement within the company.  Work hard and you can make a career with this company.  Great people to work with on a day to day basis.
good,If you are look to make a decent living and have very little life outside of work then this job is just right for you. The potential of making good compensation is available but its not an easy work environment. It can be very stressful and frustrating at time dealing with people who expect the world and plan to pay the very least. The training is good if your looking to enhance your passion at doing face to face sales.
good,No review given because this was a contract position and so my work was for 6 months thru a recruiter.  I worked there only to complete a project in their software.
good,"Great culture, fun place to work! Very collaborative environment where managers empower employees to voice opinions and ideas at all times. Overall, I recommend!"
good,"Difficult to rate AT&T now as I was a consultant for them in my last position.  However, based on what I experienced I could see that the company has changed significantly over the past 20 years.  Too many reorgs, downsizing, and changes in direction."
good,Union Customer Service Call Center with focus on service in a timely manner.  Good educational mentorship with focus on goals.  Lots of numbers to track your performance.
good,"Collections branch that dealt with customers whose service was turned off due to non payment, early collection calls to avoid interruption, great benefits and discount plans"
good,Managment isn't the best . but they work with you to ensure you can make money. There is favoritism but the overall the work enviroment is friendly and fun.
good,"Performed customer service, Sold features, Sold uverse, Added lines, Sold television service and internet service. Hardest part of job was the selling."
good,my job was to sell AT&T products and services to customers. i had to learn and the plans promotions prices and how to pitch them to a customer in a short but detailed manner. I reached my goals for the month and the challenge goals for the day. Closing on a sale was probably the best part of my job made me feel great and motivated me to keep pushing.
good,"Got to work around new people everyday. Was never working inside an office, enjoyed being able to move around. Had a fun time working there but always wanted more."
good,"*Identify, develop and evaluate maarketing strategy based on knowledge of establishment objectives, market characteristics anad cost/markup factors"
good,Buen trabajo pero piden bastantes lineas a activar al mea haciendo casi imposible cobrar el bono y te dan mil pesos quincenales al no alcanzarlo
good,"Trabajo en negro, ambiente laboral normal. falta mejorar mucho."
good,"Opening the store, prepearing for the day and motivating your employees to get ready to make it a great day in sales and providing a great customer experience."
good,"I enjoy working for the company because I love the interaction with the customers. No day is the same. Work is similar, but scenery differs day-to-day."
good,"I worked there for three years as a Uverse installer. There are quite a few problems with management overall, and that was one reason why I ultimately left. For a communications company, they do not have very good communication. It was a tough job, and a lot of lazy technicians made the work harder for everyone else."
good,Amdocs is an employee friendly company and caters to all the needs of the employee. Good to work here. Good learning experience and exposure to new technologies.
good,"fun place to work"
good,The benefits are awesome and there is a fun work environment. Although the call center manager seemed lost and could not effectively manage. He gave all the work to the supervisors.
good,Enjoyed working with AT&T as well as the people I was involved with. The projects were interesting and the proper tools to complete the job were provided.
good,"Pros: Money was good "
good,"This is a terrible job for those who value work life balance.  Management bows down to the union and everyone suffers from it.  The employees think they are entitled to everything under the sun.  The director was forced to quit, the area managers are weak.  It might close down if the sales don't start flowing."
good,"I would log into my system and get ready to take calls. I learned people skills, how to work different systems, basic technical support. The hardest part was trying to stay on the phone for a short time because i was trying to resolve the customers issue. The enjoyable part was talking to my customers."
good,I enjoyed working in the call center very much.  I wouldn't complain about anything except the occasional associates that don't try to get along or abuse FMLA.
good,"A typical work day consist of research for effective planning for the sales day. There are daily huddle to plan for proper execution of an effective sales day. There's constant coaching and developing to help the team maximize every opportunity and make sure that each customer is offered a complete solution."
good,"Taught me to always have a plan B, nothing is life is guaranteed. Many different departments have plan ned and trained fme for what is ahead. 16 years of service long abandoned. Flexible"
good,"The job itself was not hard, it was the stats you had to meet, and the overall review from customers is about the company, not the Rep. so managers says its about being a team player but stats are on each agent.  So At&t is not about the Customer.  There was not a lot of flexibility. The system we used said one thing, but the managers say another thing.  so there is a lot of indecisiveness.  Not very good at communicating"
good,"•	Worked to enhance customer service by providing product knowledge assistance and encourage coworker to develop their skill an improve sales as a team"
good,I really enjoy this place if i am permanent employee of AT&T. Being as contractor /i have experienced little hiccups but overall it is nice place to work. I never had any issue with AT&T side.
good,"Management and staff was a revolving door, if you were lucky enough to have a positive and healthy work environment, you would still need to hustle to make up those sales each month. "
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo y  buen clima entre compañeros
good,Great place to be able to work in a fun environment with a chance to  advance or even if you are just passing through. The Salary is not always competitive with similar work at other call centers in the area. They make is fun to be at work and keep the energy up. They allow for overtime with the agents.
good,If in a permanent full time position it is a good place to work.  The work environment depends on your manager and the way he runs things.  It is great for a person who is willing to put the company first.
good,"The department I worked for was great. We didnt take a lot of calls so it was nice. Most departments take a lot of calls back to back."
good,"You get to work then take the calls, fix the issue or route call to whom ever can fix issue then make sales attempt. The enviroment hi fast paced but you have lots of help."
good,"I was there for a year before they relocated their operations to Texas.  Had clear roles/procedures for all to follow.   Although the job involved working hard every day, I enjoyed my time there and enjoyed the workplace culture there as well,"
good,Typical Day making calls providing great service and rates to our customers.I learned that you can always grow and be an asset to your company. Management is great examples of how to be leaders the workplace has a great team feel and family vibe. The hardest part of my job is getting rude customers and hang ups. Most enjoyable part is making sales
good,It is important to continue to work on your education and training.  The growth potential within this company allows the possibilities to challenge yourself and develop your skills to exceed your expectations within the company.  You can learn and help mentor new hires to understand what roles will be the best fit for them within the company.
good,The most enjoyable time there was being with my co workers. The job itself is very stressful and nothing is ever enough to management. There is a lot of preasure to sell everything. Management at my location were not always on the same page. Felt a lot of unfair treatment. The pay is good and when I started the job was not as stressful as it is now
good,This was a 24/7 environment and the schedule changed a lot which can be difficult to plan various events. There was a lot to learn and plenty of opportunities for growth.
good,inbound call center.  performed basic customer service tasks and secured new service.  troubleshooting and scheduling repair calls.  it was a ok job to pay the bills
good,"Unfortunately, there is no more AT&T Canada, the management treat their employees good and a good team spirit. They are able to make change fast and adapt to the market"
good,"I worked there two years and quit because of manager politics.  I was one of the top performers, earning a good amount of commission, but treated like I was cheating. I was not cheating, just performing my best.  This was demoralizing, and as a result, I quit and gave up a very good salary so I no longer had to deal with the stress of constant phone calls and managers treating me like I was a thief when I was not."
good,"Overall, working at AT&T was a rewarding experience since I was able to hold quite a number of different positions and work for some great managers. There were many available job opportunities the first 25 years at AT&T, if you were willing to learn and work hard. In the last 8  years, management changed as well as the workplace culture. The belief that as an employee you had earned some job security proved to be an illusion. Upper management with which I became every familiar with no longer consider past performance a viable consideration. The company mantra became “What have you done for me lately”.  This caused many managers as well as co-workers to do whatever it took to meet objectives. This new workplace culture eroded business ethics. Meeting objectives, whether reasonable or not became reality. Unfortunately, this environment was unacceptable and I had no option but to resign."
good,Dealing with the changes from the corporate takeover.  Even though im still maintaining very high stats and bonus every month the strain of nobody knowing whats exactly going on while integrating new systems that are not fully ready to be released and many scheduling blunders takes a lot out of you.  I stay positive and make sure that i am the last person the customer speaks with and they leave happy and informed.
good,"AT&T is a good place to work. Many people have been there for years, since the days of SNET. Very casual atmosphere, but the technology is fairly cutting edge."
good,Great company to work with.   Good work culture and lot for support and encouragement for pursuing further learning and education. Company work life balance is positive.
good,"This work is quite repetitive. I explain and talk about pretty much the same thing to new customers. That is 1:1. It's simple when it comes to plans. We do stand most of the time especially when it's busy. No time to sit or think. "
good,"The job didn't feel nearly as secure as before. Benefits are great! Discounts on AT&T services are wonderful as well. Management outside of the store level seems to distant from what actually takes place at a retail level. They have been ""out of the game"" too long."
good,"AT&T was probably one of my favorite jobs.  I learned a lot of skills on the job.  Met some amazing people and contacts.  "
good,I've had some issues as a customer. I would still recommend At&t to anyone. The company site that i was working for closed and some promises were made that worker would be able to work in other posiitions however the vendor did not follow through with various promised. At&t is still a great company.
good,AT&T gave me a opportunity to grow as a person. They taught me skills to be a better sales person and how to in gauge with all types of customers. Great benefits for my family
good,it was an easy day at work just get your work done. Learned to work with all types of customers. It was a hard day if it was raining other than that a nice job to work at.
good,"Really enjoyed coworkers and management. Training was thorough and I never felt unprepared. Dealing with weather and heat got rough, but all in all it was a great place to work."
good,Good place to work and i am happy to work here.good management and work culture is also fine here.the most enjoyable work environment.i learned alot from AT&T.
good,Excellent company to work for.  AT&T cares about their employees. Didn't offer overtime pay but the commission percentage made up for it.  Always had monthly goals to acquire but AT&T always seemed to raise the goals to almost make them unattainable.
good,"Fun at work was the main part I enjoyed and people at all the level were quite friendly. "
good,"Hardest part of this job has to be the management. The job itself is not that tough, but management does have the slightest idea on how to run things."
good,"The pay is fantastic, the training is great, the benefits & time off are wonderful. My only issue was with my direct manager who was very inconsistent with those he didn't care for"
good,Las comisiones de AT&T son muy buenas mas el salario que te dan por base
good,"very fast paced. great people to work for.  the most enjoyable part was helping customers and getting to know them on a personal level."
good,long hours but good pay. shorter hours during the winter season. no flexibility in schedule. room for career growth. great training program that will give you the  fundamentals to succeed but the rest is up to you. if you afraid of heights this is probable not a great choice.
good,"A Great Place to Work, AT&T offers many benefits to employees and overtime work if you are looking to get ahead of the game in your career.  The management is on the look out for some great additions to the fast paced standards that answers the customer questions and provides the response to value AT&T servies."
good,Co Workers are friendly and helpful. Discounts on services are nice and they also offer great health coverage. Would be nice if they recognized workers good performances more often rather than focusing on what people are doing wrong.
good,good place to work but be prepared to lose your personal life your life will be at&t angry customers and constant criticism from management no matter how good you do your job they will find something thing to critic and hassle you about
good,"Great company, great benefits, poor communication.  Innovative, but quick to push out which causes conflict within.  Politics are heavy in each market"
good,"The company compensates well in most aspects, of course there is always room for improvement.  The work environment isn't always positive which makes it hard to be excited to go to work everyday.  I must admit that the work/life balance is extremely skewed and it is difficult to plan normal life events around the schedule."
good,"Buena empresa en crecimiento, horarios flexibles. Apoyo como primer empleo a estudiantes sin experiencia."
good,"My day started early and sometimes did not end on time. I earned that knowledge is power and that learning every day to get better is a requirement. My managers were always receptive and hard-working, strict with policy but fair. My co-workers knew what was expected of them and did their best to deliver on expectations. The hardest part was making sure that all my work was done for that day before I left and the most enjoyable part was seeing that through to its successful conclusion."
good,"Picking up service or maintenance calls one at a time which is good and bad because you are not assigned to an appointment you are required to get to, but if people fall behind then everyone is behind. Also, technicians are not allowed to go back to a job site without first  having a job order created.  The computer program used to perform work functions is not very effective and in fact makes it harder, the original program was much more effective. Local area manager not willing to cooperate with minor issues, mainly the maintenance of the work garage. The hardest part is finding the right department to resolve what would seem like and easy fix. The most enjoyable part of the job meeting new people everyday, having the challenge of knowing how the system works and having to make it work for every new situation."
good,Great way to experience sales and customer service. The job brings opportunity to feel comfortable speak with customers. 100% commission for this job and lots of walking (door to door sales)
good,"Demands are put upon employees that are stressful when working on the tasks, but rewarding when accomplished. However in todays world, there are a lot of mergers and with them come - unfortunately - downsizing."
good,"The work environment was generally as described through interviews and training. The only exception was the integration of DirecTV into the mix. DTV didn't fit well into the number's system that all technicians were rated on. Being responsible for U-verse Internet/TV/Phone, plus DTV, made it much more difficult to make your numbers goals. Plus, I just didn't enjoy working with the DTV product. U-verse was more cutting edge, coaxing high performance internet & TV out of legacy copper wire networks. DTV was old coax-based tech & not interesting to me. It was also more physically challenging installing dishes in lousy weather. As a remote work force, micro-management is a must, so be prepared to be closely observed through GPS and iPad workflow app. I had two excellent managers that I liked a lot, and interacted with a couple of others that were very good. Coworkers were a mixed bag, like most places- some excellent ones, some not so much. This was my first exposure to a union environment, and I didn't care much for it. There's a deep-seated ""us versus them"" sentiment in the work force that I wasn't used to. Finally, be prepared to see people at their absolute worst as you enter their homes to install product."
good,"Good company with decent pay. If you are not a good looking girl, it is really hard to get promoted in Austin. The director only help those types of people."
good,Enjoyed my employment with them however pay is not the best compared to industry.They invest in training employees which is a positive and learn alot from these.
good,Management beyond the store level needs serious improvement. Ops team are heavily overworked with the amount of stores that need assistance. Store Manager turnaround is every quarter. Poor handling of sensitive situations.
good,I enjoyed working for this company! it was fun and you got to help people and learn about electronics and the things you could do paperless. I never knew what a iPhone was and what it could do before I worked for this company.
good,"The customers are my joy, the management - however, aren't.  When I was hired on, sales was never to be a part of what I did.  Now they are forcing me to be dishonest by ""helping"" customers by selling them something.   I love my coworkers and my customers.  Management leaves much to be desired.  They are disconnected from reality and don't give a care to anything other than their stats and their bonuses."
good,"An average day i would drive 175 mile to do 2 day it was very unproductive, when there was plenty of work in my usual area. I learned and crafted many skills with the company, but now for what i learned they do not want to pay what we know. i enjoy working for the company and love talking and meeting with different customers"
good,"I worked for AT&T Mobility for five years. I watched the evolution of technology and enjoyed the ride as long as I could. Over the years, quotas got higher and reaching goals become more challenging for me. I believe the company has much to offer as far as benefits and compensation, but you must be in a money-making mindset. It's a world of sales, and I was and still am more customer service oriented."
good,come in log into phones and take calls.learned technical strategies to help customers.management was upfront and focused.it was on track to being organized.
good,"constant changes, great products, challenging and demanding with goals but can be fun.  Management and comp plans change very frequently. Lack of advancement opportunities."
good,very hands on with everything interacting with people on a daily and a different experience every day. not always interactive with the managers unless job has to be fixed due to outside issues. most difficult part of the day would be something going wrong and not being able to complte a job you were on all day. most enjoyable part of the day would be seeing the satisfying look on a customers face after job has been done correctly and is completed.
good,"Diversity is a topic that is very important and a key focus not just on paper, but in the work place.  CEO is championing this from the top and leading the dialogue."
good,"It was a great place to learn about sales, and how to interact with customers and getting customers to open up by asking opened ended questions on what they came in the store for."
good,With the recent mergers and acquisitions the company has sought out ways to balance the bottom line and as a result several employees have bee released.  Structure in the San Antonio region relies heavily on who is known rather than what is known.
good,Three stints as a contractor and found nothing to complain about. Would recommend AT&T to anyone with the skills necessary to do any job you might apply for.
good,"I actually loved working for at&t in Harahan, la. very fast paced and professional. moving to Atlanta changed my perspective. It was much slower and less money to be made."
good,"Great for learning about telecommunications and its future. Constant change in managerial direction. Fast paced, that was last month what about today mentality."
good,"Enjoyed this work environment and the job wasn't overwhelming. My overall experience working at Bellsouth, At&T then changing to yp.com was a great experience. I was truly upset due to being surplus."
good,Great company to work for. Always advancing to adapt to the industry. There is always training to be done to stay up to date with industry changes. Sales driven but great team environment that allows for personal growth.
good,If you do your job well and do what is asked of you and have 10 years of solid employment history with nothing but meets or exceeds in your annual reviews they will still fire you to cut salary.
good,"Busy Start to Finish Mostly Tech work, VOIP, Ethernet Install wiring Equipment Switches, Servers etc. Terminate and test everything. Document using Office Products Excel, Outlook etc."
good,"•	Customer service, multi-line telephone use, processing upgrades and activations, cancellations, up-selling, suggestive selling, ordering merchandise, plan changes, processing credits, daily communication, meticulous note taking, reviewing and editing bills"
good,"I maintained customer and co-worker rapport by listening to resolving concerns. I Established voice and data networks by running, pulling, terminating and splicing cables. It was always something new everyday."
good,"Coming from the military, the management structure has a poor leadership structure. Often managers are asphyxiate on numbers instead of customer quality and retention services. The overall job is exciting and the benefits are excellent."
good,Good work place but the management is not very supportive. New ideas are not accepted by the management. Salary and benefits  are good
good,worked as contractor and not much experience with real work culture. contractors not exposed to any company events or benefits
good,"If learning is your goal, AT&T has the infrastructure to do so. But if you want to develop better skills for the future, this environment may not be the best"
good,"Overall, a good place to work. Friendly people in a call center environment. My only grievance is that their attendance policy sets you up for failure if you happen to get sick. It is the most strict of any attendance policy that I have encountered in my career. This policy is what soured my want to work for this company."
good,I've worked for this company for almost 10 years and they have great pay and great benefits. Lot's of room to grow if you work hard and network. There is something for everyone no matter what skill set.
good,"Work with others and on your own,hard to get work done in the rain.Ladder safety,the ride home"
good,Good place to work. Great benefits. Good salary. Excellent training program. Always a chance to learn more and stay up to date on all current company know-how.
good,Enjoyable workplace with enthusiastic coworkers and upper management.  The work-life balance was great.  Never too stressful at all as everyone was very supportive and helpful.
good,"Supervised a crew of eight technicians responsible for the installation and maintenance of telephones in the Melrose exchange.  Responsible for administering union contracts, customer service, human resources, training, inventory management, and motor vehicle maintenance."
good,Nice company to work with. A lot to learn related to Reporting and the Process. Learned how to manage a Team. The enjoyable part of the job is innovating your own ideas.
good,"Start early and end late. Hard work and long days pay off. Great training but unfortunately not always job security because needs of business may change. This is natural in the industry, not limited to AT&T because of fast pace of technology."
good,"Leadership goals and objectives did not seem to actually matter at the lower levels.  BAU even though changes were being implemented about culture and new roles."
good,"Everyday i would load up all my systems that i would need during my calls and stats. I handled inbound/outbound calls, submitted cases, processed payments and payment arrangements"
good,"AT&T has offered me a greater experience in working with some elite people, I have learned the dynamics of running and operating in a large facility of technology. At times, it was challenging due to coming from a background of just customer services. Also training people who as well did not have the opportunity to work in the technology field was even more difficult but enjoyable to see the wonderful outcome of their entire training."
good,"Good company with good working environment.               "
good,"Was able to handle a large Website with complex server side middle tier with millions of records and millions of hits and millions of customers - using Java, ATG Dynamo Web Application Server (DAS), Oracle Database."
good,Fast paced environment. Management and coworkers were great. Hardest part of the job was customers upset. I worked in a bad cell location so constant complaints about dropped calls and internet usage
good,"good work with great pay, but not a great work life balance. there is a great training program to get you started. the managers have unrealistic demands of job performance."
good,I have learned a vast number of things working for AT&T.  The company is continuously changing and growing.....never a dull moment.
good,"Great way to get your foot in the door with a large and successful company. One drawback is that you don't necessarily get to choose which team you intern with, therefore it might not pertain to your interests"
good,"very busy and a chance to learn new things is ample. "
good,"very nice place to work also the atmosphere is a good environment"
good,"Enjoyed working with Att, trouble shoot cell phones as well went over billing and take payments, assisted customers with getting to know device and ensure service was working"
good,AT&T is one of the funnest places I've ever worked. They definetly take care of their employees and make sure they know how appreciated they are every day.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the team that I worked with.  This was a very interactive team with a willingness to support each other on both a professional and a personal level.
good,Good company to work for if you aren't looking for advancement. To get a promotion into management was all about the game of politics. If you did not know the right people your chances of promoting were slim to none.
good,"Loved it when it was att very good benefits, stock options and great management.  When Cingular took over it was not a very good place to work for, got a little better went they switched back to att."
good,Enjoy my position with AT&T. I like keeping up with all the latest technology. My typical day involves managing a team of 19 sales representatives and drive sales.
good,"Took orders from customers, prepared food, took prepared orders to the customer. Cleaned prepped food area and restaurant."
good,Meeting new customers everyday and having fun selling products to customers that will benefit them. Love working with management to brain storm on how we will execute everyday.
good,Got to talk on the phone each day to current and potential customers and sell them services for thier business needs. Great leadership and coachig to become the best you can
good,"Enjoy working for this company. Pay is very good, anything worth while is going to have a lot of training and requirements. Training is alright, anymore just give basic training to new hires.   But can raise and take care of your family with this corporation."
good,I enjoyed meeting the people and the experience I gained from the employers at AT&T. I will able be able to apply the things that I learned at my future employment.
good,"AT&T offers so many different avenues for many different skill sets.  It's a big brand company, an IT company, but still also sort of a utility.  "
good,Great benefits and pay but strict on employees. Educational reimbursement and 401k is wonderful. No pension for new hire managers. Most units within the company are union represented.
good,I worked for Sprint for 8 months then the merger with nextel happened and since I was on of the newest rep's I was let good. I received a very nice severance package
good,"Very friendly co workers and supervisors. You're able to advance with Directv sales. Job was pretty simple, just a lot of things to catch on to all at once."
good,"Overall, great place to work. incentive programs and bonus for outstanding work and meeting goals. Excellent training thru out entire work experience there"
good,"The Job I perform is very demanding, but is also very rewarding because you help people resolve there issues. The learning is never ending; especially with all the great products hitting the market, and neither is the personal growth! The workplace is sometimes mundane but management will often, go the extra mile to cheer things up with, potlucks, cookouts, theme dress-up days, and even daily treats to keep the energy levels cranking. Also, on occasions, someone may pull a fire alarm or we might just have a scheduled fire drill, but either way a bit of fresh air away from the building (with pay, no doubt), comes in handy and is well appreciated! Ultimately, It's the terrific pay, great co-workers that support each other like a family, and the teamwork put forth to accomplish our company's mission, that makes it all worthwhile."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, good work enviroment and overall Good place to work, lots of overtime, good benefits and great pay.   Incentives were also a plus"
good,"make sure all techs are onsite by 8 am"
good,"AT&T overall was a great place to obtain experience working with people of all demographics. I learned how to expertly deescalate situations, as well as how to communicate effectively and precisely."
good,My time in the army was fun but challenging.  Basic training was most challenging of all but I had a lot of fun. Germany was great but Ft Hood sucked.
good,Great benefits and a company that is still growing with the changes in technology with its focus on the future. A typical day at work is always focused on the customer from old service to brand new service.
good,"Worked for company over 17 years, with the latter years unstable due to mergers and acquisitions. Wireline Leadership seem to protect their own, leaving the observation of not what you know but whom."
good,"Although a company with great benefits etc, the company seemed a little grey. you weren't allowed to be entirely yourself."
good,Was there for a long time just needed a change. I would say if they still had the data dept in our state I would be willing to go back. good people to work with as well
good,It started off a great place to work with wonderful benefits. Over the last few years things have become more about do more with less. They are surplussing managers to make way for automation.
good,"Overall..pretty good company to work for.Although it's in a retail setting,it's pretty sales driven.Everything is weighted and has metrics for the company.Company has been increasing sales goals,but decreasing commissions,making it seem like RSC are slowly becoming customer service reps,with sales goals."
good,"AT&T provides the flexibility required to balance work and family."
good,"* Prospecting new business and company provided leads face-to-  face for the purpose of selling out Internet and print advertising  products. "
good,"Great paying Job with great benefits wish it did not have QA""s and less  stress on employees but I love talking to new people everyday and all over the world"
good,i worked for this company for many years and learned a lot here. it was a great opportunity and opened a lot of doors for me and my career. i recommend working here.
good,"AT&T provides employees many opportunities for growth through peer leadership roles, challenging projects, M&A activity to gain scale and vertical integration, and numerous professional development employee organizations."
good,"I wanted to stay with this company until I retired, but lost my job via the surplus process after the merger.  The are leading the way into the future, and wish I could be a part of it."
good,Working at AT&T makes you feel like you're working for something bigger. The co-workers are friendly and the time passes at a pretty quick pace
good,Would start my day by logging in to all my computer systems and phone. I learned alot about trouble shooting. Management was not overbearing on employees.Most of your co-workers are team players.
good,"At&t really invest in you learning and being the best sales associate you can. A typical shift s long, but you do receive an hour lunch."
good,"I loved the job. Everything that we did was fun and we were always busy assisting customers. The hardest part of the job was the management. They were constantly making changes without telling anyone until last minute, and were making working conditions very hard for the employees."
good,Has many products both wireline and wireless to provide customers with a solution. They have pulled out of some regional areas where they had a very visible logo presence.
good,Working as a sales executive I had a great work/life balance but the department was very disorganized. I wasnt getting appropriately compensated and there was role confusion within the organization (no clear role objective).
good,"La empresa consideró es una de las mejores par trabajar, solo que la actual situación país ha hecho que se realice disminución de personal, por falta de divisas para el fuerte principal que son las ventas de equipos y suscripciones nuevas, lo que de alguna forma ha afectado el ambiente laboral."
good,"- Assumption development and research of industry trends"
good,I believe my time and experience with the company set me up for future jobs in a variety of places do to the ever changing world of technology
good,"When I was a worker at teleperformace, I did enjoy my job very much.  I was a customer service rep and the pay was ver nice, and I also enjoyed taking calls and helping customers resolving there issue."
good,"Buena empresa, muy buen personal y compañerismo. Escasa capacitación para el personal que podría ayudar a concretar ventas o estar actualizado en temas de interés."
good,it was not a little difficult at times was never really allowed to get off the phones unless having to use bathroom or for lunch other than that the management was ok could of been better
good,The work culture is very open and flexibility offered depends on the teams working in. All the managers I had were also reasonable and understanding. If possible I will love to go back to Cisco again.
good,"Pay is decent in the area but the job can be overwhelming at times. The schedule is horrible, no consistency even for longtime employees. Expect to work most nights and weekends. All and all a decent company to work for."
good,"I loved working for AT&T, everyone was treated as an equal and worked as a team even though we had individual goals to meet. We were a threat to a lot of the other competitors."
good,AT&T was a good company to work for with solid benefits. They had a great education program called AT&T University which provided many technical courses and programs.
good,I didn't really work for them however I do have them as my phone carrier.  I also tried to get into this job after I left AT&T however the pay was not enough for me
good,"A large company with reliable earnings. Unfortunately, it is a trend to lean towards fewer ""boots on the ground"" in favor of outsourced call centers. As a field technician ,I enjoy the experience of working to restore communications directly helping everyday people in their homes and businesses. The men and women in the field work hard and there is a unique cooperation to help each other do their job better. The job can get rough with harsh weather, but it is most gratifying to know you are responsible for keeping the lines of communication open."
good,"Good pay, Good benefits, educational benefits, training opportunities, most co-workers well educated.  Can be long hours and difficult working conditions"
good,Great staff and great membership. Highly recommend working here as it is a great source for networking and career growth both in the golf industry and outside of it.
good,"AT&T is committed to the development of their employees.  Besides the typical regulatory requirements, AT&T is investing in their future as a top-tier entertainment company by providing their employees with IT training."
good,"Working at AT&T is fun, their is always activities, eating, the snack cart is always there, the people are friendly, the bosses are nice and funny it is a pleasure working at AT&T"
good,The company is in transition causing multiple changes.  Some changes are successful and many are a work in progress.  The outcome is yet to be seen however the company is solid and will come out leaner.
good,For an inbound telesales job it paid very well. They are very strict with attendance however if you show up on time and when you are supposed to then it is not an issue.
good,Company is very good if you know how to sell (I was on the retail side). You will make good money if you hustle. The company takes care of their best.
good,"Management is only concerned with numbers, does not care if a job is done well, only that it is completed on time, and doesn't look horrible."
good,"This is a good company to work for. The best thing about the company is the pay. They have great compensation. However the thing that I dont like about at&t is their morals. They do not care about the exsiting customers. They just want new business. For example the new customers get better deals than the exsiting customers."
good,"Great team- very interesting work- telecommute accepted, I worked only for 6 months, so dont have much to say, contract to hire was not an option. They had a good cafetaria on site, manager was understanding and friendly."
good,"good money micromanaged good place for people who are sales and goal driven, long hours no personal life always at work. manger will always be down your neck and you are never right in this company."
good,"When I was hired on, there were ways to advance with the company. Now the only way to advance is to move to management. The higher payed technician positions are slowly fading away due to restructuring."
good,"at Directv, I managed Argentina and Brazil sales and it really provided an enriching experience as I learned about Latin Contries culture, markets and finance systems. I improved my sales and marketing skills and was very successful. Directv had great benefits and the commissions were good, the salary was OK."
good,"Good Company, good benefits, Job can be pleasant when you are under good management. Tough job speaking with customer's on back to back calls, as the queue is high. Good compensation overall."
good,"Working at Directv is good, you learn new things everyday that comes with the job. I learned a lot about the different satellites that we use and various channels for particular boxes that are installed. From this job you will learn how to manage time management skills because when you are out in the field you have a certain time frame to complete your task. The hardest part about this job I would say is running the lines in the attic and some crawl space. Besides the cons at this job the most enjoyable part is looking at your work after it is completed."
good,good  benefits its good place to work the pay isn't very good learned new things everyday meet new people management could be better lots of great benefits
good,"ATT was a great job. I gained a lot of knowledge, the pay was great and the freedom was great. But management needed some improving."
good,"More flexibility and independents the hours can be long, and it is all commission I don't sell I don't eat concept. I go door to door cool calling ECT."
good,"sell over 100% of monthly quota"
good,"Typically, work was very productive fulfilling your daily duties. I learned a lot about the ins and outs of analyzing; maintaining a good rapport with upper management; creating a stable work environment with co-workers; and the importance of constantly enhancing technical skills i.e. Microsoft Office. The management team was very supportive and as a manager, my team and I continued to encourage each other from a supportive aspect as well. My co-workers and I had a strong bond. We executed our jobs as ONE voice. The hardest part of the job was responding to call center managers challenges of the validity of analysis submitted by me and my team. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility of our environment."
good,"great place to work "
good,"Through the course of 15 years the company was bought/merged 5 times. For the most part my manager and job function stayed the same. Cultures changed and cost cutting (job cuts), made it an uneasy environment to work in."
good,Great place to work if you're looking for stability but not ideal if looking for advancement based on achievements.
good,"During my time at AT&T, i was given the opportunity to be in charge of my weekly earings.  They offered a good work and life balance.  I was limited to forty hour work weeks, had weekends off and paid holidays."
good,"The job had really good pay and management when I was working there, the same problems where evident as everywhere else problems between management and employees that where under performing but nothing else"
good,If you are looking for steady work this is the place. Don't expect much else though. Very frustrating trying to do your job when you are not allowed to order the materials needed.
good,"I enjoy working anywhere i can utilize my best attributes which is dealing with customer service, dealing with people, selling and being around people is my favorite. The feeling I get from up-selling a customer brings great pleasure to me and leaving the customer satisfied with they're purchase."
good,Part time job during college. Wasn't the best experience ever. I worked as a telemarketer. It did teach me how to handle unhappy customers effectively and politely.
good,this is a good job out of college but not a lot of room for growth. i would recommend it though. great environment and experience
good,"I enjoy the people I work with and the job itself, but management is always breathing down your neck. They don't let you do your own work. They're always questioning everything you do and they don't allow you to do your own work."
good,"I worked as an Account Manager for AT&T's LGEM customers- government, education (schools, colleges, universities), and medical (clinics, hospitals) accounts. It was an office setting position, and communicating with my customers was over phone or via email. At times it was a very stressful position, not only because I worked with a higher profile customer, but I oversaw 1,400 of them across the United States. Not only did I have a sales quota to strive for every month, I also had to handle the customer service side of things. Such as: billing, service, and account issues. However, it was a great learning experience. I learn the importance of being organized and how to time manage wisely. I had the best team and management to work with, and that was the hardest part about leaving. I put in my resignation to go back to school full time. I wish I had more time with the company, but it was perfect timing go to back to school."
good,"The position I had with Direct required weekly travel to the various locations of the offices I managed,  The leadership was adequate at best when new conditions or issues would arise.  My stint with Direct was great but the travel was too much for me to take."
good,"AT&T is a good place to work with. The project I have worked for gave me the opportunity to improve my skills. "
good,"It was a great place to work and professional people too. I learned so very much and really enjoyed my time there. Great benefits, good pay, and people who care about each other."
good,"AT&T is a great company with, I believe, a very bright future. "
good,The program was a great opportunity. Leverage your resources and be charismatic and you'll get far. The program was cut short upon our arrival. Other things seemed to be not as though through as it should have been.
good,"Responsible for development and attainment of sales objectives through subordinate sales personnel within single or multiple sales channels for a geographic area. Key Roles and Responsibilities: Develops and attains sales objectives within area of assignment. Supervises staff and assures optimization of available resources to meet and/or exceed sales objectives. Supervision of staff includes responsibility for hiring, training, developing, disciplining and contributing to decision making regarding discharge of subordinate employees. Works in partnership with cross functional organizations to develop sales effectiveness. Responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures specific to area of assignment."
good,The hours were not that much but the people i worked with were super amazing and fun. I loved every minutes talking to people and helping them with anything they needed.
good,Good work life balance if you have been a few years. They are working on culture and that seems to be helping a lot. I am currently being laid off since they are outsourcing my department.
good,"I worked for this company for almost 14 years in a call center in Columbus,GA. Call centers are high stress positions and not family oriented."
good,I love this job as long as the managers aren't all over your back. I constantly meet the numbers but when someone else in the garage gets in a wreck or does something stupid it makes the managers micromanage.
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for, however I would recommend staying out of the Call Centers. The lack of stability across the center is nerve racking at times.  I have been an employee for 10 years and just found out that I will be surplussed beginning July 22nd. Unfortunately these things happen, but the opportunity for advancement is slim.  However the benefits and the perks of the job are great."
good,"This company was a very busy, loud, free form, working environment."
good,"Got some questions? Have some answers."
good,"Was a great place as a contractor.  "
good,Typical day at work revolves around meeting the daily sales goals. Driving to be the best sales consultant you can be by giving top notch customer service and being the educated consultant the customer needs on a daily basis. The managers have all worked as sales consultants before so some make it an easier environment to work in all while giving you selling tips to exceed your goals and to help you grow. My co workers make the day go by without their enthusiasm work would not be as fun. The best part of the job is being able to be myself and meeting new people all while assisting them.
good,"Customers were difficult at time but some were wonderful, Co workers were underpaid and forced to work overtime alot. Management was very corporation like. Fired employees regularly to make a  statement to other employees."
good,Good company. Can be physically demanding at times to maintain good numbers and keep management off your back. Offer a pretty good 401 K plan. The chain of command is military style. Work is kind of slow right now. All in all it's a pretty good company when work picks up.
good,"AT&T treats its employees well, but is currently going through the pains of transitioning into a more agile organization. Currently, the company has more than its fair share of legacy systems and legacy employees which are hindering the velocity of this transition. However, the CEO has outlined a clear plan for developing employees and new organizational structures so as to accommodate the transition. The sales organization has a consistent loom of reorganizations and other ""people shuffling"" in order to find the best, most cost effective structure. If AT&T can achieve its 2020 goal within the next 3.5 years, it will really become a great place to work."
good,quotas are raised to be unreachable AT&T has cut down on several support roles making the job difficult to perform your duties.
good,"A very fast paced environment that pushes for your excellence, using fun activities and engaging strategies. Corporate store environment was always great, especially with the staff we had."
good,"Advertising was terrific, helping others' businesses grow.  Yellow pages were becoming obsolete tho. On line marketing was profitable & new when I worked there The terrible loss for our country with 9/11 & later the stocks in 2008,took a great toll on the small businesses."
good,Good Company to work for at the time. The division I worked for ended up closing after 12 years. I enjoyed working with my co workers and have many long relationships as a result. The pay was excellent. The hours were terrible at first because it went by seniority but after several years got better.
good,The fact that I close almost every day i work is what i don't like about it. There are some days I go to work and I only see about 3-4 customrs due to location of the new store. My managers are cool and helpful. The hardest part about my job is working nights and not being able to have a social life.
good,"I loved my job, I was given my responsibility of my job and each day completed my work.  "
good,the co workers were good people. i gained a lot of experience and will miss the place. best part was a job i loved had good pay and benefits
good,AT&T is a good company to work for with an OK benefits package.  They are very metric oriented.  The most stable area of the company is the wireless side.
good,"consists of informing customers all day on products and services. I learned a lot of backend work and inventory upkeep. Co-workers are awesome and the hardest part of working here is that theres no steady days off, they change every week and the hours are very inconvenient if you have a family in which both adults work. The most enjoyable part of this job is being on top of the technological world and helping people choose the right devices for them."
good,I am part of a friendly team doing a helpful job for the customer. I learned a lot about how the mobility network in US is structured and what technology AT&T uses.
good,"Its a good opportunity to work there."
good,The work environment is inviting. The work that we perform is hard due to the clients that call into the center.The clients that are harsh to the agents only make up about 10% of the individuals that call. For the most part there are good people that call and just want help.
good,Not a very stressful job. Management has a open door policy. I have worked here over 3years the people are very friendly and fun. If you don't know the answer someone is always willing to help. Att offers online training that is free to employees.
good,Politics as usual. Management is knowledgeable but not trustworthy. Coworkers are the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job is meeting the metrics which are impossible to keep up
good,AT&T is a great company with lots of potential for career growth. I would recommend this company to someone looking to start a sales career with a great stable company.
good,A typical day at work includes micromanagement to the minute; 480 minutes to be exact.  Relentless engineering issues.
good,I learned a lot while working for this telecom giant but I found that relocation to Texas headquarters would have been necessary for professional growth.
good,"high pressure to meet standards however good company to work for"
good,"I've enjoyed 15+ years tenure with AT&T that can be challenging, but rewarding as well.  The company is constantly in a dynamic of change to stay abreast of telecommunication environment and technologies.  Work successfully with a team of self-managed individuals who contribute to meeting critical milestones and achievements.  Compensation and benefits package is excellent, however job stability is constantly uncertain based on the needs of the business."
good,AT&T GB LTD is a very successful company with many perks to the job when it comes to learning new skills and improving your knowledge in the electrical field.. however due to the structure of the company there is no way of progressing with in the part of the warehouse of which i work.
good,"AT&T is a fantastic company that does a lot of great things. Unfortunately, management buffers results to appease upper management. This goes on for several levels creating a false sense of security."
good,"Process payroll for the previous week"
good,"Exhausting "
good,"Generally positive work environment with structured management oversight, good part time position will schedule around class times while still maintaining enough hours to make a living"
good,Provides excellent training for management processes. Hours for management can change based on needs of the business.
good,Fast paced growing company.  It's exciting to always promote new products every month.  The telecommunication industry is never dull with the revolving innovative products.
good,"Management was easy to collaborate with, especially the General Manager and immediate manager. The hardest part of the job was the drive and of course the  metrics set in place could be challenging at times."
good,Requires much growth.  Not your typical sales job---more work and more opportunity than most.  Will turn you into the strongest salesman and leader you can be.
good,"Take up to 80 calls a day. Work with customers to give them the proper services at a reasonable price. Worked in sales, new installs, current customers, repair, disconnect and recovery."
good,"long days! This job required a lot of traveling, talking to strangers, and making sure my team was ready to go out and produces the numbers we needed for the day. Management was ok they had a variety of unique approaches to selling. most of them had honed in on their strengths and were able to effectively teach others."
good,This is not actually a company.  It was an employee benefit provided by our union contract that allowed laid off employees a way to get the first option for available job openings so they could be rehired and continue their career with AT&T.
good,work place is very busy and productive and I enjoy helping others out and being a person can come to in need or anytime and I can use my assistance to help
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my job with ATT and the company as a whole. I do not like the way the management was for location I was at. A recent coworker that as helped me get the job with them was let go for some illegal activities at work and since then the management has cut my hours per week from 35+ down too 6, despite having no knowledge or activity in his illegal decisions."
good,Company is divided into core and other divisions that support dealer and other indirect sellers of AT&T products and services.
good,"A full day at work as a case manager is making sure to pull 8 cases 1 per hour, receiving inbound calls and making outbound calls and also following up on previous cases scheduled for that day."
good,"Co-workers are friendly and easy to work with, good work environment, learning atmosphere was fun and going to work daily was a blessing and a pleasure."
good,"Me mandaron a capacitación fuera de la ciudad, gastaba mas en transporte que lo que gané esas dos semana. Me tuve que quedar varios días en el pueblo para ahorrar dinero (en la Gran ciudad de Guadalajara no había nadie que me capacitara). Me contrataron diciendo que me enviarían a una tienda con un perfil interesante y termine en un supermercado, el jefe me decía todas las semanas que la siguiente ya me cambiaba."
good,"Working for Directv was excellent. The pay was decent for the role, the individuals I worked with with great. The only issue that I noticed is that the Site managers needed improvement."
good,"taking calls nonstop, learned about handling calls in a high work environment. nothing enjoyable about the job in my opinion."
good,"The Measurement Operation Support System (MOSS) is an information and reports repository that supports the tracking, analysis and reporting of Provisioning, Billing, Remittance & Credit/Collections measurements. MOSS facilitates the storage, access, and manipulation of large amounts of complex data. It is a centralized client/server Java/J2EE application. The reports are generated in excel and pdf format for analytical, statistical, and charting functionality"
good,Productive workplace had to multi-task at all times.  Kept me on the move all the time.  Co-workers were great nice fun working environment.
good,AT&T was a very great company to work for. Got to meet a lot of different people as a CSR/Tech. I love working there. Needs a little more growth in the Memphis location.
good,They are doing more with less folks these days. But you can't beat their training program. There is a big push for collaboration and strategic locations. My location was not one of them.
good,"Extremely knowledgeable leadership with real world experience."
good,Formal software development methodologies in C programming in the UNIX environment. Utilize a host of lab test equipment including protocol analyzers and data scopes.
good,a typical day would involve selling directv inside Sam's club. I learned many sales techniques from great managers. the hardest part of the job was 6 day work weeks.
good,I made good friends and the benefits and pay were awesome.  Ultimately I felt the company really did not care about it's employees.
good,good and efficiently managed organzation. learnt time management and multi-tasking skills improved tremendously.
good,"Paid training, receive benefits in 6 months time, given a company iPad and iPhone and company truck. Start work at 8am and you never know what time you get off. It depends on work load, and other technicians pace. This job is overall very well paying and independent. They teach you the basics and it's up to you to learn how to troubleshoot and make your own techniques. They push safety like no other which is good. You will have your bad days and there will be good days. The toughest days are when the weather comes such as rain and cold days. Not every home you go to install will look like an organized home that looks like something out of Full House. People are messy and dirty sometimes. Overall it's a great job and you learn a lot of good handy skills such as wiring phones and cable lines. Good job if you love to work and get paid overtime."
good,"I got a chance to work with all types of people from different career backgrounds. "
good,fun work environment with much opportunity to interact with customers and maintain competitive sales goals. Great to move up in the company and advance.
good,Directv has been acquired by ATT and policies were changing when I left. Layoffs are planned and new hiring is limited. Contractors were let go soon after the take over.
good,The great think about this job is that you get to meet and interact with customers. The ability to provide outstanding customer service and help people is always a good thing in this day and time.
good,work there has been fine. people are good the upper management does not seem to be concerned with the lower tier employees.
good,Promotes marketability for all employees - provides adequate online training to ensure skill enhancement for employees
good,"I have enjoyed by time at AT&T, and still do. The company keeps me up to date with the latest cellular technology, and offers great bonuses. AT&T also provides stability and great benefits for me and my family."
good,The pay and benefits are great but the company has error-ed in choosing short term savings at the cost of efficiency and quality of customer service
good,"Work was performed in a call center environment. I spoke with customers on the phone to help them resolve technical issues with their cellular devices. I learned how to fix the most common issues that come up with cellular devices and learned how to track down solutions to problems I had never seen before. I also learned that the best techniques for motivating team members to meet the required monthly statistics are to inspire competition between different teams and between your team members. Fear of disciplinary action was the main motivator at other call centers I have worked at, but at AT&T, we had incentives rewarded to the teams with the best scores, and rewards for individual team members. The peer pressure that team members would receive from their team mates proved to be a much more effective motivator than fear of punishment. The hardest part of the job handling irate, unreasonable who made demands that were impossible to meet. The best part of the job was at the end of the call, after fixing their issue, upset customers are turned in to grateful and happy people who feel bad about their earlier behavior."
good,Pude aprender a gestionar cobranzas y poder escuchar al cliente dentro de un muy buen clima laboral.
good,"Typically you will open the store, review any new products or promotions, check your progress for the week or month, here a lecture on selling more wired solutions like home security, internet, cable, phone ect. Then you wait around for customers and have to greet them perfectly. While helping them you have to remember to sell sell sell. Management can be awesome or awful and really shape your entire experience at the job. You'll involuntarily get close to coworkers. The hardest part is dealing with your manager who wants you to try to upsell even if the customers on the verge of tears because she lost all her contacts. The enjoyable part is happy customers."
good,"I worked inside business sales for AT&T a year. I enjoyed working for AT&T for the limited time I was there. I learned about how different business sales were compared to other sales. Management was very supportive and training was always available and continuous. The hardest part of the job was being unable to make sales over the phone as well as I could being face to face. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere of the office, team members, and management. AT&T was a great place to work."
good,Established internal organization regarding training development. Solid internal support of learning management staff and applications for research and content.
good,"Learned a lot in my time here. Management, co-workers and clients were all great. I would still be working here if they had not closed the facility."
good,"My typical duties included signing Costco members up for new service.  95% of the time I was saving people money, but that came with interrupting people while they shop.  I did well at my job but I really needed more consistency with my pay, that had to be the hardest part because it was really all commission.  I've worked a lot of sales job, which I have excelled at, but the stress caused by not knowing if i was going to completely broke after bills was way too much.  The most enjoyable was signing people up that had a previous service that was completely over charging them, and I switch them to a better service literally saving them in certain instances $40-$100 per month.  That kind of savings can change peoples lives and I'm glad I could be even a small part of that."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management and was nice to learn new things from colleagues.Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,It's a great place to work.  Made a lot of friends there and learned a lot about the dynamics of corporate America. Very customer focused as opposed to employee centered.
good,"Typical day at work is always worrying about metrics. Meeting a goal if you don't meet for so long you eventually get booted. "
good,Opportunity for career growth.  DTV appreciates diversity and will help develop next generation leaders.  There's not a lot of employers that re-invest into the employee.
good,This company just needs a few changes but overall a great company. The company could save tons of money and have more daily productivity if the dispatchers sent techs to jobs in the same town they live or surrounding cities.  I usually travel 2+ hrs to get to my jobs but I often see techs from out of town in the town or surrounds towns I live in.
good,"AT&T is a great place for employment if you are looking for a career with benefits and compensation. I see it suitable for someone who is single with not a lot of family. The balance between work life and home life is not good. AT&T's executives express little interest in trying to satisfy their employee's personal life. A few things I did not like about the Wire Technician position was that you never had a set schedule; you worked day to day and you never had a clue as to when you would be getting off work. As a parent that made it really hard to make plans or to pick up my child. Though the schedule was difficult to work with, the work environment and scope of work was pretty great. As a technician, I was out driving by myself all day which was nice, and I got to interact with customers. I enjoy working with customers and not being inside in one spot all day. The freedom of the job was really great."
good,"i enjoyed taking incoming calls helping customers set up new services or making changes to their services. selling entertainment packages, trouble shooting repair issues, selling cellular services."
good,"Day began with a meeting with the manager on current promotions. Then at your terminal calls came in on customers billing ,technical problems inquires.Calls came in every minute all day long except for breaks and lunch.After every call we documented the result of call then an upsell or down sell needed to be presented."
good,AT&T is a good company to start with. The work environment is not very stressful and coworkers are really helpful. There is a very positive environment for self learning and development.
good,"AT&T is trying to hard to create the universal rep/team.  It's missing the piece on where sales people focus on their specialty."
good,"Good company to work for. Good management, good continual training. Commission with uncapped potential. Good Company to work for with locations in St. Louis, Dallas and Birmingham."
good,"Working at Convergy's was very fun. It had such a fun workplace environment and all my co-workers were nice and friendly. We all had friendly competitions to try to do our best every day."
good,"A very diversified job working with customers who have varying degrees of speech and/or hearing losses.  Back to back inbound and outbound calls which created lots of overtime and mandatory six days in this busy 24/7 center.  Worked holidays and weekends, with a guaranteed Saturday off every 6 weeks.  Exceptional team work with co-workers who supported each other within their groups.  Very strict policy on confidentiality, attendance, and punctuality.  The company offered a variety of benefits such as healthcare, pension, 401K, and education options, to name a few."
good,company had opportunity for bonus. turn overrate was high. Laid off from that job. Overall the company was a good company. No room for advancement
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,I loved my job here the pay was wonderful my co workers were great! The thing I hated most about this job is that they did not care about my family at all. If I had children that were sick there was no calling in no matter what the circumstance was.
good,"i loved doing my job because i got got to to people of all races & back grounds,plus by covering most of the city.i got to visit areas that were new to me."
good,"Working for AT&T was a great experience. I gained wealth of customer service, sales support, and project management experience from my years of service with AT&T."
good,"I enjoyed this company immensely, but had to leave them when the contract ended.  This was a contract with the government so work hours, day to day work environment, etc.,, was within those parameters, but AT&T management were always helpful and friendly and honest."
good,Great place to work with extremely intelligent people.  Environment is extremely fast paced with no training program.
good,"Great moral, and work structure. Easy paced, great tools for learning. Managers were able to break things down in a manner that was easily learned by everyone."
good,"SW Bell Telephone is an equal opportunity employer, if you can pass the entry test and they have an opening they will hire you and it gives one the opportunity to work with a wide variety of people.  Also if you can pass the test for another type of work you can move into that type of work.  The benefits are good for the employees, but not as good as they once were.  The retirees have been treated poorly, misled and often lost benefits that were due them.  The company is based on a quasi-military mind set, seniority is everything, which is equally unfair to everyone.  As with any large company co-workers and managers vary from the very vicious to the very best of humanity.  If you are liked you can advance rapidly, if you are not liked you may not advance at all and may not be able to escape the situation you are in.  It's all about the numbers, the bottom line and the bonus the CEO can make this year.  There are still remnants of the 'good old boy' system that was once the way the company was run. The difficulty varies from department to department and is as dependent on the type of manager as on the job description.  If one stays long enough one can expect to have the company disappoint you somehow.   At one time  the company rewarded employee loyalty with retirement benefits, but no longer does so.  The main reward for hard work is more hard work.  All people with the same job title are paid the same.  There's time and a half for over time."
good,"The culture of the store changes from day to day. One day you may come in and everybody is bubbly and happy, the next day you come in people might be on their toes about potentially losing their job. For the most part it is a laid back place to work and I genuinely appriciate that. However, it seems as though upper management (our manager included) has intentions in the wrong places. Its hard to communicate with them or get anything done. They promised me a raise for months and still I have yet to recieve it. Needless to say, i'd like to go to a place where my hard work is appriciated."
good,Great place to work.  Advancement opportunities were limited only because of location and number of employees. Flexible schedule.  offered employee discount for service.
good,Very good training and benefits for employees.  Great place to make friends with co-workers.  Frequent communications from upper level management.  I would definitely recommend employment to others seeking to improving their skill sets in technology.
good,Its ok its a job it pays well as long as you are selling. Its a great job if you dont care about working long hours and most holidays and every weekend
good,AT&T is a great company to work for however I just did not like the department that I was assigned.  Other then that AT&T is a great place to work with advancement opportunities.
good,Fun work place and fast paced.  Very competitive and always changing. Enjoyed working with senior leadership in strategic planning.  Training was top notch.
good,Co-workers were very dedicated team players.  Troubleshooting capacity and utilization issues was an interesting part of my position.    The hardest part of my job was to find time for training.
good,The calls were demanding and extreme and management expected metrics that even they could not meet.  The pay definitely did not reflect the work load
good,"I loved working for DirecTV. They always showed employee appreciation by making sure our work days where never boring. I learned the in's and out's of a call center, as well as almost everything there was to know about directv. My co-workers were always team players and always helped one another. The most enjoyable part of the job was its unpredictableness., you never know how the days was going to go. The hardest part of the job was leaving."
good,ATT was a great place to work at one time. Expecting a lifetime career shortly fizzled into constant worry about longevity. Seems that the employee was less important than they let on.
good,I go into too do my work an enjoy the company of my co workers. I learn and get more experience in customer service. I enjoy the atmosphere of my co workers. No Hard part. My atmosphere
good,"This job allowed me to learn new information on a regular basis and I was able to help people with cell phone issues, giving me technical understanding of the cell phone industry. I gained beneficial knowledge of privacy and security measures taken to protect customer's information. I was able to work in close proximity with others giving me the opportunity to develop a team member attitude."
good,"At&T is a great company to work for, a lot of team work and the managers want everyone to succeed and be the best that they can be."
good,"I enjoyed working for Directv for the worst part. The only thing I didnt like was the fact that it seemed like we were back in high school with the amount of talking between co workers and management.  I feel like it should have been a little more professional as far as the work atmosphere goes. However, you were highly trained and knew what to do in most situations"
good,"Good company. Good pay guaranteed by the union.Very strict attendance policies, no consideration for special circumstances. If you exceed the allotted time off you will be fired. No exceptions."
good,"Good commission,had to walk most of the day, worked in the cold and hot weather.  Good management and good co-workers made the job fun.  Enjoyed providing customer service and making customers happy."
good,"AT&T is poised as of 2015 to become not only the leading provider of home, business, and personal mobile telecommunications services, but also an entertainment giant with the recent acquisition of DirecTV. To be part of the company during this special time is a pretty amazing thing. The future is limitless, but personally for me, it is time for change and the ""next chapter."" I am one who loves change from time to time!"
good,Overall this company is great! The culture here is amazing and management is always working to make things better. I work with a great and collaborative team with a manager that cares for everyone.
good,"You would arrive at work around 6:30am, First thing to do is to approve time sheets from the precious day and go through emails that would have been sent through the night. You would look at the trouble load and how many techs you had in each area. Assign the load to the techs and then have a conference call so all managers were on board with the others' plans. Next you would get the crew out of the garage and on the way to their first job. The manager would then pick a tech and drive to the job to make sure there were no safety issues, the quality was good, the customer was very satisfied, and make sure the tech was using his personal protective equipment in the proper way. From there you would go back to the office to have a Key Measurement Indicators call with the Area Manager. Once finished with this, you might have time to catch lunch on the go to see the next tech that could be an hour's drive away. Once there, you would do another quality sample, safety inspection, make sure the customer was very satisfied, and that the tech was using his PPE. From there, you would go back to the garage to make sure that all the remaining work was covered for the day and leave around 5:30 to 7:00pm. Once at home, you would fire up the computer to input all the information that you gathered for that day to the proper forms, which would take about 3 hours. Get ready to go to bed and quickly eat supper."
good,"Its a great place to work with unmatched benefits, compensation has seen a decline because of the chance in the commission structure. Their biggest area of opportunity is the the low mid management. But overall is a great place to work!."

good,Loved the job! Love to sale! Didn't care for the last manager I had. he was power trippy and shady!! Would throw his mama under a bus to keep his own butt out of trouble.
good,"Depending on the location it's generally the best retail has to offer. It can be a truly fun environment and is generally a pretty positive experience going to work. At times it can be challenging but the job is always achievable. The holiday times can be a little rough with long hours, inflexible schedules, and crazy customer interactions. Without a doubt I would recommend AT&T as a place to start your work experience because it teaches a wealth of valuable knowledge and experience."

good,"A typical day of a call center. Loads of work that you couldn't get done because of other calls that you had to put in front of your work. The other departments that called in wouldn't completely be honest and said they messed up. When you tried to get them to fix their problems and they would go to your manager because your answer wasn't good enough.  This was the daily things the craft had to deal with.  The management was good,  but hardly ever backed the employee up and the morale of the office stayed down. The people was great and we had a great time work with each other in order to get things working right for the customer. The people and the pay was the only good thing about the job."

good,"I worked with AT&T through my college's sales program. We had weekly meetings with our assigned Account Executive, who coached us through cold-calling and setting up appointments for AT*T Business Fiber. The market for this product was difficult to penetrate because we were going against big Fiber companies, but it was a valuable learning experience."

good,Lots of overtime required here. Stress levels go up typically after 1st year. the location is horrible and hard to get to. Upper management is difficult to communicate with and the Union is a JOKE
good,"A day at AT&T is never predictable, from the one-of-a-kind customers and employees makes each day unique in its own right. I learned a lot about the different many systems and protocols that take place in the World's largest communication company. The hardest part of the job, trying to troubleshoot without physically being present with the equipment that is being serviced. AT&T was one of my favorite jobs because it is a good company to work for and most of my services are with AT&T."
good,"I loved this job! I got to sit on the phones all day and sell people products I honestly believed in, cable T.V., cable Internet, and Telephony. I did sales, helped people with billing issues and technical support for those with cable T.V. (the Internet section was moved out of the Denver area while was working there.)"

good,AT&T provided decent pay and benefits.  The company is working to transform into an all IP and wireless based platform over the next five years.
good,"From my first day at AT&T I was well paid, enjoyed working with great co-workers. I was always learning updates and changes for the job I was doing at that time.  I was initially an Operator receiving between six to eight hundred incoming calls per day. Once that service became automated, I was taught Business billing.  The calls decreased tremendously.  Business billing took more time to investigate billing issues. The hardest part of my time at AT&T depended on whether I had an informed manager or one that just had the title and said it was not necessary to know my job.  This taught me to be a good investigator."
good,As a customr assistant we talked to people all over the world. I loved working here. th workplace activities and contest made the job even better.
good,"Assisted customers with issues regarding cellular phone service."
good,AT&T was the best place to work. everyone that worked there in previous years misses working there because they were so spoiled. We all wish we could come back.

good,The company works well to create a comfortable working environment. I loved the experience that I gained from working this position as well as the people I got to meet.
good,"AT&T purchased Alltel Wireless. My job duties as the North Carolina Alltel business rep included pairing up with AT&T business reps throughout North Carolina to introduce them to my existing accounts. I covered four counties in Eastern North Carolina and four counties in Western North Carolina We also made efforts to migrate as many customers as we could under new AT&T contracts before the 1/23/2015 auto migration date. The biggest job duty was to educate my existing customer base about the merger, assist them in ordering their replacement equipment, transfer their contacts, and answer any questions they might have. Even though I knew my position was going into surplus on 2/27/2015 I worked to the very end making sure my former customers were taken care of and assisted in the transition in a very professional manner."
good,Good place to work they really train you on the art and process of sales. Hardest part of the job is the long retail hours. Co-works are great and easy to form friends with everyone in the company.

The hardest part of the job was making sure everyone worked together and we all hit our goals to maximize the store revenue and our pay checks.

good,"A good place to work if you are looking for a decent job in Pueblo,  Very corporate and leave policies are overly strict.   I would recommend it overall, but you need to be sure you have your house in order before you start working here.  Backup babysitters and discipline are required."
good,"I enjoy everyone company at these job, people were friendly and out going.  If I have a chance I will go work there again.  They help out each other to all different ways to reach each goal every month."
good,I loved the culture of at&t. In an ever changing technology field it was exciting to be apart of. My only issue with at&t is the layoffs and the bad communication between upper management and associates.
good,"14 years with the AT&T. Good company to work for with good benefits, but the company is going through a transition right now and job security is not the best."
good,I enjoyed the customer care part of it. I like helping people and fixing things. It was competitive with sales and always kept you on your toes. a lot of change though

good,"A typical day starts by requesting a job from an automated dispatch system.  Job could be an install or repair.  Technician has to make sure he or she has all equipment needed to complete job.  Support from co-workers is very good, management support is also present.  Every job has a install or repair time allotment associated with the job and efficiency and quality are closely tracked."

good,I enjoy working for a large company because it allows me to experience different situations in the workplace and gain independence within my chosen field of work. At AT&T we are responsible for working closely with project managers and site aquisition managers often seeing a project from the first milestone to the last.
good,"As a Prem Tech with AT&T I learned a great deal about cabling and trouble shooting as each home provided new and different challenges.  The work was fun and allowed for creativity in installation as you work independently.  There was a great deal of support between team members as one day you may need advice on a project and the next day you are called to help another tech.  Management was strictly by the book with zero leeway for the smallest of issues.  Safety was priority number one with customer satisfaction a close second. Overall a great experience but in order to have the possibility of advancement requires the ability to play politics and knowing who requires the greatest amount of attention.  The union is strong and looks after its members closely.  I would recommend this position to anyone with basic cabling skills, a strong work ethic, strong attention to detail and wants to break into the AT&T family."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was having the opportunity to learn and grow through the challenges of telecommunications advancement with a team of peers and colleagues. It would be an honor and privilege to work as a permanent employee at this company.

good,"1. Good Peers"
good,Every day was different. Steep learning curve and working under pressure. Great people to work with.
good,On a daily basis I help maintain connections for customer's internet and help customers with emails.  Friendly atmosphere and have many friends who I can family. I learned that I can always get better at my job and have support from management to do just that.
good,"I installed directv to customers houses. I would travel to a location and determine if I could get a clear line of sight to install a satellite. If so I would then install the satellite dish and run wires from the dish to the desired rooms. I would then install receivers to the televisions, connect the wires, and activate the receivers. Once the receivers were active and working, I would then show the customer how to work the receivers and how the system worked. Once that was complete I would get the customers signature and leave to the next scheduled  job on my handheld."
good,I have already reviewed my work at DirecTV. I do not have anything to add. Thank you.

Due to an opportunity to fit into pension enhancement program this time  so I decided to eave AT&T for new positions."

good,Everyday is a great opportunity to be the voice of AT&T to represent the company with excellent and show we care. We keep our promised to provide excellent customer service and to make sound judgements in regards to the needs of the business.  My co-workers are fun to work with and we have been on same teams over our years of employment.  The hardest part of my job is when I loose a customer due to pricing and not quality of service.  The most enjoyable part is when I get a customer who wants to divorce our company and I am able to win him/her over and they become a happy customer once again.
good,"The company since AT&T bought BellSouth has changed their focus from Customer Service to sales and revenue."
good,to assist customers with any problem or technical difficulties they were having

good,"I'm not sure of the purpose of Indeed forcing a person looking for a job to post reviews for previous employers in order to receive access for new employers to find them. It's very uncomfortable and again, I hope I've met the character requirements to proceed."
good,"Busy call center environment. Gained valuable experience in customer service and multi-tasking. Well managed office, kind, friendly and helpful co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when the systems crashed and our resources were unavailable."

good,"Moved from New Haven to an office site in Meriden. Not very well equipped and not close to any places for lunch. Trying to do workspace 20/20 so a lot of people don't have a permanent desk - it makes for a disjointed group of people, frankly."
good,"AT&T allowed me to obtain great job experience.  The management team was knowledgeable and helpful.  I leaned task management, audit skills, payroll, sale coaching, excell program knowledge, self motivation and more. The offered great benefits, incentives and opportunities for growth."

good,The ATT warehouse was a wonderful place to work. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the job was easy. I was a Quality Assurance Rep. I had to check the trucks in that carried the work loads oh phones and accessories to make sure they were exactly what was ordered and there was no damage.
good,"Worked for the company for a short time, but it was a great experience."
good,"A typical day at work would be to log in and ask the Team Lead what my assignment was for the day. We use a chat system to communicate with technicians and usually I am doing that for most of the day. By dong this I have learned a lot about the security devices and systems that we use daily. My co-workers are nice and we work together. The hardest part of the Job is not being able to see my family at home due to my ever changing schedule where I work nights and weekends. I am a part of the Recognition team which consist of two other people.

Overall, I don't think this is representative of the whole company, but like most places there will be problems."

good,"The job was rewarding for me as I was able to help 99% of our customers. The small 1% I was not able to help, with my boss approval,  I was able to get off the phone and research the problem and get back with the customer with an explanation and or a resolution. My job at AT&T was one of the easiest jobs I have ever had.  Talking is my forte. Answering  50 t0 80 calls a day was most enjoyable!"

good,"AT&T is a good company to have a career if you are career driven.  You have to be willing to live in two places Dallas or Atlanta if you live in any other location you are limited in terms of advancement.   If you are a worker bee you can still survive.  The biggest issue I have is that if you did not drive or did not have a car AT&T does not have locations on the east coast that are near any public transportation with the exception of NYC and there is no way to get to work but car and that puts many employees at a disadvantage.   "
good,"Held many different positions.  Great pay.  Good benefits.  Left in 1999...lots of changes in the communication industry...don't think the new AT&T is the same as the ""old"" AT&T."
good,If you are young and ambitious then Sales for AT&T is the job for you. There is plenty of traffic you get to learn about technology. Management is hit or miss some are very easy to work and others not so much.

I felt like I learned a lot from him and gained a mentor.  I enjoy working with smaller companies because my opinions and ideas can be acknowledged versus following a set company policy, but anyway it works to make the company successful I am will to follow."

good,"Pay was great, but the company held technicians to a strict metric that didn't fit the randomness of each job."
good,"I really enjoyed working here. All my co-workers were very friendly and management was extremely helpful; they do everything they can to assist your success. The hardest part about this job is the constant calls, mostly negative."

good,"MGA Communications provides an individualized experience, with a focus on it's clients and employees.  The management promotes a healthy marraige of professionalism and fun.  Because the firm is smaller, I think the experience is more personal and fitting for a lot of fresh out of college professionals."
good,"The people and work are great, but coming from a start-up background I found it frustrating that it takse so long to get something done. I suppose it's par for the course with a large corporation."
good,"Attendance really strict."
good,"I really have no qualms with the company in general except to say that the work/life balance is horrid. If I'm a full time student doing 20/hrs a week at DIRECTV they still require overtime during some of the most stressful months. Primarily december when finals are taking place. In addition their penalty for calling in (even if you have the pto hours) is ridiculous."
good,"Great company, lots of added incentives. Management was like family. I did there advertising and marketing. Created ads, went to trade shows generated leads through networking organizations."
good,"Not a lot of positive reinforcement upon good conduct.  More often than not it was a ""focus on the negative"" environment.   Though, vast opportunities to advance.  Job training was outstanding and ongoing.  My favorite was the daily customer interaction and trying to balance SALES with CUSTOMER SERVICE, two things that typically don't go hand in hand.  It was a fun challenge.  The hardest part was that I didn't believe in all of the products that AT&T offered yet I was held accountable for them."
good,A typical day at work i answer phones and help cust. with there accounts by adding and removing features on there account selling plans and excepting payments I am also technical support fixing peoples smart phones
good,"A typical day is to have a telephone customer out of service and have to go through the process of troubleshooting the problem.  You learn to always start at the source of dial tone and work your way to the customer you find and resolve the problem.  Sometimes require you working with a partner in trying to resolve the problem.  The hardest part of a job would probably be having to climb a pole is the issue appears to be aerial, and the most rewarding part of the job is to find and fix the problem and restore phone service back to a customer."
good,Working for AT&T was very stressful because of the Management.  The co-workers and immediate managers made the enviroment the best they could.
good,"Of the multiple  call centers in Boise DTV isn't as bad as some pay is average  commission in Retention was better before they change it againl, As with most call centers it all depends who your team leader. I ended up leaving do to her ""Mangement  style"" if you can call it that"

good,"employed by the Fiber team. When you take the job you are sold a bill of goods. The pluses are you are paid very well for the position,great benefits and discounts on services. The negatives outweigh the positives however. it is essentially a door to door sales position selling to business. there is little room for development on the fiber team and there is high turnover. This isn't sour grapes as I am still employed but am seeking other opportunities as is everyone on my team"

good,I originated mortgage loans. I processed those loans from the first phone call and shipped it to underwriting and informed title when it was cleared to close; set up the closing with the borrower.
good,"The only flaw of AT&T was the management and the culture of the job. This Job provided my with a comfortable life style for me and my family. It started out as a family orientated job, but drasticly changed in a matter of time. As the company grew, they separated the wireline side, and the uverse side, which caused a division within the company. employees and management. Instead of working together, we were fighting eachother."
good,"A typical day at Directv was very productive. From the minute you clock in you're on the phones and ready to take calls.

I have over the years had a number of great managers that were more like family then bosses. The people I have met over the years and in the various departments are ones that even though I may not have seen in years I still keep in contact with. The hardest part of the jobs I had would have to be the beginning, learning something new and knowing there were metrics to be met. The most enjoyable part of at&t was the wonderful friendships I made and making it through trainings knowing time and time again I could do my job and I did it well."

I started in sales and moved up to retention within 2 months of being employed. The retention department is by far the best position available as an agent. I am given tools to complete all of my tasks to handle our customers concerns. From billing/sales/upgrades/service calls, we can handle it all. The hardest part of my job is when a customer is not eligible for any promotions or discount offers and I know they truly could benefit from these great things. I enjoy getting to talk to people from all over the United States and connecting with them. I love that we can actually be conversational and not scripted into our calls. It really shows our customers that we do care about their needs and that we are there to help them in each and every way that we can.

Management worked with you to obtain your sales goals and to better you at the overall job itself.  Co-workers were like family because you are with them most of the day. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the proper sales quota of 100% each month. The sales goals were sometimes unrealistic.

good,"I was responsible for developing and creating a cost model for the new software that had to be developed for AT&T's data communication offferings. The local operating companies provided the software infrastructure for the process from when a customer called up AT&T (Long Lines previously) and asked from a data communication service all the way through Accounting, Engineering, Operations, and Billing. The cost model I was developing required me to find and identify key personnel in each of the departments and document their component in the process, and develop a model that could be used to cost out each of the components and that would eventually be used to cost out the data communication offering. "

good,"I started with AT&T in 2003 and found it much easier to move up and explore options in the olden days. I'm a hard worker, and a smart one. I love efficiency. However, AT&T has a habit of assigning PMs menial tasks that should be automated through a slew of systems that never seem to work right and forcing weird hours and metrics on employees that they have not agreed are feasible. It may be seamless to the external customer but not to internal customers. I love the service escalation program and the fact that there is a referral program, but I hate how pushy they get with using it. I ditched sales for a reason. Luckily, they paid for my undergrad degree, as well as my Six Sigma Certification, and my upcoming PMP certification exam on 10/26/13. I really don't like that they refuse to assist with relocation for anyone who is not becoming a level 3 manager, no matter what they have invested to develop that person professionally. My husband is disabled, and needs to be in more consistently good climate and it took me 2 years and 822 applications to get an internal job in San Ramon, Ca. Also, the HR is pretty terrible. No problem solvers in that department and it took a year and a half to get a title change to a job I had been doing already. For the devotion I've given the company, I've had a little bit returned, but not much. Process and system roll-out support is pretty useless as well. It's a great place to network, and get your foot in the door, and the casual atmosphere is great since I hate wearing dress clothes to the trenches."
good,"As a customer service rep, I provided excellent service by answering inbound calls from AT&T.  I encouraged clients to update their current features, products and services as well as attended and researched issues and resolutions.  Assisted the customers in the activation of their wireless service, identified customer statement problems and resolved contract cancellations."

good,"It is a very fast paced & competitive sales position. Customers come in to upgrade/add a line their current devices to get the newest latest and greatest technology. It is up to you to take advantage of every one of those opportunities to build greater value for the customer with AT&T features, products and services. I've learned how to maneuver around the typical sales answer ""No"" and coming up with new ways for my customers to say ""Yes"" by building greater value around the products and build better relationships with my customers. Management gets shifted around quite often. It allows you to see the different styles of management and they show you different approaches to selling. My co-workers are my TEAM. we work as a family always looking out for each other but also by being competitive in a very fun environment. Hardest part of my job is the fact that AT&T stores get robbed often and this can be quite unsettling. The most enjoyable part of my job is my customers and seeing them light up when I am able to get them a much better value for what they're paying and placing their new device in their hands."
good,"Everyday was something different, yet the same. Even if I had a slow day on the phones, still went pretty quick. I learned that people Love their television. Management were very helpful showing you how to get off the phone quick and efficient. Miss my co-workers, I still keep in touch with a number of them today. The hardest part of this job was leaving.

good,"Work for AT&T Mobility has really opened my eyes to the world of customer service.  While, technology is ever changing, customers have varying levels of comprehension and understanding of that world.  Having to take time to walk a senior member of society through the process of setting up a login for their phone to have the right spec answers for the most tech savvy customers out there is all part of the daily routine.  The only problem I have found with the company is the scheduling and the stress level of goals."

Not only was I able to see that the customers needs were met, whether it be something wrong with their phone or they needed a new one, I was also able to form a one on one relationship with the customer. In this case, a higher referral rate arises. Always good for business. The best part of the job was doing just that, developing the employee-customer bond. Seeing someone smiling as they walk out the door, sometimes a quite different emotion as opposed to when they first came in, is a great feeling to know that you were able to do what you could to satisfy that customer. I also enjoyed troubleshooting the devices. Picking apart any technology has always been very interesting to me."

I sold GSM to TDMA customers when GSM was only available or working on I49 and I10.

The most difficult part of the job was trying to calm a customer after they were told one thing by a sales rep but what they were told was not their reality.

Back in the 70's before high tech computers made your job easier you really worked hard for the money and pay was great. Every skill I know I learned while working for AT&T through their training programs. Changes over a 30+ years career were good & bad but all were challenges I embraced. I felt part of a great company doing great things in telecommunications. I had great 1st, 2nd & 3rd level managers. I made & still have lifelong friends that were my co-workers & managers from AT&T. The call center & phone store jobs as a service rep were busy & fast paced and sales quotas were sometimes unreal but at times the rewards were also unreal. I enjoyed meeting the then CEO and lots of other employees throughout the AT&T footprint of states. I learned advancement was determined by my efforts.

good,"A typical workday would include approximatly 40-60 calls per day with management available if necessary. There were about 200 employees at this call center, the hardest part I think was the fast pace and ever-changing process but the customer service employees were treated fairly and with good compensation.

good,"A typical work day at AT&T was answering rapidly incoming customer service calls, resolving issues and selling AT&T's products. I loved working closely with a team and having someone that is always willing to help me. I learned how to be patient with angry customers, become personable with customers and to get things finished in a timely manner. The hardest part about working for AT&T is the fact that even though its not listed as a sales position in any kind of job description, it is strictly a sales environment and position. I worked at AT&T for 9 months and the sales part was okay at first, it was something that management understood needed some time to get used to but I did not feel like I could come to work everyday and feel like I know I had a job.

good,"Experience in Installing, Configuring and Administering Web Servers like IBM HTTP Server (IHS), Apache, IPlanet and Microsoft IIS."
good,"The team I worked with was fantastic! Management was fair and gave me the flexibility to work at home when needed. It was a contract position, so I would love to return if another contract presents itself. The downside was they didn't hire full time employees and we weren't offered benefits."
good,"Had its ups and downs, boss was wonderful but wasnt very busy so not alot to do."
good,Pros:
good,Setting appointments with existing customers and new customers. Prepping and planning for appointments. Most enjoyable part of the job is creating a good advertising plan with customers and watching them grow their business.

good,very diversified.

Conducts follow up to determine applicability of course material."
good,AT&T is an excellent source for training and furthering an education.
good,"A typical day at work is never typical. Just as technology is constantly changing so are the needs of the customer base. Some customers simply want to purchase a wireless device whether it be a cell phone, tablet or connection card, but other customers come in with service issues, business needs, tech support help, the list goes on. You never know what to expect from day to day but it certainly keeps you on your toes and keeps you moving."

good,"Fast paced and ever-changing! Cutting edge technology. High tech phones, tv, high speed internet and home phone service."
good,"A typical day of work at AT&T would be handling between 80 and 100 inbound calls troubleshooting laptops and mobile devices. I learned a lot about telecommunications and networking, software configuration and installation. Management was hands on but not overly so, they would take time to have coaching sessions to help improve your customer service and troubleshooting techniques. The co-workers I encountered were some of the easiest people to work with and learn from. The hardest part of the job was the constant grind of being on the phone troubleshooting and the most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of getting the customer's problem corrected."
good,"Typical day at work was answering many calls, relaying messages, and running quick errands. Co-workers were outstanding and made coming to work each day very fun."

good,"En call: el horario era de 9 a 15 hs. iniciaba mi trabajo sentada a un telefono con una base de datos que me proporcionaba la Empresa. El clima laboral era excelente. Despues de 6 meses me pasaron a venta de salón. Allí el horario era de 9 a 14.30. Al llegar lo primero era encender el LCD, se higienizaba el lugar, en la puerta del local entregaba folletería y trataba de entablar un dialogo. Atender al cliente cuando entra al local es la mejor parte del trabajo, a mi criterio. Recibía capacitación cada vez que había alguna modificación en las promos. La parte mas difícil o incómoda era cuando los clientes adquirían el servicio y sus tarjetas estaban sin fondo, por ejemplo. La parte mas fácil era, para mi, la comunicación y la facilidad para vender el producto, pues me encanta la venta.- De directivos y Gerencia me reservo la opinión.!"
good,Took orders from customers for work to be down on cable lines. Assigned workers to jobs.

I also provide corrective actions and process terminations of employement as needed."
good,Work experience was great and definitely a place that I learned and grew professionally!
good,"I learned alot with AT&T, specially time management and over come my barriers of speaking in public."
good,"AT&T was an outstanding company to work for, with superior technology, and the customer service to back it up!"
good,"Did at least 2 tv, internet and phone installs and 3 repairs a day, rain or shine. I learned a lot about running cable in homes and learned a lot about my customers and their families. Management could've been been better as far as having our backs when it came to our jobs and our customers but all in all it wasn't horrible. My co-workers were awesome. We were like brothers and always had each others backs. The hardest part of my job was just making sure that the customer was very satisfied with my work at the end of the job. Most enjoyable part was when I did get that very satisfied from my customers and the smile on their face as I left their home."
good,"DIRECTV has many different groups within IT, and thus, provide someone a broad view of how the company operates."

good,"The co-workers make the job here, it's corporate but they make it worth the work we all did."
good,"My day to day consist of taking escalation calls from customers with issues with service payments etc. Also, I would assist reps in the field on how to go about their installation at the premise. Would deal with fall outs in the orders as well as fix any devices that wouldn't functionable."
good,Its a busy call center and you will take calls back to back on a daily basis. Training last for a couple of weeks.
good,This company was at it's best before the AT&T acquistion.

good,Lots of Opportunity to learn and grow. Met lots of great people .
good,"Overall a good way to make a living, unfortunately like the rest of corporate America the benefits keep getting more expensive and cover less, the quotas increase but the commission decreases over time. Some great managers, usually area managers are really cool, but they seem to promote the yes men with a power trip, not really good for motivation, natural leadership, or business in general. A lot of small man syndrome managers."
good,Good company to work for. Great pay and benefits. Not for people who like weekends and holdays off. Job can be stressful at times.
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs. The supervisors qnd floor managers were very motivatng, and also were always willing to help others throughout any workday. What I liked most about the job was it wa fast paced and interesting. Talking to people across the country was interesting and I learned more about demand of certain products in different locations. Co-workers had healthy competition, and most times management had rewards for these competitions which made work a lot more fun and interesting. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I satisfied customers to thepoint that some either recomended others to me or put in a good word to top management on how well i handled things."

good,"The store I worked at is currently gone but AT&T is great to work for with awesome phones and technology to work with. The deals were not so great but the sell points were accessories. Co-workers were fun to work with, everyone is very nice. The hardest part of the job was dealing with uncontrollable customers. The satisfaction from selling was very enjoyable."

good,The pay is not bad. Job security is an issue. The hardest part of the job is taking calls from customers that are irate.
good,"I had a great career working with AT&T. I moved to several different departments and ended up in management. Once I went to U-Verse manangement, I was stuck. NO ONE wanted to be a U-Verse manager so upper management would not release you to different departments. After trying to a couple of years of trying to leave U-Verse for any other department, I resigned. All in all, a great company and I learned a lot of valuable things."
good,I enjoy the fast paced environment and the ability to learn about all the new technology as well as the training on new products and services.

I learned how to fix different connectivity issues and how to configure webmail and email clients. The co-workers at AT&T vary depending on the length of time they have worked there. Personalities can change depending on that as well. Some are happy, others not so much. All in all, they are great people to be around. The hardest part of working at AT&T would have to be the business customers. They are harder to deal with because of the simple fact that they use AT&T internet service to run their business, so when they need their internet, they need it fixed right away. The most enjoyable part of working at AT&T has to be the team members. They make the workplace better because of their go get em' attitude."

Made me comfortable with walking into any technical situation, being able to size things up quickly, assess staff, supplement what needs help and get things moving in the right direction. Some great background."
good,"The company is a homebased call-center company that provides contract work. But they will terminate your contract at any given time. I will not recommend this company. When there is an issue you have to submit a ticket. It's not a live person to speak with regarding, pay, schedule issues and even when the system goes down. The larger the company grows less support for agents."
good,"My normal day at work is get into the office, start my PC, read my office mail and sharepoint for any new updates from my previous days work. The go ahead and start working on escalated tickets on a remedy tool. I also spend a few hours training new hires on the work processes and assist them in resolving issues. AT&T is a very dynamic place and work procedures change daily so one has to be on toes with the changes. Generally the management is very friendly and committed to achieve the set targets. I enjoyed whenever I resolved a difficult challenge and verify with my seniors to set it has a daily routine whenever the same issue occurs"
good,"typical day would be starting at 7am, depending on day and month,some days would start with back to back calls, which I preferred because it would make the day go by faster. I enjoyed MY manager, and co-workers. It was a pretty laid back atmosphere and as long as you were doing your job, no body bothered you.

good,Overall I did utilize problem solvingg skill in a way that enabled me to enhance my decision making ability.
good,I enjoyed this position - unfortunately our department was eliminated.
good,Although you knew what to expect; everyday was still different. I learned how to handle customer complaints without a managers assitance. If you needed helopo eith your manager or one of team mates was there to help. There wasn't a hard part working for att. I enjoyed the customers. I learned alot from them.

good,I liked working there as a Web Developer.
good,"At&t was a good job but the management was unprofessional, starting with the managers, who get paid to do nothing especially when the area manager is not there. They also have relationships with people at work thy should not which cause people to get better treatment by these people."
good,"Handle customer inquiries, complaints, billing questions and payment extension/service requests. Calm angry callers and customers, repair trust, locate resources for problem resolution and design best-option solutions. Interface daily with managers in operations and cash management."

good,"challeging fun daily, games to get your sells/numbers.rewared when exeeding the daily requirments.."
good,"Great place to start your career. I started as a Technical Support Rep and worked my way to Team Leader. Worked at many different position.. i.e. Coach, Supervisior Escalation Rep. If you work hard you will get rewarded, Company promotes employees within for advance position."
good,"Great company to work for, benefits wonderful and decent pay."
good,"Upper management is always looking to show a profit, so your job is always being evaluated as one that could be shipped overseas to cut costs. You should never feel safe with your position."
good,"The hours of operation doesn’t support people who are in school, have children and families. Flexibility is what’s needed in this day and time. With flexible schedules employees would remain with the company"
good,The job security is very bad at AT&T and DirecTV. I have over 4 years with the company before I and many other were laid-off. The paid is good with good benefit.
good,"Overall"
good,"I enjoyed the training process. They made sure that we understood what the job consisted of and that we were there for the customer. And while I am for the customers, it took some real passing attention to understand the technology."
good,"AT&T provides good opportunities to grow. However, shareholder supremacy consumes the executives. Therefore, employee satisfaction means very little to them."
good,"AT&T provided a great compensation package and tons of on the job training. Greatful to have worked there. As a manager, felt my opinion was respected and didn't feel I was being scrutinized."
good,Company fast pace and constantly evolving.  You will need to be flexible and and can handle change to succeed with a company like AT&T.  Good luck with this opportunity
good,Awesome place to work and grow. Would recommend all yo gain experience within communication field to heighten inter personal skills and become tech savy.
good,The pay was good. I had just graduated from college. Management is what made me leave. I didn’t like lying to customers. I don’t think I was a true salesman.
good,"The environment for all employees, technical & non-technical, is getting very challenging. Even advanced tech skills - coding, ML, AI, cannot spare you from the looming threat of surpluses and layoffs. AT&T Management is having a difficult time executing on their streaming strategy and legacy products are languishing. It is a good place to get experience, but don't get comfortable."
good,Available upon request. I worked for Directv under Mastec. Att acquired Directv after I left the company. I did work for Directv when I lived in Louisville Kentucky.
good,AT&T is a good place to work as long as you don’t mind not knowing when you’ll be home everyday. Pay and benefits are good along with vacation time. Management at the garage level was decent and was always willing to help point you in the direction you need and co workers were some of the best people I’ve ever worked with. Overall best place I’ve work for.
good,"I was hired to ""fix"" a portal issue.  When I found that the end users preferred a different method that was cheaper and faster to marked, upper management had no issue or ego about it."
good,"Enjoyed the various jobs I had during my career.  The workplace was a fun place to work.  The people were awesome.  Many team members did not always co-exist in the same location, but you always felt part of the team."
good,"As a premise technician I worked very independently."
good,I actually enjoyed working here. I moved into management after a year of being a sales associate. Corporate was sometimes unreasonable in their requests but in the end doable. In all honesty I did waaaaay more for the company than I was compensated. Great benefits and training.
good,At&t is good work environment.  It can be challenging but very rewarding as well.  You can make a career working for at&t and move up if you are motivated and work hard.
good,This particular job is not one that I would recommend growing in. We did tech support for installation technicians. The call center was small and had very little growth opportunities. If you are looking for something to help pay bills while going to school I would recommend working here.
good,"enjoy working at ATT always a learning process- I just felt that my job could end anyday."
good,Used to be a great place to work not so much any more managers only care about them selves don’t want to allow thinking on the job can’t do a good job if not allowed to think for yourself
good,If you like to work under pressure with a good pay AT&T is a great fit for you. Keep in mind it is retail and you will work holidays and most if not all weekends.
good,"As a wire technician my main job was to insure connectivity of At&t's internet and TV connection in single family households, apartments, and businesses. If you are afraid of heights you will be climbing poles and sides of houses. If you are afraid of enclosed spaces you will be climbing through attics, basements, and crawl spaces. If you are afraid of animals and insects this is not the job for you."
good,"Experiencia en ventas"
good,"Company has many perks,  but for management and call taking reps it is a very stressful environment. Most goals are not attainable. Upper management is very good to work with."
good,"In my time at at&t/ DirecTV started out very laid back the technicians at the time were motivated and seemed to enjoy what they did,  slowly as At&t took over, motivations slowed, enthusiasms stopped the enjoyment was gone. It's sad when a company can ruin a job that the employees enjoy."
good,"The union is great, the company is ok. the balance between work and life is a bit difficult. the work schedule is based on tenure so being a new person you would probably get one of the schedules that is not the greatest but overall I was still in school and my manager still worked with my school schedule"
good,AT&T offers a chance to build yourself and others while running a fast pases business. Multiple skills are learned and transferred to your employees. The job is demanding yet rewarding if successful
good,"I enjoyed the customers and the unique challenges they provided. As a team we worked hard to meet our individual and team goals, though I wish the leadership would have been a little more encouraging and coaching to help those their supervising grow into better employees. Overall though the culture was great, the pay and benefits were competitive, and most days were more fun then stress."
good,"Great opportunity right out of college. The invest in you for the long term, ,regardless if they keep you.  Broad operations for lots of opportunity (domestic and international), horizontal opportunity as well as vertical opportunity."
good,AT&T is always going to be a great company. They have been around so long. It’s a tenure company so get in there and perform . It’s a performance base company with great opportunities.
good,"I was with AT&T for 21 years and loved every job I have ever had! Unfortunately, due to downsizing, I was surplussed. I’m very grateful for my time there but I can’t wait to share my skills and positive attitude with another company!"
good,Great place to work with great benefits.  Moving up in management is a bit difficult due to minimal movement in the company.  Unbalanced benefit packages for AT&T Corps positions and AT&T contractors with same experience and qualifications.  Minimal positions for cleared personnel and no incentives for having a clearance regardless of level.  But still overall a great place to work.
good,Good job. Well payed for entry positions. A lot of room to grow with company. Great benefits and friendly work environment. Management could be better but overall good job.
good,"Requires a lot of attention to detail.  Must deal with customers on a daily basis, be a high producer, be able to meet goals and work independently not a lot of hand holding.  You will earn every dollar you make."
good,AT&T has moved to very different direction than traditional competitors and I believe it will work for company in long term.  In such journey company and management should look after employees who are making things happen for the company.  With limited mobility employees with great potential does not grow and look for something else to help their career.
good,Tu salario depende de tus ventas solo conviene si eres bueno vendiendo
good,Store located inside the mallow would at times have a lot of window shoppers that have no intention of purchasing.There were some dry seasons for sales.
good,"Apply elsewhere outside of Orlando. The Managers/ Leadership in the Orlando, FL area are horrible. They lie, do fraud, allow reps to do fraud, and push for numbers whether it's honest or fraudulent. They only want to be number one by any means necessary. Retaliation in the work place is real, and they will do it by way of observations being put into your file. Stay on top of your game with the union because the union is your protection and will protect you."
good,"Att has been one of the better companies that I have worked for in the past 14 years."
good,The most enjoyable was being in front my clients. A typical day was in front of my clients and Account Management.  I love continuously learning technology.
good,Was A Great Company Until They Shut The Building Down. Tge Work Expierience Was Cool Very Nice Culture Very Inviting Abd Motivating. A Love The Team Play.
good,they keep cutting down while asking for more from all employees. managers get worked hard. rewarding because you learn a lot but you need more recourses
good,"This particular gave me the opportunity to show high levels of customer service and communication skills. Also, I had the ability to advertise DirecTV television program bundles. I was able to help organize store strategies in order to increase the market sales of DirecTV products. Therefore, I truly admired my skills of educating customers on new and improved DirecTV products."
good,I had a good team and a great boss despite the culture changes due to ATT taking over Directv. Enjoyed the challenge and got an opportunity to learn more about SAP.
good,"Great Comp package, bonus, pension, benefits"
good,Management in the north east GA area was hired straight out of business school. Management would frequently come out on site to make us perform duties according to the literature. Equipment is old and does not work if done by the book. Typically made jobs take 3 to 4 times longer than necessary. Job performance is based on completion of work in a timely manner.
good,Overall the position I hold there is a good position. You get to meet a lot of nice people being in customer service and learning what peoples needs are for different types of products that are offered.
good,This was a good place to work  good hours  good coworkers union has your back pay is really good for the type of work you are doing would recommend to friends
good,"AT&T was a good company to work for overall. The benefits were good, and the pay was fair. I really loved my free company phone and company vehicle. I was lucky enough to learn from some amazing leaders and innovators in the technology and customer service industry. While I worked there I felt happy and appreciated for the most part. However, some employees feel under-appreciated and fearful for their jobs if they do not attain their sales goals."
good,AT&T  has several programs including Tuition reimbursement and Harvard and Georgia Tech learning programs that are available to its employees with diverse learning platforms.  The company also has a very active and accessible Office of Diversity which provides support and programs to all of its employees (craft and management).
good,"What can I really say about AT&T, it's a corporate retail sales jobs with the emphasis on sales, new sales, soft sale, push sale, double up sale, the more the better, how ever you can"
good,"Great place to work. The culture is great, the pay is okay, and the benefits are none for a contractor. The company really has a bright future due to recent mergers."
good,AT&T is great but due to the nature of the industry they are in things are constantly changing. It keeps you on your toes and you will not get bored because their focus changes every month.
good,AT&T is a great place to work and start your career. The environment is fast paced and dynamic. There are performance incentives to promote a competitive and interdependent working atmosphere.
good,"Not a ton of complaints, Realistically make around $2,000 a month but insurance is pretty expensive. A lot of opportunities to advance if you work towards it, just make sure you'r at a store with high volume if you want to earn a bigger pay check."
good,"Some days can be non-stop with customers."
good,"I did not mind working there, would consider doing it again in some capacity or another. The culture is very profit driven to the detriment of morale in many cases, but overall a fine enough place to work."
good,"They were a horrible authorized retailer to work for, aside from that I grew so much as a working citizen and a person. Alongside that I met people I will carry with me further in life, outside of work."
good,Working with the agents to make sure the orders they placed are completed as they are base on hourly and commission. Work hard make $$ if your lazy.. your will not make money.
good,"although it was not what I expected from the recruitment process right out of college, I met some great people that will be life long friends. The culture was upbeat and fun with excellent compensation. Be sure to be ready for a call center environment with quota expectations that weigh your advancement through the training process."
good,"Working remotely for more than 10 years had its benefits as well as its drawbacks.  As a manager with a team of specialists split among on-shore and off-shore, as well as across multiple time zones my availability was basically 24x7.  Work-to-home ratio was extremely out of balance but there was a feeling of achievement that accompanied that unbalance that seemed to lessen the impact.  The day to day challenges provided the fire to move forward and persevere."
good,It wasn’t the best job I could ever have. I just wanted to let y’all know that immediately after you start they want you to be on you own.  So it can be difficult at Times
good,"It was as good as it can get in Retail. "
good,"ok place to work just have to follow directions, communcation is the biggest problem 2nd and 3rd level management have no idea what you really do nor do they care just the following of whatever directive they have set out only matters"
good,More than anything I fell in love with all the people I worked with in the call center. From the director to all the employees. Wonderful work environment everyday.
good,"I have worked for AT&T for 22 years.  It has been a fruitful and rewarding career.  Technology is moving fast, so employees must be able to grow and adapt their knowledge and skills."
good,"The company has some issues with their commisson plans, however the managememt is excellent to work with. The staff are very accomidating and are always willing to help anyone."
good,"AT&T prefers to hire temps on a two-year contract - due to union considerations.  Since I was supporting legacy network systems, I didn't expect to be hired permanently when the time was up - and I wasn't."
good,"It was fun and exciting at first, then you see the company operates and how hard it makes life on everyone. The more people try to do right, even more are trying to do wrong.  Staying Tone Deaf to this even when handed concrete proof. . It is a downward spiral with people from the old bell days who are bent on running the company in the ground. Don't waste your time. The culture is horrible now"
good,It's been bought out since I worked there but it was a great place to work at especially for someone with no sales experience. They really developed those skills with excellent training.
good,"I was usually eager to start the day because I could push myself to sell more which therefore would pay me more. I learned a lot about the whole cellular business while working there and how many hoops and struggles you may have to jump through. For me, the work environment was fun because I quickly bonded with my coworkers. My manager was great, however the people above her were not that great. I's say the hardest part of the job was dealing with people's technical problems. Although I'm decently smart when it comes to technology, I'm still not an IT guy. People would constantly rely on us for problems that we could not solve. I'd say the most enjoyable part of the job was partly the environment and some of the relationships I made."
good,"It may have just been the team I was in, but my manager was not very respectful of personal space. I definitely believe in competition pushing for us to do better, but our team meetings often included throwing ill-meaning insults and cursing the other teams, rather than how to learn from other teams' positive attributes to the company. It was a toxic community, and ultimately led me to leave the company. I wanted to find a different team to work with, but there unfortunately wasn't any openings in jobs I would be qualified for."
good,It was a great place to work it was seasonal though.Also it was fast pace I learned how to read barcodes on the phones that I did quality control on. And it was challenging at times but overall it was a great place to be employed at. Cool  Environmental workplace nice curtious people if you needed help with something they were prompt.
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for, it has good benefits. Work, Life, Balance is not good, management jobs they expect many more hours a day than what should be allowed, too many targets to achieve, but to maintain your position you need to manage to get them all in each month."
good,"The company is a great place of employment, I just had the bad timing of when to start. Almost everyone that started when I did no longer works with the company, not due to att but the manager we had was miss treating all that weren't apart of his antics that we later (after it was to late) found was stealing from employee's and att itself.  Paying extra to female employee's that did ""extra"" work for him."
good,Working here is amazing!  People tend to stay here 10+ years so if you are new seniority kick in where you’re not able to alter your schedule you only get the scraps. They are not flexible with you due seniority.
good,Great pay and benefits. I met great people and grew up with them and we are still friends to this day. The company has great benefits and I have recommended AT&T  to several other people.
good,"I really enjoyed working for AT&T.  I developed quickly, and was able to move up consistently.  My biggest issue with them, was when a new boss came in and I no longer had advocation.  For 7 of the 8 years I worked there, I received ""exceeds expectations,"" on my performance reviews.  I was consistently taking on additional projects and tasks for leadership, and was considered a high potential individual.  The new boss came in, and all of that went away.  I was treated terribly by him.  It was obvious he was making my job more difficult in order to get me to leave.  I even tried transferring into a lateral position, and this individual wouldn't allow that.  AT&T does an excellent job of keeping employees inspired and engaged.  There are several opportunities to travel, and move around if you want"
good,"Decent pay, long hours, but overall a good place to work at. Can be stressful sometimes. Working outside most of the time in hot attics and dealing with customers every day."
good,Work life balance was almost nonexistent as a Retail Store Manager. The expectations to constantly grow year over year numbers without taking into thought the patterns of retail traffic can be frustrating. Pay and benefits is great. I loved my staff and the people I got to train and develop. I had a handful of amazing direct supervisors and a few that I would never work for again. Overall I have enjoyed my time with AT&T.
good,"It was a fun environment to go to work to , yes the manager toward the end of my working days there was very rude, and if it was super slow & no customers they would want us to still meet quota for that day, Yet one customer would walk in out of the full 8 hours of being open. Hopefully management gets better because from the new store manager to the ones above him that are new are not the greatest."
good,Great pay great benefits some of the stuff they do an add to work load sucks and has no point but atleast your paid for everything even going to the interview and training was paid
good,This is a high pressure work environment that is numbers driven. The company is in transformation mode and downsizing it's personnel. Pretty much zero tolerance on any compliance measure.
good,Good group of people. No formal training just a lot of OTJ training. Work was challenging yet rewarding. Had a chance to learn new skills and complete new activities.
good,"El trabajo es estresante, ser parte del departamento de servicio a cliente y retención es difícil, pues debes identificar y solucionar las inquietudes o problemas del cliente en un tiempo no mayor a 15 minutos, todo esto mientras se mantienen los mas altos estándares de calidad y servicio, lo complicado es que si el cliente esta enojado o muy frustrado es difícil lograr que te escuche, por otra parte recibirás constante retroalimentacion para mejorar, siempre hacen énfasis primero en lo que haces bien y te guían para mejorar en las áreas que sean necesarias, la empresa tiene buenas prestaciones ademas de constantes estímulos económicos o similares"
good,This was your very typical call center job. The staff try there best to make it a fun place but the management is not on board with a lot of it so that really sucks but all in all it was a job that wasn't terrible and paid the bills.
good,I was just an intern at ATT-government solutions for a period of 6 months for a research project. I enjoyed my experience the people I worked for with and for were we all friendly and helpful but ATT government solutions is not like the rest of the company so I am unsure if the review I would write would be any help to anyone.
good,"ATT taught me a lot and you are rewarded for working hard. I would recommend ATT if you are looking for a stable, great benefited company; however, you will work all around the clock."
good,"compared to other telecom competitors, definitely the best one to work for. Great pay, try to develop its own employees rather than hire within. If you are young and are looking for a first job, highly suggest you join a new hire program. They will help you grow."
good,Las prestaciones y beneficios que nos brindaban como colaboradores eran literal únicas.
good,ATT provides superior training  for communication and entertainment needs. The work environment is helpful and fast paced. There are stringent quotas to meet based on job function. Accuracy and detail are stressed daily. Overall the company does provide excellent benefits and income.
good,One of the highest starting salaries available for an entry level position I’ve ever seen. Everyone is friendly and accepting there. The hours and inconsistency of management were the only real downfalls.
good,"AT&T needs to recognize the work performed by its employees and stop being so compartmentalized.  I have never worked any where that refused to share resources with other groups, specifically, an unused conference rooms."
good,"I loved working there before the manager I had got promoted. After that, we went through about 10 different managers (ARSMs, RSMs, and ASMs). It was a complete nightmare. No one knew what was going on. Scheduling during that time was terrible. There were a few days that there was no one to even open or close the store. I was there for years and still had to work weekends. My coworkers are what made me stay so long. I truly worked with an amazing group of people that I still calls friends. The pay is good especially considering you do not need a degree to sale. There extra incentives were a plus. Training and the systems that we used day to day had some hiccups but aren’t near as bad as what I’ve worked with before. If there’s an issue, you normally can reconcile it. Health benefits & the employee discounts are also better than any other company I’ve worked for before."
good,days are dreadful and no work life balance. Not that much growth in company. Monthly quotas are sometimes hard to hit and pricing changes all the time.
good,"Directors like to take credit for their employees work.  "
good,"My direct report manager is very great and exceptional.  Great company perks including medical, dental, vision, 401K, employee discounts on internet, cell phone, Direct TV services."
good,"Teams of highly talented professionals, committed to delivering excellence to their customers.  The company's biggest challenges stem from a large number of employees and a bureaucratic organizational structure.  Although the company desires to move quickly, it often takes longer to make something happen."
good,"Gets you the basic understanding of phone operations while multi tasking on your job, account management, problem solving. Can get a bit much if you do not know how to effectively communicate"
good,"I love working at AT&T. It has given me all the opportunities to learn as much as I have learned.  Unfortunately, with the new direction that they are going, the Human Resource needs are dwindling.  Where there used to be opportunities to transfer to different departments, today there are very few, if any.  Each quarter, there is a call and more people are gone.  The future employment opportunities are looking bleak."
good,"It was a good place to work, Little disappointed by end of career company approach worked for 24 years was laid off in a force adjustment  11 months before being retirement benefits eligible. Typical day was 10 -12 hours a day with some weekend coverage."
good,Typical day starts with a meeting and ends with a meeting.  This helps keep the teams aligned on daily issues.  It is vital to 24x7 support organization.  Each day has new challenges that require flexibility to adapt and respond quickly.
good,"Heavy focus on numbers"
good,"Mandatory 6 day work weeks, If u jump tech to a state with different laws it can be 7 day.  Made on average $2000 a week, Jump tech in Omaha I made about $4000 a week.  Got a van to drive and a gas card.  Not bad  Inventory pick up once a week."
good,I rather not voice my opinion of AT&T after working there for twenty-six years. AT&T provide me the opportunity to work for a nice company and provide for my family. For that I'm extremely grateful. Thank you AT&T and I wish you the best...
good,I had an amazing time for the most part while with ATT. however the culture took a negative less supportive change which lead me to seek options elsewhere. I would be open to returning if there was a culture change.
good,"a typical day can be very slow most of the time and busy in spurts depending on the day of the week or proximity to major holiday."
good,ok company micro manage fiber splicimg take orders drive truck a lot of micro managing worry about number and not customers very god pay for what you do
good,It was a great company aside from the different cultures you see in each location. It can be more unified rather than having each store live by their own ways.
good,"working hours were 9 to 10 hours per day, and even though the management tried their best to give all the support and help necesary and more working hours made it impossible to spend time with family and have a social life, since work time was from 2 pm to 2 am. Thius caused health issues and worsening of school performance of kids. Therefore I decided to quit."
good,Great place to work but the coworkers you have can make the environment feel a bit like high school. The work life balance was a little off but the pay structure at the time made up for it.
good,"Good benefits, payment, union protected. Typical day consists of answering calls back to back, assisting customers and trying to deescalate situations."
good,"This was a good company to work for, but they sometimes hire from the outside instead of promoting form within. And the work/life balance can be a challenge."
good,"Before being laid off there was a very stressless work environment. There was flexibility in your schedule, but also depended on your manager. One of the best parts, especially when you have a family with young children."
good,"I hired on with AT&T thinking of making a career of it.  It's not the same company it used to be.  I wish to leave, but don't wish to talk badly about AT&T. I am however required to type at least 150 characters in my review."
good,It didnt balance school and work for me well.i had to leave do to not enough sufficient time to do my homework.if not for that I would have stayed.....
good,working for AT&T has been very rewarding professionally. i have worked for numerous leaders and have observed different management styles which in turn has helped me create my own. The possibilities are endless when you work for AT&T because of all the departments under the AT&T umbrella. i highly recommend it as a career.
good,"ok place to work."
good,Most of the management staff worked with you to make sure you understood what was expected of you. There were a few managers that were too nit-picky and unresponsive.
good,"Great place to work. Plenty of opportunities for advancement and to network. Multiple products to profit from, and services to benefit from. Management sucks at some locations. This company has a tendency to promote the wrong individuals due to their selling numbers rather than leadership skills. High sales doesn't equal a great manager; especially when they're unethical."
good,"I was a Principal Architect at AT&T Wi-Fi in Austin of seven and a half years, and largely loved the job.  Questionable decisions have put that business unit in peril, but I still very much think that AT&T is a good place o work."
good,"Promoted telecommuting and provided the tools to work effectively from home. Each day was spent planning, organizing and executing IT projects that were sold to customers."
good,"I was an employee for about 8 years and overall it was a good place to work. The manager that I had was amazing, although I found some of the ranking systems to be a bit high and hard to reach."
good,The pay and the people were great.  However the union isn't what it was when I was first hired and no longer works for the employee.  I would go back if I could in HR
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for, very innovative, and constantly evolving. A leader in the telecommunications/media/entertainment industry. Excellent training, and educational assistance."
good,Company emphasizes productivity when every job has its own challenges for completion.   Customers are often upset with their experiences in reporting trouble to call centers.  It is important to the company that Customer Service Technicians provide the best possible service so that Customer Service Surveys maintain high ratings.  Technicians are given wide latitude on how to provide their best possible service to customers.
good,"When the split of the Ohio Bell and AT&T in 1984, there were several changes to the AT&T side. They started to consolidate departments and eliminate departments, which lead to layoff of many employees with high seniority."
good,"Typical day includes greeting customers, figuring out the best solution(s) to fit their needs and closing the sale. You also have to deal with a lot of customer service issues that may or may not have originated from you or the store you work in. "
good,"Traditional corporate structure who attempts to put employees first but is challenged with stockholder pressures And a competitive landscape that typically impacts the working level more than its executives. "
good,The company is a good company to work for.  Teamwork is something that is done well.  The company focuses on customers and strives to be the best at it.  Teams are creative in coming up with solutions.  There is a great deal of training to keep of the the process and technology changes. I've learned to work in a constantly changing environment.  The most difficult thing has been seeing jobs outsourced.  Many good folks have lost jobs due to outsourcing.  This can happen quite often and can be a challenge to deal with.  I'm very grateful for the opportunities that the company had provided and I look forward to using the skills I've learned in a new position.
good,"mentering other SAs not as experienced,  as well as doing all my own work.   Mostly work form home environment, so all meetings were using software and all communications were with Q-chats or emails."
good,"Company has changed over the years , more technical and automation focused than customer service/experience  focused. Very sales driven on all platforms, so if sales is not your thing this is probably not the company for you."
good,"dinámico, espontáneo  e innovador , buen ambiente  de trabajo"
good,AT&T is going through a transformation and the workforce is changing too. The every changing technology and the up skills of their employees will and have been always changing to try to say up with the changing times.
good,"great people, have to do everything a certain way if you aren't meeting your quota you will be watched very carefully you get talked in the morning as a group and are expected to produce high numbers with low traffic in store."
good,"having a polite tone and demeanor. assisting customers with their daily needs of service, invoice, and products while upselling products. management gives guidance on job performance."
good,"I worked on a lot of cool projects during my short time, but the release processes were a nightmare and took over 4 days, so that was a reason to leave."
good,"Buena empresa para trabajar, personal fresco con ideas nuevas"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with other people with similar interests in technology and driving improvements. "
good,"A typical work day was selling cell phones, writing contracts, fixing phones, helping people with bills, and selling prepaid cards."
good,"I loved the company and was died true blue but it it going through a identity crisis with all it recent acquisitions and with its debt load it has  begun to layoff people.  The environment is undoubtedly a much more demanding one now than it already is.  "
good,Employees in the field had many job environments and situations. Stay on everyones good side and you shouldnt have any issues. They say they work by seniority but that wasnt the case.
good,Prestaciones excelentes sin embargo rh no tienem muy buena coordinación
good,Allowed to work and move to other positions and gain experience.  Enjoyed the people i worked with and managed over the 20+ years at the company.  Provided a good work/life balance.
good,a typical day at work started at 8:00 am loaded truck with supplies for day and dispatched on first job via I-pad complete job and dispatched again averaged 5 jobs per day 1 hr for lunch hardest part of job was not knowing until 4:00 if you were going to have to work overtime most enjoyable part were the guys I worked with
good,"If you are open to corporate America, it is a great place.  If you want to have individual autocratic workplace, this may not be your place.  It was difficult to lack empathy when following company policy and standards in candidate review and hiring processes."
good,"At&t has some good benefits and the pay is decent but higher ups have some unrealistic expectations. I did work for corporate, sometimes you can't help but feel you are expendable."
good,Worked at a contracted call center for them and was fine. Set up for success there but another company took over contract and everything suffered because of it.
good,"AT&T has above average pay for the market, is willing to promote those without degrees to positions of management if you put in the time and effort, decent benefits, learn career skills, good career mobility."
good,"I loved the people we worked with  all were true pros. The travels was great,benefits were good ,the Mission was solid. the issue i had wa the Same  tasks were repeated over and over. I needed something different."
good,"Through AT&T, specifically U-verse, I was able to learn a product, receive a promotion after earning top-selling honors, build a team, and eventually manage a team of managers regionally."
good,"Wasn't too bad if you live close by. If you have to drive 45 minutes each way, it can be a bit much as you have to take an hour lunch on site, which means you're there for 9 hours a day."
good,It was alot to learn in a few weeks need more job training but the training was paid. It was impossible to get my w2. They refused to give it to me...idk why. There management was not very helpful and the job security wasn't there.
good,"Great place to work and learn how to interact with customers, pays decent, works on commission, but they cap your hourly and commission isn't what it use to be."
good,"I was offered a job with AT&T on a gov contract, but I went with one of their contractors, because they offered more pay and almost equal benefits. The people at AT&T were knowledgeable and higher level managers were great. My direct supervisor was awful though. He lacked soft skills and was erratic and moody."
good,There is money opportunities but no work/life balance. Hard to move up in the company depending on your location. It is a very political company on a retail level. Wish there was a better opportunity with schedule choices for employees trying to go to school.
good,"Great pay, scheduling is a common issue. You must meet your sales goals to maximize your commission. Must be willing to continually learn about new technology and be willing to upsell customers. It’s a lot of work but the money is good. The way the company does schedules is the worst and doesn’t work for someone with a family."
good,"AT&T has the best benefits and pay I've experienced. I'm paid almost $40,000 more than my market value for the work that I do. This is what makes it difficult to leave. AT&T is not the company you want if you have a family or need work/life balance."
good,This is a fun place to work and you get to try out the electronics that come out. They are really good to work for and they offer management advancement.
good,It is a hard job to have if you have a family given the hours and you don't have set hours. Sometimes impossible targets to hit and you need to really work well with your management so you can hit them together. How they handle call outs with points and such is too micromanaging and had people in fear for real illnesses/
good,"Most of my work was project based and very interesting."
good,"Great place and environment to work at. Compensation is the only bad part about it. Other than that, the coworkers and manager are great and really work with you if there’s a problem."
good,It was an okay place to work they were strict but not without reason. They had a bunch of opportunities to grow in the company. Great bonuses when the site bonused.
good,"Work both inside and outside performing hardware installations, routine maintenance and interpreting reports. Utilizing troubleshooting skills to identify and resolve complex system hardware/software problems, and execute engineering work orders."
good,"Good company to work for. It has it pros and cons like any other job, but benefits are top notch. Pay is very decent. Expect to work hard, but that is why they paying you, so not much complain."
good,"In my position, it is crucial that you are a self-starter. Many projects that we work on require you to hit the ground running, with minimal supervision. AT&T requires annual and quarterly training to be completed. This ensures that employees are up to date with the latest personal and professional policies."
good,"If you want to motivate your employees and give them something to aim towards, then you need to set specific goals that are realistic and achievable. Vague or unachievable goals will be counterproductive. In addition, make it clear how you as the manager and the organization as a whole can support the employee to achieve their personal development and career goals. It’s one important way to show that you are invested in their success as this is another key driver of employee engagement."
good,The pay is decent but could be better since its stressful and new things are always added to your plate. The medical is 90-10 so that's hard to beat. If you are a team player and able to work with others with one goal like myself you will do fine.
good,"At AT&T you can make a great career and great money.  However you will work in a very process oriented culture, extensive hours with limited support.  AT&T is an awesome company however in transition and the investment decisions are favoring their transformation into the Media business."
good,"AT&T treated their employees fairly and provided many options and career opportunities.  There were also many layoffs over the years often at the expense of losing senior, skilled, dedicated individuals."
good,Typical retail sales environment with lots of role plays and product training. AT&T pay and benefits were great and time off was provided along with a work phone.
good,"Great place to stRt your career if you finishing college "
good,Decent place to work but tough to advance.  Rough work/life balance and a lots of pressure to increase sales and push products on people whether or not they really needed them.  This led to a culture where sales people were consistently dishonest.
good,The position of premise technician is exciting and challenging. Every job is different and provides new challenges around every corner. The work life balance is difficult though. Not knowing what time you will get home every day provides its own challenges with daily life. Pay and benefits are good.
good,Una empresa que brinda excelentes prestaciones aunque para poder obtener buenos resultados si es muy necesario llegar a todas las cuotas
good,"Working at AT&T was a great experience until you realized that the expectations changed nearly daily. The compensation is good, the benefits are great! Compensation did not line up with your daily, weekly, or monthly goals and this was highly confusing and forced you into a situation where what was best for your commission did not line up with the scorecard. The most annoying aspect of the job was when they started “encouraging” us to make cold calls to local businesses multiple times a week and canvas the area for other business leads all while they pay an entire group of individuals that are the Business Team that should be doing this job."
good,I owe my entire career success to AT&T since I started here right out of college. I have had great teammates and managers which I have greatly admired and learned from
good,"Always a busy work day. Learned a lot about OTT and best practices. Management is professional and a diverse work culture. "
good,No complaints...there is a lot of infrastructure and money resources the hardest part is working with peer groups a lot of work is done that is the same across different departments
good,Great company for career longevity. Somewhat behind on Innovation and could use some fresh blood in the middle management talent pool. One of few remaining companies that is loyal to their employees and keep top talents employed for decades.
good,A typical day at work consisted of 4-5 conference calls for different projects. While at ATT I never had a face-to-face requirements meeting with any users.
good,"At this job, I was expected to know how AT&T service works and how to install it. I worked with different types of service line, both copper and fiber optic cable. I was expected to be able to install Internet, phone, and cable by hooking up a line to AT&T's infrastructure and configuring modems and cable boxes to be able to connect to the right signals. I was expected to be able to do this for both residential customers as well as business customers and I did this for over 950 different customers not including instances where I helped other technicians with jobs."
good,"Relaxing place to work at but for 11 hours a day for 39 hours a week, $10 is just not enough. I would recommend higher pay then employees would be more motivated"
good,It is a great company but it seems focused on not keeping commitment to pension close employees preferring to downsize them to not pay full pension benefits and cutting extremely talented people
good,"AT&T could be a great company to work for, but if you are not part of the inner circle you will be left behind. Very fast paced, all call are monitored and you will be called in to listen to any phone call management deems not a ""good"" call."
good,I worked for AT&T in Illinois for 10 years until our center closed and it was the best job ever.    Here in Oklahoma the management is inconsistent and continue to change managers every 3 months.  It is hard to know what is expected since they are all different.
good,"Working at AT&T could be stressful at times because you have certain productivity numbers to meet and management was always stressing to you about the numbers.  The work itself was not difficult at all and one could get satisfaction from doing quality work and providing excellent customer service.  Your typical work day starts at 8:00 A.M.  You may or may not have a workload assigned to you in the morning.  If you do have a work load you do that work until it is completed.  If you did not have a work load you hit the dispatch button and work the job given to you.  You are required to work until the work load is complete.  This means that you may get off at the scheduled time of 5:00 P. M. or you may not get off work until 8:00 PM or later.  The most stressful part of the job is not knowing exactly when you would get off work during the week.  Also, the fact that you have to work three weekends per month and can't really make plans to do anything on the weekend with family.  The pay and benefits with AT&T are adequate.  Overall, the job is not bad, but there is plenty that could be done to make it a better place to work."
good,AT&T wireless was a good company to work for. They offer a variety of shifts. Lots of college students are employed here. Good benefits and discounts on cell service.
good,"Good opportunity to expand and learn. Technically speaking, it was very challenging, I enjoyed it very much. People, co-workers were very good. Great memories."
good,"ATT Mobility is a fair place to work. Pay is fair and the benfits are great.  I would share that if you are not used to handling calls back to back and providing first call resolution, this job is not for you. If you are competitive and love to challenge yourself, this is a great job."
good,I actually don't have too much to say about the company. AT&T allows for unparalleled cultural diversity. They include a lot training that will truly improve or enhance sensitivity to others.
good,"Good Pay, Bad attendance policy, Great Benefits, SALES Environment. CEO is intelligent and forward thinking company is always on the cutting edge of technology."
good,"I have enjoyed working for att but there is a definite gap in the advancement unless you are willing to completely go back to school and essentially start over in a new field. That's not advanced, that's a career change."
good,"Fun workplace to work on. Large application and large number of user so much to learn on application availability, scalability, fault tolerant features."
good,"Great company, 401k, benefits, medical/health/dental. Room for advancement if willing to relocate. The Pay structure constantly changes although if your driven you can maximize on your company."
good,To keep it short great company just not for me. You work your tail off for your comp which is good but you pay for it if you miss effort metrics which are metrics you dont get paid on they are just add one
good,"Worked here for the duration of my professional career."
good,I really don't have anything to say positive about this position. I feel management in my department were bullies. There was no one to report my feelings too.
good,"I enjoyed my time at AT&T and would go back if the opportunity came. Internal promotion didn't exist, the union was the worst part about the position at AT&T"
good,"The workplace was very quiet. There were a lot of opportunities to learn and be trained in how to test the various products for their satellite service. As long as you showed eagerness to learn, many of the employees are willing to teach you."
good,"Customer oriented"
good,"work life balance was tough, money was good though.  Mangers were good while I there however the area manager was hard to deal with.  Co workers were great."
good,I have learned and gained a wealth of knowledge and experience working at AT&T.  This has allowed me to pursue several opportunities within my career.
good,"Good pay and benefits, but stressful. I and most techs I worked with felt like our jobs were alway on the line. I’ve sents heard it’s gotten better and may have just been our management but it was a company policy at the time to write up 20% of all techs for bad job performance every month. They would break down everyone into 1 of 5 rankings, with 20% in each and the lowest was to be written up. Twice in one year and you are on probation again and you could be fired."
good,"I enjoyed some of the staff I just feel management didn’t play a good role into their company but only into themselves.Despite the best intentions of all involved, communication sometimes falls by the wayside. Notifications get missed or team members are inadvertently left off of critical communications. Take this time-consuming function off your employees' plates with continuous improvement software. Instead of a steady chain of emails, appropriate personnel receive a daily digest of all news and updates."
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for but is a hard job to keep, job security is biased on products. AT&T has no problem laying off employees that have been there for years during down times and bringing in new employees when work picks up."
good,"Amazing benefits and commission opportunities. Corporate locations are union for non-managerial staff, lay offs are possible at all levels though. "
good,"Like any big company,  there's a bit of a ""who you know"" mentality in order to advance, ... assuming you get past that and make your mark, ... most people will stay for decades."
good,A fast paced work environment with options to continually learn. Diversity is valued.  I learned a lot about digital transformation and took advantage of available training.
good,"Good company to work for.  The benefits provided are also very good. However, lately the uncertainty of job security looms over all IT employees."
good,"it was a job, nothing more I can really say about it the pay was ok for what it was but not enough for one to making a living off of it. Hours were good"
good,"Fast paced and can be very stressful, but the employees and management are great. The pay is comparable and management tries to ease the stress of the job."
good,"Good place to work, good benefits! good work work culture, work life balance, lo of opportunities to lean and enhance the skill set. new technology training."
good,"Fast paced."
good,A  take away great opportunity for those who enjoy one on one customer interaction. Very fast paced sales of various telecommunications products and services . I've learned a lot in the span of 18 years one thing being adaptable to change in a growing industry.
good,"I worked for AT&T while it was still only DirecTv. I found my management team to be completely lacking. Refused to take phone calls that customers wanted elevated, refused to give feed back on how to better handle an escalated call, and refused to return calls to customers."
good,AT&T was a great company to work for with great healthcare and very competitive wages. We serviced Technicians in 23 States and things were constantly changing so there was always something new to learn.
good,"AT&T is always two steps ahead of everyone in the industry. Compensation as a Retail Sales Consultant was very fair when I first started, but eventually the compensation plan changed which was why I found a new opportunity."
good,"Very pleasant place to work however gettin a bit too old to climb on rooftops "
good,"High energy, quick paced & results driven. Always multitasking & engaged in activities to motivates reps to sell AT&T products & services. Days would fly by due to tremendous amount of activities & chasing the sale."
good,I started with them when they just started to install U-Verse. I was a term employee and not a union employee. There was no set hours or work week. You were assigned jobs depending on the demand and working 70 or more hours was not unusual. There were a lot of unknowns with the U-verse system at that time and we basically debugged problems encountered as we found them. At the end of my 3 year contract the system was working well. Then they sold the operation to Frontier in this area.
good,"Great place to work but after 36 years, I feel that I need to go do something else.  I am 60 years young and want to do something else in life.  I like to input data and work with pleasant people in a positive atmosphere."
good,"Good pay but you will be worked. It isn't too bad but it is hard for a family.                           Completes Very high bit-rate Digital Line Subscriber (VDSL) circuits terminated at clients residents to the Residential Gateway/Modem. Installs and Repairs/replaces copper cabling such as CAT5, CAT6, Coax, Low Voltage Twisted Pair, and Quad telephone wiring in the clients's home and in the field. Installs and repairs Fiber Optic Cabling, making splices, and crimping connectors for termination at clients's premise. Install and troubleshoot different telecommunications networks inside clients resident and businesses such as IPTV, Voice over Internet Protocol, high speed internet, and wireless home networks. Troubleshoot, inspect, remove, install, repair, modify, overhaul, and operate AT&T systems, components, and associated support equipment."
good,Large companies often redefine it self over time. This has been a constant for the last 5 year. The culture has shifted from when I joined the company in 2008.
good,An good company to work for.  Customer Service has a set job description the only draw back is that every minute is monitored so if you have to go to the restroom you have to get permission first.
good,AT&T was a blessing to my family. It allowed me to provide security and comfort to my family. The work was very demanding on my body and that pretty much is the only reason for me leaving.
good,typical work day was coming in and getting my list of houses i had to go to for services and then getting in my van and starting my day at work . good place to be if u like working under low supervison
good,"I have learned countless of positive selling behaviors from At&t that translates into my current position at MyCoolCell.  Behaviors such as top down selling, coaching, discipline, inventory management, scheduling, etc."
good,"Es buen lugar para trabajar, con buenas personas pero muy poca libertad para crecer"
good,"A typical day at at&t is different for everyone depending on your division."
good,Very demanding company to work for. they wants a lot of quality standards met which where very time consuming. made it very fast paced to get your work none safely.
good,I have no additional comment regarding the company or anything related to the company culture or procedures related to the operation of the company thanks
good,sometimes the store was slow and sometimes it was jammed packed.i learned a lot about different people and how to approach them in different ways. it taught me to go above and beyond for all customers and keep a level head.
good,I was bullied at AT&T they say they are a diverse company but those that are different are often made fun of. You cant go to managers because the managers are friends with the bullies. Its the bullies that get promoted. I have witnessed a bully being mean to a customer and saw a regional manager and regular manager walk buy as if they were afraid to do something. So great benefits but they should address the bullying and do something about it.
good,"Maintaining customer accounts, answering customer calls regarding billing, and equipment issues,posting payments and adjustments to customer accounts,"
good,The benefits were good but the AT&T take over pushed a lot of good workers out with work hours that didn't give much quality of life. It would have been much better if they also took their employees home life into account
good,Provided great benefits and discounts. I learned how to work in a team environment and became an expert technician in the process. I am grateful for the time I had with the company.
good,"AT&T procedures and policies are very mature and advanced which help to build up as a skillset."
good,"I absolutely loved working with my peers and even management, working for AT&T the company was an honor for me, however doing the actual job had become extremely stressful in certain ways, I felt there were times in which we could have, but did not put the customers needs first."
good,"Working at a satellite office provided me with the autonomy to make decisions about customer needs and plan my work times to fulfill those needs. I rarely attended morning meetings, etc. I was then reassigned to a corporate office, where I had the same job but at a different location. The middle-level managers were so concerned about that the upper-level management thought of them that I spent just as much time cleaning my desk and making everything look perfect (just in case someone ""important"" walked by it) and attending long meetings as I did try to meet the customer needs. That meant I still had all the work that I had to do like at the other job location but spent more time after hours completing it. In my opinion, this degraded the service I provided to the customer because I was exhausted from the whole of it. Overall, I loved my job and was sad that I needed to quit due to poor work-life balance,"
good,"Organizados, practicos, funcionales. Buen lugar. Muy profesional."
good,"Es muy grato trabajar para una empresa tan importante y grata como esta. Siempre pendiente de las normas y de qué no le falte nada a sus trabajadores. Siempre en comunicacion, y de muy buena calidad humana."
good,"I was fortunate to start with Wisconsin Bell and observe the many changes of the company.  It was a great place for advancement, education and benefits."
good,"i met a bunch of good people working at at&t. some lasted, some didnt. however it was a cool environment to work, managers did not stand behind employees though, quick to throw everyone else under the bus before taking ownership! ( my experience) incentives were rigged and made it impossible to get or change the amount of sales or a certain app or program that has to be sold, which was almost impossible to sell due to the fact that at&t service is not the easiest to get or cheapest! overall i did last there almost 3 years. it was a great experience. at&t turned me into a awesome sales men."
good,Not a bad position but the job security is going away by the qtr which was told to us by the CEO that this is the new way of life.  We are told that this is just the way it is.
good,Read emails from home before I went to work. Met with my direct reports and afterwards met with my Area Manager.  It's a pretty good company to work for even though I was surplused. I did see favoritism within management. There was a difference when it came to 1st and 2nd shift managers.
good,"AT&T has many positive things to offer.  It is up to you to make the best of it.  It's not for everyone, but can be a great place to work.  It is a hard company to work for sometimes though."
good,It was a good place to work. Co-workers were good. Management was horrible. They like to micro manage. It also took them a long time before handling and/or resolving issues.
good,"It was exciting at first. I was put on a dynamic team and we did some amazing work. I was put on pilot programs and sent off to do special assignments. It was really great. I was promoted several times over, and then business conditions changed. An operations directorate was brought in to manage R&D. Then things fell apart. It resulted in an outsourcing which sent me to IBM."
good,"However, my most recent position was as a contractor, and unfortunately, the work environment was less desirable.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the AT&T employees.  The hours and demands of the job are challenging, and the pace is fast as processes and procedures are ever changing, but that is the nature of IT.  The hardest part of the job was when I worked as a contractor and  much of the work force was off shore, so their daytime is our nighttime which made it difficult at times to achieve the level of communication that best serves flawless project implementations."
good,"Management always made sure we were happy and satisfied with the work environment. Every Friday we would play team bonding games. I learned during my employment, strong leadership skills and to work as a team unit.the most difficult part of the job was competition within the marketing department during advertising campaigns. The aspect I most enjoyed was the ability to travel several times a month."
good,"The only negative thing I have to say is that the points of escalation, did not take the changes in the oom or scope to consideration when it is based off a very effective scope order management flow, that I base most projects off of."
good,AT&T is great if you are looking for a well-paying job with great benefits and okay with staying in your position for quite some time. There is also room to move.
good,"Love my job, hate the office politics and being micromanaged, customer service has not bee the focus in many years, pay is excellent but you need more then pay to live a good life"
good,AT&T pays very well... $30 an hr with no degree is unheard  of. Job security is something all together different. Constant threating to close jobs was what made me take the buyout and  leave in 2012. Benefits were awesome as well as pay.  They eventually closed down every office in Michigan.
good,Cliques and I saw some racism among the trainers when it came to assisting the black employees. The work discount was great. The hours can be long because the lunch breaks are only 1/2 hour with two fifteen minute breaks.
good,Tienes desarrollo a largo plazo existen cambios en los esquemas de comisión algunas veces
good,"AT&T had many different functional departments and therefore offered quite a few opportunities to find a career and advance as an employee. Compensation was competitive and other benefits were above average. Quality of management varied, but was better then most from what I have experienced."
good,"Like many companies out there, the general work force from entry level to Manager 2 positions, are micromanaged to the extent of unnecessary stress and creates a work environment where you have to walk on egg shells all day long."
good,"At the time, this was a new position the company was trying out so we knew it was a possibility that it could be dissolved if certain goals werent met.  The sales goals were too high and the customer base was oversold"
good,"I was an intern at AT&T for the summer.  I learned a lot about product marketing, UX design, UI design.  The team was helpful and interested in advancing my career."
good,The company has made long strides in evolving as a Technology company. Leadership has facilitated lots of training programs to it's employees and encrourages everyone to pivot their skills over time.
good,"Ok place to work but you never know when they will change directions. Work-life balance can be a concern if your in a retail environment. Great opportunity to grow in the company often, but never get comfortable in one position for more than 3 yrs. Your job is always on a timer."
good,Some groups have poor capabilities in managing budgets. They brought me in as a contractor promising me 18mths of work then realized they had no budget available for my term. I was very disappointed.  Aside from that I still think it's a great company if you are working full time.
good,"AT&T can be a great place to work, but the culture of the management there is one of extreme control. The people are great and the job is fulfilling but the only thing that I had an issue with was the constant checking in by management which could be stifling."
good,"Fun and productive with daily interactions with all employee levels.  A typical day includes reading email update, reviewing materials for upcoming class and communicating with peers, the management team on upcoming projects."
good,management sometime not understand to installer and co-worker will help with customers and troubleshoot and vehicle are keep up. There not enough hours in the day to service all the customers
good,AT&T is a great company to work for. It offers a lot of learning experiences and growth opportunities for its full time employees. Doesn't offer much to contractors.
good,Great place to work for always had something to do you're on your own time take break from you need to I don't know what's really great company to work for good pay
good,Excellent work environment competitive rates excellent customer service great benefits good hours excellent management team grey CEO love working there
good,"Excellent work environment, outstanding work life balance, management is unique."
good,Run overnight and day test. Analyze results and report defects in JIRA and respond to all questions asked be developers. It is a great work environment with the best manager and team leads.
good,this job was not a job for me i have nothing bad to say or good. the money was ok but thats with all the over time. Loved all the insight to the company and all the payed experience
good,The workload was too much for a person to handle however it had to get done. The sales teams are rogue and quite difficult to support at times causing additional stress when up against a deadline
good,Overall working at AT&T is good. Flexible working hours and management was supportive to train on new technologies. Compensation benefits were also good.
good,Environment stressful and competitive. Base rate is not enough for all that the job encounters. Has nice incentives and opportunities to make money but only if the opportunity is presented.
good,"Management was poor, pay was okay. The manager was hitting on the women there, so it was hard to pay attention to my job when someone is harassing you.  If you like to take calls and have patience for the customers, then its a good place to work."
good,"El clima laboral es muy bueno, se fomenta el trabajo en equipo, por ser un área donde el principal indicador son las ventas, se genera bastante estress."
good,"High call volume, fast paced, repetitive call center work. Management on my team was great! Vacation time was first come first serve. Sick days were allowed if you had enough ""points"" to cover your absence- If you did not have enough, you would be fired or required to make up the day within the same work week if management allowed. Hour long unpaid lunch and two 15min breaks."
good,Sometimes stressful sometimes poor weather conditions otherwise ok.  I liked it but not for people who are afraid to climb a pole in all weather heights are sometimes frightening.
good,"Working with AT&T was good for the benefit for the entire family."
good,"Every day was pretty much the same, answering calls in regards to directory assistance, meaning providing phone numbers and addresses to our customers. Management was okay, they didn't meddle too much but also didn't provide much guidance via advancement. The culture itself was great, worked with a great group of people, we made the best of our time there. The hardest part of the day was adjusting to the ever changing expectations and the most enjoyable was getting off work"
good,I was happy to be allowed to have a close working relationship with Information Technology and Operations.  I learned a lot.  Management styles were varied.  Some were better than others.
good,Great company to work for if you have a lot of seniority.  Benefits and pay are incredible! There's really not much more I can say except I wish I would have been able to get a few more years under my belt.
good,"Not as many advancement opportunities as advertised, unless you want to deal with the stress of being a manager you are stuck where you’re at. They aren’t hiring anymore of the higher paying positions because the lower pay positions are taking over all of their work, for less pay. Also I’ve had 5 managers in 3 1/2 years"
good,daily automation and regression testing working with various OEM's and Dev teams to find root cause of bugs discovered. Providing fixes and retesting software/firmware
good,"It was a good place to work for the most part. It was stressful at times and the hours worked were strenuous, but the compensation was good for the time spent there per week."
good,"Great company to work for.  The only hold down was the inability for the union to negotiate better commission structure.  Management is non union, so there is a natural divide."
good,Very fast paced with constant back to back income phone calls.  Weekly team meeting and daily huddles to keep you up to date with any changes that affect you or the customer
good,AT&T is a coo place to work at.  The union does not do a good job at fighting for you but overall the perks are fine.  The hours are good and they give you enough vacation time.
good,I really enjoyed building the sites up to their full potential and being a part of a team that took care of their staff and customers in a very high regard. the down side is you do not have much time for an outside life. The hours are very long but worth it
good,Empresa lider en el mercado en servicios de telecomunicación celular para el sector de pequeñas y medianas empresas con amplia cobertura 4g LTE en la zona de Tijuana y puntos aledaños. Excelente ambiente de trabajo y valoración del capital humano que la conforma. Comisiones y cuotas alcanzables con excelente relación consto beneficio para clientes en general.
good,"I learned how at&t acquired there work from home division. It was by out sourcing 3rd party companies to distribute there services and products, I had no problem with there policies or responsibilities. The only problem I had work with the company is the 3rd party companies they decided to use as a out source for employment, they did not respect or have any compassion for the employees they decided to work and participate in the campaign provided."
good,Great work life balance and benefits. Fast paced and challenging position - very enjoyable.  Team was in another state - somewhat difficult for team collaboration.
good,"I love working for AT&T, however, I wish that the work hours were more flexible, since the only days available for me to work are on weekends. I believe that being a part of the AT&T family is very fun and exciting."
good,Very fast pace dealing with tech issues and concerns and have to multitask 10 different items or more at once ever since the merger with DIRECTV. AT&T culture is very different from DIRECTV.
good,"Take 80-100 calls a day regarding billing issues, Phone mplan questions and technical support. Metrics are the most important aspect of job. At the time they offered free cell service and data plans....but that was 11 yrs ago."
good,"The company as a whole is disconnected from its workforce. very impersonal and not understanding at all of what actually happens in the field. The first couple tiers of management understand and work together to make the job easier, Above that they need to get back to their roots of taking care of the customer. not giving the customer what they think they need. The pay is excellent and the people I work with are great. The ""performance standards"" are a bit extreme and the technician is often punished for anothers mistake or misinformation."
good,I enjoyed working for AT&T however I worked with many people who were not the friendliest of people. The biggest problem with this company was as a family man it left me little time to enjoy with my kids.
good,I think that AT&T has offered me a great paying job for the time that I have worked here but it has been lacking in the area of advancement.  I worked with some great people and made some great relationships in the time that I worked for AT&T
good,NEEDS a Better Family/Work Shift availability - hours not so good - no need to EMpower the employer with slaving at hours - nights til 10pm - is excessive for call center work anymore - not a good balance
good,"If you enjoy selling and don't mind pushing products and services aggressively then AT&T is a good fit. My experience was at an Authorized Retailer, who set their own pay and sales incentives. AT&T Corporate run stores tend to have better salaries."
good,"If your looking for job security.  This NOT the place.  Constant threats of downsizing.  When your are in the union with low seniority there is no way to save your job, no matter how good of a performance you do."
good,"Great company overall, in terms of benefits of pay. I can't speak for all managers, but myself and those I know,  work life balance as a manager is atrocious. Target expectations are sometimes ridiculous, given you store's location."
good,"Stressful but good company to work for overall, good benefits, the call centers are stressfull and micromanaged but overall a good place to work for. AT&T does have advancement opportunities if you are willing to relocate where you are needed."
good,Learn different technology and devices. Lots of tools and learning webinar for advancements. Flexible working hours and environment with multi cultures
good,You will not see a lot of diversity at the executive level anymore. Nor will you see much diversity in middle management. Seems to be some uncertainty right now for everyone.
good,"AT&T pays well and gives competitive benefits.  For the team manager position, there is 10-15 people per team and you are  responsible for their performance, which can be stressful since you are viewed as a manager by how well your team performs.  The people you work with are supportive and friendly, they are like a second family.  The business needs come first, so scheduling can leave you with a shift that is not desireable for a work/life balance."
good,"Trabajo en equipo, trabajar bajo presión, cultura de inclusión."
good,"This is where I learned programming working in the corporate environment. Job consisted of programming with Informix database 4GL and ""C"" programming in a Unix environment (AT&T 3B2 Unix boxes)"
good,"Very fast pace work environment where you are always learning new things and keeping up with sale trends, new sales promotions, and company standards."
good,"Energetic and engaging workplace. Good people and involved leadership. A great place to work."
good,Good exposure to challenging tasks. Have experience in agile and waterfall methodologies. Sometimes work used to be hectic but still enjoyed working with AT&T as a client
good,I cant complain about the job however i was disabled and when it was time to end my disability i was never given a return to work date and just left out to dry
good,"I was employed by Pacific Bell Directory in 1988,then moved to SBCLD and ended my career 30 years later with AT&T.  Although there were more growth opportunities when the company was local, I was able to grow, learn and expand my skills via various job functions. Overall positive experience."
good,"Never boring, always something different and at times very challenging.Got to do work in the field and always had desk-paper work."
good,"I was a contractor, not an employee, so most items above do not apply.  It was a good company to work for as a post career temp.  For employees, it is not the company it used to be.  Job security is not what it was.  The company hires overseas contractors to save costs. "
good,"The size of the organization has pros and cons. On the up side, the people are smart and committed. On the down side, it has grown via constant acquisitions over time and suffers from internal process chaos."
good,"With hard work, you can move up to a comfortable  level. Able to move to different groups after a few years. Lot of time during the day is wasted on big company processes. Process tools are cumbersome as if an engineer designed them"
good,"Great experience with 2 exceptions. Management move around can put you from a bad manager to a good manager. unfortunately mine was reversed."
good,Good place to work.  Union is weak with poor representation of members. Company always changing and will cut employees based on performance. Management is somewhat decent.
good,"AT&T is an amazing company to work for if you don't have kids or a relationship. If you have either of these, the work/life balance can be tough. They have amazing benefits and they pay great."
good,"I like to advance in any job I get. I did not get the opportunity I felt I deserved. All in all I love the company and it's products. I would work for them again, but would like different opportunities with the company."
good,You either have it or you don't. You will either love this job or hate it. It can be very rewarding but it is very political. must involve yourself in company affairs as well as kick butt on the sales floor wether you are coaching a team or a team member.
good,"None to mention about AT&T being as a consultant with a staffing company, have limited view and accessibility. continuous changing, need to be flexible."
good,"A typical day would consist of cleaning/ getting work truck ready to leave the lot by 8am, after leaving the lot you would dispatch on your given jobs. Each employee would complete the jobs given to them. No job consisted of the same thing, each house, customer, condition was different. All employees were expected to work a full 10 hour day but usually consisted on working later due to the amount of jobs."
good,"While the underlying environment can be quite intense, primarily due to upper management having zero clue what it takes to really make AT&T work at the real production level, the team I worked on and other teams I worked with were full of great people who really cared about their jobs and making the best out of some unrealistic deadlines and expectations."
good,AT&T is laying off seasoned employees to pay less experienced contractors less money. Working through different job titles has been stressful with some positions and laid back with others.
good,I learned a lot about the sales process when it pertained to AT&T. I learned how to handle customer objections and deal with different personalities and people.
good,Great place to work. However work becomes stressful with the constant changes to leadership and management. new reps were not properly trained while older reps coasted by just collecting pay checks. This job like an another job is shaped on how you approach the day each and every day.
good,"I worked at AT&T for 13 years. Several incarnations of AT&T rather. The company became so big that it didn’t really care about his employees. Combining wireline and wireless and saving money resulted in a lot of job losses. That said, I don’t regret working there. I learned a lot of things and met a lot of people. I gained valuable experience and skill."
good,"All in all not too bad with strong leadership."
good,"Incoming calls were typically back to back throughout the day. Calls range from simple billing questions to technical support to irate customers with many errors on their account. I learned how to remain calm and positive with customers, co-workers and management. I also learned how to deal with a lot of change because procedures and sales requirements changed often. Management is stressed which comes down on their direct reports because of the pushing of sales now. It was great to be able to provide resolutions to customers and feel good knowing you helped them. It was hard to meet all the stats because calls need to be under a certain time while resolving the issue and offering new products."
good,"Working at AT&T showed me a lot about the customer service industry. I worked there for several years and was able to learn about not only the customer service culture but the products. The products and services offered are vast. I had to learn quickly. The job is very fast paced, but did teach me a lot."
good,"The department I worked for at AT&T no longer exists as it was acquired by Comcast. When I was part of this organization,. I thought the company was moving in the right direction. This was quite some time ago."
good,I loved working for AT&T and would love to work for them again in the future. My only negative review would be about the union and how they would take your money every month but wouldn't have your back when it came to representing you. Otherwise I absolutely lovd my job and took pride in representing the company.
good,"During my 18 month employment with AT&T as a wire technician there were many positives to the job with a handful of relatively important negatives.  Here is my best attempt to convey that experience quickly."
good,At&t was a stepping stone in my career as it was my first tech support job. I would recommend anyone starting off to go to At&t to learn tech support savvy and customer service.
good,Good company overall. Great benefits. Right now company is going through massive layoffs. This is a union ran company for all technicians. There are big changes coming within the company.
good,Great place to start if you're interested in pursuing a career in the telecommunications field. Must be comfortable working and making decisions independently.
good,AT&T is a great place to work if you have a Bachelor's Degree min. They promote within and provide 100 of hours of training. They have outstanding benefits and discounts available to employees.
good,An innovative place to work during these rapidly changing times of technology and entertainment migration.  Constant technological advances made for a very exciting workplace.
good,"It got rough: ATT wasnt really heavy in New Mexico, so we had to struggle with getting cell phone activations. Also, it was rough due to only getting credit for phone activations and not anything else we sold in the store."
good,"There is a lot of climbing,  crawling,  and lifting.  So understand that before applying. You have to work in ALL types of weather also.  However,  they do provide you with all clothing and tools to keep you safe and warm."
good,"I was the only female on the floor and would be asked to decorate the floor instead of sell.  It was annoying that men would put you in the back so they could hog all the sales coming thru the front door."
good,As a whole the experience was fine. Need more opportunities advancement . More diverse environment need. Not such an emphasis on monthly metrics but on how the customers are treated
good,Working at AT&T i had learned more about technology. It was fun at work because you helped others with necessity's. The hardest part was doing the counts.
good,Learned to be a real corporate leader and gain proper respect from co workers and upper management. the company promotes people to higher positions and they aren't actual leaders. people that feed off there own ego and sensitivities should be in charge of a store.
good,"It’s the first retail and sales job I’ve ever worked and it has definitely helped me in those aspects, but after doing it for 2 years it’s become tiring especially with  our sales goals skyrocketing and compensation staying the same."
good,"While I really enjoyed working here, it was a very competitive position. If you were doing well they loved you. If you weren't, you just didn't matter."
good,The job boosts my confidence in customer relations and gave me a competitive personality with my coworkers and helped me do my best to outshine everyone. The hardest part was dealing with coworkers that didn't do their job right and wanted others to pick up after their slack. The most enjoyable part was helping people out and selling them products that they needed.
good,"I would assist a large volume of customers with phone questions, new device purchases, billing questions, while all at the same time attempt to position and sell a myriad of different services to these same customers."
good,"Gigantic company, so can be very bureaucratic.  Was in the large system consulting group which later was sold to HP.  Not sure this review is relevant any more."
good,in a place of AT&T world get ready to throw away your life and ultimately you will be paid for it and compensate for it as well but if you are willing to give away all your time pleases do so but if you are person that would love to be out going and be able to do stuff I wouldn't recommend it
good,"AT&T seems to be constantly expanding its reach to keep up with the newest tech trends and break the mold from being a pure telecom company."
good,Typical day consist of reviewing daily customer feedback comments and concerns. Informing the office of current results. Review and analyze data as applicable and create data reports for review.
good,"Great place to work, but while working make sure you're working on your education just in case AT&T decides to lay you.  Be very cautious just so that you stay prepared for what may come."
good,"Good place to work.  The entire department felt like one big family.  No drama for the most part, which was refreshing.  Professional people working alongside me.  The only disappointing part of working there is that the method they allow advancement depends highly on the length of time employed with the company. So, if your tenure is not lengthy, and there is someone else in the running for a position that you already have experience in, you can forget about it.  Your experience will not override their tenure.  This is not a very EOE method of promoting staff."
good,"Very physical work that is preformed in all weather elements.  Must be able to work at high heights such as ladders, roofs, telephone poles, and bucket trucks."
good,"Was a fine place to work. Very much based on efficiency. Hardest part of the job was working as a contractor, which I would not recommend to anyone. No real trust on us to do our jobs, even if we go above and beyond."
good,"The typical work day tended to be slow until it wasn't."
good,Over the years cellular and home service commissions have declined. You basically don't make as much money as one used to do to so much competition with cellular companies.
good,"Great work environment. love coaching my team and developing them. At my store we have fun and make the best of every sale and customer. I will always stand by the saying ""do more than you get paid for"". Some times that will back fire and put you in a very stressful place and get no where for over 6 months. Best part of the job is my staff and customers. I love people and am very friendly with a professional attitude."
good,"AT&T treated their employees fairly and it payed well. There are some positions they are no longer hiring for, so they hire contractors. Those contractors are performing the same work on a team with the employees, but are treated completely different. Management was always trying to do things to bring everybody together, but ultimately their corporate policy does not allow that to work."
good,At&t was a great place to work for a lot of people just getting out of high school. There was a lot of drama between employee's and if you could ignore that then everything was great.
good,"They moved me all over the US. They trained me for any job they needed me for. The compensation was alright at the time I was employed there. If the industry itself hadn't of been in such a state of flux, coupled with the economy being a mess, I might still be there and might still be loving it. It was challenging, exciting, constantly evolving, and interesting."
good,"layoff got me"
good,AT&T is not the company it used to be.  With the constant reorganizations it is a very stressful job.  They do offer great benefits and encourage their employees to continue with their education.
good,"on a normal work day meeting new people everyday"
good,"A typical day consisted of walking into the office, greeting people, setting up then down to daily work."
good,I loved working for this company. They always took good care of their employees. Great compensation and incentive plans. The management could stand to listen to the employees a little more when it comes to average handle times however overall I would say a great company to work for.
good,"Good place to work as long as you go in and mind you business and head strraight to work. management was hard but fair, lunches were rushed and timing was overly strict,"
good,"door to door marketing for At&t can be rough at times but i enjoyed conversating with all different types of people daily, talking with them and being of assistance to them in any way that i can. its a very competitive environment seeing that is it commission based but that kept the culture and community on its toes and to be at there best"
good,The overall environment was way better when it was Directv things actually got done with employees input this company now is so back as backward I wake-up in the morning and don't feel like going to work
good,"mandatory overtime of 45 minutes daily nearly year around, hard to get a set schedule....but if you apply yourself and be attentive to your call you will excel in the business"
good,"It was a good work place , learned a lot about sales and about different technology. Just the pay wasn't there and you had to sell so much just to make a decent commission. But good people, and fast paced environment."
good,Worked 11-14 hours daily with an off day alternating randomly weekly. Could not call in sick without having a union meeting after you return. Money was good though. Great experience!
good,"If you like long hours, but fairly simple work this is a good job for you. The supervisors were  good to work for, and the team spirit is there, but overall as a shop, it was disorganized and cluttered."
good,"I enjoyed my time there despite no real chance of direct advancement."
good,"managers are corporate robots. a lot of micro managing. Dealing with customers can already be stressful for some, so why make the overall environment even more stressful"
good,I was a temp contractor so I did not receive any company benefits. Upper management was solid and had a good grasp of what was happening out in the field.
good,Working as a field technician can be very rewarding if you are willing to put in all the time and effort to excel. Winter months tend to be very slow and football season you'll hardly get any sleep. You need to be able to keep yourself motivated and moving forward as well as manage your time very efficiently. It is a hard job to balance your time if you have a family or other obligations. The pay (if piece rate) can be outstanding if you are fast and do quality installs. Not so much if you are a slow tech or get caught up in conversation easily or distracted.
good,"Very busy- supported customers and sales.  I loved my customers and I often worked on solutions with sales. We would coordinate getting all the heads together to get resolutions.  Many of us were laid off.  We had work/life balance in my segment, but not in others."
good,"See title.  Great company, good atmosphere- given recent acquisition strategy internal employees have a difficult time exploring other promotional options.  They also pay WELL below market for positions not located in revenue centers... no matter how qualified or experienced you are.  Do NOT accept a role thinking you will have a chance to show your worth and make more money.  Get the money up front.  Else you will spend the rest of your time there fighting for market rate and having them say (falsely) that they DO pay market or that there isn't anything they can do about it."
good,"great job if you can work changing shifts every three to 6 months"
good,Management is put under constant pressure to perform that results in a tense environment for all employees.  Managers tend to move around a lot and consistency is lacking.  Most employees are fun and make the work enjoyable and the pay is modest if you're a good seller.
good,AT&T is a good corporation to work for.  The benefits are good and you are given enough freedom to balance your work and home life.  Working hours can vary depending on projects
good,"our position was eliminated"
good,Fast paced environment in the telecommunications world.  Typical day included multiple conference calls.  Both internal and external with customer.  Lots of technical and sales education opportunity.
good,Wages are amazing but AT&T management is corrupt. It is pretty cut throat they either love you or want to get rid of you and if you want to work honestly then they want to get rid of you. Hardest part is the customers and calls you handle.
good,"If you come to work for AT&T, be prepared for a lot of organizational changes.  Benefits are good but do not think you will work here for 30 years and retire.  That is a thing of the past."
good,"Worked for DIRECTV when AT&T bought them out and man what a difference (for the worst). The pay and benefits were comparable (slightly worse); but the constant bureaucracy and tools and technology they foster lead to a slow production environment. Way too many silos and turf wars mar the ATT environment unbearable. And with the yearly ""surplus"" exercises to layoff employees torpedo the morale."
good,"I have mixed feelings about my short time at AT&T UVerse divison.  For the most part I enjoyed what I was doing.  I really only had two issues both personal.  One I was attending college and nearly failed a class due to work requirements.  UVerse was not your standard 8 to 5 job.  There were days I worked from 8am till 10pm at night which I would not have minded if school was not a factor.  Second personal issue is I would have preferred business class,  I am not one for crawling around in homes.  The work was satisfying and I even enjoyed climbing telephone poles at age 49/50.  If you a telecom interest and are looking to join the field.  I would recommend this company as a launching platform."
good,Had some good managers and some not so good. had some room for advancement. Benefits were usually very good. There are a number of different divisions which can offer opportunities.
good,"None at this time to be reviewed at a later stage."
good,"I’m really having trouble with this, because I love my job. I love the local people and management, and I love (most of, lol) the customers. "
good,Working in a call center has its ups and downs. You have to be a person who is tech savvy and can think on their feet. With the systems we use on a daily basis you have to be great at multi tasking
good,"Sign in July.  114 degrees.  Given company van and gas card. Had to attend classes as electricity is involved. Proper use of equipment such as Signal meters. Ladders and product assembly. State codes for installations. Was working well when I couldn't keep up anymore.  Had become ill and could not work. That was about 9 years ago "
good,If we had mgrs with tech exp then things would run like a well oiled machine but we don’t so it doesn’t. We’re under paid for the job we do and it’s an insane thing to grasp...
good,"In 17 years I have had super high highs and super low lows. The resulting corporation after the BellSouth / AT&T merger has ended a run that I had zero intention of ever leaving willingly. I met and was honored to work with wonderful people across our world.  I am saddened that this merger with TimeWarner has reduced all of us to mere numbers on a map. It was a good run. This was my best year employed there and I found out on a random Monday my position ""in Louisiana"" was eliminated.  It has nothing to do with who I am as an employee it appears, merely my location. Apply freely - love cautiously."
good,New Management is looking for low cost solution and not paying much attention to employee satisfaction. More and more legacy employees are replaced by low cost new hire staff.
good,"Unless you know someone,it is hard to be promoted."
good,"Coworkers were always great to be around. Depending on 1st level managers, depended's how successful you are. Hope ou are luck enough to get a great manager."
good,The telecommunications industry is very unstable and not very secure.  I signed up to work for Bellsouth which was a great company to work for that really looked out for their employees.
good,"CEO tells rank and file one thing and then does another like retraining current employees for new positions and then has mass layoff.  "
good,Me gusto mucho trabajar en esta empresa ya que me brinda oportunidades muy buenas
good,"I would recommend AT&T to anyone who wants to grow their career.  They provide good pay and benefits, along with tuition reimbursement.  This company keeps pace and/or sets trends in the marketplace."
good,"AT&T offers a lot of training for employees. The job is very fast pace, and requires long hours.   I had some good managers.  I felt being a long time employee, I did not get the compensation that was due to me, but the company offers great benefits."
good,Worked with a bunch of great people although my direct managers were a little questionable.  The hardest part of the job was sitting through multiple meetings as opposed to just focusing on sales.
good,i helped at&t customers with and problems they may have had programming their internet service.  billing issues .and purchases of new internet and telephone service for there businesses .
good,Work culture is nice and competitive environment. Day to day changes in technology. challenging environment to work. Flexible timings and work from home facility.
good,The environment was stressful and complex which was fine for a while but it became too much for me to handle after almost a year. But if you like that type of environment then I say go for it.
good,"Work life balance great"
good,"Scrum every morning, fast-paced, heavy work load, like learning new tools, but panic and pushing for big project deadlines are humanly unrealistic.  Management is good, but cut-throat for some people and thankfully have not experienced that.  Workplace culture is good, but feels like a technical factory rather than a enjoyable workplace.  I don't mind it at all really, but extremely high-pressure to complete complicated tasks in a very short period of time is burning me out."
good,"Pretty slow location, so every customer should be a sale. Lots of time to learn and understand what you need to sale properly. Sometimes it is boring but you make the most of it."
good,"I enjoy working for AT&T, stay very busy (and I enjoy being busy), while learning new technologies.  As a contractor, we do not receive any benefits, or paid time-off."
good,"At&t is a large company.  Secure job, but easy to feel like just a number.  They offer great benefits and opportunities to advance.  This is the opposite of small town feel.  If you can deal with that then this a great place to work."
good,"At&t was a great place to work initially when the customer service was a top priority. Through the years the customer service level and quality has declined to say the least, things that happen in customer service now would not have EVER happen years ago."
good,"It is honestly a solid job if you dont want anything too demanding.  I worked for Spring Mobile, so I cannot speak for other retailers, but before i left, they raised their expectations of us, but offered more punishment as opposed to more rewards regarding meeting their new standards.  Hopefully they have leveled out since I left."
good,AT&T is a great place to work. They encourage and embrace flexibility and work life balance. Management in my department was not the best and could use a refresh of leadership.
good,At&t is a great company. I unfortunately had bad management. But that was just my location I was at. There is better management at other locations. overall the benefits from this company was great. And for me just to be part time the pay was excellent.
good,"pays well for a part time job, can get stressful having so many products to sell, good benefits really great discounts, fun to work for sometimes, if you are not motivated to sell then this may not be the job for you"
good,"Meeting start at the time that is scheduled, after 30 minutes of the meeting i start out day driving out to my first job, after that i will continue picking up jobs until the load for the day is cleared taking my hour lunch where i deemed necessary, i work alone throughout the day with not a lot of supervision. "
good,"AT&T is a competitive environment which has a lot of forward momentum."
good,Great company to work for. Wish hourly rates for sales reps where more competitive to other companies. Fast paced and upbeat working environment. Compensation was unfortunately always changing for my sales  team. Hard for them to get use to a comp plan that benefited them.
good,"Pay is good, lots of ways to bonus, sometimes there is alot of overtime sometimes there is none so if you depend on overtime may not be the job for you. As long as you show up for work usually you wont get terminated. Easy to move up if you want. Only thing that isnt great is that some of management really shouldnt be in management and the culture is sometimes biased."
good,Was a great experience to the world of sales as it was my first sales job it was an easygoing pace that had many obstacles that I was able to learn how to overcome because of how great the management was in training
good,"usually as soon as you log in you are busy, customers seem to have been waiting a long time but they only been in cue for a few seconds/ I learned that if you treat them with respect & kindness it kind of defuse any situation. I learned also that everyone is different & that patience really is a virtue. We were able to decorate our cubicles & have personal pictures up. Great place to work."
good,"After a 3 week traing course, you will be assigned a shift. You have weekly goals to meet as an individual and a team. Not all inbound calls go smoothly. You need quick resolution skills under pressure and to solve the customers issue."
good,"This is a great place to grow in your career. Plenty of training opportunities and a great work culture. Tough schedule working four 10 hour shifts, but great to have three consecutive days off."
good,Currently job security in low and work life balance is not equal.  The company is solid and a very strong financial company is going majors changes again and we are not sure if our jobs are secure.
good,"Overall good, periodic training from Higher Tecnical Team on new skills, good work life balance, transparency in management discussion, few people are not good, but most of them are very good."
good,Working for a satellite company takes patience and humility. Customer interactions could differ so easily. You had to adapt to each situation and get the job done.
good,"This company had an excellent pay structure and merit system. While I was pleased with compensation, I had very little scheduling flexibility and  grace was extended for minor time infractions. I do not regret working for this company but once my contract ended I didn't miss working for this company."
good,"Great experience working for a very large and fast pace company. Through the years working with this company, they have kept up with all the changes in the world with electronics, wireless, and entertainment."
good,"work like a robot with good pay and benefits, alot of repetition and chances to move up in the company but not in all states. this company is going through alot of lay offs so i would hold off until 2020 ."
good,"AT&T provides training and encourages employees to continue to grow in new and different areas but have found it is very difficult to get promoted or move within the company for new opportunities and growth.  "
good,"Surprisingly agile and willing to use new technology, but hamstrings devs with time recording, PM duties and red tape like most big companies seem to do. Incredibly surprised (pleasantly) that they allow remote workers."
good,"Actually a local retailer but very serious about keeping a good reputation. Benefits were great, office was in an even better location. Very easy to move up within the company."
good,"Have what it takes to work at Veterans Home Care? Ready for a challenge? We are looking for a dynamic and enthusiastic Human Resources professional with experience in a fast-paced work environment, employee files, exceptional customer service and an eye for detail. If you are passionate about HR and love the details, this is your chance to work hand in hand with the Director of Human Resources and help build the HR foundation for a medium sized business whose focus is serving veterans."
good,Supported the teams upgrading to 3G networks for a 13 state region. Updated analysis to determine when to request more telephone number blocks be assigned to the company.
good,"Overall, a good place to work.   Very focused on profit, too many chiefs trying to lead the way. Only means of advancement is through management.  Craft people are almost all union.  Good job security and in general you have a lot of freedom to just go do your job."
good,I enjoyed my time with att.  A typical day at work was busy.  The hardest part of the job was getting the different departments to work together as a team for the customer.
good,Fun and fast pace. They micro manage to a point that you feel like you are being watched over. But managment was helpful and curious. We had lots of parties.
good,AT&T is a great company to work for but it all depends on the department you are part of. Benefits are good but they do require long hours. Many would love to retire with the company but sadly in certain areas there is just no room to grow.
good,training was provided in timely manor.  Equipment was out of date and never calibrated.  Daily directions were clear.  High pressure environment.  customers were not the number one priority.
good,"Great company to advance in, but the company consumes your life. You have no time for anything but work. The pay and opportunity is amazing, only down side to the pay is that its commission only, so some days you could work the whole day and walk away with nothing to show for."
good,"The longer I stayed with this company, the more the associates were pushed to sell, sell, sell!  I have always been successful with the philosophy of ""If you provide the best customer care, people will buy your product...and send their family and friends to buy your product."""
good,"Salary and career advancement opportunities were very good, but burn out was commonplace due to lack of work life balance. The number of PTO days allowed were generous, but never used more than have due to ""needs of the business"". Leadership frequently changed direction so it was difficult to develop and execute on mid-range goals."
good,"This is a great place to start your career. The pay and benefits are great. Diverse environment , lots of potential to expand if you are willing to relocate to where the job is."
good,"Unreal expectations, very micro managed, great pay and benefits, zero work life balance, almost zero opportunity for advancement, great training, great comradery, overall great experience for a few years but just wouldn't make being a wire technician my career, day to day the workplace steady changes/ not stagnant at all"
good,"Wonderful management team, go out of their way to get you promoted and make sure you are happy and productive. Learned about a lot of large scale enterprise practices, and got a feel for what it is like working for a very large corporation. Pros and Cons in both."
good,Got paid salary which is horrible because as a manager I almost got paid less per hour than what I was making as an assistant manager. Learned my lesson and never made that mistake again.
good,"Took calls from installers to help get the customer's dish on. Took payments over the phones, helped resolve customers issues."
good,"I usually work 8 or more hours depending on how long it took, learned how to work with all phones.Helping set up accounts and trouble shooting phones working on tablets to get our transactions done."
good,"This company was an okay company to work for.  The work/life balance was not very good.  ATT had shifts bid every 6 months or so.  Never a guarantee your going to get a good shift even if you have seniority.  The benefits were great in the fact   you get a percentage off bills with them, insurance was great and some help.  Another stress would be your stats and making sure you kept them up or else you would be fired."
good,"Good company to work for, just not much growth potential. Great Benefits, but could be better at employee moral building. Management for the most part is Great!"
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for if you are planning to do all that you can to advance.  With this company you have to enter in with the mentality that you are making friends to advance.  If you play the part, kiss up to the right people, stand out, and work hard you will advance.  I was with the company for nine years and my whole department was laid off.  Those that did what I mentioned above were salvaged and moved to different departments.  All the others were given the opportunity to apply for different jobs within AT&T and only a few out of 25+ people were hired on."
good,"great place to work  - no job security ...churn some  jobs have flex "
good,i was treated better back when i was a bargained employee technician. then promoted to management. I should have stayed on as a technician. there is no benefit to becoming a manger. you are treated worse and pay a lot more for all your benefits.
good,It is an okay place to work I worked there for 17 years and still would be there if they had not downsized our department. the benefit s package is the best available
good,I started right when DirecTv was Bought by ATT. The Benefits where amazing and the discount was great. I don't like how it seemed like there was a head hunt and a lot of good people have been let go. I also don't like the Preference based scheduling that changes constantly. You can get your perfect schedule then lose it the next month. Makes for a stressful work and private life balance.
good,"I love my job, I am just looking for a part time job. I refer people to this job. I would love to have more overtime and not as much time. The only issue I see is inconsistency in managers. My current manager is amazing"
good,"Although the money is excellent, the pressure can be too much. You have to have the right management around you to be successful and that is sometimes hard to find. The managers do not teach, they only focus on the few that can sell and pressure them to carry the store."
good,I have had a good experience working at AT&T.  Although I have not experienced the progression in my career that I initially would have expected I have enjoyed the time working here.
good,"Pay as a manager was subpar, bonuses and commission could be better. Members of upper management were very tacky in the acquisitions of other stores in the area terminating managers who were leaders not only as managers but also the strongest sales people."
good,"AT&T can be a great place to work. The benefits are good and you can learn a lot. There isn't much room for advancement any more and the management could be good or bad depending on who you get. You will some times work a lot of over time, but other days you may get off work early because of the work load."
good,"At&t is a very well paying company and they provide good benefits to employees who are full time.  The company's weakness is in management and their ability to adjust any rules to any end they see fit.  Co-workers become like family and are the main reason people enjoy working there, everyone seems to help one another in most stores/locations."
good,"AT&T was a great place to work in my youth, it taught me many things, I met many people and grew so much as a person. However, it had many factors that made it a stressful place to work. Long hours, no personal life at times, and often time a stressful environment at work. However, that comes with almost any 9-5 job. My hours were more like 9-9 but same concept. It paid well and I benefited greatly from working there so I have no regrets and definitely encourage others to work there also, but only if you are driven to make money, earn commissions and out sell your coworkers. Otherwise you will likely not last long in this business."
good,good place to work but as a contractor it is not secure. the culture is good. They allowed working virtual which was a great benefit for me and my family.
good,"it was a very interesting experience."
good,Excellent benefits and pay but demanding work conditions. Not much of a work life balance. The company sent too many jobs oversees. The company downsized.
good,"While the division in which I worked was relocated to Syracuse, NY, while it was here, it was a well liked location by the roughly 800 employees which were stationed there."
good,"There isn't much pressure at this job, but there also isn't a high chance of advancement.  Management is ok, and the schedule isn't too much.  Overall, it's a 7 out of 10 as far as a job/career."
good,"I loved working for at&t until union jobs got cut by the 100s replaced by ""management"" jobs performing the same functions getting paid half of the salary and less benefits"
good,If you like working remote then you would like working for AT&T.  Have to be independent and take initiative to train yourself. AT&T has lots of different tools and processes that you have to teach yourself.
good,"AT&T was great , I have learned so much about customer satisfaction and the value of putting the customer first. Also how to be a leader in the business."
good,This was the best job I've had in my life. I never thought that this company would close down after working here for a decade. Benefits was awesome. We had union. Everyone had the same opportunity.
good,"This was a great way to learn how everything in a phone company worked, I started as an installer, I was trained on how to install a drop, an interface, jacks and how to climb telephone poles. "
good,Company did really great things for employees prior to being bought out. I liked having an onsite cafeteria and gym. We also had a quiet room to take naps on our breaks.
good,"AT&T was purchased by Comcast in 2002 and before this take over it was a great company very child friendly and pro family, I had the best training with company."
good,Ok place to work.  Exposure to new learning opportunities.  Due to continual reorganizing the exact path forward is at times muddled.
good,great environment. love working here.  Have to work there to appreciate the environment. great pay great benefits . overtime available if you want it . You will do great as long as try
good,A good company in which to work for overall pay and benefits. Hours can be long and work /life balance takes a back seat to the viability of the business.
good,"The people you work with are great, but when it comes to work/home life it can be a bit of stretch to get off if you have time to take and management approves it."
good,Working at ATT has provided me great knowledge of working in an office setting. The managers are supportive and believe in the employee not only succeeding in the office but also in life.
good,Working at ATT allowed me to get a deeper understanding of the inner-workings of such large company that is a revolutionary market leader in nearly every sector it does business in. Strong brand name
good,"Improved upon patience, as well as expanded on my ability to overcome many challenges with problem solving for customers. Working in a fast pace environment taught me to ensure all my work was up to standards, leaving the company, and consumer satisfied"
good,"good hours to work from, and fun culture with co-workers . managers are also pretty laid back and cool, not micro managing employees. People were willing to help and explain things."
good,a typical day at my job is helping people achieve their goal as well as exceed company expectations as well as trying to continue to be an asset
good,It was a really great job AT&T helped broaden my skills in the IT and the  Mobile world  the workplace and culture was easy to learn and all of the staff was very friendly
good,This job was excellent when it was DIRECTV.  After the merger into AT&T my job was relocated to King of Prussia Pennsylvania.  I chose not to relocate.
good,The management is very strict and everything must be done perfectly. There is a lot of micro management and since it is a union companion there are many rules. Some which benefit you greatly and some that kinda limits you.  Pays a decent amount for a none college job.
good,"Typical workday visit stores, set meetings with District and Store Managers. Set Sales goals. Train management. Working with Small Biz team to increase penetration"
good,like any place you work it all depends on the people you get employed with and how stressful or how fun days can be depending on them
good,"The technical aspects of the job were not bad at all, with the only stressful factor being we were required and pressured to sell AT&T's U-verse."
good,Work for AT&T for 10 years and none of that time was taken into account when the lat offs come. Managers with less time got to keep their jobs while others where let go.
good,"Gym, Cafe, Doctor on site, Tech lab-computers available for personal use. The site is wonderful. With switching to att a lot of things have changed with DTV that aren't that great for the employees. benefits changed, pay changed, as well as others."
good,"Prior to working here I had no skill in selling but quickly learned how to present products and services as ""solutions"". Sounds cliche but i will forever be grateful for the opportunity and knowledge i gained working here. If your into sales or business and consider yourself a go-getter this is a great place to work and make a name for yourself. However, if you aren't comfortable with being pressured into selling and meeting your goals this might not work for you. You have to really be a high performer in order to get promoted. All in all great company to work for."
good,too much work.. they use good technologies..too many Indians.. Vendors suck the juice out of contractors. people hate that. over all I didn't like it
good,"typical call center environment, low pay, good support staff and management. selling was required which is difficult being mostly tech support type calls."
good,Answer incoming calls about phone accounts and payments/ Assist customer with their accounts by adding/deleting service. Taking payment over the phone.
good,"Fast paced call center environment, very large facility which includes a work-out room, cafeteria and multiple break-rooms.  Good insurance benefits and nice annual health fair provided on site."
good,"With contracting and budget cuts your job is always at risk. Great people and culture. "
good,Good Company to work for as long as you do not work in I.T.  Company is in the process of moving several IT organizations to offshore companies (India).
good,"It is a good company for folks looking for entry level positions.  The pay is decent and compensation is a bonus.  However, when looking to further your career more professionally, it lacks."
good,"Great company, great brand, they pay well and they expect you to work hard for it (not a difficult concept).  I had a few different roles here, and in the retail stores the work /life balance is terrible, but its retail, so what do you expect?  The call center role has a better work/life balance but the fear of the center closing is real every day, and came to fruition with my center closing.  Lots of opportunity for advancement, mainly if you are willing to relocate.  Tuition reimbursement is great, discounts on services too."
good,"good , life,work,balance and benefits"
good,"The pay and benefits are great, especially compared to other jobs within the field. Employees make a decent salary as well as commision. cellular service, and home services are half-off, which is generous. "
good,"sell, sell, and sell...cellphones, tablets, rate plans, accessories, tv service, landlines, internet and alarm systems. plenty where to get paid from."
good,This job is no longer Ava in the area.  Overall I loved my job here and wanted to go to work every day. Really hate it's now closed. All management was easy to work with and it was a fun environment
good,Learned alot about communicating. Call centers are fast paced. I definitely learned to budget my time. Need a little support from management.
good,I like working there just no advancement opportunities currently are laying off guys and I want to make sure I'm not one of them. I'm a good employee never been late and do not call off
good,"With this company I have learned a significant amount in the past year. I enjoy my job and enjoy those that I work with. We have been through several different managers in the past year, as well as employees. The store I currently work in is a level 1 store and does not have as much foot traffic as a level 2 or 3 store. It can be fun, frustrating, and awarding all at once."
good,The company encourages you to worker smarter and not harder and provides many opportunities to learn new skills. The co-workers are some of the best I have ever seen!
good,"Hard working team"
good,Senior Management has no concern for frontline employees and management. Local management is caring and understanding.  Expectations are often unrealistic.
good,"It is a fun, team atmosphere to be in. The training is extensive, and on going. "
good,tough but rewarding place to work - not for the faint of heart - great expectations for employees and can be high pressure in some cases
good,AT&T is a good place to work for a young person or some one with no family. the pay is good and the co workers are great people. wrok day hours change every day.
good,"My idea of a productive and fun workplace is one in which all employees work well and compliment each other.  When the sales team and management team work as a unit, the work is far more fun and the customers have more confidence in what we are selling.  Each chain is only as strong as the weakest link though so when you have an employee who ""shirks"" duty it's a turn off for the customer and takes credibility away from the sales team."
good,"Great team atmosphere, everyone works together to succeed.  Flexible work hours. Most career growth is located in Atlanta or Dallas, other locations are satellite offices. Relocation opportunities."
good,"This company is in a constant state of change, as it's a leader in telecommunications and technology. I love being on the front lines of introducing new technologies to our customers and becoming knowledgeable about the technologies that shape our lives. Our company continues to keep people connected to what matters most."
good,AT&T is a good company and productive to work in with good skills to learn. Every month releases with tight timelines are good to learn.Overall its good.
good,great way to learn how to interact with different types of customers and provide the best service. Employees always get equal opportunities within the company.
good,Limited opps for management advancement. Overall this is still a great company to work for. At&t has great benefits for everyone. They also have a very diverse work base.
good,Depending on he organization you are in will determine the culture. There is a lot of opportunity for knowledge growth. A lot of the managers do not change positions and it takes a long time to move up.
good,"AT&T is a very good company, however because of it is a big company, there's also an excess of management levels. Also offshore teams which are supposed to take some workload aren't accomplishing their goals and work is kept on few accountable people."
good,"The benefits keep me here. The insurance is great and affordable. They are paying for my college!  I just wish the compensation did not continue to decrease, but I do see the benefits/comp as a package deal. AS far as retail goes, it is the best, easiest, least stress, sales position you can get. The job is not hard, but you will deal with your share of jerks. Management is good, and just remember, it's not what but who you know if you want to advance."
good,Fun to work with the people you see everyday but upper leadership is crowded with people that were inherited from the old T company that are out of touch with the technology they manage or are leaders of.
good,Providing excellent service to the customer is paramount here.  Working for AT&T teaches one to look beyond just technology.  The speed at which technology changes is fascinating.  Keeping up with all the changes is definitely one of the most challenging parts of the job.  Providing stellar service to the customer is the best part of the job.
good,"I appreciate the opportunity to try and learn a new trade, however it was not meant to be.  Hard job, you do get to meet fantastic people though and that can be great.  Managers try to do a good job but could use some training on delivery."
good,IT work for dsl network home or business . Effectively served as IT for complex business networks with high demand customers. Isolated  the network or hardware problem to expedite a fast answer to customer.
good,"This was a very nice job.  There were various duties, not all the same every day.  These duties included monitoring the mainframe, participating in various technical support groups, and dispatching appropriate technicians to solve node failures."
good,Good place to work and good people to work with and not a lot of stress. they do have a problem with you taking time off for family issues and have a pretty flexible work schedule. the drive to work is long for some people because it is not centrally located to tampa the downtown area
good,Good place to work. Pay is good when you factor in commission. If the store is short staffed you can expect to work open to close on your own a few days a week.
good,"Friendly co workers, stayed busy on a normal basis which I like. Good benefits and plenty of room for growth. hardest part of job was working every weekend and working lots of evening shifts."
good,learn how to become better while operating computer and speaking handling customer need while in live conference. also learned how to solve issue in a nice positive manner and work out best resolutions.
good,"The typical work-day would be to arrive early, begin Operational activities and prepare for the sales day. Much of the day would involve nearly non-stop customer service and problem solving of various kinds whether on phones, laptops or tablets."
good,"The company is one of the best in giving the best support for customers satisfaction, and with the continued system improvement for best results, Agents, Trainers, Supervisors and all the staff will work together as one team and perform better most specially if every employee's achievements will not only be acknowledged but also they get the right compensation and incentives that they deserve in such a way that they will stay with the company and grow in all aspects that will benefit both the employee and the employer resulting to satisfied and happy customers."
good,"Great place to learn new skills, company going through many changes. Could use a culture boost. I worked as a Level 2 Helpdesk Agent. Pay was low balled for the industry."
good,"- DirecTV recently acquired by AT&T"
good,"I was only there for six months, but liked the people and the atmosphere"
good,"Hours can be a little hectic of course because it is retail but the sales compensation, health benefits and available discounts make it worthwhile. Employee discounts on services and products are awesome."
good,I enjoyed some parts of the 20 years that I worked for at&t but was at least threatened with layoffs twice per year through the entire time that I was with them.
good,"AT&T is a great company, awesome benefits, as well as competitive pay. The EMO discount great, and the store always has a great culture. Teamwork and success go great within this company."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,AT&T is a great place to work. Very challenging and rewarding with benefits. Management is great to work with and the company has a awesome work culture.
good,"Large company so the paycheck is always on-time.  Daily routine is always reactionary.  Hardest part of the job is learning all the diverse systems.  Depending on department and role, there are lots of long-term folks that often show you how something is done properly.  I've learned over the years to treat others always professionally even if they do not return the favor and then, always to keep every piece of documentation and email to document your actions and those of management."
good,"A typical day at work would start off by catching up on new promotions, changes to procedures and/or new equipment to demo. Next we would hit the sales floor, taking turns helping customers, selling solutions and advising customers on policies or how to deal with tech issues. End of day, put away display inventory, count drawers and clean. "
good,AT&T has so many stores and so many ways to move up in the company but it depends on the store you work at and your manager. you get good pay not so good benefits and cop that is hard to hit. employees at any store work like a family. you see your emps more then your family.
good,"AT&T as a company is a pretty good place to work. My coworkers were awesome, management was pretty decent most of the time, benefits are GREAT, and compensation's pretty good. "
good,"Good company, bad management. don't do what they say."
good,"-Developing others and our people are what makes any company successful"
good,Strong leadership and direction. Intense focus on improving yourself and offering online tools to help you in that pursuit of redeveloping yourself.
good,"Job consists of visiting stores such as Best Buy, Costco and Target.  Ensure sales associates are trained and are comfortable selling Wireless, Directv, and Digital Life."
good,"It was an easy to work for company as a provisioner.  The work is difficult, but the experience invaluable.  Salary and benefits were standard everywhere."
good,"Speaking with a customers on a daily basis, getting the know them in all aspects of their lives to give the best solutions for work and home.  Wasn't just about mobile communications but also how to use home entertainment services on the go.  Management team was good at observing our interactions to help develop our skills, however was looking for more leadership development so I could help others.  The hardest part of the job was helping customers with account issues that needed outside store help such as customer care or account services.  Often their was a lack of empathy from care to find solutions for customers another than what the system would say.  Definitely talking to customers was the best part.  Such a wide range to people to meet like the elderly who only needs a flip phone or watch old TV shows and doesn't know what ""wee-fee"" is, to those who ""know it all"" what's the processor speed, do you guys have gigabit downloads yet, finding the right solution for everyone."
good,"I am in Door to door sales but I am disabled and cannot do job per doctors and my department denied my accommodations.They did offer me a 60 day job search but there has not been anything posted that I can apply for so in 21 days I will be terminated. If I was not disabled this is a great company with great people. There is just nothing they can offer me. All I need is a desk job I am just unable to walk 8 hrs a day because I have Rheumatoid Arthritis. "
good,Great company with terrible managers.  Even worse was the District Manager. She was a tyrant that did not care if one of your family members was sick. She couldn't care less if you were on your death bed.  She just wanted results.  If you were successful she liked you but if for some reason you fell from grace as a sales person she made sure to make your life miserable.
good,Great pay but job security is kind of shaky. Too much work but not enough time in day. More focused on numbers than customer service.
good,"I got there and was not stop action for the rest of the day with sales; troubleshooting, business analyst, etc. Customer service is much more than just answering calls. Is connecting with te customer and solve problems. At&t gave much high quality profesional training to be successful on all. Engaging award system and a wonderful culture."
good,"Responsible for new and existing customers to upgrade from ATM, to Frame Relay and IP as. IP was the future of all telecom."
good,"aprender conforme se trabaja, exelente acogida del personal y etimacion general"
good,"AT&T has tons of benefits and allows you to really learn the sales floor. The problem is the hours are random, you typically start off closing every shift (11:00am-8:30pm) leaving you no time to do much. The quota is completely location biased, its very hard to hit it if you are in a tough area of town. Hard work, but the pay is worth it, you must sell a ton and be knowledgeable on every product."
good,"AT&T offers a lot in terms of learning and career development.  They are a union based company which means that seniority determines your work schedule, a lot of times."
good,"Good client to work with. Biggest mobile network operator which makes software always on top with performance, TPS and security."
good,"DTV/AT&T is one of the best places to work in America. They offer competitive wages and extremely good benefits. The hardest part of the job is overcoming objections from the customer themselves. I worked retention, last line of defense."
good,"Typical Day : Would be to install and maintain One of the world largest networks and provide excellent customer service for about 2-6 customers daily"
good,"Very good place to work. Sales is tough and there is no such thing as a 'secure' job so do your best everyday. Don't take any sale for granted. You will be fired if you don't perform, and there are tons of people willing to fill your vacant spot."
good,I worked for a third party AT&T called advanced communications for a year. They are a business that is constantly growing and as they learn to communicate they will become an even better organization. I love the opportunity to get commission and be competitive.
good,Benefits are great. Quality of service has changed from customer friendly and focused to pay for performance and production only.
good,Since I Left I heard that work -life balance is improving from the top down. Compensation was good for the area I was in. Hardest part is getting buy in on new ideas and management methods. Most of the people you work with are 1st class people as for as peers and support. Middle management needs some work but Upper management were dead on most of the time. You will do a lot to CYA but if you cover your boss raises are good if they don't get blindsided during the year.
good,"Overall, the company is good. Especially the co-workers make it all worth while. The job since adding on Directv has put a strain on technicians."
good,"great work and training experiences.  Excess Managerial pressure attempting to measure productivity and efficiency as if we were package handlers, assembly line workers. Our job functions did not translate to this type of measurement tool but they continue to use it."
good,"Typical day at work is busy, and you get to meet new people every day."
good,Gained a lot of sales experience and quality customer experience. Learned a lot about technology and providing hands-on experience with tech products to consumers.
good,"Good work environment"
good,"Good company to grow within, very hard to get into other positions but I feel I was taught a lot valuable skills within the position I held."
good,AT & T has a strong org chart and it is followed very well.  There are managers with many years in the company that can supply a new recruit with proper training.
good,good place to work. but need more training before placing employees on the floor. I think they should have a longer training with a longer lunch break.
good,The work was very interesting and challenging. I enjoyed working with the people they are hands off and let you complete your job. The managers support and appreciate the work you do.
good,"There isn't much to say about AT&T just that working for the company, ill tell you that it is a very stressful job working at least 40-50 hours a week 1 hour lunch every day and the pay is very good and full benefits only negative thing is how much they push you to sell above and beyond to the point where you'll have nightmares about not selling, customers are usually friendly and want to buy just  management wants you to sell more then you possibly can"
good,take calls from angry customers and have to be able to calm customer take care of their needs and be able to establish a rapport with customer and satisfy them to be able to get a good survey from them the surveys determine your stats have to maintain 100% attainment meaning the customers have to like you and be willing to recommend the services
good,"Required rep to shove products down customers throats, basically making them (the customer) mad when they were just calling with a billing inquiry. And then holding representative accountable for customer satisfaction."
good,"took inbound calls, provided technical, billing and general customer service issues. provided general programming sales suggestions"
good,"The ability to work with capable, intelligent people is what makes work great.  Additionally, being able to create something from nothing is always rewarding."
good,"	Provided assistance to wireless customers in handling and resolving their device, plan, and billing issues."
good,AT&T is always moving and trying to improve. I recently attended an iDAS installation audit with our C&E guys. It was interesting to see that the C&E guys didn't meet all the requirement and why.
good,I was package pick up I would pick up new shipments for the store on the docks keep docks clean in order and help sales saport
good,very fun enviroment to learn. love keeping up with latest technology and teaching new employees. most of all making sure customer needs are met.
good,"Fast pace, always changing to move with technology.  Company makes every effort to stay current and move their products into the future."
good,"Working independently is a good perk of the job. Being able to organize and prepare my 'office' (truck) and take on the project (customer order) gives a real good feeling of responsibility for someones happiness similar to giving someone a holiday gift. Finishing a job, cleaning up, and delivering the speech of how the entire entertainment system function for the customer in laymens terms is a good job routine to enjoy after you have sweated in the attic, repaired wiring and giving life to the system is a day of success. The pay is decent."
good,run team to make sure all installs and service issues are taken care of. while keeping inventory and cost under control. company takes care of employees
good,Fast pace enviroment with a huge amount of daily training. Ok at times but there are also times where it becomes a bit demanding. The benefits of working for At&t is the huge benefit package that is offered to their employees and their family values when it comes to their employees.
good,This job was a good job just working by yourself on a site could be dificult depending on the house and was still expected to get a certain amount done the co workers were helpful when they could help and the supervisor was the best ive ever hadsome people think a cable/satellite job is easy but it is far from it
good,"I enjoyed waking up in the morning talking to customers. Sometimes the job was stressful, but I knew how to manage the stress. I learned  so much about technology in 1 year and I won't ever forget what I learned from Directv. Some of my coworkers were fun to be around and very helpful. I recommend this company to everyone."
good,Spent 10 years here. Had some great times and made many good friends. Great training and support. People are awesome. Commissions are a little light for technology sales but the security is good.
good,"AT&T is a good place to work. There are lots of opportunities to learn new technologies. With the recent acquisition on Directv and expansion in Mexico, AT&T is solidly poised to beat its competition."
good,"I enjoyed that there was a strong possibility of me doing something different from day to day such as projects, training coworkers, along with my day to day tasks. Productivity and attendance driven work environment.  There was some office politics that you would expect in most corporate america settings. The company began consolidating a few years ago which lead to my office closing, me being laid off June 21, 2015, and eventually let go on October 9,2015. I would say the most enjoyable part of my 15 years of service would be my coworkers and all the knowledge I've gained working there."
good,"mostly work independent but occasional work with other employees. always training for new skills. great group of guys to work with. poor balance between work and life, company always came first."
good,"I think AT&T was a very good place to work, I did however prefer Cingular, before the merger. Call Centers and some people are a great fit. I am just not one of them. I don't enjoy trying to sell people things they don't need. The days were also incredibly long. You worked with a ton of people and only ever knew a handful. But, if you are not a College graduate and you can pass the test, you can definitely live on the salary they pay you. Especially if your spouse works there too, which a lot do. Also, I didn't like when managers, especially not your own, would give you hand signals to wrap it up and the poor person you are talking to has called at least 5 times with no help. I felt I should take the time to get his issue resolved, if not, he would be even more unhappy and nothing would have changed. Thankfully, this didn't happen too often and not by too many managers. Most of the managers were pretty understanding, but a couple caused a lot of problems. There is a difference between helping a customer and simply chit chatting. But, I left there after my husband passed away. After losing him, I just couldn't deal with it anymore."
good,I did a variety of different things on a daily basis.  The most enjoyable part was working along side my colleagues and developing a friendship.
good,"Depending on the year and location I changed from Sales rep to Asst. Manager to Sales Manager and back to Sales rep. Since the typical day changed drastically for me over 7 years I can give a general understanding. Day to day would include: Opening and closing procedures, checking in inventory and inventory counts, weekly meetings, sales tracking, customer follow up, 1 on 1 meetings with employee's, marketing, b2b sales, customer service interactions, troubleshooting, housekeeping, training on new products/services/advancements. I learned that I have a huge love for technology and all new products that advance life at home and in business. The management changed drastically over 7 years and some were great to work with and some were not. I have developed some of by closest friends through my coworkers and have a great relationship with them to this day. The hardest part of my job was turning a negative customer service interaction a customer had previously into a positive sale/interaction personally. The most enjoyable part of my job was turning that negative interaction into a positive one and getting some of my best sales and faithful customers!"
good,"It was a good opportunity working with the Line crew in Oakland. We started the day at 7:00 AM and on a normal day left at 3:00 PM. We at times had to come earlier and stay later if there was an emergency. I learn how to climb telephone poles and install fiber"
good,"DIRECTV is a very fast-paced working environment where you are constantly learning. There is no typical day, there are always new ways to do things and constant process revision to ensure that everything is working correctly and efficiently."
good,"The work place typically had a nice, relaxed atmosphere. I enjoyed the opportunity to help bring the community together with the technology that is offered through the services that at&t provide.  Building a customer market, rapport, and retention rate."
good,"Is was a very nice to place, everyone is helpful, and i was able to relocate."
good,Good place to work. Good for networking. Lots of internal organizations to join.It is also a great place to launch your career in life in IT.
good,"Great pay, great benefits, and I also had great hours. Didn't feel appreciated by the multi-billion dollar company though."
good,"Not much work life balance, its a retail job so you will not have the best hours starting off. 95% of the store works weekends. Benefits are great. Paid vacation, tuition reimbursement. There are many sales metrics to meet and management will be drill sergeants. If you perform and do the key behaviors you will be fine."
good,This job is an extremely huge high sales job. You constantly have sales goals that need to be met and if not then you have to change your whole plan as to what works for you and the customer. If you are good with a huge amount of stress and high end sales then this is the job for you. Most of the time you will work until 9;30 at night and for sure work on the weekends. Not a bad company to work for lots of money and incentives.
good,Meritocracy need to be reviewed which is lacking and take it forward. Overall good company in terms of standards and learning opportunities.
good,"A typical day at work started at 5:30 with running reports and checking emails. Being a multitask person is one of the things I learn while working for this company. It was a fast pace environment and constant deadlines to meet. The management team were very approachable with the co-workers seem to get along fairly well. The hardest part of the job could have been not completing all deadlines in a timely manner, but being a multi task person I never had the problem. The most enjoyable part was feeling good at the end of the work day knowing it was a productive day for me."
good,"a typical day at DirecTV is kinda of boring to type it out, but not know who you will meet or what can you learn for a casual conversation from a customer was what i looked forward to every day. I only go to see my co-works once a week for meeting and picking up inventory. i don't consider any part of what i did as hard, as a supervisor or a technician just another challenge to over come."
good,"The best part of the job is the pay and the benefits. Typical day can range anywhere from 8am thru 9pm. The job isn't very family friendly, but it is a great company that gives you room to advance."
good,"Strong team environment, made a lot personal/professional relationships during my contract. Peers willing to take the time to direct/communicate what the procedures are involving newly assigned task."
good,This was a really good job but I needed to go into a different direction.  Takes up a lot of time away from your family.  I liked the green time option though if it was slow they let you go home.  I think people start looking for that way too much.  God work environment nice people.
good,"when you sign up with them make sure you are completely decided on your schedule because once you have a schedule (part time / full time) they will not switch you to part time easily if you are currently full time, the requirements for switching would be either a medical reason or if you go to school full time. when you leave this corporation you will not be able to get hired again by Directv for that same position until after a year once you've left as I understand it from several of my coworkers."
good,My time at the AT&T call center seem to go by fast. Maybe because the job was so fast paced. My phone never stopped ringing. I like fast paced work environments. It makes the work day go by in a blink of an eye.
good,This is a good job if you are new to the workforce. High pressure and they will fire people at the drop of a hat. pay was decent. benefits so-so.
good,Provided excellent training opportunities to learn new skills and apply them to the job in a very productive but demanding schedule. Excellent lab facilities for testing software and tools for software development.
good,As an AT&T employee your taught how to access a customers home for proper installment of entertainment services. The proper way to run wiring. There are tech that you can reach out to when you have questions or road blocks.
good,"liked working with new customers and talking bout the offers,and benefits of att promotions and service.also working with customers to fix there devices."
good,"My morning starts with checking my company phone to see what type of job has been dispatch to me and what location.  I call the customer, introduce myself, and let them know that I will be the technician to perform their install or service call and approx. what time of my arrival.  "
good,"A day at AT&T is one that can change day to day. "
good,Fun place to work. Customer service driven. Great team environment.  Excellent training. Great compensation and incentive benefits.
good,Often times worked and closed the retail location alone. Great opportunity to help fulfill customers needs. Very rewarding.
good,"Awesome company to grow your career."
good,Open up the store and login to the system. Make sure everything is in stock and in its place. Management needed a little work. My coworkers were awesome. The hardest part is when the new iphones launch and it gets extremely busy for a while.
good,"A typical day at AT&T is very high paced and busy. I learned to work with people from different cultures and backgrounds. The management there are really focused on getting the job done. Therefore, co-workers tend to encourage each other to contribute in an effective way. I enjoy working with clients who embrace the mobile platform and love to keep up with emerging technologies."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work if you are looking to make good money in a fast pace environment. The high required sales goals are easily attained if you are driven and motivated. But, it is also very demanding and very stressful."
good,AT&T is an exciting company to work for. They definitely have good moral within the company. Best part of the job was being able to assist our customers and being able to make final decisions when assisting them.
good,"I learned a lot. Directv Latin was very good to their employees years ago.  I left in 2003 so I don't know about how it has changed.  Great culture, lots of integrity, that is very had to find nowadays for management. The people there worked hard and worked smart.  Also a trait not seen very much.  Not afraid to discuss, real discussion, not just repeating what senior management wants to hear."
good,Rapidly changing company in a competitive market.  A lot of changing happening due to pending merger with AT&T. Lot of opportunity but management is indecisive due to the pending merger.
good,"•	Established manager with a vast knowledge of telecommunications system principles and procedures.  "
good,"co-workers fun to be around"
good,Union which can suck in many ways. You can work at the slowest location in the world and really get payed as much if not more than the busyest location in the world. silly concept.
good,"Company has great benefits.  I work in an unsupervised position."
good,"AT&T is a strong company overall.  I have worked with a diverse group of individuals.  My typical day was a balance of back end paper work, sales, consulting current customers and developing new business leads.  The toughest part of the job is selling a diverse portfolio of products, many of which aren't related to each other.  The job is very fulfilling in the standpoint of being able to genuinely help people with their services and devices."
good,"I love coming into work everyday knowing you have a helpful team to work with. Management ran their daily tasks, resolved any customer escalations and coached all employees smoothly and efficiently. I mostly enjoyed interacting with customers and knowing I'm helping others connect to their world via technology. I have a passion for technology and it felt great when I would have customers coming back to specifically see me because they trusted my work."
good,My typical day at work consisted of overcoming many obstacles. Such challenges as how can I help the  customer. I learned a situation can always be helped and resolved. Management had a great helping hand and coworkers with important information. The hardest part of the job was being laid off. The most enjoyable was being able to achieve excellence.
good,"This was a great experience being employed here. Compensation was pretty good, and there was always ways to make more money in this position. I met great people in this workplace and I was always able to transfer my job if needed."
good,My typical days at work consist of setting daily goals and monthly goals in order for me to be successful.  I'm able to interact with my coworkers and customers everyday.  I'm also able to mentor my coworkers on subjects that has any gray area.
good,Started here as an Area Manager and advanced to Associate Director. Established and built the Licensing department into a smooth running machine.
good,"Overall good service/Motivated team setting."
good,Prepares orders by processing requests and supply orders; pulling materials; packing boxes; placing orders in delivery area.
good,Their Relocations/Transfer of billing Responsiblity department is open to serve their customers from 7am until 1am. It's a very face paced environment with an average of about 100 inbound calls a day per employee. It is great customer service experience for an entry-level employee because they are exposed to different facets of the telecommunications business.
good,"During the launch of the U-verse project, there was a shortage of techs and a large demand for the system. It wasn't uncommon for use to work 14 hour days for 12 days straight. The work was enjoyable however, and meeting the customers was a great part of every day. The system was technical, combining the technologies of fiber optic to copper, VOIP, coax, catV, twisted pair, and electrical. It required a broad knowledge of the infrastructure of data transmission in urban environments."
good,An abundance of new business opportunity made this work enjoyable.  It was interesting to design & produce industrial content to ensure craft production.  Being a privately owned small business the ability to respond to technology growth stymied the business growth
good,"job was enjoyable, could get be stressful at times, since you would have customers yell at you. other than that i really enjoyed the people there."
good,CIMS is the goal from the time you come in to the time you leave.  Plan to spend time beyond your schedule to complete work objectives.
good,"Laid back environment, team building activities, flexibility of my time and schedule was very accommodating with my position. I would recommend working in the HR department."
good,I was in charge of overseeing the operations of two communities that included but was not limited to sales creating contracts and administration duties.
good,"Great opportunities for advancement, team building and mentor other colleagues. Loved working with multiple disciplines; including EF&I vendors w/opportunities to go out in field to lead project teams and conduct MOP meetings for Central Office Equipment Installation."
good,Do not apply here unless you're a kid and your attracted by a little bit of money.  You are better off at a salary job.  Stay away from this commission structure because it changes way too fast and way to often.
good,They will work you to the bone but pay you well for it. Some of the best benefits Ive had and by far the most time I've ever spent at a job. 21 days straight without a day off can get to a person. But the paychecks were certainly nice.
good,"The company and it's leadership have provided me with opportunities for my professional growth. A chance to get more knowledge in the advancement in digital TV, high speed Internet and voice services, among other products. It's also nice to be able to share that information with all types of customers. They actually do appreciate being connected to the advancement of technology. I think the hardest part of the job is, there are times when you need more time to finish up a job then what's allocated. Me as well as the customer likes it when you can fix the problem the first time, verses a temporary fix because you are rushing so you don't go over the allowed time. That becomes very frustrating at times, especially when you want to do it right the first time and it should be the last."
good,Working for AT&T offers a great opportunity to work with innovative technology and top-rated professionals and dedicated colleagues.
good,You can make a good amount of money for a retail job.  Things started off great but then they cut pay and increased job responsibilities and products to sell.
good,"This was the best job I ever had! The leadership, culture and general culture was fantastic! Since it was bought by Citibank, it is now just like any other large corporation with good and bad points. Still a pretty good place to work though."
good,Fast paced work environment. Always in a position to learn new technology. rewarding
good,"A typical day at work is great energetic place to work. Learning and meeting new customers each day which is the most enjoyable part of the job. Also, having the opportunity to work with others as my peers is great because it allows each us to help one another with meeting daily goals."
good,"A pretty good company to work for. They allowed me to learn various aspects of the mobile network, in addition to providing service to a wide customer base."
good,"Was able to lead a group to grow strategic services.  "
good,"Typical day at work involved pricing stock, managing stock, customer interaction, up-selling products to meet the needs of customers, interaction with different computer systems, cash handling, etc. "
good,"gud work environment"
good,Overall a decent place to work but the benefits and pay scales are terrible.
good,Good pay and company but the commission structure keeps changing for the benefit of ATT and we have been making less but selling more. the vacation time and medical is great. Fun work place. Management and sells reps are on a different page. I still work here. I dont feel there are many opportunities in moving up in the company.
good,It was a long day answering calls for billing and ordering. It was an ok job
good,"good place to work."
good,"AT&T (formely BellSouth) started out as ""a great place to work"".  However, over time, like many other companies, their focus has changed to ""only"" the bottom line.  for the most part, advancement is all about being in the right place at the right time and depending on the organization, your work hours could totally overlap  and overtake your personal life."
good,Very challenging and productive. I've gained a lot of experience from my first job.
good,"Every customer you meet has a different situation or issues. You have to be able to talk to people, calm them down if need be, and be able to answer all there questions."
good,"I started as a PT employee and became a Manager Trainer. I really enjoyed the job and my customers. Working 9 - 9, 3 or 4 times per week simply wore me out."
good,I enjoyed the work environment and my coworkers. The call center was fast past but their  was always someone their to assist you if needed. The hardest part of the job was the irrate customers. The most enjoyable was satisfying the customer and keeping their business.
good,"drive company truck, co-workers where very nice we where like a family, most enjoyable part of job was working alone, management was fair, I learned great customer service, provide quality service. There was not a hard part of the job for me because I enjoyed doing the work."
good,AT&T pays well but at times will won't more from the employee that is possible.  This job is like most jobs it has it pros and cons but is an overall good place to work.
good,"this job basically didn't not allow for much personal time, they only offered full time positions and if you were not about Direct Tv you would not do well in the company. A typical work day consist of answering incoming calls, pitching products based on customer needs and opening new customer accounts. I learned how to sell , and how to manage my call time efficiently. Hardest part of the job was meeting weekly goals since every call, even those you had no control over counted against you. Most enjoyable part of the job was the incentives, the contests and raffles."
good,"answering back to back calls, getting yelled, unable to make customers fully happy. To breathe and not take things personally. Management was very supportive. Co-workers helped with stress. Not being able to make everyone happy. Breaks"
good,Great pay but very stressful environment. Enjoyed satisfying customers but always afraid of job security.
good,"The job was  very interesting and as a 411 operator,my responsibilities were to assist customers within the 50 states. The hardest part about this company was the layoff of 124 employers including myself. The call volumes in the Georgia region decreased due to land-lines becoming more and more obsolete."
good,Working for AT&T is a great experience but the days are slow and due to low traffic I often have nothing to do.
good,"A lot of talents, good strategy, but a lot of legacy too. Wireless is doing better, you need to be in the right part of the company."
good,"DirecTv was a great company to work for. I made a lot of money and the company takes care of its workers for the most part. There are many perks which make it difficult to leave.  At my site there were 110 technicians and probably 90 of them were unhappy/frustrated and or wanting to leave their job. The reason people stick around is because the money is good and getting a company van, free cable, gas card, bonuses, paid vacation, 401k plus all benefits, training pay, drivetime pay, OJT pay,custom labor incentive pay, all are included making it difficult to leave or for other companies to match. Salary for a fast experienced tech is between 70-100,000$ a year, however you fight for every dollar and some days you make nothing...(piecework). There is more frustration and adversity in this job than any other, but if you can ignore a lot of that, stay calm, flexible and have a spouse who doesn't mind never seeing you, then DirecTV is right up your alley."
good,Telecommute was outstanding.  Can actually have a life outside of AT&T.
good,"this is a good place to work. there are a few holes in the structure as with any company, but overall, fair to employees for the most part due to union."
good,Selling products and services to customers to meet our sales. Fast paced work when there are many different customers with specific needs. Learned how to be competitive and still work as a team. Had an amazing team but meeting sales at times was a challenge due to cut hours.
good,"Calling Customers or getting calls from customers. 70 calls per day. Every customer is not the same. I enjoy my job "
good,"att is a good place to work, has its ups and downs.  the pay and benefits are good, but sometimes does not make up for the customers that you deal with.  there is ability to advance into management but not to move into other hourly jobs in the region"
good,Laid me off after buying my company.jlbhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
good,Team work was always supported .Project work guidelines were timely received .
good,"AT&T is a great place to start a career in the wireless industry, and will teach you a great deal about excellent customer service."
good,Used to be a great place to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the majority of people.
good,"Job assignments vary. Geographically dispersed teams require the use of collaborative communication tools.  Emphasis on field support with ride alongs for technicians.  Significant discipline in project management. Company is working to change culture to compete with ""start up"" culture.  Signficant employee and customer loyalty."
good,"As a service technician (not Prem Tech) ,I learned a great deal about the outside plant. I enjoyed having the freedoms of being outside. The  copper plant was in need of repair,however, once you understood how things functioned it got easier over time. there was always a new aspect of troubleshooting you had to learn. Electronic parts, setting up routers,fixing opens, short, etc., ever cable lengths that would could exceed several blocks or several miles. Overall descent work that can be taxing on the body as one gets older."
good,"With AT&T Corporate, they train you extremely well, and prepare you for when you actually go live. They are focused mainly on customer service, and the results from your customers survey's. Promotions do take a long time thus, if you want to be with them long term know everything you do is taken into account for any transfers, promotions, etc. All sales reps are covered by the C.W.A (Communication Workers of America) which is your union. Fair job, great compensation. However forget about any vacation until a year of employment."
good,"My day starts with inbound tech support calls for a variety of AT&T  products and services,as the day progresses I then handle customer service calls primarily billing concerns.The biggest challenge is explaining the usage and benefits of current plans and devices."
good,"We were a collections agency, this job taught me how to negotiate well. Management was really fun and tried to keep the environment less stressful. Hardest part of the job was getting the shift you want. They had split shifts which means you would work 4 hours, leave and come back for another 4 hours."
good,"Working for this company has provided me with a variety of different opportunities. I have worked as a customer service reprsentative, outbound call group, high level adjustment team and audit team. I have learned a gret deal of skills to be a benefit many employers."
good,Company provides lot of trainings on cutting edge technologies
good,"Complex software updates used cross-functional teams including offshore IT resources.  Employed all of the official project management processes to implement the projects on-time and within budget.  The reward was the delivery of an updated software project that helped clients work more productively and/or save money.  Great co-workers were spread across the entire US.  Some projects were so large, possibly more team members would have been more beneficial."
good,"Learned vmware by training program from at&t"
good,"Learned a lot about sub-contracting business. Hardest part about it was long 12,13,14 hour days.6 days per week.Most enjoyable was that every job,every costumer was different."
good,"Pull productivity reports to ensure accounts were assigned to correct Sales Associate team."
good,"It's a great job with good benefits and pay. The best I've ever had. However, some of the standards aren't fair to a regular employee. A representative is held directly responsible for making or keeping people satisfied with AT&T. You can get a glowing review on a survey, but if they aren't satisfied with AT&T's procedures or pricing, for instance, you're still accountable. There's also a problem with a new assistant manager. He/she is seems to have found it acceptable to not treat me with mutual respect, and I find it rather sad that occurs within such a great and reputed company."
good,"es muy gratificante saber que se tiene la capacidad de buscar y de enfrentar diferentes nichos de mercado  dirigiendo a un grupo de asesores de diferentes personalidades y comportamientos , con los cuales a un diaogo"
good,A lot of work with no defined instruction. Up to 6 conference calls per day. Had calls about having future calls.
good,A excellent company to work for; many opportunities for advancement.
good,Great people that are always motivated and inspired. Great benefits and compensation.
good,"Estabilidad , crecí como profesional y conocí de administración, presupuesto, material publicitario , sistema sap, material impreso organización y planeacion de eventos , compras programadas de materiales ,  manejo del presupuesto compras de camionetas , contratos material pop , premios para los incentivos a vendedores entre otras muchas actividades , proyectos como dtv llega que consiste en un trailer para llegar a lugares reconditos y lejanos"
good,I worked 11 pm to 7 am. It's good work if you like the night hours. They offered other position. Call center enviornment. Management is really not there for you unless you know them (so it seemed).
good,"En un día de trabajo lo normal era llegar conectarnos al sistema de DIRECTV, comenzar con los llamados y cumplir con la meta diaria impuesta por la supervisora de ventas. Lo mas difícil fue realizar mi primer venta pero la realicé al tercer día de trabajo."
good,"working hard"
good,"It is a non stop atmosphere that evolves all the time. A typical day at work would consist of selling phones and devices to customers, assisting with bill issues with customers, and servicing devices with issues. It's a team oriented employment, which is fun and enjoyable at most times"
good,Al entrar a esta empresa me costaba tomar el ritmo con los valores la cual la empresa trabajaba gracias a mi forma de ser pude tener un buen acercamiento con algunos de mis colegas los cuales me permiteron que trabaja junto a ellos para tomarle mas el ritmo al trabajo y de apoco ya empeze a tomar vuelo solo cuando me llamaban los clientes ya no habia nada que me interpusiera a entregrar mala informacion no me costo mucho ya que años anteriores ya habia trabajado en ventas en tienda como ful time y part time
good,great instructions on what we should do to make more sales. We got to walk door to door knocking on peoples doors trying to sell the product informed to us to sell.
good,i worked at AT&T as a contractor for only three months but the job was fun and the people were great.
good,Goos job. great benefits. Wish the hours werent so bad as it makes it hard to raise a family.
good,"ATT is a well connected company. So having it on your resume is a plus. Just be prepared to trade your life for money. It was not out of the ordinary to work 60hrs a week as a asst manager. It all depends on your area manager. From what I hear if you work outside the west region, its normal living but inside.. geez! alot of madness. Overall the company is a good one."
good,Working in the mobility industry was exciting and challenging. I enjoyed being on top of the latest gadgets and finding a perfect fit for our customers. I enjoyed encouraging my team to strive for excellence and not only meet but exceed their goals each month. The most challenging part of my job was learning how to motivate and direct our Gen Y representatives. The most rewarding part of my job was actually connecting with these reps and learning from them as they learned from me.
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho é sempre com muitas ligações, chats e tickets para ser analisados."
good,"re-organization and downsizing became the order of the day (that was no fun)"
good,"It can be a very rewarding job, but management puts unnecessary stress on their employees."
good,"(1) A great place to learn."
good,"This job was good for the experience, I didn't stay long because I decided to continue my education and better myself."
good,"A company cnstantly changing with high demands for sales production. Goals are obtainable for those who are willing to put the effort in, great benefits. Not a lot of free time for after work life."
good,A great place in the atmosphere among the workers. Upper Management could never capitalize on that strength. ]
good,The health/insurance benefits are great. That's the biggest perk. And also reward points for making good sales. Free stuff is always great no matter what it is. Even receiving an extra charger cable for your cell phone when extras are available. It's the little things like that that are cool.
good,"Accepted calls from customers and ATT CO and ATT field technicians."
good,Very busy days producing great work for big brands and cool sports and entertainment activations.  A true team environment where the clients are a major part of the team.
good,"Telecommunications company driven by knowledgeable sales teams that strive to keep up with cutting edge voice, data, wireless and internet technologies."
good,I really had no complaints with AT&T.  They were actually really good to me.
good,A typical day was logging in and the phone calling people's numbers and asking them about if they wanted to add on any packages. I learned about how to use their computer system. The hardest part of the job was that we had no control over when and what time people were called by the computer. People tended to get irate and feel it was us calling them but even if we put them on a no call back it took 4 days to fully go into effect. The most enjoyable was being able to talk to people and try to help them to the best of my ability.
good,"los horarios eran generalmente rotativo, siempre y cuando no estuviesen en un punto de venta oficial."
good,"building positive relationships with customers, educating them on every service and device ATT offers for the best communication aspect in their daily lives.  Working and communicating with co-workers to achieve a high level of satisfaction for direct customers.  Face to face with all levels of human interaction to remedy and promote a better way of life using devices for home and personal usage.  Resolving any conflict directly without getting others involved and self empowered to correct any friction between the customer and the company."
good,"Great Feedback from management if you have the right leader, Pay is great for the job that you do. To tell you the truth I miss it."
good,Excelled at job and was very disappointed that position was eliminated as well as 2000 other people. District manager told me that 50% of people in my position were not doing their jobs so corporation was firing 100% of employees. I asked him did he know how insane that explanation was? Above Store Level Management do nothing but react without evaluating their decisions.
good,"Worked there for over 10 years, I liked the people I worked with but there no room for advancement."
good,"Back in the time I was there, this was the greatest place to work ever. I'm not sure what its like now, but I'd go back to the Greensboro site any day! Unfortunately, I learned that not all call centers are that wonderful, but wow - did Greensboro Customer Care in the early 2000s set an example!"
good,"I learned a number of things in my tenure with AT@T (SBC). during the 15 years I spent within that organization...1) not to judge a book by the cover-diversity 2) keep an open mind and be ever willing to learn new things  i.e. - computer training and other classes available. 3) versatility - I'd never thought I'd be able to do manual labor, yet I did, due to a change from my regular sit-down job to the manufacturing side of that facility-  My co-workers were the best!!!!! and still friends. The most enjoyable part of the job for me at AT@T is that it's shown me that ""whatever you want is out there................."
good,A company with great resources and tools. Very structured and organize.
good,"My previous employer at&t is a great company to work for, they are union based so they have great job security.  It is also a very fast pace job which I enjoy and compensation was great at first.  After two years I attempted to advance in the company and was even elected for a leadership development program.  However due to changes in the company my location changed area managers 2 times in 1 year.  I had to continue to prove myself to the new leaders and was happy to do so.  I even took on more responsibility as a floor leaders and invested in helping other develop.  My efforts were over looked and I am now looking for new opportunities with other companies.  Our management became so much more invested in their numbers than in the customers we are there to serve bending the rules when it was in the store's best interest and the customers."
good,"Could have been a fantastic place to work. Unfortunately it faced many of the same issues that all call centers do. High turn over, poor management, and overall feeling of being ""stuck""."
good,"smart and strategic thinkers"
good,"This is a front facing job working with the public . It has it's advantages and disadvantages as most jobs do. I start out with preparing the store for opening. Once we do open we work with customer issues and help upwell customers on products and services. Everything from iPhones , Uverse and now Digtial Life home security . We do have a manager on duty at all types. This is the busiest store in country so we get busy very quickly. Makes the day go by fast.  I am team player and most all my coworkers are as well.  Hardest part of my job is dealing with the different personalities that have customer services issues.  Most enjoyable part is making a difference and educating customers on products and services."
good,"Overall nice environment. Typical day was calls lined up with little time for completing tasks independently. I did learn a lot due to this being my first job out of college, it was a great learning experience and very welcoming. Great resources for personal improvement. "
good,"I worked in a Customer Service ""Rewards Program"" Call Center for teh first 18 months and then took 12 weeks of training to become a Business Call Center Customer Care Specialist working in the 800 and WATS line Clients we had. The work hours were very good, and changed per busniess needs and was bid out on Seniority basis.  The hardest part of the job was getting all the paper-work completed before hanging up with a customer because the next call came right to you and you had to be ready to serve them. It was a bit stressful, but we developed a rythym  and were able to work with our Management team to give us a buffer for 'after call documentation' before taking our next customer call!  I loved the job and had great team members that I worked along side!"
good,"The work was rewarding, when assisting customers. There was no way to advance past a customer service representative."
good,"To be completely honest, I must have been the only employee that enjoyed my job at at&t. YES, they have rules, YES, you must show up to work, YES, you must learn the systems and be nice to the customers. I started out as a sales support rep answering phone calls just like anyone else. I didn't mind it so much, you do get the occasional person who is so angry you can almost see them throwing their phone out the window of a speeding automobile. However, on those calls, you just work thru them as best you can. If everyone who worked for any company gave it their all, things would run a lot smoother. I can't even add up the amount of people who have the WORST attitudes about their jobs or their customers. The reason these companies have the rules that they do about attendance and call quality is because in the past people just didn't want to work! They didn't show up and when they did their work ethic was horrifying! They would do nothing they were supposed to and still collected their check. I was brought up with an understanding that in order to keep a job and keep those paychecks flowing, you have to learn that job and perform to the best of your ability. If you can honestly say that you are doing this and still have a lot of problems, then I'm sorry for you and perhaps you should check with your union rep. But please keep in mind a little saying when your complaining about the rules that this company has set forth. ""The sins of a few will affect the many"". Unfortunately the company had no choice but to impose these rules, I don't blame them and neither should anyone else. I"
good,"A typical day at work for me was very fun, once you get to know the people you worked with. Otherwise, this job can be very stressful for no apparent reason. However, when working in a urban area like Atlanta, because of 95% of the United States using AT&T, you will meet so many new people and celebrities. That is what kept the job fun other than selling the latest and greatest new devices. I learned what time management was all about from two aspects, back office and customer service. A lot of times customer don't want to waste hours trying to complete something that they thought was so simple. Because of this you have to know how to use your time wisely, whether it's completing whats in front of you right then and there or completing it after the customer's visit. Therefore, you have to have a tremendous quality of a memory. The people that I worked with were AMAZING! Thats at any store. The people that you'll tend to see for 8 hours (sometimes more) become your family and between working at both stores, I loved both of my store families! That's what makes it hard to leave if a new opportunity arises. The hardest part of the job can be every customer experience. Every customer experience is going to be different, therefore you have to be on your toes at all times. You'll never know what each customer wants before they open they're mouths to tell you and you'll never know what you can sell to them along with what they want if anything. AT&T is big on upselling so you have to be prepared. The most enjoyable part of the job is trying phones and products before everyone else."
good,"Good pay and benefits and lots of overtime if you want it."
good,"Overall, a great place to work for flexibility and to advance."
good,"sign in threw ipad, stock truck, call customer and do job. I learned how to use cat5 and cable at the same time. Management was always in rotation, never really had a close relationship with the four managers in had in a eight month spand. I enjoyed my coworkers. We helped one another at all times. Hardest part of the job is change in management. Helping customers enjoy their service. especially the elderly."
good,I've learned about about business management and running a multi-million dollar operation. I've had some well trained hard working managers. I enjoy selling new products and services to help make people more productive and keep them connected to what matters most to them.
good,"Se trabajaba en un ambiente agradable. Aprendí como se trabaja en un call center, a manejar los tiempos, Servicio al cliente y conocí sobre televisión por cable."
good,"I would have to say that overall AT&T is a good company to work for.  I have recently lost my passion to work in this field.  I am no longer fascinated by technology and cell phones and  or tablets.  I also feel like the company has their hands in way too things.  Too many products, sale quotas, etc to keep up with.  My pay goes up and down with the weather it seems."
good,"Taking incoming calls for wireless services, handling questions about billing, phones also we did sales for home services , internet and tv and home phone services. We had a team with a manager and had sales we had to meet in order to make it for the month with points to earn with a bonus check. Hardships of the jobs were when people yell and scream but you learn how to calm them down by the end of the call once everything is worked out."
good,"Overall a very good company to work for, although I worked for a subsidiary of ATT and was only within the organization a short time."
good,AT&T has unions that protect you from harsh treatment for management but do not expect to move around the company.
good,Good company. Very telephony centric and not really an established business development for solution selling
good,"You can stay with this company and retire. Hard to move up, and they are not big on family home life balance."
good,"Great Company to work for. I worked at AT&T about 8 years ago, the reason for departure was to grow a career in the banking industry."
good,"taking care of customers"
good,I loved my job. Everyday was something new and exciting. This company offered good benefits and pay.
good,"starts slow usually picks up in the afternoon. A lot of customer service issues,(my phone broke,cant get text,and how do i do this question). It's very competitive you do have a sales goal but your co-workers work with you and help you with sells sometimes.Selling home phones and the consequences are ridiculous,write ups 7am meetings on sunday. The best part about At&t free phone"
good,There are so many openings in Engineering but they are all irrelevant to what a real engineering deals with.
good,"-A typical day at work: I would get there, have 5 minutes to sign into everything on my computer. I would take calls from customer (generally back to back) for roughly 2 hours, take a break, 2 more hours, take lunch, 2 more then break, then finish with the last 2."
good,Call center environment. Management played favorites and sometimes refused to do the job they were supposed to.  Saw many employees get set up for termination
good,Great place to learn. Have great benefits. Co-worker are good. Nice team environment.
good,"this company hired people from all walks of life and ages,which alot of times made it hard to focuse bc of the younger workers,not taking their job seriously"
good,"As a customer assistant, my duty was to assist DSL customers with their internet connection issues, troubleshoot email problems, and setup new DSL accounts."
good,"Sitting on the phone for 8 hours a day listening to people complain about issues with their bill or services, is what a day consisted of. I learned many things about customer service and account and people management. Everyone did their own work and management supervised. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the negativity. The most enjoyable part was the team work and spirit and contests."
good,"Summary: "
good,"I work 9.5-10 hours a day.  I have learned so much that I use my skills in every day life, especially when it comes to making decisions.  I am a manager and I have grown wiser and I have learned how to deal with people in a way that I wouldn't know had it not been for the job.  My co-workers are supportive and wonderful.  We are a family.  The hardest part of the job is when we are forced to work 12 hour days because I am a mother and I have household responsibilities as well.  Sometimes we are led with fear and the morale of our call center is low and a lot of our representatives go out on stress leave.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.  I love my peers and my representatives."
good,"interesting, union job, worked on customer dsl lines in 22 state AT&T footprint area"
good,It was indeed an honor and a learnig experience to grow up in AT&T while it was going through massive changes.  It was a great life lesson and I made some invaluable lifelong friends and gained great mentors.
good,Never knowing what you are going to do for the day.  Many different types of installs and repairs.  Hardest part of the job is climbing polls.
good,"Learned new things, continuous training on products & services. Assisted customers from start to end of shift unless there was some off the phone time or breaks & lunch. Utilized various systems to ensure I provided the best customer to my customers. The hardest part of the job was leaving. The most valuable part of my job was that I got to leave at the end of the shift knowing that I did my best to accommodate my customers. Wish there was more room for advancement without favoritism."
good,"Empresa seria, donde se trabaja en equipo con total respeto y responsabilidad."
good,"working at at&t was a great experience, but management could use a bit more training"
good,Learned an extreme amount of customer service. Handled a large amount of phone calls in a short amount of time. Sat most of the day. Enjoyed my co-workers and I would love to work in there call center again
good,The Pay was good for being an entry level position in a retail environment. The hours are long and it will consume your whole day because the schedule is being generated by a computer
good,"Depending on who your boss was, it was a good or bad experience. I was let go after they transferred alot of manager responsibilities onto me, on top of my already-full list.  When I failed these extra tasks, I was let go."
good,Managed day to day operations. Learned how to lead a team of sales reps to achieve and exceed goals. Created great working atmosphere. Enjoyed a lot of aspects of the job.
good,i have started my carrier with this company. Project allocation was satisfactory. Good work environment. Overall it was a learning experience. 
good,"Been with AT&T for 17 years, and secure company to work for, but never going to get rich here."
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for to get solid experience under you belt. Being in sales, it was a mostly independent job. However, I did feel that many hours were taken away from actual selling to reporting and team calls. The hardest part of my job was getting through the internal processes to proceed in the next step of a sales cycle. Sometimes I felt like there was not enough support or too much red tape to cross to get things done. We joked that no sale goes unpunished. I would definitely like to work for AT&T in the future again as I believe the security and benefits are worth it in itself."
good,"Stress level very high. Pay is very good."
good,"face to face with the cusomer. everyone is special. managers wnat it done , now. hard coomute. the slow ride home wa great for the wind down."
good,installed satilite dishes and equipment to recieve satilite tv

good,"AT&T/ Lafayette, LA       2006-2011"
good,"Primary technical contact inbound telephone support for external and internal customers regarding products and services by basic and advanced troubleshooting, investigating and resolving customers' questions and problems, Clear communication via e-mail and the telephone using proper spelling and grammar to proactively resolve customer issues is imperative. Some of the issues you may encounter include the usage of phone features, billing, network coverage and technical issues, data services and internet connections"
good,"I really enjoyed working for AT&T, however since the smaller company I was working for was acquired by AT&T, the culture shift was a bit of a shock."

good,Typically a very good work environment until the last few years.  Downsizing and new management changed the culture.
good,Its a good place to work great job good benefits good work life balance
good,"This company was a great reputable company to work for. It was a temporary hire assignment since they are no longer in operations. We would make outbound telemarketing calls to local residents of Honolulu, Hawaii and try to promote callers to sign up with AT&T as their long distance carrier for home phone lines. Co-workers were really easy to get along with, sales was easy to make.  "
good,"Providing this service to residential and business customers could be very rewarding through the satisfaction gained via interaction with the customers.  AT&T middle management seemed more concerned with established abstract internal metrics rather than the quality of customer service and engendering customer loyalty.  All of my co-workers shared a common attitude towards positive customer service....although it was sometimes hindered by the above style of management, often long and erratic work hours, personal time scheduling difficulties, and an uncertainty of implied attitude towards job security."
good,"A typical day of work at AT&T included talking to customers all over the country regarding their bills, service, or any other issues that arise with having cell phones. I learned how to assist mulitple types of customers from very diverse backgrounds. The hardest part of the job was when I had to find a political way to tell a customer that his/her request was unreasonable and could not assist. The most enjoyable part was finding a reasonable solution for the same issue that worked for both the customer and the company."
good,"Llegar a horario,casi siempre antes..marcar entrada,revisar correspondencia electronica,proyectar los objetivos del dia personales y empresariales...Capacitacion e imformacion,formacion de equipo,recursos antes de comenzar el proceso de venta.Trasladar objetivo y negociar proceso de cumplimiento de objetivos en cuanto a la direccion del equipo de ventas.Resolver en el transcurso inquietudes de recursos para lograr interiorizar el producto(directv),escuchas,feedbacks,carga de ventas,comunicacion interlocucion con el cliente,trato y total conocimiento del producto.Aprendi a negociar entre los jefes inmediatos y los empleados como intermediario para lograr el objetivo comun,aprendi a tomar decisiones,a detectar problemas inmediatos y resolverlos estudiando estrategicamente la situacion.Mis colegas superiores una relacion super homesta y directa llevando a cabo en la medida de mis posibilidades todas las ordenes al pie de la letra,y con mis colegas iguales a competir con intelecto y confianza,ademas con ejemplo,muy buena relacion.Con los empleados,mas que bien,porque aplique mucha didactica al producto para comercializarlo y podian mas facilmente lograrlo."
good,"Daily routine would be to answer phones, taking care of customer needs and updating information on computer. Management would be tough and inconsiderate. Most of the co workers were great."
good,"It’s a great company over all; unfortunately changes that have been made have not been positive. They rather spend more money on a 3rd party company, than having the actual employees get good salaries and accomplish more. All upper management are great, love them to death that's the only reason I’m still in the company. They are accessible and always open for/give advice."
good,"In-bound call center. High volume calls, Busy, fun and energetic place to work"
good,"My experience at AT&T was a positive but very different one from my previous employer. Yes we worked under the blanket of a large corporation, but we very much ""sold our own business."" To the most true extent they were My Customers!"
good,EDI - research issues
good,"This job is a good gateway to the company. The hours are long, and there is no sitting except on your break. traffic through the store is either constant or slow."
good,"Well, it's at&t. There is no environment like it. It can be frustratingly stagnant and fabulously advanced."
good,Very political management structure and once you reach a certain point it becomes hard to work there. Pay was great though and very easy job.
good,"Working at any call center can be stressful, but I made the most out of it at AT&T. The training was helpful, the environment was laid back and management wasn't too bad. My co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was the redundancy. The most enjoyable part was helping someone who had been courteous the entire time and being able to resolve their problem."
good,This is a great job for people who recently graduate from college.
good,The only problem that I found with AT&T was that you had to go through multiple programs to get to a simple answer
good,"AT&T's compensation plan was awesome, however there was little flexibility for anyone with a family life."
good,"AT&T was a great job in many aspects. Our day consisted of answering the phone call of customers that had issues or concerns with service or other AT&T related info. I became more computer savvy, a better decision maker, and more mature in my time there. As with any company the management staff sets the tone of the office. AT&T's staff was pretty laid back. The management staff was very helpful and knowlegeable. My coworkers were good people. We shared the common goal of making sure the customer was satisfied with the product to the best of our ability. It was difficult when there was an issue that we were attempting to resolve for the customer but were unable to solve it due to company guidelines. We want to at any time be able to make teh customer happy. Sometimes the rules just simply didnt allow it. I enjoyed the company for its job security, it paid well, and overall was a fun place to work."
good,"Working for DTV was not such a bad gig at first. Good benefits (namely the FREE DTV service). Red tape can be a hindrance when switching from part time to full time and vise versa. They go first come first serve to the bidders and I bid from the shift I most wanted, to the shift I could not work no at all. They rejected my bid because I was not yet full time in the system and said they'd resubmit my bid when I was, well when that happened I was on the bottom of the list and got a shift I could not work which ended up causing me to part ways. As a tech support specialist the customers are typically going to take their frustrations out on you, but if you can shrug that off it can be a pretty decent setup."
good,AT&T is a great company and they pay their sales people very well. The management is good also.
good,"payroll changes, administrative matters,selling phone as a sales associate"
good,so far no advancement after 5 years and constant excellence with sales goals
good,"co workers very nice, managers were great. Learned a lot about people in the customer service field. Need to have a thick skin to work in customer service"
good,Typical Day at Work Lots of calls from my Team but I enjoy being a problem solver for them.
good,"Had to count the registers twice and they were counted at the end of the night so that is a total of three times. They did not trust their employees they used the cameras to view what the rep. was and wasn't doing. Management were nice to each other however they picked and chose who they would value opinion from. My co-workers were nice everyone got along. The hardest part of the job was making the interaction personable because the company required for us to sale so many items within a sale and not everyone has a budget for them, so getting management to understand that was impossible without them thinking we did something wrong. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with fellow co-workers as well as the customers."
good,"In order to be successful at what you do, you have to surround yourself with people who are better than you."
good,"The best part as being application support manager was as long as all applications are functioning properly, life would be peaceful :-). colleagues are always helpful in sharing their suggestions and tips during any critical situations."
good,Its very demanding with quotas .. multiple quotas. Hours are retail hours never any consitancy unless you have sinority. Quotas are stressed in fact if you aren't hitting them you will be stressed. Job comes with stresses but in this economy you cant get pay like this no where else. The pay and benefits are good they'll even pay for school.
good,At&t was a great company to be apart of at the time I started with SBC and closer to the end of my employement they purchased At&t. The pay was great to just be a customer service rep. but the managment was a bunch of miserable women who came to work to make your life as miserable as theirs! Besides that no complaints.
good,No Comment..
good,Work days are usually 10hrs pay is average for the work. There are some good managers there and there are some bad managers. Most of your co workers are helpful.

good,Great organization with many years of opportunities. Currently making a huge transition in their I.T. infrastructure organization. The high touch customer support may be impacted.
good,"Responsible for answering calls at a high pace. Presenting information for resolve customer concerns, along with up selling product. Management was basically numbers based. I enjoyed the challenge and the idea of helping people."
good,"...it was a contract job so I was treated like a second class citizen, told I was doing a great job, and when I reached my 3yr limit for contractors in Texas was sent packing. Environment was disorganized at best and completely mismanaged at worst."
good,"The job role consisted of working with peers, engineers, managers, IT personnel, well as client, and vendors to complete complex network installations in corporate customer locations nation wide. Each day brought new challenges which required nimble response and decisive action to complete all required tasks within budget constraints, timetables, and customer expectation which my manager gave me great flexibility with to meet those goals. On some days the challenges encountered to complete a project could be mind numbingly hard and/or counter productive to the overall scope of the project but I had a wonderful team of peers that made these challenges much easier to get through."
good,"AT&T is a great company with excellent pay and benefits. The management staff in some departments are not well trained managers. Most of them, do not posses interpersonal skills. AT&T is a great fortune 500 company that have room for improvement. The first step is to extend deversity classes to management and have more manager/craft relationship classes."

good,"pros co-workers,pay rate."

good,"Directv is a good place to work for someone who just complete college. They take the time to teach you everything you need to start off with the job. Management can be great as long as you are on there good side. But, as far as job sercurity, that is not the place. Q.A. determine if you have a job or not. T.L. will throw you under the bus to management to keep there job. That is only things that I used to hate about directv. As far as that, great company to work for. Benefits you get free service after 60 days, and a chance to enjoy yourself as you work for the company."
good,Very specific day-to-day responsibilities.
good,I learned a lot. My boss was an inspiration to me and I will carry on all the important values that I learned. I was offered many opportunities and for that I am grateful.
good,Not a bad place to work if you dont like a fast pace enviorment
good,"I loved working for AT&T for 11 of the 13 years. Things changed all the time and I loved that. However, over the last 2 years the focus went away from Customer Service to Sales. That is the way the business needed to go but I love people and want to continue working with people and helping them."
good,"Not alot of supervision, your always at a new place meeting new people. If you work fast and hard you make great money."
good,work with self starters great team endure florida sun and heat always plenty of work.
good,"A very competitive environment. The only downside is that when I was the most successful representative I was not as popular. Managers can be hired and promoted too quickly. A lot of the true sales skills are from the more experienced company sales reps and they are often promoted as well, that usually works out better."
good,Growing company that has a great structure for development for internal growth.
good,"AT&T is very focused on the dollar. Having said that, I believe they do try to take care of the customers. The people I worked with were all amazing people and great workers."

good,There is always something new to learn. Systems are constantly changing and new ways of accomplishing programming are always in the forfront.
good,A typical day at work would be taking calls from customer about their AT&T cell phones bills. Assisting customers with payment plans to secure their service. The management staff is made up of very different managers throughout the hierachy. The hardest part of the job is being unable to help some customers with payment arrangements to avoid an interruption of service. The most enjoyable is being able to have contact with co-workers that do not sit near me.
good,"The pay was good, the benefits decent. Difficult to advance without knowing someone to promote you."
good,All around a good place to work. Co-workers were easy to work with. Learned alot about people skills.
good,"Days at AT&T were always busy and high-paced. I loved my coworkers! We always had a great time amusing one another between calls. Management was there at all times for extra support, and so was the Manager Relief team. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I was able to help our customers' and fulfil thier needs. That really is a great feeling."
good,"-Morning meeting, hit the field and find businesses that want to grow through internet marketing. We call and stop by in person, taking business away from the competition and new businesses."
good,"I would asist customers with billing issues as well as technical problems within there cell phone service. I given the oppurtunity to clearly understand how the communication network operate on mobile level . The position was web-based with little to no Supervision .

good,AT&T is a great place to work. I have grown as a person over the last 6 years of employment. I have had the opportunity to work with some amazing leaders and mentors. I enjoy the people both as co-workers and customers. I enjoy the constant change and direction the company is going in.

good,became difficult 2002-2005 with layoffs around every corner. enjoyed the job while i was there.
good,I go in mid day everyday about 12 and begin work. I am one the top reps in my department Im always exceeding our goals. I know my job like the back of my hand and I can probably do it in my sleep. We have a script we go by and get graded on 4 calls a month on how we interact with the customer and if we resolved the issue. I have all types of people that work with me and I speak and do my job. Try not to make many friends less trouble I can get into. The best part is the pay and the raises along with vacation time offered. The benefits are the best.
good,Work days star early and you never know what time you will be back home.
good,the pay is great and also the benefits are one of the best in town

good,"Help customers with problem solving concerning there cable,also take billing"
good,"I've spent my entire career as a Solaris Systems Administrator at AT&T and have learned pretty much everything I know while being there. That being said, after SBC bought Ameritech and subsequently SBC buying AT&T, the entire culture changed. When I started there was a lot of training and certifications because they wanted you to better yourself as an employee and a person. As the years went on, job responsibilities were partitioned off into specialized teams."
good,"Although the environment was a good one, the down side was the immensely high pressured and stressful push to sell, sell, sell."
good,A typical day at work at AT&T involves exhibiting great customer service to every client and helping the company grow its client base. While I was there I worked for two groups and was responsible for inbound and outbound call support. I was also viewed as a leader and mentor to my coworkers and peers. The hardest part of the job was balancing work and family they do not have a set shift and you have to bid for a schedule every month. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I was able to help and being a part of a loving team enviroment.
good,•a typical day at work - Avg
good,"Its nice to work here, the fellow technicians are very helpful"

good,"• Managed 5,000 AT&T Business Accounts in the Miami Beach Area"
good,"The most enjoyable part about leading a team of individuals is to get them to think collectively. They have their individual goals that they need to achieve and getting the opportunity to coach and develop their skill set is a great responsibility. When I get them to collaborate and see the big picture, that is when I get the most out of my employees. There is a difference between managing a team and leading a team. I am confident in my ability to lead a team."
good,Responsibilities for collections call to negotiate paying and retain the customers and ppreparing report of findings of investigation. General call center and customer service duties claims and billing adjustments.
good,"Directv inc. is a good company.I learned so much in just a short amount of time.A typical day starts out with going to the warehouse to get my daily equipment and route,then doing a vehicle check before i leave.Once i leave i planmy route out from small job to biggest and i call my customers and take care of each one accordingly.I learned a great sense of responsibility from being in chrage of so much equipmeant and tools.Management was there and willing to help along with several supervisors and human resources.My co-workers were great.We would all stay in contact anjd help each other out when needed(dropping off equipment/help finishing a job).The hardest part of the job was working in confined places such as attics,small crawl spaces,closets,etc.The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting so many great customers and providing them with great customer service."
good,I Very enjoyed working as a porting specialist. Enjoyed the people I worked with as well as the customers. In this position I would help customers bring their current telephone numbers from current carriers to ATT. Many times I would call the current carrier to get the correct account information so that the customers could keep the phone number they already have. This often was a home or business number that they might lose.
good,i love this job. it was very fun and fast paced. I loved the fact that we were encouraged to play with our devices and demo them when ever possible.
good,"This started off slow, but I ended up with a lot of responsibility and really enjoyed the job. I, often times, spent more of my life at work then I did at home. Including one instance where I was there for 36 straight hours. In the end, they hired some people in key positions that were the best choice in my opinion. I was let go for reasons I didn't agree with and not long after that, the company was bought out by someone else."
good,"In general, it's a nice place to work. nice environment and nice people to work with"
good,"A typical day at work would be, clocking in and taking calls. I learned the software that they use to produce accounts. The managment was stern but fun. The hardest part of the job is the type of customers that call your line. If they are existing, they cant be sold and that counts against the rep."
good,- Handle between 10 to 14 installations per day
good,"Eight hours of customer care, often luke warm morale. A consistent change in rules and standards. A big turnover staff ratio."
good,Great place to work in Sales. They make every effort to keep Good Morale Going.
good,Steady to fast paced inbound calls. Organization and patience are virtues needed in this position.
good,"Typical day at work was opening the store at 9:30am and opening in less than 10 minutes, but having to be there earlier. Then, go through the multitude of emails from managers and higher ups who don't take the time to get to know you, but only your sales metrics. Co-workers were great, and the money was great."
good,"Excellent pay and benefits but very stressful. Can only comment on the call center in Odessa, Tx but it had a bad rep before I went to work there and after I went to work there I understood. I believe most problems was because of the team managers at this particular location, not the business as a whole."
good,Good place to learn customer service and guidelines. Teaches how to deal with the hardest customers.
good,"I love this job. I would never leave if, perhaps, the company were larger and there were more opportunity to use my specific skills and experience. I simply need to move toward my future goals."
good,it is a good job but can be better if they put more effort in worrying about our health and lives then just worrying about pleasing there boss
good,"Overall a good place to work, with great benefits. It had a great program for career progression. They worked to share in the profits and benefits through additional incentive programs and contests. Always on the cutting edge with the newest technologies."
good,"Fast paced environment, fun and friendly people, very entertaining"
good,"This Company has alot of high goals for employees, the problem that I have is when you meet the goals, they just move the bar more and more each month. They pay hourly and there commission plan is based off how much you exceed your goal. So it gets to a point where you bonus and commissions are next to nothing. I am all for making my company do great things and striving to hit sales goals but when I hit my sales goals month in and month out and they just increase my goals. It basically just turns into an hour job, making us work more and make less money."
good,AT&T has great wages and is union represented. I really liked the technical part of this job. The technology is changing at rapid speed. Many changes on a day to day basic to keep you on your toes.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working for AT&T. My salary and benefits were great and the opportunity to make more money was awesome yet challenging (had to meet sales goals). I am a ""people person"" so I loved the fact that I talked to customers all day an assisted with whatever it was they needed."
good,"El trabajo en el área de operaciones es 24/7 por lo que si se sacrifica tiempo de la familia, pero pagan bien a comparación de muchos lugares"

good,"Productive day starting out reviewing prior days open items, answering emails and phone calls.  Setting up appointments. Set time aside for training individual and team.  I like to help train others and I learn new things to help take me higher in my knowledge base which I feel if a team performs like this then that team is unstoppable.  Handled many difficult situations and due to the team and I learning together we concurred them."
good,The Good Att does have great benefits and fair pay. Very diverse. Bad as of late a strong push for sales and moving jobs to 3rd party vendors over seas.
good,"8 AM until dome whenever complete. long hours not support "
good,"Its a retail sales environment with commission sales people. That aside, my coworkers were fantastic people and there was a real sense of being part of a team."
good,"Benefits are great.  There was a lot of attrition due to tenure, but the experience I was able to acquire through all of the positions I held was enormous."
good,"I work in the AT&T call center, the pay is excellent. Great benefits and many learning possibilities. Management is horrible. Needs a complete overhaul. Running the center into the ground. Use to love going in to work. Not so much now, and even though I’m part of a Union . Im looking to find employment elsewhere."
good,Buen ambiente laboral y buenas prestaciones pero el estrés laboral era demasiado y trabajo bajo presión
good,Nothing bad to say. Work life balance is terrible but that’s to be expected with a retail job. It really all depends on your manager if your work day is good or not
good,"There is nothing that I want to say about AT&T!  Create your own view of the company. This section should not be mandatory, as it should be an option."
good,Gained vast knowledge in sales as well as customer service and marketing strategies. Also gained great leadership & development skills. Fast paced work environment. Long hours though with extreme requirements for availability.
good,"Worked as a contractor for more than a year."
good,This company provides a great experience and provides great benefits.   Company has great vacation package.   I am at a point we’re I feel my growth has came to a end at my current position and I need a change.
good,My overall experience working for the company was good. All the managers I had were great. I didn’t like the culture at work once the main focus became on sales instead of customer service which is why I left. I’ve seen worse at other companies so I guess you just have to choose if you want to deal with the pressure from the higher ups. They be doing too much for me and stressing there lower management out!!
good,"I’m happy to get early to work I feel with lots of energy to help people and learn more every day. "
good,Learned a lot. Had great team leaders and co-workers.  The project ended and that was unfortunate but I really enjoyed it while it was going on. The work itself was very satisfying as well.
good,Seasoned PM experience is a must.  New hire PM's generally hits the ground running. Teams are virtual and remote experience is necessary.  Onboarding generally takes approximately 2-3weeks.
good,I knew the job was on other side of town but had to work split shifts for only 2 days a week. Just was not working. I became pregnant and they did not like that very much either.
good,Technicians are required to learn new technology as it rolls out to the public. First line supervisors may not be trained in technology and often rely on techs to train each other.
good,"Great benefits and salary,  there was a lot of pressure from management to sell at any cost, I feel it was sometimes unethical . Constant monitoring and harassment"
good,"It's a good job and I like doing this type of work but the management needs to be improved,  the requirements change daily so you never know what is expected of you but providing services to customers and solving problems is a great feeling."
good,Te exigen pero te proporcionan herramientas para realizar tu trabajo y para crecer
good,It's a very fast paced environment that requires tend utmost performance.  You are monitored frequently and given an annual review.  The compensation and benefits are very good.  They are also very good about diversity and inclusion making sure that the employees are valued.
good,Working in the call center is a stressful environment and is not for everybody. if you can sit in a chair and take unpredictable calls. paid good and good benefits.
good,AT&T was a fun place to work. make sure if you are looking to work here that you will be able to consistently hit sales goals. The have strick performance management policies.
good,All in all great experience at  all the places I have worked in my resume.  Everything was good there management and raises sometimes didn't come when they were supposed toi but all in all it was a great place to work.  The life to work is a little low I mean a lot low but management tries to work with you.
good,Att is a large company and has been around for over 100 years.  It has a good handle on how to do business.  Managers have their personalities and you have to learn to mess with them as long as you do what you are suppose to you will be successful and make advancements if not you will ne walked out the door.  Attendance is highly important.
good,This review was forced so will not be a full one. The job is the job in that you get paid a working wage. Management is a numbers game either they play or replaced some are good some are not.
good,Alot of changes occur so have an open mind and work/life balance schedule. Great benefits and pay. You also receive discounts on home and wireless service.
good,Had mostly good bosses.  3-4 were really good and would have been successful anywhere.  But had 2 absolutely awful bosses.  Both were bullies and didn’t care about their subordinates.  Years with average to great bosses far exceeded the bad ones.
good,This can be a very fun and productive place to work which rewards top performers fairly well.  With all of the new changes AT&T is going through in the right division you have a tremendous opportunity for growth.
good,"I enjoyed my time there. Only thing I would advise to others. Be sure you stay healthy or family things don't make you miss work. One day gone from the first 90 days can cost you! "
good,If you're a born salesman this is the job for you. Your hourly wage is ok. You have the chance to make money on commission sales if you push products and services.
good,"People are friendly and helpful. Long term projects give a sense of job security. Will learn a lot if you take self initiative otherwise will fall behind. Work culture is not the best, we never go out and have fun."
good,I enjoyed working for AT&T for the majority of the time that I was there. They promoted based on friendships versus a persons tenure. That was one of the things that I disliked about them.
good,"no comment i was laid off after 18 years and 3 months . My seniority remained at the bottom for no one was hired after 2001 in my department "
good,"Pros:"
good,"good place to work, needs better pay. good people, lots of overtime and not much time off with family. would recommend overall to learn and gain knowledge"
good,Only worked there for less than a year and overall it was purpose filled. Had to stay on point in my position and no slacking at all because it would show. It is almost impossible trying to get hired permanently but I was making more money as a contractor than a lot of the permanent employees.
good,"Working at At&t helped me hone in on my interpersonal communication skills. Overall, improving my customer service skills. It was great learning experience."
good,some people make a career out of a job like this. personally i just needed money to help pay for school. i did part time while going to college and it was a good way to make money and get experience. your experience depends on management. expect to have a bad schedule when you start - scheduling goes off of seniority.
good,Great place to work if able to get a permanent position. Term or temporary employees have no job security and it's almost impossible to get hired on...
good,"A typical day working as a premise technician includes working with residential and commercial customers to ensure that their broadband and tv services are working correctly."
good,At&t is a great place to work. Follow directions and work safe and you will do fine. The pay is great and the benefits are really good. Management truly cares about the employees.
good,There are a lot to learn and they offer an extensive and good program for training.
good,"Just another day at the office, just like every job, it is what you make it. There are good days, there are bad. Just make the most of everyday and give it your best."
good,People with deep experience in mobile technology who were all professionals.   Many had advanced degrees and its a great place to learn about management.
good,"Decent job, but the management of some of the NOC teams know almost nothing about NOC and are not able to answer any questions or concerns regarding their own NOC procedures."
good,muy buen equipo de trabajo en la tienda en donde desempeño mis funciones
good,Got to work with a mentor and it was a fun experience. It is a bureaucratic company so a lot of paperwork and a lot of time waiting for stuff to get done but it was a great learning experience
good,"AT&T is a competitive work environment, it takes a person that thrives in multitasking, and a competitive nature to work for this company, for the right person."
good,"applied for customer service job and did that for almost 10 years then we transitioned to sales, it was hard to get into the selling part especially when that was your main focus and all the customer service skills that you obtained in the previous years no longer mattered.  Management had there favorites who they would keep off the phones when ever they wanted. Good pay and good benefits though"
good,"You can plan your day out but be prepared for an email or meeting to completely change that.  Change is constant and you have to be prepared for that on a daily basis.  One great thing is that the company is diverse, so you will see many different types of people there."
good,No longer good for long term employment.  This is now best for those with desire into communications field  I’ve been fortunate enough to fulfill over 30 years of service at At&t   Grateful for that
good,"Good company to work for with plenty of room for advancement. If you are successful, the sky is the limit. Management can make or break your experience with the company. I've worked for good and bad. Work/life balance can be difficult at times. If you manage a big store, you will put in a lot of hours."
good,"A typical day will consist on several installs or service appointments. Safety at every aspect. of working and driving.  Learned alot about phone lines, internet and fiber optics."
good,"The sales persons day revolves around getting sales in cellular, internet and tv. "
good,"call center with cubicles to work to work privately. typical day at At&t handling 90% incoming calls, making schedules for technicians, calling customer to set schedule appointments to have U-verse installed and internet, wi-fi. Management fair workplace culture great, hardest thing I experienced on job is certain work was taken away from team and most enjoyable is working as team, giving great customer service and meeting productivity goals at end of day."
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with. My store Manager was awesome. Good pay and compensation. They had so many benefits and discounts that at times it was almost confusing trying to sort thru them
good,"There really is no typical day at At&t. Something new happens every day, that’s what’s so great about different customers with different needs. a very big downside is the fact that they change store managers so much. It was also very hard to get my employee discount attached to my phone bill, which still isn’t attached to 3/5 of my phone numbers."
good,34 years experience in the field. provided medical insurance training job security. How come you changed over the years not as employee oriented as in 1977 does pay well and is a secure place to work
good,"Too much outsourcing, offshoring, layoffs, and uncertain situation. Too much changes in teams and organization. The reorg sometimes endup in reinventing processes"
good,Great company if you’re looking for a stable work environment. Management can be a little micro managing but if you can work safely and efficiently you won’t have much to worry about.
good,"great place to work"
good,It is a good steady job and company to work for with great benefits. The only thing that comes to mind is the hours you have to work and they are not lenient at all if you are sick ever
good,AT&T has a lot of benefits that are worth working for but there's to many problems with management. The work environment is great you definitely feel like a family
good,"Great company to work for as far as benefits and workplace.  Advancement opportunity for agents and managers."
good,"There are a lot of opportunities for training, but no job growth. A lot of processes are in place, which can get a little burdensome sometimes. Mentor-ship from management is very minimal."
good,"The Jobs and opportunities that AT&T give is amazon, the people that work there are not the best. they are not exactly for the people but more for there self and its not cool."
good,"typical day is 10 hours, I have expanded my language of fiber optics, first level management is reasonable to work with,  the hardest part of the job is the hanging of drops, the most enjoyable is completing a assignment"
good,I worked for the company for 4 1/2 years between 3 separate stores and I've worked in great environments here and not so great environments here but AT&T provided me with great benefits and life changing opportunities as far as being able to transfer anywhere in the country. The company itself isn't what it was a few years ago but for the most part it isn't a bad company to work for.
good,This job was a good opportunity for advancement and to gain management experience. The negative aspects were that it was strictly commission and there were no benefits. Had there been a salary plus opportunities for commission it would have been more enticing. The work culture was great but at the end of the day I needed to make a decision to try and find an opportunity that could provide a salary as well as benefits and a place that could provide advancement.
good,This job is easy the management is only road block along with work life balance but the pay is good enough to overcome your desire to have weekends off
good,"Great company and excellent benefits/discounts.  Unfortunately, it was a term position so up to 3 years only.  However, would not have received the training to become a lineman if it were not term since it is very hard (selective) to become a permanent lineman--most were hired before 2015 when the term job started."
good,Great place. Love it. Great customer service! Love my co-workers. Awesome environment. Great relationship with my manager. Moving from Florida to texasu
good,"I very much enjoyed working at AT&T. Is was very beneficial in advancing my pitch, tone, knowledge, customer service skills, and even my language barrier. I was definitely worried about that, but under great management I was able to successful working there."
good,"A typical day, depending on the day was to check e-mail first. See what is pending from any other engineers in the office, currently from the previous evening or early morning already.  Start pulling what projects probably have already printed out from the printer and put them together, and put them in folders, and start listing them in our log. Take an overview of it, make sure everything looks correct on it, if it is already in it's final stages.  This is a process that will go on throughout the day for the rest of the project I am receiving.  Plus, what the engineers send to me for drafting, and answering the main line, and taking outside calls from our crew, or contract workers.  The hardest part of the job is keeping your work in line of what was most important, from least to greatest sometimes. The most enjoyable was when you are fairly busy, and the day goes by fast, and the people.  When everyone enjoys each other's company even though they are busy."
good,I really enjoyed my time with AT&T. They are very thorough about the training for the job you are hired for. Learned a lot of ins and outs while out in the field. My overall experience with the company is very good.
good,"Its a great place to work, learned a lot of useful job and life skills from this job! Best place to start off your career. Not too much room for growth."
good,Don't be a minute late....at all....u will be fired. The ppl there were great the pay was awesome but the turnover rate is crazy because they don't play about being on time.
good,"Enjoyed the work and the people. However, my personal life required my compensation at the time. This was my only reason for leaving. The compensation would have come, but my time frame did not allow for it."
good,"The call center is a great place to work, the job is very repetitive, so if you’re someone that gets bored by the same thing every day this may not be for you. There are opportunities for advancement or additional education within the call center, if you can make it known that you want to improve and grow those opportunities are amazing."
good,Tjis is a Good company good company to work for. They pay well but schedules are not that flexible.
good,I liked every one i worked with and worked for my mangers was always on top of everything and really seems to care about his team and the store and making sure every customer was taken care of
good,There is a lot of room for growth. This could be a stressful job if you care about your performance. They compensate very well. The company tends to have their employees have fun while they work and the company has shown how they care for the public.
good,"Productive and fun work place, lot to improve upon."
good,"My time at AT&T was enjoyable. It was challenging. Wonderful people and great opportunity!"
good,They are flexible with my work style and family life. My supervisor has encouraged me to take the lead on many pertinent tasks and challenges our project faces.
good,"Thankful for he opportunity working for AT&T. was a good job, good pay, but they weren't very helpful when it came to locating to a closer shop to your house. I drove over an hour to and from work each day."
good,This is a great place to work don't get me wrong. The pay is great! There is a great amount of stress that comes along with the job though due to the lack of training on the multiple systems used leaving you unsure on how to do your job when you get out of training. Management expects you to offer on every call or threats of being let go immediately which is totally okay with me but if you don't know how to run the systems it's kind of stressful as well to try and sell something to someone you don't even know how to help.
good,"A typical workday included being the main point of contact for customers, management styles vary but everyone was flexible and very helpful. Tons of information to learn, fast pace environment"
good,"AT&T was a great place to work. They are highly concerned about the customer at every level. "
good,"I enjoyed the people and the working environment. you have to be on time and ready for work. the job can be dangerous. also working outside in the weather is difficult. Overall, i enjoyed my time there."
good,"I went into this job with an open mindset. They provided full 8 hour shifts and multiple commission opportunities were present. However, there’s a lot of stress on numbers and stats on how you do and management really emphasizes that and make it seem as if that’s the most important as opposed to making the customer happy."
good,"A lot of driving time and different challenges at ever turn.  One day splicing cable to installation of services at a customer's home. Work alone a lot of the time.  As long as you are doing your job, my boss just calls to check on your progress.."
good,"With a high pay and access to commission bonuses, this is a lucrative position to those driven to assist and sell with minimal turnover. The environment is great and if you are good with people it is possible to excel very quickly into management and assistant management positions. I recommend it as a good place to establish a high profile career"
good,"Although working at AT&T has its perks (good benefits, steady hours, etc.), they take advantage of the fact that they are a BRAND name. The pay is far below market and you aren't really appreciated or valued. Regardless, most managers are very friendly and helpful and want you to succeed. If you can accept the pay, it can be a great company with potential to move around and move up... use the free training and classes!"
good,"The cultuire of ATT has changed over the last few years. They have held at least 2 layoffs per year since 2015 and that really starts to make you wonder if you have any security.  Most bosses are virtual so do not have any relationship with their employees, except those in their own office.  Makes it hard to relate to them at all."
good,I enjoyed most working days here.  My job was in the elements and demanding when the weather.  Management was fair until Uverse came along.  They let go of many techs and hired kids at less than half the pay.
good,"The job is difficult, but with the right training, the job is manageable.  Over the years, the part that has become unmanageable is the management itself.  The work productivity demands are at a high level, and organization and self initiative are an absolute must to succeed.  Success greatly depends on your level of self determination."
good,I pulled several cases. I worked several hours. And I even worked late to catch up on things I knew need to be done around the hospital. I would do work if other people left and didn't finish their work. I would work more hours than I need.
good,"Excelente  empresa, se  preocupa  por sus  empleados."
good,This title and segment provides the freedom to do your job accordingly as long as you have the drive and self discipline required to be successful. This role has taught me a lot regarding Account and Time Management and it's trickling impact if not tamed correctly. I mostly have enjoyed the freedom to set my day according to the tasks/appointments at hand as well as the online tools/certifications that have helped me hone in on skills needed to become a better partner to our clients. There is however definitely an area of opportunity regarding this company's interdepartmental communication and specific client resources.
good,AT&T offered many excellent opportunities for advancement both within ATT and outside of AT&T by offering a second to none tuition reimbursement and corporate paid certification training in bleeding edge technologies and methodologies.
good,Nice company to work for if you want to do outside activities.  The company can be great for making decent money.  Its slot of politics and can be intimidating to promote up in the company.
good,"Workplace culture can be challenging depending on the organization you reside within at AT&T, mainly because the company is so large.   Overall I would say the culture is what you make it and the company ensures you have the ability to offer input as to what it is."
good,"Working for AT&T was overall a good experience. The company takes care of its employees very well. I worked in a call center. It is a very fast paced environment, but that comes with the job."
good,"Install new service to business and residential locations, also troubleshooting of client concern, issues, and problems of various kinds."
good,AT&T is all about making their customers happy/satisfied.  They are very focused on training their employees to be well-rounded by taking online courses.  Most days are extremely busy and somewhat stressful.  They pay very well.
good,"ATT was a great place to work. I just made a mistake leaving the field and taking a sales job. Sales was not in my blood and was not cut out to sale, more of a worker"
good,"El trabajo de promovendedor es un poco pesado debido a que estas parado, pero ala ves es muy entretenido hay diversidad de clientes. "
good,Having a sales driven job was exciting to me at the time and I had a great experience with customers while working there. Fun incentives and competitions made the work week and month go by fast.
good,"I really enjoy my job and most of the people I work with.  I feel like the position falls right in line with my skill-set.  However, the main drawback has been rotating hours which does not work well with my family life."
good,Good company to work for; however management needs improvement. Waste of time on meetings which not always help to execute and complete projects as planned by upper management.
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone who likes to be a part of a big team, doesn't mind endless HR training, and is just a number to a company. "
good,"flexible work hours, opportunity to work from home, good benefits, etc."
good,Excellent benefits and great place to work awesome people. Management will work with you and try to help you succeed and get you career advancement. Fun atmosphere
good,"AT&T offered me a job with benefits.  It was a challenging job, but one that they provided counseling and some assistance with growth. "
good,Great Pay if you are competitive. The time I was there they were letting people go for odd reasons though. Lot of center closings in other states which can be very stressful but overall the pay out weighed everything
good,"Ok place to work if you can deal with outside elements. Especially working in south Florida, it could be 95 degrees one minute then pouring rain the next. Also depending on your manager some are more helpful but that’s any job."
good,A typical day at work consist of reviewing previous day data.  Also it consist of conference calls.  The culture is collaborative.  There is not really anything that I can say regarding the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
good,Meet and greet customers assessing their needs and provide either product or services to resolution. Shipping and receiving new and relinquished product also cash and inventory audits
good,"This was one of the better paying jobs in Syracuse due mostly to our Union.  However, our office is closing 06/2019.  What a shame to see that corporate greed took over and closed this location to consolidate and move more jobs overseas."
good,Good vibe and people to work with people. Good work space good communication with everyone we did tech appreciate day where we would give them food and drinks just a good job
good,"AT&T is a good place to work, you will be compensated fairly, receive many discounts and benefits. Upper management has no idea what they are doing and the ceo can’t decide what direction the company is headed. Craft employees are union so seniority is everything. The company is currently reducing headcount in staggering numbers, so I wouldn’t suggest AT&T as a long term career"
good,"Es una de las mejores empresas para trabajar, buenas prestaciones, buenos salarios."
good,"Good place to work if your on the tope of the seniority list. good benefits, excellent team. friendly managers. Expecting decrease of  workload,possibly layoff by seniority."
good,"Enjoyed working for AT&T. It was very demanding and challenging but if you worked well, compensation was rewarding. Management fell off the wagon for a while, but after a while things began to catch backup."
good,The experience you adquire is great todevelop your carrer path. You get the chance to learn a lot about Telecommunications market. Also its a sef learning carreer opportunity.
good,"Your offered a lot of benefits like discounts on tv, internet and cell phone as well as full medical, dental, vision, life insurance, and 401k. You are given pto but cannot use it often due to restrictions. Overtime available. Mandatory overtime not frequent. Shift flexibility if you have things to do. Shifts are given based on seniority. Monthly bonuses and incentives. The problem is work/life balance. You’re at work all day it feels like. Bonuses are based on customer feedback which is sometimes unreasonable. They find a lot of issues with what you do so beware of the damned if you do damned if you don’t. Managers are cool but there is some favoritism. Great environment. Everyone is supportive and positive most of the time."
good,"boring at times, but it did have tv's on the production floor."
good,"It was a great place to work, I just had a long drive to get to work on  a daily basis. Every day was a different set of challenges, but in most cases manager would support technician decisions."
good,Typical sales floor environment filled with stressed out Supervisors standing over theiir top producers instead of coaching the weak ones to be better
good,ATT is a good company to work for.  It is very fast paced.  I learned a lot of different jobs with the company and even  traveled for them.  The hardest part of the job was relocating for 6 months.
good,"AT&T pays well and it offers great benefits. The job is unfortunately still retail and dealing with angry customers grows tiresome. There isn't much room for advancement unless you go to management training. If the store you're assigned to as a manager doesn't flourish, you're highly likely to be fired."
good,Horario Flexible. Días de descanso rotativos. Herramientas necesarias para el desarrollo y cumplimiento de metas y objetivos laborales.
good,"It was a fun place to work, they had a lot of great perks, but made it consistently harder and harder to make money because of a changing commission plan."
good,"Recent years, it was slowdown and losing a lot outstanding employees. "
good,"AT&T is a fantastic company to work for.  They start employees off at a competitive wage with benefits and time off.  I worked at a call center, so there seemed to be ""too many chiefs"" at times. The biggest turn off of the job was the sales.  I worked in customer service/billing, but was still expected to meet demanding sales goals (selling cable television, internet, phone lines, etc.) The environment is constantly changing to adapt to technological advancements, so if you can't adapt well, this isn't the company for you."
good,I am proud to be a team member at AT&T. I have learnt a lot from working at AT&T. I have worked with lot of folks who are pioneers in the field and had good mentors while working at AT&T. Thanks
good,"Excellent pay, benefits, and if you desire to work remotely with customer visits this can be ideal.  Quotas difficult to reach because often too busy working on putting out fires."
good,Good benefits and a very traditional management team.  Period of downsizing was a real negative.  Worked there several years before being moved to Lucent Technologies.
good,Overall very well rounded company with good pay and benefits. I have worked here for 2 years but the opportunity for advancement is minimal in my area
good,Overall ok place to work at. Great benefits. Scheduling isn't the best especially is you require work life balance.  Workplace culture is awesome. Can learn a lot here.
good,A good staff and management team. the environment was open and you could communicate with your team because of the open space and the way in which the work rotated around.
good,"Your schedule may always start at 8 A.M., but there is no telling how long your day will last as you will be expected to work until there is nothing left to do.  There is no official attendance policy so often times management has taken the strictest policy they can.  You can be terminated for using the sick days the company gives you."
good,Benefits were good at AT&T but better at BellSouth before the takeover. It was a very stressful work environment even when working remote. There are people outside of your control and when your Project is on the line relying on these people it is very hard to ensure they will do their jobs.
good,"Good company to work for but in process of downsize."
good,DOnt have much to say about company don't have any problems started this job as a young adult put my heart into it also trying to graduate from college still working
good,this is not productive at all in the job search. I just want to be able to apply for jobs and look at what is available. This process is slowing me down
good,Tough work life balance . Great training and opportunity to advance . Be forward thinking and a hard worker and you'll be good!! I would recommend this opportunity
good,"Better sell sell sell, fun overall experience. i was not impressed with the whole management system but you can do it! 7 point system is not fun if you have a family emergency."
good,AT&T is continuously evolving it's network and infrastructure.  It's a great place to learn new skills and technologies and there is potential for advancement if you are able to move around the country.
good,"Good training, good management.  Management and culture seemed good and managers were engaged daily.  Worst part of job was having to drive to office just to pick up work vehicle."
good,Es una empresa que si trata bien a sus trabajadores y al cliente.
good,A typical day would be going into a retail environment and trying to be a personal consultant to our customers. Would provide customer services as well as trying to get customers to obtain new product. When we had down time we would go through B2B procedures as well as try to collaborate on things such as table days or funnels.
good,"Big organization a lot of process, hard to be recognized and advance for career. On the positive side not too much stress and good work life balance in most teams"
good,"This is retail wireless sales. There are constant sales metrics to hit. These vary by day, week, and month. Managers are constantly pushing and stressing sales above everything else. Managers compensation is tied to sales volume."
good,"In order to review AT&T properly I would have to separate the AT&T corporation from the smaller division that I worked with. The people that I worked with particularly were awesome! I really enjoyed working there very much and management was always fair and supportive. The only thing difficult with the job was adapting to the ever-evolving technology. We were constantly getting different call types that we would have to treat a bit more differently then others. "
good,"I enjoyed my job and the work. I was able to work alone and had the freedom of not being tied to one place. The union is very supportive of the technicians if you communicate with then. The company holds us accountable for a lot of errors, or dissatisfied customers, outside of our control. Management does not support their team the way they should when things get rough, and are quick to write up if someone is in their ear. Punishments are handed out far more than praise for good work. Company will lay off as quick as they build up. So much for job security and advancement."
good,Good company to work for. Great benefits. If you love change and fast pace this is the job for you. High sales goals different product you need to sale. every month something different.
good,AT&T taught me many things about myself and the people around me. You will not regret taking the time to work there and enjoy yourself while doing so.
good,"I enjoyed working here, but I wish they were more flexible with the schedule. I had to leave because I wanted some weekends off and I couldn't have any. Also I wanted less hours because I am a full time student as well and they needed to wait a month to cut my hours."
good,No complaints with the job really. Management at my time of employment was very poorly trained. Company expectations often didn't reflect with what management was trying to enforce.
good,Went through 3 managers in the year I was there and each one was diffferent on how they ran things....................................................
good,"Fun place to work if your passion is customer service and fixing things for customers and making them happy. I liked the long drives to different locations and meeting new people. The people i worked with were like my brothers and we always got along and worked together, we always had each others backs. The hardest part of the jobs was the hours and being away from family."
good,A typical day had lots to do and many meeting. There was a bunch of maintenance window work to perform. The hardest part was  the varying schedule between days and nights and the 7/24 on call. The best part was the work was engaging and advanced as technology did.
good,I loved working there the money was great I left because i got sick and my time off was not covered so it caused me to have points. Hopefully I can return in six months.
good,"I worked here years ago when the pay was much better so my opinion will reflect that. That being said, the work/life balance was not good. Other than that I rather enjoyed working for AT&T (primarily for the pay)."
good,Overall good place. Just became too stressful with all the sales. fun environment with good people to work with. management will work well with you to do what you need to improve yourself.
good,"Signing in, checking my email, work orders and calendar for appointments. Working on hardware and software issues, opening and closing tickets. It was a good working environment worked well with colleagues and clients.The hardest part was learning to manage unexpected incidents.The most enjoyable was the friendships that were made."
good,AT&T provides a flexible work schedule for me to manage and lead my team of remote reports.  I work in a cost center to the business so there are always budget pressures.  Overall good culture and leadership.
good,Working at AT&T was a great learning experience and I always enjoyed working with my coworkers. Working with customers on an individual basis made up the bulk of the day and one of the most enjoyable parts.
good,I enjoyed the fast-paced environment. The pay and benefits were certainly a huge part in AT&T showing how much they value their employees. It was the best call center I have ever worked in.
good,it was fun to work for at&t while i was there. But the work culture itself could have been handled a little bit more realistically.Always trained workers when need coaching.
good,"When there were a lot of calls, whether good or bad, it made the shift go by a lot quicker. The people I worked with were great! They're really good on security and making people feel safe and they make sure you know what you're doing before they make you go out on your own."
good,"For as big of a corporation that At&t is, the employees get treated pretty well. Wages are good and negotiated with the union. At&t also has good benefits that they offer employees. The culture can be a little stressful at times, depending on where you work and how much the managers push for the numbers."
good,it was a good part time job. I went to school full time while working for an AT&T Authorized retailer. It wasn't directly for corporate. I made enough to get by.
good,"Typical day at work consists of taking on telecommunication provision orders for various sites all over the country. There are a lot of communication between sales, project managers, and myself. Sometimes customers. Management is fair and reasonable. The most enjoyable part of job is the privilege of teleworking."
good,It was very stressful since you had to clock in at the perfect second and punch out at the perfect time. Only had 3 times if you late or had an emergency and you were terminated
good,"Immediate management treats you like family, however upper management has their own agendas and goals across an area/ market which may or may not be practical for your given store or situation traffic etc. That being said I overall enjoyed my time and experience there and felt I was compensated more than fairly for my time there."
good,"Challenging work place , with never a dull day. Demanding and rewarding. A great family orientated work place, with opportunity for growth and development."
good,"Working at AT&T has been a mostly good experience. The company has invested in its employees for success and advancement. My time with the company was isolated to the Hawaii Islands making much of my experience based on my interactions with primarily my boss in another state. "
good,I've worked there since I graduated from college (last 37 years).  I have had allot of growth opportunities working in several different areas of the corporation.
good,"At&t is a good company with good benefits in place. The work life balance due to retail hours is hard to manage at times. You can be scheduled for an 8 hour day, but depending on customer flow, could be there for much longer which can cause outside scheduling conflicts. Because it is such a large company, customers can be advised many different ways and honoring someone else's commitment is not always an option."
good,I enjoyed my time working at AT&T. There were plenty of days where I had to work 12+ hours but I was ok with the money that came with it. Depending on the area you live in you will either have an amazing management team or one that does not know up from down.
good,"I generally enjoy working at AT&T.  Most of my supervisors have always allowed quite a bit of autonomy, allowing me to do my job to the best of my abilities.  AT&T has quite a bit of online training, though there might not be much related to some positions.  Hours were flexible, pay was great, and benefits were pretty decent."
good,"AT&T is a good place to work. Lately, with the recent reduction in workforce things have gotten pretty unstable. Everyone seems pretty nervous lately."
good,The culture gives you the ability to interact with people on a daily basis. You get to influence and coach your staff to become all they can. You are trained and given the tools needed to be successful.
good,What I enjoyed most about working for AT&T was my direct manager. I did enjoy having the opportunity for some SD work. My only responsibility was firewalls only.
good,"Great benefits, compensation and life balance. There is no job security as they merge constantly other companies. Too many constant trainings that might not help on your role."
good,"AT&T allowed the various business units and organizations to really own their culture, allowing each group to develop its own culture that aligned with the over all culture."
good,"Overall AT&T is a great place to work, although you may encounter organizational/management challenges. The pay is great and there are many opportunities for educational and career growth."
good,I was able to learn a lot of customer based skills. They do give you the opportunity to advance although it may take a while. They also have good benefits.
good,"É uma empresa gigante globalmente, porém no Brasil não possui um quadro de funcionários tão grande. "
good,"It was stressful when there was a lot of work, but it was a great job that provided for my family for several years. Many of the people became good friends of mine."
good,Good company overall. I was unfortunately caught up in workforce reduction only 5 months prior to being fully invested in my retirement benefits package. This timing seemed to be very suspicious considering I was far more qualified than other managers that were retained.
good,"Great benefits, great co workers, cutting edge of technology. Continuous learning. Discounted services. Opportunities to travel from state to state. Opportunities for advancement."
good,"If you’re looking for decent pay with management that doesn’t care about you, this is your place. There’s really no room for advancement. You’ll have work but you won’t be appreciated."
good,Hard work but easy to do long hours you dont ever know what time your getting off and with all the technology changes there just looking to lay to many people off no job security
good,"Good pay, Good Insurance, Good Fringe Benefits. Initial training is usually very good. I worked on the company for 15 years in different capacities. Good company to work for through retirement. Unfortunately, the part of the company I was working for was sold to YP Holdings, to separate the advertising part of the company. I would have stayed with AT&T, had I had the chance."
good,Fast paced. High Stress. Amazing pay. Good benefits. Organization and consistency is an issue. Job security is an issue if the manager is gunning to get you out. But overall it’s a great door opener for other incredible opportunities!
good,I've been with the company since 2007 and turned it from a job into a career. I've forged a number of strong relationships and long lasting friendships from people i've met throughout my time.
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for, but as a seasoned network engineer and dedicated enterprise technology professional, the focus on mobility and content delivery such as TV has the company's main mission moving away from my core competencies."
good,"Overall good company, worked for them for over 25 years - lots have changed but it still remains a big corporation who is looking at their bottom line.  Top down protocols rigid and often aren't realistic in the real world.  Otherwise, good pay and benefits and opportunities to work your way up as long as you work hard and perform well."
good,Tiene un excelente servicio y buen ambiente laboral.
good,A typical work day involves having a conference call every Monday through Friday to discuss today's agenda. I get in my company car and drive to dispatches to talk about promotions and services.
good,"A strong company with many benefits.  Focused on emerging technologies and corporate success.  However, employees are constantly challenged by layoffs and restructuring."
good,It was an ok Company to work for. Work/Life balance was kind of hard to deal with. Management sucked. It was a very political place to work at. But all in all they paid well
good,"AT&T has become a rapidly-changing place to work over the past several years as the company works to re-position itself as a modern entertainment and media company and move away from its previous image of ""Ma Bell"".  "
good,Great opportunity for skills development however not much time to pursue due to work and all online; compensation and discounts great; culture is to surplus to meet yearly expectations which is also difficult to have motivation.  Seems to be occurring much more that prior years.
good,Extremely sales driven role. They require you to sell to every customer you come in contact with and are not sympathetic to the customers issues. Management is a joke as they do little to help daily. Training was horrible. They put you in the job unprepared and expect results. Pay was good and commission is paid out monthly so that a plus.
good,"I would load operating systems onto Cisco and Netgear routers and switches, update existing configuration, write new configurations and work on installation teams for hardware upgrades and replacements.  Some work would be done from the office and some from my home office especially when that work was done at night.  I also performed network trouble shooting to determine why a corporate network was slow or inaccessible.  I enjoyed my work team and my last several managers were great to work for.  The hardest part of the job was when AT&T would downsize and force my work teams to disband and lose their job especially when the work was out sourced overseas.  It was a thrill to install a new computer network and bring it online and know that my configurations and operating systems I installed were working and correct."
good,"Field work is hard in it self working in all weather conditions."
good,There are great opportunities for advancement in a technically advanced communications company. They are truly equal opportunity. There is no more diverse company than AT&T. It is professional but the departments I worked in (construction/engineering and network services/maintenance) were relaxed. The company is demanding of timeliness and attendance and they don't relax those standards in any department. It is a very good company to work for.
good,I would prefer not to comment in this forum. I would prefer to answer any questions of this nature in a face to face as I feel you can only get a real understanding of my role and opinions in that format.
good,"Good opportunities with a large company, Exciting job duties and working with experienced co-workers who strive to deliver exceptional results for success."
good,Did not work in retail.  Strictly business to business mobile solutions.  It was a great ride however when they imposed quotas on internet and land line solutions it became impossible to succeed.  I always met goals for mobility and other solutions. the pricing and expectations of internet and landline growth were not realistic because we had no infrastructure to support it and were not competitive.
good,Working at AT&T is a company that has lots of changes.  The salary is great but you will work for the money. nonstop high pace work environment with changes happening overnight
good,Wonderful benefits however not great work/life balance. Did not like that there was little grace on time limit to assist customers on the phone. Felt like numbers were more important than really helping people out.
good,"Coached Sales Representatives to close Sales and Manage"
good,Corporate Culture is constantly pressuring. Great coworkers and internal store culture. Management was stagnated and caused their laziness to come back on store employees. I was written up for the most ridiculous things just because management training was absent.
good,"You learn different things from the get go, they teach you what they can in their university but you’ll get the real feel of it on the actual job. They will always make you try to do better or do jobs that you already know can’t be done. There’s always confrontation at some level because you didn’t meet your numbers etc... Your coworkers are in the same boat but will jump ship because they’re afraid of the management. You have a union that tries their absolute best, overall the working experience was great. Dealing with management was the worst, in order to try to do everything they ask of you most people cut corners and if you’re not in someone’s good side they’ll get on you for cutting those corners."
good,"The job is a great entry into the job market fresh out of college. Job security is not always there due to yearly layoffs. Also once in sales very difficult to get out. You can progress within the sales organization, but never get out of sales."
good,"The company provided good environment for their employee and they also have management training for those agents who want to step up the ladder."
good,"I started working at AT&T in 2012 with a BA in mathematics. I believe I was the only one in my store with a college degree. my starting salary was $12.95 and after 3 years, I was paid close to $17 for my hourly pay only  and I was paid on commission depending how much I hit my goal each month. my best months were november and december, where I made four to five thousand dollars each month. But I was the top sales person ranking on the top 5 in the midwest region. Because ranking is so competitive, I tend not to take many personal days off even when needed. most sales representatives work over time since you won't get to leave if you are with a customer and your shift is over or if there is a queue. I was asked or rather scheduled a 6th day once in a while and that was if someone was on vacation/sick or during holidays. I worked during holidays and weekends. overall the pay is great for someone without a degree but the hours are awful for someone with a degree"
good,"working for att is very stressful but good at the same time. there is a lot that is required of you and you are not able to make 1 mistake. so many numbers and metrics to meet but it is good money, all I will say is take your time and take care of our customer, one little mistake can get you fired."
good,"a typical night at work would include going through the medal detectors, clocking in going to my station and grading iPhones and Samsung LG based on their appearance and functions"
good,"Get ready to sell DirecTV.  At&t spent alot of money on DirecTV so now they are trying to recoup. Management will micromanage  you and only ask you if you offered the customer DirectTv. They do not care about cell phones anymore. Fraud is rampant with Direct Tv Now because there is alot of pressure to sell the streaming services in a time when customers are cord cutting. At&t is a union job but if you have a shady manager they will make you feel like your job isnt secure. The Time Warner merger may be reversed so who knows what will happen. My advice if you dont want a high stress job, I would avoid At&t. They like to outsource and will try to sell corporate stores to authorized retailers by 2020."
good,"Well structured, great level of processes, easy to join team and know what you're supposed to do, very little ambiguity, informative and useful meetings, not a lot of wasted time."
good,"When I worked at AT&T I loved it! There was just a lot of turmoil on the management side, it became very tense. The opportunity to help people learn about technology was very fulfilling."
good,The work flow is maddening after being there for so long. Honestly I’m tired of working customer service from a desk. Retail allows you to move around throughout the day and feel less sedentary.
good,AT&T rates employees on call metrics when they should be looking at the overall ability of the representative to handle a customer issue to conclusion.
good,"At&t provided good pay and bonuses along with management training, advancement opportunities and good benefits. However, some departments were very sales driven and caused some employees lots of stress."
good,Offers good working conditions and great benefits. Job training opportunity are available. Provides challenging and satisfying work. Management people skills requires improvement.
good,As long as you meet your metrics in productivity and quality with job requirements you can maintain however the constant badgering about those metrics which comes an old form of management and can be a little overbearing when associates are wanting to keep their jobs cause
good,"I learned a lot about AT&T business units"
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar siempre y cuando te toque un buen gerente, hay varios que son difíciles de tratar pero en si el ambiente es bueno"
good,Workung1 at At&t was a great experience. With them I learned to individually care and solve any customer issue or concern. Clean and friendly company. Managers are well trained to train and provide At&t Respresentatives with extensive and detailed knowledge of the company and it's purpose.
good,It was a fun environment until they closed the center.  We did have massage chairs in the entertainment center. Overall I enjoy my job working at AT&T and I am very sad that they closed our center.
good,Had Been Working For The Company 6 Years. Traveled And Worked In Wisconsin For 7 Of The Months And My Job Wasn’t Retained When I Moved Back Home. The Managers Are Open-minded And Willing Yo Pivet When Need Be.
good,"I left a few years ago, so know that the union has been working to improve things.  Like most places it's really a matter of who your managers and their bosses are.  They're very numbers driven to meet goals even as the board makes decisions that lose business to T-Mobile."
good,There is always another position but not always in the area that works for you.  The call-center aspect and communication between locations could use some work.
good,Much of my grief with ATT was not due to their actions but the changing market. There is less room for growth. This makes it difficult to advance without relocation.
good,"on a typical day i would check my sales goals, and start approaching every customer at the door with a pleasant greeting. I learned how to use different sales tactics to excite customers about the products we offer. Management was shaky at times, several changes in management left employees to train other employees while selling.For the most part management was helpful when there. The culture was always fun and competitive.  The hardest part of the job was trying to add on more accessories or insurance on products, but i almost did it every time. The most enjoyable part of the job was reaching number one in sales goals."
good,Great company. Has it’s benefirs just like any other company but once you are in management everything changes. Work life balance could be better but overall I love this company.
good,"Since I worked at AT&T via  consultant agency my opinion about AT&T would not really be valid."
good,"A good place to work, people are generally very strong.  Commission structures are complicated and difficult to maximize.  Fair amount of recent turn over in sales positions."
good,The cafeterias are wonderful. They have a complete range of healthy food all the way to 'cardiac on a plate' if you so desire. I wish more places had in house food like this.
good,"It's all about pushing the shareholder's agenda to the phone customers. You are the face of the company. Unique customer service and sales role. Customer's think you are a technician, when you are really a commissioned sales person that is encouraged to use unethical sales practices."
good,This was a good job. Very respectable except for union employees who got away with almost everything and anything including theft. I had little control over employees who were protected by the union. Management was not union.
good,Not as great as it used to be in terms of employee loyalty... similar to other companies under transition.  Great opportunity to gain skills and try different types of functions.
good,AT&T was a good company to work for.  Gave adequate training and compensated for good work and meeting quotas.  Company is no longer around.  Shipped jobs overseas.
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits and a great work culture. The only issue was at the time the standing the entire time during shifts was difficult on my back and legs.
good,Consistent work with supervision that cares. Outside work in all weather conditions. Been doing this type of work for over 20 years. A new experience for me far as learning about satellite dish.
good,"install and repair Cable, Phone, Internet services provide by ATT. Must have valid Driver License to work for ATT must be able to work in Hot or Cold weather in close spaces and good customer service skill tp help serve customer needs"
good,I worked on many projects and with various managers.  Some are good and some not so much.  But AT&T makes a lot of management changes.  I am not happy with my new manager.
good,My workplace has evolved into an entertainment and data driven business which is completely different from the work I was hired to do at the start of my AT&T career.  As AT&T has transformed as a company I have been able to adapt and excel in my position.  I have taken on various roles to diversify my skill set.  Working as a project coordinator I was able to transform our office's focus towards achieving high customer service scores based of customer surveys.   Mentoring my peers has been the most rewarding part of my career and I take pride in helping them grow and exceed the company's expectations.
good,"I have enjoyed my time with AT&T, as I started off as a CSR on the phones under DIRECTV. The fast pace environment is what I enjoy, but I need more challenges in my day to day operations."
good,"good company to work for for advancement and opportunities."
good,"Starts an inbound customer service position to correct bills and basic account needs. But is required to turn into a sales opportunity for other products that are difficult to sell.  Offering multiple products on every call is a must regardless of the reason the customer called in. Its gets very stressful balancing good customer service and making management happy. "
good,"This place will definitely help you keep your head above water, but the management is underhanded and sneaky. This job definitely taught me a lot of discipline."
good,AT&T has been a great company to work for. After several years I was able to become a full time teleworker. I worked on projects from home and was accountable based on my performance. Not much room for growth.
good,"AT&T is a very low stress work environment. When I interned at the company, I was put on a very good team with good mentors. Others were unlucky and didn't have as much work to do during their internship. Overall I learned a lot, but the experience is very team dependent."
good,Great company to invest a furture in. Great retirement and health plan. AT&T allows you to grow and find a better opportunity in different areas of the company.
good,"The culture was great ! Enjoyed working there with the staff , Management was very good. It was not professional enough for me. A very young culture. I had a pre-teen at the time so mandatory overtime was not good for me."
good,I felt as if the rapport of the work site went on a downward motion after changes made to the company. Job security was a thing a stake. New rules and procedures were bot tolerable. Layoffs as well.
good,no review at this time.. It is a good place to work.. the company provides good incentives for there employees. I would recommend it to anyone... it is a fun place as well at times...
good,"Lo que pude aprender son las cosas básicas cuando se trata de poder revistar soluciones para problemas de modem o conexión de internet. He podido ver qué tipo de sistema se usa para el servicio de internet proporcionado por AT&T. Por lo regular, hay de todo un poco cuando se trata de los distintos tipos de persona que atienden en cada llamada y aquellos que son demasiado tercos o no escuchan razones son difíciles de tratar, sobre todo porque se siguieron todos los pasos necesarios y se les brindó toda la información pertinente."
good,AT&T is great place for learning the basics of a salesman. As I went up the AT&T chain it was a great place to be but the work life balance with having a new born made it stressful.
good,"System Issues constantly- At&T Internal systems are behind time and has issues with new promotions and offers. No other complaints!"
good,"I genuinely enjoyed my time at AT&T. They had an amazing benefits program and a very generous commission system."
good,"I absolutely loved working here.  It was never boring, very fast paced, and you were given breaks and a full 1 hour lunch.  The compensation was decent and the overall work experience was very positive."
good,ambiente trnquilo con beneficios provechosos en la empresa
good,"Outside of the shift bids, it was a great place to work. Preferred morning shifts over nights. There was still the option to get full time benefits working 35+ hrs weekly. The pay was great, benefits,and discounts, and bonuses were great!! Dont know if they have put in a cafeteria there, but that would be a plus."
good,"AT&T is a fast growing, forward looking, fast paced, results oriented  organization. The job is demanding but the company provides extensive training and have well established and strict guidelines for performance and safety."
good,I have enjoyed the opportunities and challenges that my current company has provided for me. I have been afforded a wealth of learning opportunities and schools.
good,"Fun work environment. Good management. Customers are the hardest part of the job, so you have to be patient and understanding when speaking to customers who have issues."
good,"Good respectfully management, you will want to come to work just for them. The paid is decent amount. Opportunity to to move up and the company. You can pull as much overtime you want."
good,Overall AT&T was a good place to work.   The employee discounts for the phones services were great.  The severance package for force reduction was also good.
good,"Working in AT&T's Small Business Mobility department provided me with amazing corporate employee discounts, especially on my cell phone accounts and Uverse."
good,"I have worked with many changes through out the years, things typically change and then come full circle. The health benefits are very nice as well as some great discounts."
good,Great organization and work distribution.  Weekly deadlines and there was overall tension of loosing job as the company was shutting down its operation in this location
good,"Good pay for the work, not very great benefits , management was great, very good at what they do, employees were very friendly and helpful, customers are stressful at times but all in all very pleasant"
good,"good company to work for. 21 years. Don't regret any! Flexible work, SME, good benefits, overall happy in my tenure with AT&T. I would go back in a different capacity."
good,Empresa voltada ao crescimento e servir bem aos clientes.
good,I enjoy my job with AT&T. I have a demanding schedule and I juggle several things during the day. Typically at work I work with 20ish people that need my assistance all at once. I thrive in this kind of work place.
good,"Important, critical thinking, environment driving individuals to focus on daily functions and career growth encouraging staff to always leverage their time."
good,"I worked at AT&T for 30 years until I was laid off recently. I started at the bottom as an operator and left as a System Engineer in an IT role. AT&T paid for 2 degrees, one undergraduate and a master’s degree. For me the education and the training opportunities were great. Although, I would say now there are a lot of people taking advantage of the training opportunities but there are not enough positions for those employees that would like to advance in the company. In fact, the company is reducing cost so the opportunity to use the training will probably come outside of AT&T for most. "
good,"I worked for AT&T for 17 years and the company always look to sure up an experienced employee team oriented environment looking to challenge the competition in all aspects of entertainment, informational technology and now social media."
good,"Working for AT&T is pretty decent. The major drawback is the difficulty of moving into management, particularly if you start in a Union position. My Union position hamstrings my advancement; I have applied for 240+ internal management positions, and despite having earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees and completed over 850 AT&T classes, I have only been allowed to actually interview for four positions."
good,My job was very enjoyable in that I was given authority and free license to recommend services to my customers that would ultimately be a necessity to keep their companies flourishing with new technology and at the same time ensuring that they are content with the product and interaction. Which is a win win for me and my company.
good,"Depending upon your workgroup, you can either flounder or succeed. Lateral moves aren't always easy. Same with managers, if you have a good one things go well. Otherwise, its a challenge to work each day."
good,"Great place to work if you're in an entry level sales spot, once you go into a different position things become more stressful and less protected as you leave the union"
good,I was able to gain knowledge on how to do troubleshoot internet and emails. AT&T have tools to make agents work more efficient. The hardest part of the job is to do troubleshooting with elderly people
good,This is a good place to work. If you want to build a career at AT&T there are many opportunities for advancement because it is a very large company with operations spanning across the globe. You just have to be willing to play the politics game like any other corporate setting.
good,Worked with technical environment and professionalism. Helping people with a new network on copper line and troubleshooting bandwidth and package delivery was exciting and fun.
good,Things have changed from when I was there so I can't full comment on how things are since that was 6 years ago. Management was decent since they had many technicians to deal with on a daily basis
good,"At the time of my employment here I was ranked number 1-5 out of 23,000 representatives. It was a competitive atmosphere which pushed me harder to be the best each and every day. I enjoyed getting to work with the customers and to meet their needs. Each customer was different and that made it more exciting to get to fit each their needs into a plan that would better suit them."
good,"This job isn't for the faint of heart.  You need to be able to keep up with technology or you WILL fall behind."
good,Very hard work well compensated. Given neccessary tools to complete the job. A lot of temporary positions so you don't know how long you will have a job
good,"A typical day at at&t is different for everyone depending on your division."
good,"Learned The Endless Growing Industry of Technology. A Very Fast Pace Work Enviroment. Hardest Part Of The Job Was Poor Management. The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job Was Helping Customers, Especially The Elderly Ones That Needed That Little Extra Patience, and Helping My Peers."
good,satisfied. great company and great benefits in comparison to others. the perks will KILL YOU if you leave! the department will determine your happiness.
good,"The pay and benefits were great to have and the same level co-workers made the place tolerable.  Management however has no idea  how to actually manage as a whole.  There are a few managers that work well with the agents but the majority of them read numbers, and constantly badger agents to meet certain quotas/aspects of the position.  There's literally a set of people that just go around finding reasons to start problems, and this isn't a compliance or policy check either.  The job was a great experience overall, but due to health issues created by the job (anxiety and elevated blood pressure) I had to leave.  If you can handle being a verbal punching bag and always told you can always do better without much show for what you're doing right then this job is for you."
good,Very monotonous work. Work anywhere but any of the call centers.Things can change on a dime so be prepared for constant change due to technology.  Good salary for what it was.
good,It is a very good place to work. You get a company phone and Ipad to bring home for work us only. The training is a long process. I was not able to stay due to missing one question on a written test on the last day of training.
good,"My job was to manage and work on call routing projects.  "
good,I worked as a Sales Representative in the call center.  It was an undercover job.  Customers called thinking it was customer service and I had to upsell.  If you are good at sales and enjoy a call center environment then this is the career for you!
good,"This was a good career for me for 31 years that involved lots of time spent away from my family, working long hours for good pay.  When we had good managers the job was good, when the manager was bad, the job became very stressful. The benefits were very good and allowed me to retire at an early age through good money management in my personal life."
good,"My experience met all of my expectations, although the pressure applied by management seem to be a bit much. I believe that it was the location I was at rather than the company as a whole. Great benefits, great pay, but a ton of micro managing."
good,I enjoyed working for them but I was just not able to make the money that a single parent needs to make. They give you the tools to be able to sell but the compensation wasn’t what I think it should be.
good,"I have worked for the company 32 years.  As with all companies we have went through many transitions.  AT&T was a communication company that has transformed itself into a Global Technology Company.  Unfortunately, there has been much downsizing and I would not consider leaving the company, but I am being forced to relocate to Texas in order to remain in my position.  There are very few positions available in Michigan anymore."
good,"ATT is a face paste work environment . I have learned how to be empathetic to people I don't even know. Using 5 or more systems at 1 time to resolve technical issues , I have become excellent in multitasking. The hardest part of the job would be keeping your composure while dealing w/ very difficult customer. In the end remaining calm , and being professional even the most upset customer will calm down if the representative stays calm. That's been my greatest take away from ATT. The most enjoyable part of the company is company discounts."
good,AT&T I feel has always been a fair company to work for.  They are trying to change things up and adding channels like the In-Home channel which are great until they put managers are their last chance in there.  Then this person changed all the schedules we were promised and wont work with anyone.
good,"Working at AT&T was an exciting job, it was a new platform that I had never experienced before. You must be good at upselling and sales in general to do well at this job. Commission and perks are paid to those who can sell the most, and customer service definitely falls behind sales. This was a unique experience and one I'm glad I took, though it was not my cup of tea. At&t is a nice company to work for and treat their employees fairly."
good,"This is a nice job to have when you are fresh out of high school or college. It's good enough to get you through your life when you don't have that many bills. However, this job is not enough live on. If you are trying to support a family this is not the job for you."
good,"Supported 1000 Systems, Hardware and Software. Application support, Network support wired and wireless. Security support, and remote VPN support for off site employees."
good,They are very work oriented and is a good place to work. They are not a very stable place to work due to high turn over rate but you can make very good money with the bonuses.
good,"I give at&t a 2.5 Review based on the fact that they hired us and less than 6 months later, the location where I  was working shut down and the only options were to resign or relocate to cities hours away."
good,"Great place to work, your on your own and do your jobs at your pace. Somewhere new every day, work in all kinds of weather, install, troubleshoot and repair. overtime every day. Bad thing is that every contract we get stuff taken away and work duties increase."
good,"You can move up in the company if you know the right people.  In the group I was in, doing a great job was not enough, you also had to pat your managers back."
good,If you're use to or have previous call center experience and have excellent customer service skills then this job is for you. The only thing I have bad to say is that some managers could be hired from outside with no experience through the company which can be very difficult because you're constantly going around asking other team managers how to solve problems due to your manager not knowing how to solve any issues.
good,Same as before same work place. same description than before. nothing different. same camaraderie. Same job with different title.is just a title not a position
good,"It is a company that I believe can be very inconsistent, but it does provide good pay and benefits along with a Union. I only wish management was a consistent along with rest of the company."
good,"work in all weather conditions, usually always busy with work, may work long hours each day, may take longer to complete a job if your a new tech or just learning trade"
good,"The company has been gearing up to complete the Time Warner purchase.  Restructuring the company with large layoffs and organizational changes to ease the transition into being an all in one media, mobility, and network provider."
good,"-Typical Day starts around 8am, and ends around 7pm"
good,AT&T is an enormous company with a reputable identity.  They have many systems in place for the same function (i.e. Instant Messaging) and have neglected standardizing their internal IT systems and infrastructure.  Otherwise a challenging and competitive environment with an employee culture that has the will to win.
good,Good company to work BUT rotational shifts which makes difficult.
good,As a prem tech there was several years we were Non management and non union when the union finally negotiated a contract prem techs were basically screwed
good,"Not a career move for those who are driven. Good place to get some training and learn to run a territory, selling to small/medium sized businesses. Hard to make any real money in telecom these days."
good,The sales are easy to make if you can simply hold a conversation and be  friendly with the customers. My main reason for leaving was the fact that advancement takes a very long time and is awarded more off of tenure than off of numbers and performance.
good,"Teamwork is a must. The work is hard when you are a Door to door salesman because you have to be on top of your game and not let a ""no"" discourage you."
good,AT&T provides a fantastic environment for starting a career as they will invest in the employee in order to get them ready for their current role but also a future role.
good,"I left the company several years ago, but while I was employed there, they provided good career opportunities and benefits.  They had a diverse workforce, including many women and minorities in high-level management positions."
good,"A typical day was first organizing the appointments to manage time efficiently. There were task driven efforts and it was a source of many little victories. The accounts that the company entrusts to the rep is significant and a great inspiration to meet and exceed expectations.The contests and rewards were awesome and I won them many times, better daily victories, then finally the income was terrific if you had all the smaller successes."
good,"I worked remotely with very few office visits. My work had to my only exposure but I did receive public acknowledgement on conference calls."
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with. The manager was not such a good person. I enjoyed the type of work I found it very challenging. I was allowed to make decisions based on my experience.
good,Buena empresa aunque podría mejorar en muchos aspectos
good,"Es un buen trabajo en cuestión de horarios, comodidad, hay buena disposición por parte de los supervisores, el salario es justo."
good,"Day begins at 7a.m., load equipment & supplies, be out of the yard in a timely manner so you can make it to the 1st am ticket on time. Greet the customer & verify the work order matches what they have in mind so everyone is on the same page. Then proceed to wire the home for voice, data & video, I have to say the hard part is the attic work when it is 98 degrees outside, but in most cases the wiring can be completed from the outside of the home. Once the wiring is complete you can install the modem for internet and the set top boxes for their video service, most phone jacks are in place & just need to be reconnected. Once all services are working it is time to educate the customer, Briefly describe the services that were installed and show them the controls and functions they will be using to operate the equipment. Answer any questions they may have, clean up the work space and it's off to the next customer. The best part about the job is you are always going to a different location to work, meeting new people. It gives you a sense of freedom driving from job to job even though you are at work."
good,"Working in a call center is hard work sometimes. You go in, clock in and start taking in bound calls. Never knowing what kind of call you are going to receive! And they are never the same! Could be about billing, a reset on the device, or maybe you have to transfer it over to technical. Could be a new order, or if it's someone wanting to cancel their service, transfer to another department for them to save them from canceling."
good,"AT&T is for those who wish to have no normal life. You are always working and the pay is amazing but why have so much money if you have no time to spend it. This is a job for those who do not have a family and just like to work. They don't respect your work schedule. For example, if you have reached your 8 hours they still expect you to stay longer if more customers arrive or if your stuck with a customer they don't provide a back up when its your time to leave. "
good,"Work days were very intense, constantly having to make sales and offers.  Management tried to make the days more fun by having fun activities and giving out treats if you were able to land a sale. Everyone got along with each other and helped one another in a tough situation. Hardest part is making the sales goal, when you're unable to have customers purchase new things from the company. Most enjoyable thing is helping people with thier ATT issues"
good,"PC culture is starting to take over.  It used to be a fun, challenging place to work as a technician, and usually still is.  The prospects for learning new technology are excellent."
good,"Management gets moved around a lot, so you go through quite a few managers in a short time.  Job can pay well if you sell a ton, especially for what you are a required to do.  Sometimes you get volun-told for things."
good,The site itself if accessible to where I was staying. The account I was handling was the easiest among all the Line of Business for AT&T as we only check appointment updates and contact the necessary department if needed.
good,"•Actively develops new relationships"
good,The managers and coworkers were very accommodating and sort of took me under their wing to show me the ropes. Overall a great learning experience during my time with the company.
good,Being professional both written and language communication. Acknowledging and respecting others effort and output.Give credit where credits is due and being objective and subjective.
good,"It's a fun place to work depending on which store you land at management can be excellent or rough, the pay is pretty good but expect for directv to be shoved down your throat"
good,"Employee relationships is the one of the best I have experienced. When it comes to upper management at the VP level, they don't seem too engaged with the team they represent."
good,I work for ove et 10years for the exception of my last manager I feel as ATT was a good place for employees.  I neclvet had issues and most times enjoyed my work.
good,well we come in have short meeting then start our day answering incoming calls going over bills an ech cutomers how to understanding there bills helping with trouble shooting
good,"The company is a great company to grow with, if you are determined and dedicated. Lots of money to be made, if you can master the art of time management you will be able to have work life balance, but it is not easy."
good,"Since I started working at AT&T, there have been very busy, crazy days and there have been some very simple, fast-paced days.  I work in an inbound call center, assisting customers with processing payments, setting up payment arrangements, changing data plans, researching product upgrades with pricing, review and explain detailed billing, process adjustments up to $25.00 per account, and add/remove features from devices as needed."
good,"ATT  pays a lot however I was forced to resign having health issue with my back looking to start a new career elsewhere.if you are looking to make between 70,000 and 100,000 go for it"
good,typical wireless sales situation. could use better work to life schedules.  pay has gone down consistantly over the years.  good management advancement for top sellers.
good,"I have not complaints about salary here because I was well-compensated.  However, the transition from Ameritech to SBC to At&t brought continued tactics to get rid of top paid employees and unreasonable sales goals."
good,"Good company to work for in terms of company culture, collaborative efforts and productivity. A lot of opportunity to test concepts and potential solutions from a UX perspective."
good,It was a good job but I never saw it as a career and was never able to advance to upper level management.  I was pigeon holed into a life of retail and now struggle to find anything outside of it.
good,"Working hard, fulfilling my responsibilities, and receiving positive performance reviews have not made a difference in my position."
good,"Good company must be able to relocate in order to continue advancing."
good,"Love the job, Just very poor management hire up. (district manager/ Regional manager) I have learned a lot in this job and especially about technology, phones and tablets. The most enjoyable part of the job is selling and making extra commission checks. Hardest part of the job is learning all of the promotions and memorizing them."
good,"I felt like they weren't honest about the salary. I was told the commission would be more than it was, Sales were heard to make at this location. They have a good training program"
good,"I refer friends here for the money and the  benefits, if nothing else. Do NOT FORGET to join the Communications Workers Union! Not expensive and worth every penny."
good,"Sales pressure is high, you required to meet your numbers. they do teach you how to build immediate rapport with customer and make knowledgeable sales recommendation,"
good,"Great benefits and perks...but demanding job.  Strict on attendance so if you have kids don't expect in understanding.  Stats are what makes this job....if you can't meet their expectations of stats you will eventually be terminated.  Stats, in my opinion, are unrealistic."
good,"AT&T is on the forefront of change and global influence with their recent growth beyond the mobile phone industry. As an intern, I was exposed to the initial process of consulting and problem solving for an internal solution. Management looked to us for critical thinking and real solution implementation despite our temporary position."
good,"From beginning to end the day is non-stop.  Start with a quick team meeting and set up riding along with techs for the day."
good,"AT&T is an exciting company to work for.  However, advancement is no longer that easy.  It is very hard to move around to other opportunities in the company.  The benefits are great and it is nice to be part of a leading edge company.  Telecommuting is accepted in most areas of the business; but the number of days per week needs to be negotiated/approved.  The learning opportunities are very available and accessible.  The education training is first rate."
good,Dynamic environment.  Ability to move within the company.  This allowed for many different opportunities.  Good system of promotions and advancement.  Treated as a professional and with respect.
good,"Helpful, skilled people in the IT arena.  Typical day had several phone meetings, adequate time to perform my job duties, and some additional time to learn additional skills."
good,"AT&T is a fast-paced work environment. During each interaction, you're expected to bring up and talk about TV, Internet, Cell Phones, Business vs. Personal use, friends, recreation, occupation, insurance, various accessories, and also demo all these items for each customer. "
good,Typical day at work was fun and challenging. I learned team building skills and Leadership skills. The culture was great everyone had a fun loving attitude that was ready to succeed.
good,"fast paced, want you to answer calls as quick as possible, talk to people all over the world, deal with difficult people at times maybe 1 or 2 calls per day, feeling of accomplishment when you help a customer, training is decent, they do listen to your calls. pay is good,benefits good, 401k."
good,Great company overall that is invested in their employees. The role of Store Manager is difficult because you have to face the pressures of upper management direction and potential non producing consequences along with driving your team to achieve the goals you have for everyone to succeed. It's not hard but it can be stressful and alot of times it's easy to feel alone in trying to get everything accomplished.
good,"I reported to the Director of the Service Level Management team, the Reporting Analyst plays a key role in providing the Client as well as internal AT&T Life Cycle Management (LCM) teams with vital business information reports and recommendations based upon diverse data sources."
good,"Great co-workers, management was ok (as a whole they did not seem trained to manage people only numbers). Call center was more stressful than it needed to be, but honestly the people I worked with were great people and I miss them a lot. The co-workers made it  a good place  !"
good,"It had its ups and downs, but I wouldn't trade my experiences with my fellow former co workers for anything. Very hard company to work for, but it can be very rewarding despite the very high daily stress factors."
good,Running support for all customer related issues and back office assistance for the technicians in the field. Good management and work environment was great. The hardest part was juggling different issues when you may not have handled one particular call in several months. Best part was the work staff and the challenge of solving problems on your own.
good,Supervisor and others wanted me to falsify my signature on company documents to receive government funding of OSP not damage due to Hurricane disaster
good,Pero cambian te cambian mucho de zonas no siempre es algo fijo
good,"I have learned many skills and lessons with my career, multi tasking with a customer service emphasis. I learned many skills, including the life skill of endurance and being able to adjust to changes on a regular basis while being thankful for my career."
good,Technology is fun!  It is changing all the time so its fun in the sense that there is always new technology to learn.  This company did a great job at taking care of their employees.  Lots of activities and relationship building activities outside of work.
good,Interesting projects that were at the cutting edge of technology.  Highly educated and talented work colleagues.  Great learning environment.  Always a challenge.
good,they should be more careful about how to choose people who will represent such a big company. the manager was not responsible for her job at all spend all day outside the store
good,The typical day was answering calls from customers and addressing whatever issue they had. we had 3 breaks a day. i learned a lot about soft skills and deescalating customers. management was overall well ran. there was good workplace culture and environment with lots of incentives for doing the job well. the hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. and the most  enjoyable part of the job was the interaction we had with the more enjoyable customers.
good,"Working in Sales in NY was a fun and rewarding place, however, HQ in a support role was not exciting and stressful and lacked good leadership.  Many changes occurred over the past 15 years."
good,"High workload and changing requirements made for a stressful environment, but the work was very interesting and had many opportunities for challenges to make the day fun despite them usually being long."
good,"I worked in several of the locations and most all of the management is great and the money is not terrible. Very fast paced when busy, but could be dead for hours when slow."
good,"At&t was overall a good job, there was a lot of travelling involved, a lot of wear and tear on my car. At times a very stressful enviornment , but there was also employee gratitude. Every job has strengths and weaknesses."
good,RF Optimization weekly recommendation of optimization changes to improve KPI.
good,"Working for DirecTV was educational and helped me build my people skills, working in a call center had its challenges as we had to keep our call time down as well as resolve the issue of the people calling in. I feel the pay could have been better but I always had the greatest Team Leaders."
good,in RCMAC i provisioned POTS orders and as a tester i pretested and turned up t0 circuit orders. It was very challenging and sometimes frustrating work. i learned all about how circuits are designed and how they work.
good,This was a good job and offered great benefits with the ability to earn unlimited income.  It was very competitive and you need a lot of discipline and time management.
good,Very interesting jobs.  I had several jobs at AT&T with the best being as a Technical Training Instructor.  Always helping people each day made the job very rewarding.
good,Working for AT&T is a great position for someone just starting in sales that wants to learn the sales process. If however you are a seasoned professional there are other jobs that pay much better in compensation.
good,"AT&T, gave me great work environment, but my department work load was transferred to Texas..., I have worked at this company for 20 yrs.., good benefits, and pay...."
good,"AT&T was a fine company to work for. I basically enjoyed my time there, but do not wish to go back. Managment was hit and miss. Too much micromanagement of employee performance."
good,Working as a employee at AT&T is very rewarding especially when you develop yourself and work well with others around you. There are a lot of training opportunities to keep you up-to-date on current technology and industry improvements.
good,Working for AT&T was great but they're CEO and top level management are awful. People who cut corners were rewarded before being fired for the same behavior.
good,So far my experience hasn’t been a bad one. I’ve had great work crews and management teams. They could defiantly pay better and offer better healthcare plans.
good,"I would recommend AT&T. AT&T has its faults and its not always an easy place to work, but the benefits are great and management is good for the most part."
good,"Your always busy and if your not then they will send you home which is never. You are expected to work through rain, snow, wind, EARTHQUAKE. They are big on attendance and safety and hopefully you don't get stuck with a manager who only cares about himself."
good,"Your days can be long, however they seem to go fast.  The atmosphere is laid back in some areas but they deadliness are strict. The company changes a lot so you have to enjoy a fast paced job."
good,"Not much to say other than working for a large corporation. The culture here is, Layoff, Layoff, and did I mention layoff? Not for the weak of heart to work here. Typical day was chaotic and overworked. I learned from their online training classes and I do admit I had picked up a lot ion order to perform my job successfully everyday. Management was people always trying to gain favor and outdo their fellow peers in order to get noticed. This culture seems to be status quo in most corporations. Hardest part of the job was just shutting out constant layoff letters and talk in order to concentrate on the very complex job. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting flexibility for work and ability to work remotely."
good,"Excellent benefits and pay at the time when I was there. Attendance, tardiness and production are strictly monitored. Attendance is pro-rated the first year. Extremely demanding work at times but in most departments you are fairly compensated."
good,"Fast paced but no chance for advancement at least at this time. There is a Union. Install Uverse, Direct TV, Fiber Optics. Great pay and benefits. They do from time to time lay off technicians and supervisors. Meet your numbers and good attendance and you will be fine."
good,"Working on the telecom side of things with AT&T it's very high pressure and demanding. Especially from the market director. It is very hard if you're a woman working in the telecom side at AT&T, it is best to be a man. They treat you better and with more respect. You work a lot of hours, but you can work from home sometimes which is nice."
good,"Great workplace, fun environment, management is good, not much room to move up within the company in Hawaii. Pretty good benefits and good pay. it is union."
good,My only problem with them is their management i really believe some managers should not be managers point blank period.Managers should have experience in all aspects. From my understanding there are some managers on site that never took not even one call
good,Not really focus on  work and life balance but do try to drive a employee culture with some disconnects but A for effort.  They were some cuts on salary and commissions.
good,A typical day would to be to start off in a huddle with your Supervisor to go over the previous days work and performance.  After that your expectations for that day were discussed with your team.  Once the Supervisor had given expectations you'd log on to your computer to see what jobs you had for that day and then gather all the supplies you needed for your vans and then go to your 1st job.
good,"Learned alot about corp. network design.  However I was only trained by a new consultant, and he didnt know that much,"
good,"Working at AT&T taught me alot about leadership and being friendly. I grew as a person in sales as well as customer service. I enjoyed my staff as well as my bosses. We grew as a family, and  I would take everything that I learned there and use it to become better in the future."
good,"My typical work day was spent primarily in the field managing Service Technicians, doing inspections, training techs, talking to customers and ensuring techs were performing all aspects of their jobs. I learned what went into the day of a technician while they were performing job duties. Management gave me lots of autonomy to do my job and make decisions without much interference whatsoever. The workplace culture was team oriented and driven by customer satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the unpredictability of cable issues such as a cable cut or service disruption. The most enjoyable part of the day was working with my co-workers, interacting with my team and meeting new customers."
good,"Working at AT&T Mobility was a fast paced experience.  Like with most companies, they had to keep up with the times and/or be in the front of cutting edge technology.  When I first started with the company it was only customer service.  light to heavy phones answering billing questions, or activating new lines of service.  As time went on our duties changed.  Once U-verse was introduced, it became fast paced and selling became the main focus.  We had quotas to fill."
good,"Fast paced, no time for second guessing, high standards, you have to be able to adapt to change quickly.  Management is held to exacting standards and fail fast and overcome is the only path forward."
good,Expanding workload consistently necessitated careful allocation and utilization of resources. This fact both kept the job interesting and diverse. Time and geographical constraints dictated a mutually supportive team culture that proved beneficial to all concerned.
good,This was a terrific corporation to have worked for. AT&T is a big company with a lot of opportunities. Great benefits but you can get lost in the shuffle if you’re not hitting your goals
good,AT&T is a great stepping stone to other careers in retail or corporate positions.  The daily pace is fast and required dedication to product knowledge.
good,"Due to the politics that are not in our control, job security isn't the best  for employees no matter how much you or your coworkers would like it to be."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer service aspect.. To be given a challenge and being able to handle and correct the situation for the customer and turning a negative situation into a positive interaction. I always enjoyed hearing that no one ever took the time to fix the situation they were going through and that I took that time and now they would stay with the company.  The call center environment is very busy and being able to handle the call volume and give good customer service at the same time is a great skill to master.
good,During the time that I was with the company it was Bellsouth before the company transitioned into AT&T. I only stayed there approximately several weeks after the transition. The most enjoyable part of the job was the incentives for selling Bellsouth products. The hardest part of the job was supervisor (previous to last). The mutual respect was not returned in a professional manner.
good,"If you dont mind working nights and weekends, this is the job for you. You have to be willing to sell and recommend products to customers and close deals but otherwise its pretty good.."
good,"As competitive as the job was, the space around wasn't very lively. Being in a competitive system, you often need things to inspire in which they didn't have much."
good,"Safety, quality, and customer service most top priority. Most days begin with a morning huddle. We review safety guidelines and discuss best practices. Also, we address in know issues there may be."
good,"I really enjoy my job at AT&T and would like to stay, but they are downsizing and eliminating my job. I have not been able to advance there as much as I would like."
good,A typical day at work can be challenging with the customer's sometimes being rude an not wanting to work with us. It works out most of the time with customer being very satisfied with services received. I have learned a lot with the time I've worked for AT&T Mobility an I thank them for the opportunity they gave me to be employed there.
good,Technicians have assigned vehicle and are responsible for maintaing adequate parts inventory. Large service area requires lots of driving. Ladder work is often required in most areas. Technicians frequently have to work in tight spaces. Must be able to communicate and educate your customer about your product's operation. Technicians work until all assigned jobs are completed.
good,"Fast pace work, have to be very detailed oriented, costumer service and have full understanding of all products and services, good management  the best workplace culture we are a family."
good,"Excellent benefits including extensive training, great health insurance, 401K match and paid time off. Unfortunately company is in an overall employment downsizing/outsourcing  mode through the year 2020."
good,Working for AT&T was fun but also stressful. The average work day consisted of taking 100 plus calls a day along with doing computer work during and in between calls.  The culture at my office was very laid back people wore sweatpants to work regularly.
good,"The finance and accounting departments at AT&T in El Segundo, CA are fast paced and demanding.  I was given a lot of autonomy in my position there and gained a lot of valuable experience because of it.  I had regular exposure and interaction with executive level management.  Overall, a very good company to work for.  They have a very good compensation and benefits package including annual bonuses."
good,I loved working at AT&T as a sales support representative. The management was pretty understanding and helpful. The hours were decent and so was the pay.
good,"AT&T acquired DIRECTV in 2015. The Directv brand wnet through a slow makeover process. Changes were made to the different groups within Direct and some groups would merge with redundant AT&T groups. My role in my department was changed. I accepted the change ,but I wasnt happy with my new role in the company. I had the oppurtunity to take early retirement. I also was offered a layoff package prior to my retirement date. I am very grateful for the time I spent with Directv."
good,"I am used to work on a shifting schedule. A fun place to work with and learn more, I am open and teachable so that I may grow in this kind of industry. The hardest part of a job is to adjust at first however, I know I can also adjust myself for me to learn. lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job is to be with your teammates and treat them as your second family."
good,"ambiente laboral muy agradable, el gerente de tienda sabe lo que es su trabajo, lo difícil ahí es aprender a sobrellevar a la gente que te trata como un empleado mas, lo que mas me agrado del trabajo eran las ventas y competir con mis compañeros por un objetivo."
good,Good place to work but management culture is broken. Unrealistic expectations create unnecessary stress on the job. Working safely is paramount. Pay and benefits seem to balance out workplace stress.
good,"Chill, easy but stressful at times. Hours are good depending on where you work. A lot of downtime so you have to find ways to be productive. Higher power were cool"
good,Coworkers are great but too many lay offs taking place. Lay offs have become too frequent and now impacting good and hard working employees. Wish it wasn't the case.
good,"Your future is what you make of it here. You can do just fine getting by, or you can bring a nice bonus home every month. It's just a matter of finding the angle that works for you."
good,"The job culture at AT&T is good. The money, benefits are very good. There is a lot of overtime. The management staff has a lot to be desired. There is a lot of turnover which causes trouble in the crews. Overall experience is a good one."
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for, however, after 18 years of service, I am being surplused within 30 days and will have to relocate to a different city in which I am not prepared"
good,"Safe workplace with incredible staff. Upper management not so great, they were negligent and did not look forward to keeping their best talents, but to make money for themselves"
good,"Empresa que desarrolla al personal en temas de liderazgo, coaching, tecnolgía, con una cultura laboral de exigencia con respecto por el colaborador. Metas muy exigentes, de mucho seguimiento y acompañamiento, mucho análisis de indicadores de cobertura, penetración, mezcla de productos vendidos, productividad por asesor, etc."
good,A typical day at work was fast paced and could sometimes be stressful.  I learned a lot and management was ok.  The hardest part of job is leaving involuntarily the most enjoyable part of job was my coworkers
good,"I love working in att. Its the best job if you want to keep yourself up to date in technology while earning good money.            "
good,"Great training, competitive market place, great pay, Corporate America environment, unfortunately lots of yearly re structuring and downsizing.  freedom to work from home"
good,"Maintained account relationships, understood their business goals and directives and met with C level management along with day to day to better understand the fit that I could bring to any aspect of their business. Sell Applications and solutions that fit to help the customer reach goals for their business direction."
good,"Liked this job a lot. Great pay. The staff really got along well. I truly wish I could have stayed on. The benefits were great, and I loved the fact that they gave employees discount on their service, as well as the bonuses,"
good,great place to work. too strict on sick days. really fast pace.theres a lot of customers who come into stores who can get the answers they are looking for online.
good,"AT&T is a great place to work with many opportunities. The culture has changed from previous years, in that employee values aren't as important, but that seems to be corporate in general."
good,Zelf verantwoordelijk voor prioriteit bepaling en indeling van het werk.
good,"A typical day at work consists of being on the phone all day with customers calling in about problems with their bill or services. "
good,"Typical day consists of each representative interacting with 10-20 different guest. Inter\actions involve anything from simple troubleshooting of devices to upgrading phones, selling tablets, home security, television services and accessories. There is a decrease in income to advance into management. The are some managers that take the promotion because they truly have a passion to help and develop staff. Work culture is fun and coworkers generally treat one another like family."
good,"This job is very busy and can be kind of stressful, based off the fact that you get yelled, cussed and fussed at by customer's that are upset about their bill. But it can also be rewarding."
good,This was my first job out of college and I was incredibly blessed to receive the training that AT&T provided me with respect to always keeping the customer first. It stayed with me for a lifetime.
good,Way too slow and hard to make extra money.  No real systems in place training.  More about fixing phones and random requests from customers.  Hard to hit sales goals
good,no comment. i dont have much to say bout the company. Starts off as a great opportunity. but they find ways to pay you less over time. Great benefits if you are full time only.
good,"I enjoyed my time with AT&T and would have stayed if things could have worked out on relocating where I was moving."
good,"Buena empresa para trabajar, pero más conveniente en área administrativa ya que ellos si tenían tiempo de convivir"
good,I really enjoyed being a sales support representative. My co workers were great managers can be a little cranky sometimes but I just ignored it. Your daily duties include opening the door for customers and checking them in to be seen by a rep. Sometimes you may need to use sales skills to help customers and help answer quick question. You handle all the inventory in the store and just keep the store neat clean and ready for customers to browse. Sometimes customers are angry and upset but you shouldn’t let stuff like that bother you. Just say sorry and sign them in.
good,Great place to share acknowledge about the different technologies they are working with. Some times the delivery times are behind of the estimated time
good,"It was fine,  It is hard working on straight commission and was not for me.  Nothing against the job just needed a steady paycheck.  Working hours were great."
good,"Processes on top of processes get through a typical day.  Since the merger with DTV and upcoming merger with Time Warner, no opportunity for advancement."
good,It was very fast paced. There was a lot of training on a weekly basis. Management was always there to answer questions and help when needed. They always tried to make work fun for the employees.
good,It is fast pace and stressful but they pay better than most. You have a full benefit package available to you. You have to start out working nights and weekends and it is seniority based.
good,"Fast paced 24/7 call center environment"
good,"ATT has  good work culture and balanced life style "
good,"ATT culture is vast. They are very diverse, have a huge workforce, and are community minded."
good,"En general las opciones de la empresa son buenos..."
good,"Not many technology companies have existed for 140+ years. The glacial pace of the company can drive people nuts. However, the senior leadership is sound and has a good long-term strategy. Too many ""lifers"", slogging through the hallways waiting until they can retire."
good,"You have to bid on new shifts every 2 or 3 months, and what shift you got depended on seniority.  Supervisors also had to bid on shifts, so you usually got a different Supervisor depending on your seniority and theirs.  This is a very fast-paced stressful work environment, but they offered lots of training classes, especially if they were changing your work requirements.  The call center is high-volume and extremely fast-paced.  I enjoyed learning new things, so with all of the training we received, there was always something new to be learned.  I actually liked talking to customers and assisting them with how to use the smartphone.  Most customers are very understanding and I always got a lot of accolades.  What I disliked the most was the environment created by most of the supervisors, it was usually not pleasant, but there were some very good supervisors too, if you were lucky to get on their team, the environment was usually much less stressful."
good,"Get a user story, and do it."
good,Awesome pay great benefits only reason I left was because of management. If you can sell and do great with people this is for you. The perks were great
good,"I enjoyed my 10+ years at AT&T.  My favorite perk was the full time telecommuting that I was able to take advantage of.  The work was balanced and they encourage you to maintain the job/life balance."
good,"A dynamic company with ambitious targets.  If you are in a key collaboration zone of AT&T, this can be a very exciting company to be part of.  Diversity welcome."
good,My start to the work force in Florida. Before the merger or buyout of Convergys. Things changed after the merger. Some good some bad Management was good throughout this process
good,"I really liked working for this company. I defiantly kept busy, but i got migraines looking under a microscope for 8-10 hours a day. And then i relocated."
good,Great place to work because of the people along with the great discounts on products and services.  Being in a technology field can be very demanding as you have to stay on top of current products and how they fir into the technology world. Overall good company
good,"Overall a good place to work. Great people, good vision/future. Not so great opportunity advancements. Direct management not so great on future plans. In job training was ok."
good,"was not happy when let go due to the reason stated but 1 year later received pay for the days used against me for termination."
good,"Productive, Fun workplace with multi cultural , Potluck Party.Learned "
good,"Great benefits, tuition reimbursement, and discounts. "
good,"AT&T is a very stressful job."
good,"buen lugar de trabajo , cambian en pocos lapsos de tiempo las politicas asi como los esquemas de comisiones a veces afectando a empleados, buena capacitacion y buen ambiente de trabajo , los altos mandos poco hay contacto con ellos, se aprende bastante sobre tecnologia y ventas"
good,"The corporate culture at AT&T was very competitive and performance oriented.  A strong positive exercised by the company was feeling empowered to make suggestions on ways to perform your discipline.   The compensation structure was above average, but in some cases management subjectivity was the difference maker."
good,Decent place to work. Great pay. The culture was pretty diverse. I learned how to communicate in a way that makes people feel like they're not making a phone call to waist time. They fed us quite often and ran contest frequently.
good,"As a tactical account executive, we experience many ups and downs. Goals and expectations are somewhat unrealistic, especially with not having enough time in the day to manage administrative/billing/service issues, while being expected to excel in sales attainment. Still, working for such a large company has it's many benefits."
good,worked for 21 years.  retired from AT&T.  had good pay and good benefits.  had numerous managers some were better than others but over all all were good
good,"Very busy at times answering phone calls.  I learned about sales, productions, technical support. The management team was creative in building stepping stone for advancement.  The workplace was festive and fun at all times.  We would receive incentives each month when reaching our goal as an individual and as a team.  The hardest part was the business relocating and changing names several times.  I did enjoy serving each client."
good,AT&T was a pretty cool company great benefits and discounts. The hourly pay grew pretty swiftly and if you love talking all day it's perfect. Didnt need much background to get hired.
good,A place to work to make money if there was more advancements it would be a good place to work. But there is always that fear of losing your job never no.
good,NO job advancement unless the upper management likes you.. NO set schedule.  Assistant manager had very big ego and disrespectful.  Great benefits and job security. Great group of team members.
good,Very stressful environment because of the company goes through a re-org every 3-4 months.  With all the impending mergers I would not recommend AT&T as a place to work for now.
good,I was an OPT. The job was temporary and ended in three years. The pay and benefits were great. The management was tolerable but they were always looking for something to pick at.
good,"A typical work day is busy and fast paced. I learned a great deal about Human Resources and Payroll Operations. I met great people. The hardest part of the job was when I first started, there was no formal training at that point. I basically learned on the job myself with help from friends. I enjoyed learning new/different aspects of the job."
good,Certain positions offered in depth training.  My last position offered no formal training.  I learned by research and asking my peers for advice on processes.  Management was very supportive and always open to conversation.  They offered flexibility to help us balance our family and work lives.
good,i absolutely loved the pay and team at this location.  the management  staff was out to prove something and only served to deflate the team.  once i became management my teams productivity increased 10 fold.
good,You have lots to learn when working at AT&T . It's hard at times but positivity is key. Customer service is key and asking questions as well. Funny environment to work in.
good,Great place to develop and cultivate management skills.  Sometimes workload difficult to manage due to constant force adjustments and              frequent changes to priorities.
good,"Ability to work to your potential in most cases"
good,AT&T is a great company to work for unless you get placed in a poorly managed organization. If you can avoid that then I see it as a company you can retire from.
good,"learn alot about phones and customer needs, most the time if not a busy event week or holiday, you are sitting back and waiting for a customer, and most the time its a 50/50 chance that customer is good or bad considering most of them get smart with you for something you have no control over. other than that great job, great place to work."
good,"Working in the labs, can be really slow unless you have a position in research.  Projects that are worthwhile are very hard to come by unless you have the recognition and trust on your team. Ideal for people who are done moving around in the career and settling down.  If you are young and looking to advance and gain new skills, look elsewhere or join research."
good,"Good place to work, would have been nice to not have to work 6 Days per week. Also you are expected to work all holidays. Good environment and room for advancement. Routes are based upon your production the beter you perform the more work you will receive. You will be given a company vehicle and gas card , sometimes your route will be close to your house but sometimes your route will require you to travel about 2hrs. The opportunity to work independently was the best part of job though it does create stress because you have to be able to fix All problems that may arise."
good,Pay was fine but At&t  is more concerned about selling their other products than actual cell phones.  Direct tv and home security were major things they wanted sold but i took the job because i liked just selling cell phones
good,"The independent company i was working, there tending to be a lot of favoritism with management. Completely bias. I tried to stick it out as much but none was done. Company we are representing is great but authorized retail micromanaging was just a disaster. Even though the experience was a mess i got to learn a lot on how to keep composure with managers that had no direction. wouldnt trade it it all."
good,Good work ethics and less politics in the work place.  Good compensation and work life balance. Management should act on issues reported to improve process.
good,"Great Company with great benefits. Issues with large global organizations are definitely present At&t. Very customer focused, but so many different procedures in place, losing customers to churn always."
good,Work independently with lots of driving.  Network and peripherals constantly need attention. Different departments wanting priority.  Management spread too thin. Good support from colleagues.  Good pay.Fair amount of training and was able to take time off.  Huge territory and shared on-call with other techs.
good,A good place to work. The customers were great and other employees were great. The management in the store I was in was terrible as far as I know that manager has moved on.
good,"As a contractor there were things I was not allowed to do or even had access too.  I felt this hindered my growth somewhat, but that was their policy when it came to contractors."
good,Experiência ímpar em trabalhar utilizando outras línguas dentro das grades de conhecimento.
good,"Stressful at times,but enjoyed the varying workload and situations.Local management supportive and helpful.Greatest thing was the wonderful people i got to work with."
good,"SELL ,SELL, SELL, and then SELL some more. Doing more with less until we replace you with an outsourced agent or someone cheaper. Management in the same boat so they can sympathize. Having the support of your peers goes a long way"
good,Working to this company is very knowledgeable for me I've learn a lot. Although its a tedious job i make sure i am doing my job correctly. Management wisely is very cooperative and knowledgeable the working place very productive and fun at the same time. The hardest part of the job is where you need to meet you quota and Inventory audits.
good,At&t is a wonderful place to work.  Pay is great.  Hours can be long.  Environment is great.  If you work sales your job security is based on performance.  If you work in operations it is easy to become overwhelmed and overworked.
good,"While working at AT&T, you constantly had shift and manager changes.  None of which you had a choice in.  It was all based on seniority, and a bidding process."
good,a typical day would be the up keep of the field plant. your learning experience would come only if a very rare incident would occur.         management is your typical team of management. workplace culture was very organized hard working.hardest part of job would be working in the dead of winter. as a journeyman making the customer happy was the enjoyable part  of that job a great experience that i was a part of.
good,"Ambiente agradable, aunque el esquema de comisiones es muy variable y las oportunidades de venta pocas."
good,"Better place to work for those who are energetic, thrive in a professional environment and interested in developing technical skill sets. Best opportunities for advancement if you are in Los Angeles or Dallas. Not much advancement elsewhere."
good,"Strap your boots on, the organization is consistently transforming. It is important to keep your skills up and refreshed. Being mobile is also a critical part of being successful."
good,"Retail Sales consultant comes with a lot of stress. Goals are forever changing as well as compensation. Due to lack of union contract commission pay has diminished drastically over the yesr, to the point where working there wasn't worth the stress of the pay. Poor management makes it harder to work there as well"
good,Had an unbelievable time working at AT&T. To bad upper management had not cared about staff at my location.  With the right team AT&T is definitely a fun environment to make money and meet new people
good,It was an experience. I enjoyed it most days. It was tough around the end for obvious reasons. Great memories. I would definitely recommend it for someone starting out.
good,"Ability to work from home a few days a week, great support teams, continuous learning opportunities but constantly changing environment due to non-stop mergers and acquisitions eliminated middle management roles."
good,I like working at Verizon. I think the company should offer more incentive to the employees as sometimes they go through tough times dealing with unpredictable customers.
good,Aprendí a introducir modelos nuevos. Algo difícil fue trabajar con porcentajes
good,I was employed at AT&T for more than 19 years. I thoroughly accredit my level of professional growth to AT&T. The senior management team is highly vetted and the corporate vision is clearly communicated to all employees.
good,"At&t has ridiculous goals set for their retail team, they basically set you up for failure. They expect you to push things that you don't get paid for, and will fire you over it. I personally did fine with the goals, but the stress of it did not add to my overall happiness. The work-life balance is absolutely terrible. If you don't have a family or want a social life, or you are very money motivated, then this is the best place to work.. otherwise I would not recommend."
good,if you cant sell try another job. If your good at selling than you can make a living. Management will coach you after sales even if you did a great job.
good,"An okay place to work. Position changes were stressful, but the pay was good for raising a family. Good benifits which allowed me to retire in an okay postion."
good,"Typical day at work is depends from project to project..."
good,"Job is focused on sales and customer satisfaction."
good,"I found myself working at AWS, ready and willing for advancement yet a college degree was needed. So I found myself working in a retail envronment. It was very convenient."
good,"I signed on as a contractor to assist in a State wide Project, worked out of home office part time and traveled when needed."
good,"If you can crank out the numbers constantly you can make great money, but the balance of sales opportunities to customer service inquiries makes it difficult to keep steady figures."
good,"Enjoyed working for AT&T up until the last year I was there, my manager did not help in my advancement in the company. He was lazy and never worked his entire shift which made us work longer hours."
good,"Decent job with some management issues regarding my personal work site. I enjoy the work and have gotten really, really good at running cable yet it is very hard on the body. Climbing in and out of attics during the summer months in  extremely high temperatures is tough. Crawlspaces are a little better but can be dangerous (rarely) in rural areas with wildlife specifically arachnids, snakes, and sometimes cornered animals.  The pay isn't nearly enough for the work hazards and hard manual labor involved with running cable both for satellite TV and internet but it does manage to be slightly higher in most areas than most entry level jobs."
good,"It's a good company.  I like working here, but am ready to move on!  Finance is a good place to work - lots of opportunities, good compensation, I recommend it."
good,I was able to provide for my family for many years due to my employment. They rehired me when I needed to come back to work at night so I could take care of my nieces.
good,AT&T is a very fun place to work and is very well compensated.  The management team makes it very fun and incentives are plentiful.  I would recommend this job to friends.
good,Better than many of the employers in the area. No real chances for advancement without relocating. Good tuition reimbursement program. Good money for the area and the work we do.
good,Working for ATT was fun and challenging.  There were difficult times when it came to changes within the district but I learned to adapt and embrace those changes.  Best part of working for ATT in my past role as a manager was being able to gain the trust of my employees and help develop my team.  That was very rewarding to me.
good,"Its a great place to work to learn about the most recent technology. However, there is not a lot of opportunity for advancement outside of the store. The pay is optimal."
good,"buen ambiente laboral,turno americano, como experiencia muy buena."
good,"I loved working here probably because of the people mostly. The company overall is okay, no autonomy with lower management tho. Commission plus salary so pay is good."
good,"Great people, room for advancement, great team players. Always up to date on the latest technology. Searcy store had great management always positive. The Rogers store wasn't as professional"
good,As a premises technician your typical work day involves driving from house to house installing and repairing services. One must have the ability to work without supervision and complete task within an expected timeframe.
good,I have learned several skills that enable me to aid customers; each day has its' new challenges. Management opportunities are limited due to the down sizing and the direction of the company.
good,"This role teaches you a lot about working for a Fortune 50 company. It's a great place to work fresh out of college, but I have not experienced a great way to move laterally between disciplines."
good,"OSP Technician, Fiber Splicer"
good,Benefits and pay was good but there was too much micromanaging. Worked under union and there will be times where AT&T will not agree on a new union contract and at times you will be forced to go on strike.
good,"ATT is a big company and has a lot to offer employees.  It has great benefits and a lot of room to grow.  But beware, it is full of strict rules and policy."
good,I love what I do but I hate the distance and I feel I do not have a very strong management team.I love the sales environment and the competitiveness atmoshere but sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming without the proper leaders in place.
good,AT&T offers great benefits . The main issue is that they only allow you to miss 8 days in a year sick or not only 8 days. I really like the customer base and the employees that I worked with. Management team is not the best.
good,"Benefits, time off and tuition reimbursement balance out the relatively low pay. In the retail environment, the frontline sales people are union protected which can be a blessing and a curse"
good,"I would answer incoming calls from all over the U.S. I helped them with their cell services. I would take payment and perform minor tech when needed. At time I would need to persuade them that AT&T was the the best choice and do everything I could to assure them that we could provide the best service,."
good,"A company full of potential for employees development."
good,"Co-relación entre empleados amena; constante uso de concursos de venta con regalos impresionantes. En general una empresa increíble con una baja empatía con sus empleados, ya que no era tan fácil externar tus ideas sin que generaran una molestia a los superiores. Trabajo bajo presión."
good,"Even with all of the changes in the economy and markets AT&T is not a bad place to work. The one thing that I can say negative is that the company is just too big for itself. The larger the company, the smaller the employee.  That's about it in a nutshell."
good,Overall i helped customers with basic trouble shooting and helping them to find the perfect phone best fit for their needs. The staff was friendly and were able to pitch in with helping a customer who needed further assistance
good,Upper level management had no idea what I did on a daily basis.  All managers were based out of another state and when they decided to consolidate my position they had to ask me several times what all I did.
good,"En general es una buena empresa, buen ambiente, salario competitivo sin llegar a lo mejor ni ser lo peor, transporte accesible, lejos del sur y oriente de la ciudad."
good,"Trabajo sencillo de realizar, el inconveniente de estar lejos de la capital donde se encuentra el supervisor es estar resegado al ultimo y cuando se solicitaba de su apoyo este no llego."
good,"Job was a good starting point. Not a job if you want to have a family life."
good,"Too many corporate issues that affected its employees. Company ended up not delivering on promises made to employees with benefits, were sued for over 18 billion to the point where now workers are on strike."
good,Lots of room for growth here but the wait process to even be seen ridiculous minimum 2 year wait on promotion very good benefits must be punctual to work there.
good,"la empresa tiene un excelente ambiente laboral ademas de buenas instalaciones, para mi de las mejores compañias telefonicas , aprendi mas de la venta , de equipos telefonicos y mejore mi atencion al cliente"
good,Good company it was just a down turn in the economy at the time I was employed there.  So job security wasn't the best at that time any where in America.
good,As long as you're focused and ambitious working for this company will be enjoyable. It's a fast paced company and things change pretty rapidly but as long as you're willing to work and learn it will be a breeze.
good,"Large company with a larger company mentality. AT&T will only do what's best for AT&T and not what's best for it's employees. We're all just a number. "
good,"Rapidly growing and quick-paced company with constant change.  Can be stressful environment, but rewarding with options of career choices and positions."
good,"Fast paced work environment, talking to employees, very result based oriented. Met some very friendly people.Employed on contractual basis. Left after contract was over. Will recommend the place to family and friends."
good,"Lo que mas me agrada de mi trabajo son las RELACIONES PUBLICAS, LA NEGOCIACIÓN y el trato directo con mis clientes."
good,"Oportunidad de crecimiento y excelente ambiente de trabajo, libertad total para desempeñar tus funciones pero por ser distribuidor las limitaciones de producto limitan expectativas de comisiones"
good,"Typical day consisted of taking customer calls, assisting with phone support, collecting past due balances and setting up payment arrangements."
good,"Decent place to work, good benefits, great coworkers, competitive pay...."
good,"I love AT&T's service, hands down, it's hard to top. I love having so many things to offer a customer. The innovation is far above any other. I thought I would retire with that company, but life lead me another way. I took a job that allowed me more of a work life balance, because of having to take care of my 95year old Mom. I am so grateful for my current job, it allows me the freedom to take care of my Mom when needed. AT&T is more strict, union based rules,"
good,"AT&T is a company that has no problem paying you, but will make sure they work you to death. If you need time off, or a consistent schedule do not work here. You will never have a consistent schedule. You will work a ton of overtime, but your will be paid well."
good,"Not a bad place to work if you like things to move at a snails pace.  Takes forever to get things done.  Small projects can take 18 months.  Easy for people to hide and do nothing.  I would say the company takes care of the employees, good pay and good benefits."
good,Typical big company and low stress work place.  People are friendly and cooperative.  Good work/life balance.  Big vision and ambitious goals for future.
good,"Not bad to work for as a temporary career corporate job.  You will have a lot of training that will assist you with your job with coaching a development for your team, but you will not learn back office unless you are hands on and willing to take the extra step.  The most enjoyable about the job is the discounts with TV, Security, and wireless products."
good,"By far favorite employer. Company offers enough incentive to challenge the employee, but once they acquired DirectTv, they got too ambitious with their goals and expected far too much from employees. Training wasn't structured enough and had to pick up a lot over time, but still one of my favorite jobs"
good,"Fast paced environment, where the only thing that can bring you down is yourself, and the mistakes of others. The Union was both useless and toothless and bent over backwards to not help its members. The company, at times, seemed to not care how hard someone worked, or how well they worked. Efficiency was valued over quality."
good,"My time at AT&T was satisfying for years.  Unfortunately when my management chain moved overseas, their understanding of the proper way to retain business was lost and customers left due to lack of attention after the initial sale.  In the later years of my employment products were being commoditized and value add was sacrificed to push new implementations while ignoring growth opportunities with existing customers.  This was cultural and my belief is the barriers of time (different time zones), focus on a factory vs tailored customer environment lead to the decline in my business channel.  Limited team communication due to geographic time differences was the largest issue."
good,Good company to work for. Great benefits and discounts. The opportunity for advancement is good and the people you work with are the best part of the job.
good,I'd worked for AT&T through a temp agency on an extended assignment. The pay was good and the environment within the office was even better. I would have loved to stay there but unfortunately my department was outsourced to a company in TX.
good,Before some of the recent changes it was a good job the changes since the dtv merger have been bad. Hopefully someone at the top will notice soon it was a great company to work for.
good,Contact customers per their work order and install or service their equipment. You have to have good people skills and be able to communicate with different customers.
good,"In order to advance to other levels within the company, it is required to have a bachelor's degree, otherwise you may end up stuck in 1 job for a long period time"
good,The company is a great one nothing bad to say about them at all. The pay is fair and the benefits are pretty good. A lot of great people work there...
good,Overall good company to work for. Compensation has been slipping and work hours more demanding but the benefits and the pay make up for it. Great 401K benefits. Good people with a good culture always helps job satisfaction. Management is OK and gives my job direction and meaning to a higher purpose.
good,"There are many positions throughout the company, and I feel unqualified to speak for them all. I can only speak for my current position. The inability to know when you are getting off work each day makes it difficult to make any plans with your family."
good,"Catch any accounts that did not activate through the normal Analyst Review process and activate them for future appointments "
good,I would greet the employees and visitors by name. I felt comfortable with them and it felt like a family environment. Some days were fast paced and others were laid back. You just need to be prepared for anything.
good,"Dar servicio al cliente interno siempre es muy gratificante, se respira un muy buen compañerismo."
good,Overall great company to work for. Opportunities for advancement. Unfortunately I was laid off during the recession. I preferred the company when it was Cingular prior to being bought out buy AT&T.
good,Work weeks depend on the company's desired goals. you may be required to 60+ hours a week or barely get 40 hours. Working outdoors will have it's pros and cons.
good,"One of the best clients in Usa. HR department was cool and caring. Lot of benifits along with good pay rate. Big scope to learn lot of things like behavior, work, punctuality, team work etc."
good,"Management allows you to perform your job efficiently. Training does have room for improvement. Work environment is very comfortable, everyone is friendly."
good,"Inconsistency in regards to  management is a serious problem. Customers knew more about the release of new service, before the employees."
good,"I worked at DSL Tech Support Call Center"
good,"I went into the position expecting it to be mainly customer service based, it actuality it was very sales-geared. With hard sales not being my forte; I did not enjoy the position."
good,"DirecTV was a great place to work. The people were fantastic, and like any other job had its challenges as well. I learned the system and performed very well. With the incoming merger with AT&T I believe most of us knew it was a matter of time before we would be looking for another job."
good,"Fun place to work, but they have regular sight wide shift bids that make it difficult to plan life and school.  They do make accommodations for school, but not enough to get there on time so you have to chose between work and school."
good,"Ambiente laboral bueno con actividades dinamicas para motivacion e incentivos laborales, excelencia en servicio al cliente y constantes actualizaciones en estrategias de venta y retro alimentación , excelentes relaciones interpersonales, empleo con un grado intermedio de estrés, aprendizaje en estrategia de ventas y oportunidad de liderar equipos y capacitar en estrategia de ventas y buen servicio al cliente."
good,"interaction with a lot of people. Co workers are usually young and get along great, made a lot of new friends. Work place varies store to store but for the most part everyone is laid back. Goals are set and reviewed day to day. Hourly plus commission so you work for your money. Hardest part of the job is rude customers but that will be everywhere. Most enjoyable part of the job is when you get to help a customer build a solution that works for them and helps your paycheck in return."
good,"AT&T offers employees good benefits and an opportunity to increase paychecks based off of commission. Though the management is lacking many skills, the other sales reps are energetic and fun to work with. Corporate policies restrict employees to extremely limited schedules with little room for error. Overall, the company is lacking in many areas, but still decent to their employees."
good,"We had a lot of initiatives to encourage us to succeed in sales like games, fun competitions and prizes to win. This helped us meet and exceed our numbers. Management was very helpful as well, you have coaches who found new ways to help you meet your goals and coached you on best practices to apply at the job."
good,"Call center . Answered phones, assisted customers with their questions about their cable bills or the problems their having. How to hook up cables over the phone with a customer and trouble shoot. The management was very helpful with the over all call center. I have no problem working with different cultures. Having to schedule a repair job, because I could not help them over the phone. Being able to solve the customer problems and having a happy ending to the conversation."
good,"AT&T is a decent place to work, but it is highly dependent on the local management, which has a lot of leeway in determining the culture of their garage.  The company does not take employee input into account very seriously I would say, as they consistently implement changes that employees determine makes doing the job harder (i.e. switching to Transit fleet, combining DirecTv and AT&T dispatches, implementing equipment guidelines and restrictions that do not coincide with equipment on stock, etc).  The company is in a sort of transition period and there always seems to be some grand new plan that never materializes and just serves to disrupt day to day workflow.  They are ALWAYS months behind on strategy goals.  All in all though, if you show up to work and do a quality job, it's a halfway decent place to work."
good,Work included planning and working with engineers that have been in the industry for many year. Great learning experience with AT&T providing many oppertunities to advance with education.
good,"This was my first corporate job and was a great way to get my foot in the door. "
good,Working for Southwestern Bell as a Service Representative has given me the opportunity to work in a face paced environment. The collaborative nature of me and my peers make it possible to attend to my customer's needs at the highest level. The best part of my job was coming up with creative solutions to better serve the customer base.
good,"Working for AT&T in the Ad. Insertion Operations office has given me the opportunity to work in a face paced, fun environment. The collaborative nature of me and my peers make it possible to truly deliver the daily business in a productive and accurate fashion. The best part of my job is working on special projects which allows me to learn about other aspects of the organization which I would not get just working my regular day to day duties. Unfortunately, due to force reductions, I will have to say goodbye to the people who I have not only come to know as coworkers but also as friends."
good,We had fun and it made it a great environment.  The people were great and it's a great company to work for.  I would highly recommend anyone to work for AT&T.
good,One of the best companies in the world. Always proactive in making the changes needed to be successful in the market place.
good,Professional work place that provides opportunity to grow professionally. Manager however are task masters and sometimes impede professional nurturing.
good,Overall good company. I think they have a lot of growing to do with all of the mergers and overlaps of business units/employees.  I do see great things coming for them once all of the dust settles.
good,"Working for a company as large as AT&T has many advantages including full benefits, 401k retirement plan, Education reimbursement."
good,Good company that is rapidly changing from a communications company into an entertainment company.  Co-workers are great and most of the management team understands how to grow the business.
good,Highly intelligent and hard working team. The team worked out a solution to every problem thrown at it. We regularly met off sight to improve communication.
good,They promised a lucrative environment but the calls where more often to cancel services then to upgrade and the system need tuning  however was still able to make a few dollars while I was there
good,"Working for AT&T gives you a good perspective of dealing with internal and external customers. There are a variety of experiences such as dealing with many customer requests for help with technical issues, billing, etc. I have also had opportunities with teaching and helping develop new hire reps for several years. AT&T is a good employer overall."
good,"AT&T has been an excellent place to work. Training is exceptional and no expense will be spared to educate the teams. Work/life balance can become compromised if not carefully monitored as an employee. Compensation is quite good particularly for entry level positions, it is a wonderful place to begin a career."
good,AT&T is a great place for eager individuals who are driven by goals and want a lot of potential to grow within the business .While employed her no benefits start until after 6 months but once you get past your trial period the benefits are great. Great team and very cool driven management. Compensation does change yearly so you have to be ready for switch ups and stay on your toes at all times. if you haven't learned already solutions are the only answers that are worth anything.
good,"AT&T provides a lot: good benefits, job security, good compensation, very nice coworkers... but ultimately it is a huge company with a lot of corporate overhead."
good,"from greeting 30-40 or more customers a day, handling merchandise and managing inventory and keeping up with store records, making sure sales representative had a support with accessories or more."
good,Wonderful place to work. Make your schedule work the hours you want. They probvide all the neccessary training and you write your own paycheck. Benifits and advancement are availabe.
good,Managers give you the freedom to develop a plan of action for completing your daily task.  Co-workers were from located in other states so you learned different work ethics from other regions.
good,AT&T is a company that you honestly get out of the company what you put into it.  This allows for fast upward mobility in the earlier stages of your career.
good,A Sales professional with strong business acumen who is able to influence and build support across organizations and cultures is what I learned while at AT&T.
good,Overall job was ok . Interacting with customer's really made the job fun. Management could be more organized and communicate with employers better.
good,AT&T is a great company to work for. They truly educate you on how to do your job properly. There is always recognition for doing well and obviously you get paid more because it is partially compensation.
good,"	Answer calls for roadside assistance customer of AT&T all over the United States "
good,Working at at&t has been wonderful. Their benefits cannot be beat. They are currently going through a lot of restructuring so moving up is next to impossible.
good,I had a great time working for At&t. They took good care of their employees with fair compensation and really good benefits. I really like the way that they trained their employees on new technology releases.
good,I start my day by coming in to work a couple of hours before the outside technicians start their day. Get them ready to go in the morning and make sure they have customer installs and repairs each day. This job has thought me how to be proactive in solving problem to get the best customer service possible. My co-workers and I work as a team each day to make sure all technicians have work each day and are doing the work that is required of them at each residence or business.
good,"A typical work day was always interesting. I learned about a lot of troubleshooting steps. Management was great and always had my back. My co-workers were fantastic and great to work with. The hardest part of the job, apart from just filling out paperwork for every little troubleshooting thing I did, was just dealing with the customers who would yell at you for breaking their phones."
good,DIRECTV was an excellent place to work with great competitive pay and benefits - after AT&T took over there was a nose dive in customer excellence and employee relations - AT&T forcefully put a lot of DIRECTV employees out of work after their many many years of service.
good,"Customers would call 1411 for directory assistance. We stared off only giving phone numbers. And as technology advanced we did reverse lookup, able to give numbers for people all over the United States. Learned how to do relay calls. Was chosen later in my career to be a team leader to help keep track and coach other team members to utilize efficiency and their performance to serve customer better."
good,This is a high stress environment. It is a typical call center environment with high turnover margins. They have done a lot for me and my family with great pay and great benefits.
good,"Amazing culture, pay, and benefits. I really enjoyed working with this company. I had to go back to school and they couldn't work with my schedule."
good,"It could be a fun environment to work for.  If you focus on making sales and don't get distracted by your peers you'll do great. AT&T is one of the best companies to work for but you will not have a life.  Just use it as stepping stone and move up or move on.  "
good,"Todas las mañanas llegabamos  a limpiar nuestra area de trabajo, recibiamos indicaciones del gerente de los prospectos de ventas y los lugares que ibamos a volantear, con mis compañeros teniamos buena relacion y nos acoplabamos en trabajo en equipo."
good,"constant flow of calls alot of unhappy customers calling about billing issues for the most part, high stress trying to keep customers happy and follow policy and procedures. Upper management did not appreciate the work we did for them. Center was threatened to be closed and was saved and then finally did close"
good,"Hire better managers who lead by example. Managers should be uplifting to everyone and not micromanage."
good,"It used to be good company to work for. However it is changing rapidly. Offers a lot of professional training and state of the art technologies. Too many mandatory courses not exactly related to work. Good compensation, competitive benefits. It used to offer remote work up to 80% but gradually reduces it to 0%."
good,"From employees of the managerial levels to the mechanics, everyone is dedicated and enthusiastic about making the workplace fun and efficient. The culture of this company is great."
good,"I was in college when I worked this job, therefore it was an awesome and free spirited environment. With some understanding managers who really made the job fun. The hardest part of this job is the selling and trying to decipher who is really a buyer and who is a browser. I defiantly learned a lot about myself during those years."
good,"Team managers was like picking names out of a hat blindfolded. Some are really easy to adjust to and some really suck. Great place to make oodles of money, but scheduling really not ideal for balancing work and life. I attended school fulltime and im the type that needs the interaction with the school to be successful, really difficult with the time blocks."
good,Working at at&t was a good learning experience. My managers and co workers were amazing. I feel that the pay structure could've been better.
good,too much micro management we are grown men don't need to feel like little kids at middle school with all the micro management work if tolerable doing work in the tie they give you if very reasonable
good,Overall fairly good company to work for. must be able to understand all aspects of job and willing to deal with all types of people daily is a must.A typical day in any kind of weather you have to be prepared for what ever task you have for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people everyday.Co- workers were great to work with and didn't mind taking the time out to help you if needed.The most enjoyable part of the day was to see your customers face after you finished installing they're service that was ordered.
good,"Load van up with all tools necessary to do all jobs for the day.  The job is all self motivating since you are almost always by yourself on the jobs.  AT&T tracks and times everything which i did not like.  You are on a new job site everyday which I did like, and you only have to engage with one customer at a time."
good,The work is not meant for everyone but those who don't mind sweating and are equip with a good work ethic will find this job very rewarding. 90% of the time you are out on your own working with the customer to bring them the best services possible. Because you are are alone in the field self reliance is mandatory. If you don't put in all that you can to learn the system and do your research on the services you can expect to have more bad days than good.
good,"The work experience was beautiful, the company was vibrant and the knowledge I learnt was inspiring. I got the opportunity to interact with many great technological experts who gave me insight of how various Network elements work. Also, working at AT&T labs I had a chance to better understand the various difficulties faced in real time. I hope this would later prove to be a great learning curve in my professional career and would help me to excel. It also helped me in gaining knowledge in latest technologies in the networking industry. On the whole, this summer internship gave me confidence that I will be able to meet the requirements of industry standards."
good,"When it was just Directv, it was a great place to work. We had a lot of fun with coming up with ways to provide our agents with additional incentives for performance. Providing games that we could play with taking calls and providing excellent customer service was a way of life. Management was always involved and always visible. There was nothing hard about the job. I always looked forward to being there. When AT&T bought out Directv, management was always tied up in meetings. They no longer allowed us to provide incentives to our agents. It became work. There was nothing fun about working there anymore and we were all told that our jobs would be safe. Then in May of 2016, they told us that they were going to lay off an undisclosed amount of supervisors and managers from there positions."
good,Great place to work if you like to stay busy. I loved the fast pace of the office. People are a lot of fun to work with. I did not like working nights that was the only hard part.
good,Great job and you can make a lot of money fast. However they don't accommodate religious beliefs so it may effect your personal life but if that's not a thing for you the you will love this job
good,Good company to work for. The company is pretty aggressive in its approach and a good place to start at for an entrepreneurial person
good,I enjoyed working for AT&T.  Great    teamwork skills are taught  and they did always try to recognize and make you feel appreciated.  Did have many different type of management styles. Which did teach me the different failures and successes of all style types. That often I felt was what frustrated customers most. Is at times not everyone was on the same page. When it came to upholding policies or making exceptions to the rule.
good,"It was never a day where i did not enjoy working for Prime Communications. Employees are friendly management is always willing to help with any issue until solve, i will enjoy working for  Prime Communication again."
good,I loved to work with AT&T. People working with me are so supportive and helpful. Company is cool and good for working people.
good,"Overall all a great place to work, benefits and pay are well.  Very challenging in all aspects.  The best part of the job was having a positive impact to employees and peers."
good,Its been over 12 years since I worked for OSI but it was att&t collection agency. It was a call center for the over flow at At&t.
good,"The 36 years I spent at AT&T involved a lot of changes as the telecommunications industry evolved during that time.  I felt like I worked for the best company as far as reliability went, and was proud to be an AT&T employee.  There were many times over those years that I had conflicts with various co-workers and management, but for the most part I enjoyed the various positions I held.  I learned my customer communication skills there, and in every department I was able to fine-tune those skills.  The best part was being able to work with customers and solve there problems, and help to improve their lives with our products.   I enjoyed many opportunities to travel out of town to help where needed.  The hardest part was the extremes in weather I had to endure while I was working outside."
good,A typical day at work is knowing that you will always a ton of work to do. Not a bad thing at all I accept the challenge and that is why I've been with the company going on 4 years. It is a great experience to work for a such a big company. Only issue I have is moving out of my current position. Opportunities have been presented in the past but there is always someone more qualified or I receive no response all together. I've worked so hard in so little time with the cooperation and I feel like I am not appreciated. So i am willing to take the opportunity and look for a company seeking a loyal employee.
good,"typical day at work is fine until the job matrix comes into play, they want high efficiency on the jobs done, which is understandable, but they also want high reliability, which is also possible, but to have high ratings on both is nearly impossible. its a never ending fuss about bring this number up"
good,"This company is no longer located in Dover, NH. The company gave up their government contract instead of renewing it in 2009."
good,I have spent few years in this company and I have lots of good memories. Many people I have met there has became an inspiration to me in different ways. I have learned that team work and taking responsibility is the most valuable thing how can I grow technically and personally. I was always open-minded and flexible to changes. Work at AT&T was about day-to-day changes in network environment. Most challenging were network outages. Our team was responsible to monitor these outages. According to service impact and location within the network we had to engage different teams responsible for their platforms to troubleshoot the issue. Also high management had to be informed. From start to end of the outage we were main point of contact and voice conference call leaders. These issues gave me lot of confidence to react fast and be calm under stress situations.
good,"Repeat information from last review of this company. Good place to work, but does not seem to be very secure."
good,"Need more of a work/life balance and better attendance policies."
good,"As an IT contractor, the job consisted mainly of deploying machines and recovering data. You were required to cover several sites so, although remote access was encouraged, travel was mandatory. Although the work could become overwhelming at times, co-workers would help out whenever they might be available. As time passed, more production was always desired of the contractors until it eventually became unattainable."
good,I enjoyed my time with AT&T.  I learned much needed skills that made me an effective content team member.  My transition to a corporate world from being a pro athlete was possible because of the AT&T culture.  I am forever grateful for the opportunity.
good,"I would have stayed with company but they downsized, so I had to take a package and fine new employment. I relocated with company to MN but it was to far from my family so I have to end my employment."
good,"Was able to learn to work with multiple phone line, offer great customer service, schedule Technicians and customers visits, equipment needed and price if any for time and labor."
good,At&t is a very professional company that opens doors for many engineers. I started with this company with hopes of making a career out of it. I spent fours years with this company before realizing I would like a change.
good,"In this position interacting with customers, helping employees and maintaining a conducive environment for business was a goal l set and accomplished each day."
good,"If given the opportunity to work at AT&T, I would do it again.  Like any workplace, you learn to deal with different egos.  There are technicians who gives their all, day in and day out, Then there are others who seem satisfied with mediocrity. The only setback that I see is that managers are increasingly pulled into micromanagement, maybe out of necessity."
good,AT&T is a massive company and there is a lot of opportunity for growth. Their training was top notch and their compensation for a first job out of college was well above the average. The only drawbacks to this company is that there is a lot of red tape involved in most sales cycles and there are periodically large scale layoffs/job changes.
good,"Working for AT&T for over 30 years, I gained strong customer service and communication skills.  I learned to be confident and comfortable with constant changes and uncertainty.  I understand the importance of building relationships and being a strong team contributor.  I had the good fortune of working in a variety of  organizations which gave me a broad understanding of the business and allows me to be capable of managing virtually any challenge that may arise."
good,somos una familia encargada de dar entretenimiento y llevar en alto todos los estándares de solución a nuestros clientes buen ambiente de trabajo una sola familia de hermandad
good,I would recommend this as a great starter job if fresh out of school to people interested in internet technologies or building good customer service skills.
good,I fell out of love with my job the moment it changed to sales.  It was very hard core sales in my opinion and left a very bad taste in my mouth about the company by the time I left
good,"making payments arrangements, changing rate plans"
good,"AT&T is a great place to work as far as diversity is concerned, compensation, and team orientation.  Was able to learn a lot within own discipline as well as other technologies."
good,"Unionized frontline sales force impacts a lackluster pay for managers."
good,The environment in many of the work groups was tense.  There was obvious favoritism coming from Management in many of the work groups.
good,"My most enjoyable part of my job there was doing the inventory, whether it was counts or checking in.  The management did well with our team and they were always looking for a way to help or promote.  Several of my coworkers were promoted and we all worked well as a team."
good,Great coworkers work day is ok lots of driving from one tower take pride in your area I covered the northwest part of san antonio
good,"like with all telecom jobs over worked, poor management ,and always wondering if you will have a job. other than that its great. good luck and have fun"
good,"The only downside to this job is how dependent on commission you will become. After a while, they changed the way commission is decided from month to month. Everyone became unhappy with this because it became harder and harder to earn money that you were normally making."
good,"For the most part, AT&T is a great place to work. The people are nice and the managers I worked for were all very nice. I learned a lot about the cellphone industry and the equipment. I was taught many excellent tactics for dealing with customers. The building recently got several really nice amenities added including: a ping pong table, a pool table, DirecTV, and an Xbox. Frequent contests lead to reps getting some very nice prizes, like TVs, game systems, headphones, drones, new phones, tablets, mixers, coffee bars, parking spaces, team lunches, and even a team getting to watch a movie on company time."
good,"A typical working day at AT&T consists of talking to your peers to start the day and see if anything changed in the industry.  You learn and you keep learning everyday, always new products coming out.  One of the hardest part of the job was always being ready for changes, nothing will ever stay constant but that comes with the territory.  You meet a lot of people, hone your people skills and just have fun with your customers."
good,"Would rather explain upon interview overall fun place to work, may not always be the best work environment between management and employees but I would recommend the job to people"
good,"Worked in 24/7 Pvt, Ltd, for AT&T U-verse technical support. Best thing about AT&T was that it aimed at resolving its customers issue on the first contact itself. That should the seriousness of the Business."
good,"This job compensates very well compared with many companies. You are expected to meet a sales quota every month. It's an inbound call center where customers call in about their bill, but you need to sell them on the companies product. Many incentives. Very micromanaged. Attendance is key. Cannot be late to work. Also, breaks have to be taken as scheduled. Cell phones are not allowed while on the phones or on the floor."
good,"ATT provides its employees many opportunities to develop their own career through building relationships, access to technology and employee training."
good,"no opportunities to advance, organization undergoing a merger restructuring process that has not been a smooth transition."
good,typical day at work included taking calls which would come in back to back; I learned how to have patience and improved my customer service skills; the most enjoyable part of the job was helping people. I loved making sure that everything they called in about was taken care of.
good,I was only a contractor for this company but I learned a lot of new things on the computer working for them. Employees were always helpful and a nice company to work for because they paid you well and always made sure you got your break and lunches.
good,Typical day of work consisted of talking to customer while asking open ended questions to uncover their needs and wants. This job taught me how to sell effectively and better my communication skills. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with an irate customer that disrespects you. The most enjoyable would have to be closing that big sale and nailing everything the managers asked for.
good,"Clima Laboral Negativo, es pesado trabajar con tanta presión, la gente es agradable, tenemos malos lideres."
good,"The work is challenging but fun. Every day is different, you never know where your going to be headed. I learned a lot about myself more than anything else. I'm great with people and customer care is number 1. I learned how to read and understand tests on signal and cable checks i learned how to install Uverse service and I'm really good at it. I get along with all my co-workers and they are a diverse bunch of guys. The hardest part of the job is trying to make sure you can do all that is possible to get the customer what they want. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you do get the customer everything they wanted and more."
good,"Maintaining clients was a definite growing experience coming from previous clothing retail. Acknowledging a clients' and corporations' down falls and an ability to reverse and reassure that each client made a solid change for the better was the biggest lesson I've learned in the two years that I have been apart of the At&t team. I love the ability to make a change for the better for each individual experience, whether it is saving money on a monthly bill or expanding the applications for a business so their productivity was enhanced. Transitioning to a management level came with ease with my prior knowledge from Buckle. There was a big change though going from helping a team grow and reassuring management that we were doing our best, to being the captain of the ship. I enjoyed the challenges and excelled once I had a full staff that I trained. We gladly took the title of best in our GA/SC area four months in a row!"
good,"Learned a lot about different selling. I feel I can go to any company and sell there products and services from the training I received throughout my tenure. Also, meet and developed some great relationships with a lot great people."
good,"I enjoyed my day at work.My day was balanced between installing new service and maintaining existing service. I learned how to work with new technologies, and I learned how to deal with a variety of people, fellow workers nd mamagement alike. The hardest part of my job was working on jobs with defined dead lines, the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting these deadlines and seeing a project completed."
good,Learned that being positive will get you far. Allowing open minded thinking for learning styles and abilities will allow opportunities to come without even realizes that they are in front of you.
good,Metrics mean everything.. If your customer calls back its like the entire world is coming to an end. The stress from worrying about meeting your metrics can become overwhelming.
good,"Flexible work schedule. "
good,"This company was awesome back in 1999 great pay, benefits and continual learning,  from the introduction of ADSL and Long Distance to merge again with AT*T, this will always be the company that gave me the basics and discipline that has helped me create my own business. For every thankful! 10 years with this company and received more knowledge than 4 years of college."
good,"Good company to work. Good Work Environment. Good work Culture. Supportive team members, Fun Work place. Good company to learn new technologies."
good,"This is one of the best companies I have ever worked for.  "
good,"A typical day at my position begins with reviewing the previous days rejects and correcting the issues surrounding them to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction.  I am quality driven and I pay close attention to minor ""details"" as they can be the clue that can lead to the resolution."
good,"Leading a team of 15-20 customer service representatives handling inbound customer service calls for assistance in account review and device functionality. AT&T did an awesome job of training employees on the importance of active listening, showing empathy, problem solving and negotiation skills to provide excellent customer service. Several mergers and acquisitions in 6 years lead to frequent job role changes and department closures."
good,"At&t offers a competitive environment with lots of excitement and room to excel within the sales environment. A typical day at work includes meeting new customers and assisting existing ones with their cellular and wire line needs. At At&t I learned how to use my negotiating skills to provide excellent customer service and surpass my sales goals. I also learned how to keep up with the ever revolving world of technology. My management team was phenomenal to work under. They motivated me to use my skills to progress and stood alongside of me to offer any additional help or knowledge that could drive my sale. We had weekly meetings about the growth of our store, and our managers made clear their expectations by introducing them in exciting ways to our sales team. My coworkers were right along on the motivation train often offering a competitive edge to my work and covering any details I may have missed in the sales process. We worked together to close the deal. The hardest part of my job was the hours and technical work. Often times you'd get too busy to get off when you were supposed to leading to 10-12 hour days. I personally didn't mind too much because that gave me the opportunity to get ahead. Technical work was always difficult because often times the customer would come in already upset and because their device was faulty. It was then up to me to coo them by assuring that I would meet their needs and we would get the problem solved. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to make relationships with my customers. Many of them I know on a first name basis."
good,This was a challenging and fun environment. I was encouraged to strive for excellence daily. The work / life balance were great and compensation was fair.
good,great call center with good pay and hours. comfortable work areas and management is easy to talk to. good location and easier to get to now in case of snow. training is fun and easy to learn
good,I enjoyed working with DirecTV. Some days would be longer than other but overall this was a good job. I enjoyed meeting new people and the gratitude they showed after providing them with good service.
good,"Very competitive work environment. Need to network fast and with the right people to move up."
good,This is a great career for a customer service and networking minded person. There are many strict rules and regulations to follow and many performance metrics that have to be met. Do not pursue this job if you are not comfortable with your every move being tracked and monitored.
good,"Good Pay, Benefits, great 401k. Work life balance is non existent if your in a call center, but there are many of great teams to work with in the company"
good,"Enjoyed the time with company,  Was in the Government Sector not he phone.  Would like to have stayed but the work left and there was any procurement of new contracts in the area,  they did not try hard enough"
good,"ATT was a wonderful company to work for. The benefits and sales compensation were awesome. Though the hours were ong, the environment was so fast paced, the time flew by."
good,"I enjoyed being able to help customers with their mobile devices, and helping with their bills. If a customer had an issue, I always did my best to resolve the problem."
good,I would go back to Att nut its very stressful I can handle but it takes a strong person many people aren't familiar on how ro deal with other peoples attitude.
good,Was a amazing experience differently fun. Great people and at work party s. Great pay and exciting career advancement.
good,"I love working at DTV, the people are great, as well as, the benefits!"
good,"Provided excellent training and application; excellent environment for self-development pre-merger."
good,AT&T has changed a lot over the years and those open to the changes are able to advance their careers and enjoy their time there.  The company provides great benefits such as tuition reimbursement and service discounts.  There are a lot of opportunities for career advancement if you put in the hard work and know the right people. The pay is great and you meet a lot of great people through networking.
good,"A challenging, ever changing environment where the key to success is based on you!  Whether you're in customer service or retail, the job experience in itself depends on your willingness to put forth effort.  "
good,"There are 4 shifts,  Each person works alone on his/her shift.   The  hardest part of the job was having to work the midnight shift from 11 pm until 8:30 am.  Each shift was more than 8 hours."
good,I worked for ATT Mobility for about 3 years.  I would call it a typical call center environment. This place has plenty of education on new and exciting technology. Only negative feedback would be ATT will become your home and your home will become the only place you sleep at. Required overtime pretty much all the time.
good,"Amazing people working along side me, and a very diverse staff allowed me to explore ideas I had never imagined. New challenges, new operating paradigms on a nearly annual basis kept the learning curve high, which was nice for someone like myself that requires constant mental stimulation. The management at the very top and  the bottom few levels care about the people deeply. The most difficult part of the job were the upper middle management that gave an air of caring only about numbers, treating people as a disposable commodity."
good,I recommend at&t to anyone. It's a very good place to work and they treat you good. the only dislike about the company is the management because they lack experience and do not know what there doing
good,I enjoyed the work this job had for me and I enjoyed the customers I met. I liked being on my own all day and being responsible for myself. The thing I did not like about this position was that there was mandatory overtime and I never knew what time I would get off each day. I also had a swing schedule that changed every month so I could never plan for events in the future.
good,"I like AT&T overall and I love the culture of being the best. However, it is high turnover so if you are not a dedicated person it is not for you."
good,AT&T is an excellent company to work for with great benefits and compensation.  They are concerned about their employees and take calculated measures to ensure they are inspired and engaged.  I have worked for the company for 3 years and have had a great experience with this company.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of talking to customers on the phone about service issues, establishing service, moving there services as well as any questions about any products. What I leaned is selling tactics proved by ATT. Coworkers and management were nice but there was a lot of micromanaging that happen while on the job. The hardest part about the job is some of the management and the micromanagement that took place on days when business was slow. The most enjoyable part bout the job was the pay and benefits."
good,AT&T is a great company to work for but the training center needs to be revised. The job is very hectic but it's also exciting.
good,"As the company changed from Pacific Telephone/Bell to SBC then to AT&T the culture of the company slowly changed.  Our hours as managers went from an average of 40 hours per week to 70 or 80 hours per week, and 6 - 7 days per week.  More work, less bodies.  Then the work was offshored and we had to train to people that were taking our teams positions.  Very disheartening."
good,I enjoyed helping my customer further their self in the advancement of the new technology. figuring out how to fix the challenges at hand.
good,"AT&T is a great company if you work at HQ, but I worked at a Market arm that earned $4B in revenues and my job moved to WA. With that said, I was offered jobs to expand my career if I moved."
good,"When I worked for AT&T, the mindset is very much meeting and exceeding your sales goal. if you must work later to meet your goal you will need to. Weekends are rarely a time off, you are only allowed to not meet your goal 3 times before you are fired"
good,Great for those who like to work overtime. Compensation plan has been reduced so sales make less money. Not good for work/life balance. Decent opportunity for growth.
good,"it was a basic office working enviorment, with reliable and helpful staff memebers. it was a busy but fun place to be."
good,Pay was excellent. Good benefits.  Training available when needed.  Would have enjoyed working a bit longer but due to decline in call volume it was not possible.
good,Pretty busy throughout the day. There's alot of multitasking and communicating with technicians via email and phones. Lots of communicating with teammates.
good,"AT&T gave me a great career, benefits and unmatched skills and leadership growth.  I am very happy to have been a part of this company."
good,"Too early too tell, numbers driven with little micromanagement beyond that.  Plenty of time devoted to training with lots of opportunity to learn and grow."
good,"Disregarding the stress that can come from being a telecommunications operator, DIRECTV did a wonderful job in creating a fun comfortable environment to battle the every day obstacles that come with working for a call center. I would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a CAREER to apply."
good,"Great company to work for. Micro Management company a typical day at work would be to show up in the morning and have a 30 min. meeting and get to work. what i learned in the time of being there is i actually put 100% into my job no matter what the job is. i love to build a career with comopany i work for rather than just being there for a paycheck. management is the one thing i didnt like about the company because they were not informative enough. managers had too many ways to get away with too many things. could do anything they wanted when they wanted to. our second line manager would do things that were not in our contract to descpline employees rather than coach them. hardest part of the job was just having to take the blame for something you have no control over every morning, not only one person but everyone. the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to give out great customer services and doing your job, and feeling great about the work you did."
good,I worked in the midtown Atlanta area. it was a good place to work. I was blessed with great managers. Some of the co-workers became great friends.
good,"great pay and benefits, fast- pace sales environment, high standard of customer satisfaction. hardest part of job is to balance work and home. a lot of overtime, picking up where you left off the next day."
good,"A typical day at work consist of clerical assignments, investigative work and compliance with legal demands.  I learned a great deal about the legal aspect of phone records.  I enjoyed my co-workers tremendously.  They were like family to me.  I gained several lifelong relationships.  The most difficult part of my job as a Subpoena Clerk... was during the moments where I wasn't able to assist law enforcement with catching a criminal due to FCC rules and regulations. The most enjoyable part of my job was the knowledge I had in knowing that I was helping my country's law enforcement and legal system capture and prosecute the bad guys."
good,"This job requires for a lot of team work, fortunately all the people I work with are amazing and hard workers. the only unfortunate part of this job is that it is temporary."
good,The financial woes in the early 2000s impacted Lucent's ability to succeed. I enjoyed the customers and sales managers that I worked with. Solving customer problems with engineered solutions and making sales were very rewarding.
good,"AT&T is company with strict values. Never bend any rules. Manager friendly."
good,They pay the best so they can hire the best. Everyone there was highly skilled and a pleasure to work with. Very demanding but you get to build some really cool things
good,"During a typical week, we would have a team meeting discussing any changes, anything that needed to be improved, and any achievements worth recognizing. Supervisors would keep us engaged by offering incentives of potlucks if we performed well. I learned a lot about customer service skills. The hardest part of my job would have to be the frustrated customers and the easiest would be the ones who just wanted to talk."
good,"·	Provided accurate and appropriate information in response to customer inquiries in a timely fashion."
good,Gained valuable insight and experience. Met interesting people in all forms of business and in the private sector.  Nothing more to add than it was a good experience.
good,AT&T is a industry leading company with many opportunities. It is a numbers driven company and they are very focused on the safety of their employees.
good,Great people to work with and enjoyable environment.  Current supervisor is good to work for and cares about his employees.
good,Typical daily duties were to provide AT&T DSL business and residential customers with tier one technical support for their DSL internet and networking connections. Everyday was a new learning experience concerning technology growth and change. My co-workers were like a second family to me and many I still have as close friends today. The most challenging part of this job was having to leave after company cut-backs closed the center and laid us off.  The most rewarding and enjoyable part was the strong support received from the CEO to local management to learn and engage in skills self development training.
good,"Answering phone calls and providing as much help as possible. Assisting with bills, activating phones, cable service, upgrades, setting up appointment for new customers. Learning how to deal with all types of people and attitudes with different and sometime difficult situations. There really wasn't a hard part when it came to the job and it was very easy and laid back as long as you did what you needed to do. Loved the bounces after a new sale or upgrade."
good,"Daily task consisted of preparing and implementing training sessions, as well as creating a positive & energetic atmosphere."
good,"I loved all my employees they were team players and dedicated workers. My favorite part of my job by far was my customers. I cared for all of them like family and would go above and beyond to help people. I love to work with people doing anything related to customer service, because I am a people person. The job for me became overwhelming because I do not consider it a job you can take on if you are a family person as well. I am a dedicated mother so taking on this management was a huge commitment and it became hard to balance home life and work."
good,"The company as a whole is a very great place to work, the pay and benefits are excellent. What it all boils down to is who your management team is that will determine your experiences at AT&T. Some are better than others, but aside from that it is rare to find a job with the benefits flexibility AT&T provides."
good,"A typical day consist of helping customers, doing inventory, opening the store, closing, etc.."
good,"Typical day at AT&T Mobility was fast pace, interesting and fun...The daily huddles that they do always turn out to be very informative and full of motivation."
good,Great place to work for and great management team.  This would be an awesome place to start fresh out of college.  Company overall was a good place to work.
good,"Typical day at work starts with a overview with your manager on how you're doing on your stats. AT&T is about numbers, you need to meet goals that are sometimes out of your control. You need to be able to multi task and be operational. It's decent pay and benefits and has many opportunities and training."
good,AT&T is a large company and but each retail store has it's own culture. All of the retail positions are sales based keep that in mind when applying.
good,"AT& T was a stressful job because of demands on meeting deadlines."
good,"The entire day was spent in a call center environment working with clients with service issues, billing issues, order issues and we were also required to transition all calls into sales calls."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my work was helping people resolve problems, supporting my team and the interaction I had with my co-workers"
good,"It was a work environment where you were using a high level of customer service. The hardest part of the job is just not taking no for an answer and when you do get that no , to keep pushing forward."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of about 200 + phone calls, but I was able to manage. I learned that you can not talk and listen at the same time."
good,no job security in sales but a good environment and great perks and there is micro managing. over all it was ok but not the job for me
good,Great company to work for some management inconsistent/Great pay but work has was to physically demanding/Many employees injured on the job.
good,"I got laid off only after 6 weeks and am looking for a job in the same industry. I love the technician position, I have good communications skills, and am good with my hands."
good,"Att has a nice campus and is a very nice place to work. The people are friendly and fun to be around. The customers can be tough but if you help them and are not rude, this will be a great fit for you."
good,"Fun co-workers, team players. Good place to work and learn. A lot of opportunities to grow. good benefits and good pay."
good,"Great people- some of the best and talented people I worked with at ATT."
good,This is a place for someone who doesn't really have a lot going on in their personal lives. It will take 10 plus years to be able to get a better schedule. AWESOME pay and my coach is the best!
good,"Low morale environment.  Company pretty much expects you to perform a miracle by being able to understand someone whom only their immediate family can understand.  "
good,"You wake up early, probably around 6:00 am for most. you arrive at 7:00 am to work. You listen to the managers talk about your numbers and then safety. I learned a lot about the At&t infrastructure around the entire San Francisco Bay Area having done jobs all around it. You will have to work a 10 hr day on average. Bending down to work on phone jacks will overtime destroy your back and knees. Climbing telephone poles is very dangerous. Co workers are good people all trying to scrap out a living. Most have earned and deserve the position. Management can be very cut throat. They will not hesitate to throw a technician under the bus to save their own hide. The technicians unionized and the union, for the most part, is strong. I love being out in the field on my own and working at my own pace, being that its hourly pay."
good,"definitely one of my favorite places i've worked. management is awesome, they really work with you to get those sales. daily meetings to go over qualifying and delivering quality customer service."
good,Over all not a bad place to work. Management treated you with respect. Did varies functions so work day passed quickly. Raises were very low.
good,Nice place to work. They have on going training to help you improve your job.Great PTO and health benifits. Great coworkers!
good,"Good Coworkers"
good,I love coming to work but when the door doesn't swing and we only have 5 customers a day with 4 Reps its impossible to make money
good,"Since I've been with the company a lot of changes have occurred.  At one point it was somewhat fun to be there.  Of course we worked but didn't seem as tedious and stressful as it does now with added rules and regulations.  Generally I've learned to be more patient and take my time and empathize better with people.  Most of my time is spent with my co-workers and immediate manager and they are very pleasant to be around.  I'd have to say the hardest part of my job is constantly quoting things verbatim to every customer and leaving one thing out has somewhat serious consequences.  The most enjoyable part of my job I'd have to say is free time I get to speak with my peers and get to know the newer ones a little better.   Also, the one on one's with my immediate manager."
good,"Hard work to meet day to day demands. Lots of pressure, but benefits and co workers are great. Been here for four years and have seen lots of good and bad, but in the end, it's like any other technology office job."
good,"Working as a Customer Service and Sales representative for AT&T was sometimes challenging but usually rewarding. I enjoyed everyone I worked with. I felt like we were more of a family than team members. The most challenging part of my job was when I was working as a mentor, and I have the desire to help other team members to meet their sales quote but they are unwilling to apply what I have taught them. The most rewarding part of my job was helping someone that welcomed the help and in the end they met their monthly quota."
good,i was apart of the dept that worked from home. i did enjoy working with att. everyday we would log into about 4 systems in order to view the customers accout.
good,"employees very dirty. "
good,Overall great team of dedicated employees who care about each other and our customers.  Lots of opportunity to learn new things due to size of company.
good,"Great people to be around.  Each day is an adventure with no two days being the same. This is a bit of a double edged sword because it also means each day is a huge question mark and you deal with endless day to day variables. Probably not a great fit for people who need a structure.  My manager is great and so are benefits with solid pay."
good,"A typical day at AT&T involved adjusting Commercial business accounts and working closely with the Account Representatives. I learned the importance of teamwork, as we interpreted the contract and managed the account accordingly. Management really empowered us to work independently, without much supervision. My coworkers were wonderful and we still keep in touch to this day. Always together around birthdays and Holidays. The hardest part about the job was the drive, since I had to travel 65 miles each way to get there. The most enjoyable part about the job was also the people I worked with. There was nothing they wouldn't do for me and vice-versa. I really miss my co-workers."
good,"The training is very unorganized. You have to train yourself and the way they teach you, if they do, doesn't help with interacting with an actual customer."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I have the power to have a positive effect on every customer that hears my voice. Giving an ear to every customers concerns, and knowing I made them happy."
good,I loved working for this comany benefits are grat and the money was great to. Management changes all the time. I was surplused a few times and had four different postions in 10 yrs.
good,"I loved my job at AT&T. I learned more about monthly compensation and learned how to work with Excel even more."
good,my exprience there was all abt money... it wasnt focused on customer service. if you made money you were there bestfriend if not you were moved towards the back and ignored.
good,"I worked here for four years, the pay and benefits are great at this company. If you want job security, this is not the place for you. The position I held was a sales representative in a call center. If the monthly quota was not met you were a step closer to being terminated."
good,ATT is obviously a huge company but they as a corporation is a good company to work for.  There are so many groups and it hard to work across groupls.  depends which field and group your're working with and who your supervisor or manager happen to be.
good,"The over-all atmosphere in this type of sales position was pretty decent. The team of sales associates were fun and supportive, but the hours were standard retail fair. Not really a great balance of work/family life except if there were enough sales people for that particular store."
good,"A typical work day started with going directly to work station. Logging into the computer and all necessary windows. Reading pertinent information to stay current with trending issues. At DIRECTV training is top notch. We had computer training's that we could complete at our desk as well as training's done in class rooms with training specialists, it just depended on what was needed. The management was constantly changing and and requirements were always changing and we were always threatened with termination at various times if certain stats were not maintained. The training provided gave me all the tools necessary for doing my job and I really don't have any particular item that was hardest for me. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships I built over the 8.5 years that I worked their."
good,"I was able to work my way up from a phone representative to a Team Manager to a Quality M&P Process Manager. "
good,Great benefits and pleasant work environment. There was always a great team effort from sales support all the way up to management.
good,"Steady stream of innovation, process improvements, and new products keep employees engaged. Numerous and various training opportunities allows employees to thrive in desired fields. My position as Centers Tech Support Manager has awarded me the opportunity to expand my knowledge of the company's support systems/databases, methods and procedures associated with troubleshooting, and expand my knowledge of the Java programming language"
good,Fun place to work with wonderful people who team to work together. Great opportunity to mentor others and  lead project teams to deliver product on time for customer satisfaction.
good,"Société à taille humaine rachetée ensuite par AT & T"
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for.  Within management, your day will average typically 10 hours a day.  Depending on the business unit you are working in, the pace and work load can be intense.  This is the most challenging part of the job, but if you can keep up with the pace and demand, the greatest reward is the fruit of your own work, and your subsequent compensation.  "
good,If my call center did not close its doors I would still be with them to this day. Other than that there is nothing wrong with this employer
good,".10 hour days"
good,AT&T is a great place to bein a career. They will invest alot of time and money in developing your skill sets and coaching you on your issues.
good,"The pay and benefits of this job were worth the poor management and difficult work. Although it was very hard work, dirty and sometimes dangerous, it was well worth my time to be there. I felt as though the management could have done a far better job, and there was little room for advancement within the company."
good,Productive job  I learned about the different types of people you can sell your services to depending upon location. The job is also enjoyable and not difficult if your very social to begin with!
good,"I was lucky and worked with a great bunch of people who were experienced sales people, and worked well to support each others customers to provide the best sales and support possible. The company trains people to know the equipment and how to train customers in using the technology. Management is hit or miss at times, some are very unscrupulous and encourage shortcuts, others hold their salespeople to high standards, I unfortunately had many of the underhanded types that cared more about sales than honesty. The great part of the job is having the latest and greatest of devices for free or at a substantial discount, and free service. Benefits are great, rewards programs and incentives are generous, I ended up getting a free bicycle from one of the rewards programs. The hardest part was trying to balance a personal life with work. I had many managers that also did not schedule well so there were times when I would have to come in and help."
good,"The benefits/coverage is good"
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for. Typical days are filled with financial reviews, forecasting, data interpretation, as well as AP. The hardest part of my job is not to get overwhelmed. There isn't a day that new challenges appear and have to be addressed. But the support here is great."
good,"People were nice. However, it was hard to keep up with thee rukes because every supervisor would tell you something different."
good,Explain and demonstrate products. Update software. inform customers about our latest and greatest devices. Give them the benefits of the ATT products.
good,Converting customers in areas were we will no longer offer DSL or we who now have the option to order AT&T Uverse .  I've learned a lot about Customer Service as AT&T has always been big on taking care of their customers.
good,"Great company to work for,aways learning new sys"
good,"Fast paced environment, always a challenge and focused on the latest and greatest technology. Global workforce. Work environment is remote for some job functions an other positions are set up in a collaboration work environment."
good,"The average day will start the daily sales meeting, teaching new reps sales techniques to improve their sales. Then heading to the field to talk to prospects."
good,"Working as a camp counselor was very fun working with children, I really got to have agreat time with the kids in the community.  I learned here kids will only do what you allow them to do.  Hardest part of my job would be standing outside in the summer heat all day with 12 kids."
good,"AT&T is a worldwide international company but the department I'm with is like family. We have been through ""life"" together."
good,Excellent place to work before 1984. Eventually renamed as Lucent Technologies. Now is Alcatel-lucent. Layoffs continue.
good,Nice group of people to work for. Good pay and benefits. Hardest part of the job was people taking on change.
good,"This company has a lot of room for advancement and the commission break down is definitly worth the work. As a professional, I love this company."
good,"Very diverse work environment, work schedule flexible to meet personal needs."
good,"This job was awesome!  AT&T supplied several career opportunities with financial aid for continuing education so you could dream big with this company."
good,"A typical day would involve 1 or 2 conference calls with the construction vendors to get updates on the progress of their projects and to ensure they had all the equipment needed to finish on or before deadlines."
good,"they always had nice incentives to keep the morale high. they were flexible with time, when you had an emergency. the pay and benefits were good and they constantly offered overtime. moving around in the company was difficult though, not a lot of support"
good,Normal Job. It is what you make it. Summers are hard and hot. I am a wireline tech. there is room for advancement if you can hang in there
good,"AT AT&T"
good,"micro managed, not a positive work environment. spend more productive time staying off manager reports than spending the resources to complete the job more efficiently. managed by fear more than productivity. no real concern on how or what was done to complete a task more about how long or whether a quota was met. Shortcuts have to be made to complete tasks according to specs. a very negative work environment, in fear of your job everyday and no positive reinforcement. every employee is just a # and each manager fears their job based on performance. First line second line management doesnt stand up for the front line in fear of their jobs. communication with front line employees is smoke and mirrors or just nonexistant"
good,I work in a call center for at&t and set up new accounts for reps that would call in and need help. I also ran credit checks on customers. as   well as i was a customer service rep. My main goal was to make sure all calls got handled professionally and in a timely way.
good,"A typical day at work starts at 8:00 am and ends when all the work is complete if that means that you're out until 10:00 pm.  I've learned that not every house is the same along with the customer you always have to play it by ear, the management could be better at communicating whether it be by e-mail or by phone.  My co-workers are a blast to work with I don't have any complaints about them at all , the only thing that is hard about this job is to make sure that when you leave the customer is satisfied that you have done everything for them and that you leave on a good note.  The most enjoyable part about this job is that you meet new people everyday."
good,"Fast paced, consistently changing workplace. Had various managers during my employment and learned to adjust to different management styles. Communication is key. Learned to coach to employee's strength, each person is different. Hardest part was finding what motivated the individual and keeping a positve work environment during many changes. Great benefits and salary."
good,AT&T is a good company to work for if you are willing to travek and have the time to invest in success- The work/life balance is nearly not existant - the days will start to run together but there is opportunity to move up if you are willing to move around and relocate. Leadership has opened up and they are really invested into employee engagement ...which helps to keep things fresh -
good,"Notning interested:"
good,Workdays are very fast paced. There are new challenges to accept every week. Management is very demanding on employees. Co-workers/employees are very smart and helpful. I enjoy the challenges and team building activities.
good,"Working at AT&T has been a great experience. The training staff does prepare each employee to work with customers with normal interactions and in non-threatening situations. Only problem is that many customers that call AT&T are not calling in happy when I speak with them in the retention dept. Many call in and are very vulgar and argue their points. I can understand many other's point of view; however, you get more flies with honey than vinegar."
good,"Pro: Pay, Benefits, extras"
good,I enjoyed my time working at Andorra. The pay was competitive and the co workers were like family!
good,"directv was a good company and did treat the employees good. Fun place to work at most of the time. I learn more computer skills and how to give customer more information. Most of the time you did not get time to meet with co workers because Amazon is a fast paste work place. Hardest part of the job is keeping your numbers down because you are work so hard to make sure the customer is happy when they get off the phone. Amazon have all different kinds of stuff they do for the employees. they have picnics, games and luncheons"
good,"Great pay and benefits"
good,It is a fast paced environment where the customer always comes first.
good,"I like Customer Service because dealing with different people you get a chance to see the world from different point of views. The sense of helping a person and solving their issue gives me a feeling of accomplishment. "
good,"Bank deposits, helping customers with cellular plans and phones or problems."
good,"DIRECTV takes television straight to the masses. The company operates the largest direct-to-home (DTH) digital TV service in the US, ahead of #2 DISH Network, and in direct competition with cable providers Comcast (#1 overall in the pay-TV market) and Time Warner. In addition to its roughly 20 million US customers, the company counts about another 12 million subscribers in Latin America under the DIRECTV and SKY brands. Services include HD, 3D, and video-on-demand (VOD) programming. Phone companies such as Verizon and AT&T bundle the company's video services with their own traditional voice, digital telephone, and Internet packages."
good,"its ok, if you can come inside AT&T with good package, life is good, otherwise its hard. Work culture in nice, you will learn a lot here. AT&T gives lot of priorities. Good growth in technical. Higher management is bad, they need to improve their leadership skills."
good,AT&T Mobility is a strong company to work for that offers different career advancement in to many different departments all over the country. They are innovative and are always thinking many steps ahead in every move they make. They challenge you every day to be your very best and ask a lot of their managers.
good,"Working for this company had many rewards."
good,"AT&T is a great company to work. We discussed our dispatches for the day, and any problems that may have occurred the day before, every morning in a very social and comfortable atmosphere. My colleagues were very skilled and intelligent and there was absolutely no competition between us. We socialized outside of work because our work setting was comfortable and relaxing. We worked very hard because we were proud of our hard work,"
good,"good place to work at./ lots of selling pressure"
good,Answer phones all day regarding billing with a high emphasis sales.
good,Installed phone cable and internet for homes and businesses made repairs and explained the new home services and many products door to door
good,"Answering phones, resolving customer complaints, escalations, worked as a team leader for special products etc."
good,"This was a great job.  The hours were cool and I worked with an excellent group of people.  Unfortunately the management was quite inept, which eventually lead to my division getting sold and me out of a job."
good,Learned so much about the satellite world and how amazing that the channels travel through air .
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was hitting our metrics and going above and beyond what was expected and being AWARDED for doing our job. Front row seats to BRONCOS and NUGGETS!
good,"AT&T has overall been a great place to work. The retail locations are primarily wireless sales with a mix of other products and services. Management goes through a lot of changes from time to time, but for most of the managers I've experienced working with they have been ideal for any employee to want to work for. There are many parts of the job that may seem difficult at times, but with persistence anything can be accomplished. The most enjoyable part of the job with AT&T has always been having co workers that I can truly enjoy in an atmosphere that is fun and relaxed."
good,I felt that the schedule changed to often to actaully have a life.  new schedule every three weeks.
good,"This is a fast paced, quota based sales environment. The commission rewards can be excellent. I found it exciting to have new products and services to offer customers every few months. "
good,"Overall work experience is good at AT&T. Work goes neck to neck with the development team. Involved in various projects, Few projects are in cloud environment and which follow agile manifesto."
good,"AT&T emphasize on training and investing in their employees/managers. Great managers are very hard to come by. They will help you to succeed. If you have a bad manager, it can be very cut-throat."
good,"The job was stressful because of the micro management. The job itself was good. Customers started off angry, but if treated right they would leave happy. My office closed & moved out of state so I don't feel it deserves all stars for security."
good,"Sales meetings, sale produces, customer service, stock store, set up marketing props cashier, close store."
good,"A good company to Learn Things. "
good,"I install phone and internet service, I also repair phone and internet service"
good,"Although I was not with AT&T for longer than 6 months, I did have a good experience with the staff and management. I learned that sales and commission were not necessarily a field of work that I was interested in, but I did enjoy working with customers and finding solutions to their issues. The majority of coworkers were very helpful and enjoyable to work with. With the competitive environment though there were a few that were unprofessional. The management team did well most of the time, but did falter a little when it came to coaching their team. I appreciated At&T's values and commitment to it's customers."
good,"i learned alot working here like working with different people some was angry, happy or sometimes upset with their food. i always made sure once the customers leave back out of the door they was satisfied. this job wasnt really hard since i am a fast learner everything was kind of easy."
good,A great place to grow in your knowledge of the telecom industry with ample resources available.
good,Most days would start with a conference call from area manager going over previous days sales numbers and different strategic products that were being focused on.
good,great place to work when you come in you work the late shifts managers will work with you to help you achieve goals
good,good opportunities in advertising programs to smb's.  great co-workers. imbedded customer base. good work/life balance.
good,"Early mornings, late nights, great work. You rarely see your managers out in the field. You work by yourself majority of the time and only interact with customers. You get pretty good support from your fellow techs and team members. Hardest part of the job is to make sure that you document everything and keep records of everything in case managers try to put you into a jam. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with nice customers, and riding around doing your own thing. The coworkers were pretty good. I learned to keep records of everything and keep my hands clean of dirty business."
good,"morning meeting, loading equipment in truck"
good,"ATT its is the great company, I want work there with no doubt.  However some leads are giving the company the bad name. If the employee did not do the throe personal work, it employee refused. They would call the hiring company to give the pink Slip."
good,"A day at work means making sure Representatives are on time, checking inventory, making sure at&t dress code is in place and our customers are treated with exceptional hospitality so as to maintain at&t integrity and brand. The hardest part of the job was the most enjoyable and that was meeting goals on various metrics"
good,Daily sales activity includes contacting existing clients face to face  and prospecting new businesses for the purpose of selling digital and print advertising products.
good,I really like working with my team and peers however I am interested in advancing my career and relocating to another state.
good,Overall a good company to work for once they get on the same page around policy and procedures for representatives and management and get a handle on the high call out rate.
good,"Good work life balance. Good job security. Advancement is a struggle, but achievable. Happy with my time at AT&T!"
good,"Most of the time your job was secured, but  as soon as you get use to something, you were forced to do something else. your job always changed. Our department worked most of the bugs out of different company departments, like Relocations, and then it was taken away to another group."
good,I enjoyed working at AT&T although i am now looking for a better job. I have been working there 2 years with a staffing agencey. I need more money and a job i can put in all my hard work at a company and have benefits and vacations.
good,"I began a work day two hours before my technicians began their shift, assessing previous day's completed and uncompleted work, prioritizing today's work schedule for more than 50 technicians and build a conference morning report for area operations managers. Additionally, I assigned work to technicians based upon their geographic proximity to scheduled work, skill levels of all technicians and vendor meet-ups when necessary. Further, throughout the day would monitor incoming alarms and redirect technicians to outages and other areas of priority as the wireless network's dynamics warranted."
good,"Because AT&T is one of fortune 500 top three Telecommunication Corporations I always felt like I worked at leading edge of the industry, especially since my customer base was primarily the United State Government.  My average day’s work aired a sense and feeling of accomplishment. Being on that leading edge just about every day there was a difference experience."
good,"Typical day is pulling up systems, asisting customers with the best service. Managment coaching for improved work. Co-Workers are very easy to get along with everybody works as a team. The job is not hard work. The most enjoyable thing about my job is assisting customers."
good,Company has good benefit. Pay is good if you are able you do a good job and sell the product. You can get advancement if you stick with the company for a great deal of time.
good,"As a worker in Arizona, you can be fired for no reason or cause. I had excellent managers and coworkers, but rulings from corporate were harsh. As contractors we were told we would be made permanent after a time but the carrot kept being delayed and it turned out we were just tools. This was back in 2006 so this review might not be as meaningful to current job seekers."
good,"My favorite place to work! Moved through the company (prior to sale and as the new company AT&T), trying new jobs and learning the software business from the ground up.  Enervating."
good,"Muy buena contratacion y ambiente laboral, Renuncie a la empresa porque no habia posibilidad de crecimiento, y porque me ofrecieron un trabajo mas acorde a mi formacion profesional en la Petroquimica Cuyo SAIC."
good,When I went to work on a typical day it would consist of screening customer calls.  The hardest part of the job was to hear one of the co-workers talking to a customer without respect. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I got to correct the co-worker's wrong and making it right.  I learned that in life in general that you can go further with treating people with respect because that is how you want to be treated.
good,"You sell phones and process bill payments.  More than half the people walking through the door will buy something.  Benefits and pay were fantastic, averaging $25/hr for a good, motivated sales rep in our location, but yours will vary."
good,"Selling products and solutions, get to learn a lot about people and what makes them tick. I like talking to people they can teach you a lot from what society is about."
good,"Good place to work, however, the compensation is on the low side. Very limited movement within the organization, and low chance of advancement"
good,Good company to work for. I enjoyed the culture and the work environment.
good,"Great place to work, always busy, some fun customers and fun contests for the consultants."
good,"Taking calls at home via VOIP, retaining angry customer's accounts, upselling and saving their business. Base + commission. Great opportunity."
good,"Learned how to deal with irate customers. "
good,good place to work. provides training and opportunity for advancement.
good,I was able to progress to a management level within one year managing my own team
good,"Involved in a morning call with equipment vendors first thing in the morning to objectively assess site forecast and completion as well as determine issues on site and forecasts for resolution."
good,"Co-workers nice and friendly, best part of the job is being able to work alone on those days you dont want to just do your job and go home"
good,"A typical day at this job was always very challenging. Changes were made very constantly so I always needed to be aware of all the changes in order to perform well at my job. I learned very much at this job about computers, tv's and voip system. My manager was very knowledgeable of all the aspect of performing the job. My manager broke every single issue down to simple key steps to remember. My co-workers were fun to work with, overall my team that my manager put together and educated felt like second family. He made us feel very positive about the potential we had to do our jobs right. The hardest part of the job was just keeping up the changes that the company was making and how we needed to adjust in order for us to perform at the level the company needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was having food spreads every week in our weekly meeting."
good,small business sales to customers calling in complaining about there service
good,constant change. schedules change every 3 to 6 months and can very from 7am to 10pm so you can forget about school if you want to be able to do both because it will affect school eventually unless you do online school only. good pay and benefits.
good,Enjoyed pitching at diff customers and enjoyed communicating new features
good,"Productive, Fast Paced, and Friendly environment to work in."
good,Having a desire to help the community was constantly a positive drive for me to be at AT&T
good,at&t when I lived in New Jersey was a great place to work. My team was very intelligent group of ladies/gentlemen. We were contractors so we didn't have too much lead way there. Management team that I worked for had NO CLUE as to what they needed to do.I think they were newly hired so didn't know too much of what we did. The managers (field/switch) that I constantly did work with were very knowledgeable. Overall at&t is a nice place to work at if you want to work for a big industry company.
good,"We have to be at the office at 10:30 a.m every morning. After that we will leave the office at 12 and go to our work station, which is located at an Walmart."
good,typical workday sitting at a desk answering phones. Learned how the passport service works and how passports are made and approved. Management was around but not overpowering. co-workers were pleasant  and helpful. The hardest part of the job was the training for the job. the most enjoyable was the doing the job itself.
good,Had to work with customers to make sure their cellular and home needs were met.
good,Great company to work for if looking for benefits. Very stressful and focuses switch constantly. Management is great depending on location.
good,DirectTV was technically a great company but had management issues that hindered advancement.
good,"A hard day at work is often considered a key to success. So is fun. Because you spend (on average) the same time within your professional circle as you do your personal one, enjoyment is pivotal to production. Fun, like enthusiasm, is contagious and has a snowball effect that helps generate good work over and over again throughout the organization. I have learned a lot about circuits and how they work. The hardest part is when the weather is bad, when we have lightening, circuits can't be repaired (which is not that often). I have a great co-workers, we all work as a team with no problems! The most enjoyable to me is working the early shift and not having to fight traffic and being on the guiding team here creating social events for my co-workers."
good,Enjoyed working here because I worked with a team that is supportive and there is avenue to learn new technologies.
good,its a challenging business. that allows you to interact with customers and get them what they need.
good,"Days can vary, go from back to back calls, to a few minutes between them. Learned how to read bills & explain changes to customers as well as how to use multiple systems on one call. Management could be hit r miss but most will do what they can to help you or back you up on calls. CO-workers were awesome, doing whatever they could to help with questions if managers were otherwise helping someone else. The hardest part is handling the days when one call ends & another comes in immediately after & it goes like that for most of if not all your shift. The most enjoyable part is knowing that what you did for a customer has made their day & relieved any stress they may have been having about their problem"
good,I worked on trouble tickets all day. AT&T downsized from 52 test centers to 28 and my union job was eliminated.
good,"Great place to work if you love technology. Always room to grow, and the learning never ends. Management in most areas, are highly developed leaders. The hardest part of the job is work life balance during holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job is technology."
good,Is a nice place to work and my co-workers are very professionals. Also provide trainigs in differents areas to develope professionally and to be prepare for the future vision of the Company.
good,"Challenging and rewarding, daily tasks encouraged to develop as a leader."
good,"Great people. "
good,Small company feel with huge corporate advertising.  Dealer locations are not fully functional AT&T retail stores.  Some of the consumer experience is lost due to limitations.  Overall the upper management is capable and the company is growing very fast.
good,"A career at A&T in the retail environment leaves little work/life balance. Working hours are a minimum of 50 hours/week with little time to take any kind of break. Working outside of scheduled hours is expected and time left for personal effects is kept at a minimum. There is much to be learned working at AT&T in that employees are given access to many training programs as well as career development help. The most difficult part of the job is the requirements of working variable shifts while standing for at least 9 hours per day, with little time given for rest, sometime as little at 8 hours are given between end time of one shift and the beginning of another. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to meet and talk with thousands of different people and learning the different key competencies of running a business."
good,"A typical day at work would be to put your sales technique to work and deliver an extraordinary experience to each and every customer."
good,Working for this company is very rewarding. The hardest part of the job is being able to resolve all consumer concerns on one call.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers.
good,"AT&T has a lot of innovative products and services. •        "
good,"- Prepare sales floor, Handle customer transactions, Close out sales floor "

good,working with great people. making good money and enjoyed to work there
good,"Great Training and Development"
good,"As expected, the telecommunications environment is always changing. The compensation changes around every 6 months because as soon as they see that employees are blowing goals out of the water, they will shift compensation around to keep everyone within a certain amount. "
good,As long as you given 150% then you are okay.  I learned alot but job sercurity is not a pro.  You can lose your job where whatever you manager say about you can't save your job.  You are only consider a number
good,"Lots of diversity in types of jobs and types of people."
good,DIRECTV offered great benefits and work/life balance. Allowed me to have flexible working hours.  Career advancement is limited if you currently work in one of the satellite offices.
good,Taking escalated calls from floor representatives to help negotiate with customers.Customers phones were suspended for being in a 90 day non payment status.
good,"Working with AT&T overall was a very positive experience for me.  I learned how to work within a team and my strengths as well as weaknesses.  My co-workers helped to make the workplace more enjoyable aside from the many pressures of working in a call center environment.  A typical day at work included checking emails, training, team meeting but most importantly assisting consumers with their sales and customer service needs.  The managers that I had were all unique in their own way and provided positive feedback with constructive criticism. I would say that the hardest part of the job was the pressure to sales when some opportunities were not available.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of ""making someone's day""  I was blessed to have helped some very interesting customers."
good,"Depending on the location you either have a lot of time on your hands or next to no down time. Learn your demographic quickly it will help but you will still see a wide spectrum of people coming into the store. Stay on top of current and future technology coming out, people will ask. Most of my coworkers were great and very helpful people, if you're not a techie find that person in the store and become friends with them and if you're the techie find another person like you in the store. Hopefully you will have a manager that has a background in sales they can be very helpful developing your sales skills and if they don't keep your head down and go with the flow. The compensation and benefits were really good when I was there."
good,The best part of working at AT&T was getting to work with amazing representatives. The variety of people was fantastic and I learned a lot about what different generations need as far as a manager goes. Relating to my agents on a personal level helped to ensure a team that worked well together and enjoyed their day.
good,I worked there for 3 1/2 years. I was a Customer Service Rep. I took calls and once I found a manager I worked well with I excelled. I  was even offered to help train a new group with calls. I learned a lot about the cell phone companies. The money is nice if you do it right. I made $5k in stocks in 3 years. Although I'm employed there any longer I  still have my stocks and my money is still growing

good,Worked for almost three years and loved my job. i left due to personal family issues.
good,"Continuous learning on job experience,  physical work, a profession many take for granted. Very grueling work at times with climbing poles and ladders when jobs required it. Pay checks best part of job."
good,"Es una muy buena empresa,porque estan pendientes de tu mejoramiento en tu campo laboral,y son cumplidos con sus obligaciones de contrato."
good,"Loved this job, I learned to manage different people with different personalities. Love the sales environment and quotas and the people are great. This company has great benefits and there is always room to grow. I learn to coach and develop employees. Work in scheduling and to look at the store trend. The hours are a bit long but they work with you just in case you are going to school. The down side is that you always work weekends."
good,My typical day at work involved being with my customers. My co workers are fun to work with. The hardest part of the day was working on top of the roofs and in the attics on hot summer days. My most enjoyable part of the day was working with my customers.

good,Worked 6am-2:30pm. Learn a lot about home phone industry. Crazy call volume. Excellent pay
good,"Management policy is inconsistent"
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for that offers you challenges.  As a project manager and release manager the typical day usually involves following up with your team members to ensure that the project is moving along fine.  I have weekly project meetings where we discuss the status of the project, solicit any questions, and determine if there are any major roadblocks that need to be mitigated immediately.  In addition the project is tracked to ensure that we are on schedule and within budget.  "

good,"A lot of phone calls and printing ID cards. I learned to be detailed oriented, and customer service. Management was hands on. Co-workers were like family. Taking on a high volume of calls at times was hard but manageable. I enjoyed my co-workers and new friends I met."
good,I was a customer service rep that took inbound calls. Was transferred to the Customer Retention team. I loved my co-workers but the environment could be stressful sometimes due to the lack of support from some of the management staff. The hardest part of the job was sitting for 8-10 hours and not being able to move around much.
good,Unfortunately the schedule came out on Thursdays and you wouldn't know if you were working that Sunday until then. Hours different every day and days off different every week.
good,"If you like selling and lots of customer service, go for it. Salary plus commission. Retail hours had its pros and cons.  Lots of perks & discounts. Managers will tell you what they want you to focus on selling Smart phones, Tablets, Wireless Home Phone, Residential Alarm (Digital Life), and accessories to consumers and businesses."
good,"Hard part of job was being on the phone all day long.  I most enjoyed helping customers solve problems, help with billing, and even teaching over the phone how to run their tv."
good,"This company has a very fun and relaxed working enviornment. If you are a contractor however, there is no room for advancement. The training was very easy and understandable."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people (interior and exterior).
good,"Great place to work, but should have strong sales background. The office I worked in had a nice family vibe to it. AT&T taught me to speak with a smile and ensure quality customer service. Even if a customer was angry and cussing, from my training with AT&T I can smile through it and help my customer."
good,"Company has great benefits.  Have to be flexible to work various hrs, weekends, and holidays."
good,"A typical day at work is busy. Learned more structured environment. Micro management. Co-workers are helpful. The hardest part of the job "

good,"Back End operations for Title Insurance with minimal training"
good,The company offers a huge array of departments and the ability to learn a host of skills
good,"AT&T has an establish traditional company culture that is very welcoming to diversity. A typical day at work would be talking to a million customers, while finding it challenging to get collaborative projects completed in a timely fashion in order to better customer satisfaction. AT&T's presence is very large across the world and their it is infinite opportunity. Just remember the lager the staff the harder it is to get things done."
good,"A typical day working here was keeping workers encouraged, and staying on top of our focused numbers."
good,Enjoyed competition co workers wer wonderful benefits great
good,Michigan Bell/Ameritech/SBC/AT&T was a great place to work in the 90's but things have changed
good,The company as a whole is a great company to work for. The company provides adequate training to employees and helps any one learn to sell. I have come across many great managers and a few not so great. There seems to be a lot of favoritism in some stores and no teamwork. I enjoy working as a team and the store i am currently in has a lot of tension between everyone and it is not a comfortable working environment at times. The pay is great as well as the hours but i would personally like more of a challenge and more of a teamwork environment because you tend to see coworkers more than you see your family therefore i would like coworkers to work together like family and that is not the case at the store that i am currently employed.
good,"Typical day was to to change rate plans, explain bills , add features ect."
good,Met alot of people and had a great staff. Enjoyed the customers and loved meeting new people

Lo que mas me gusto fue el hecho de estar en contacto indirecto con otra cultura."
good,"dispatched to install/replace/repair telecommunication facilities and equipment "
good,"A typical day at work for me starts at 6:00am est, I am prepared to answer my AT&T small business customers concerns about his/her wireless phone or billing. I learned to actively listen to my customers for clues on how best to resolve their issues and follow my company's knowledge guides and policies. The hardest part of my job was when I had to use more than one technique to resolve wireless technical issues; it is a lot easier on both myself and my customer as far as time when the first steps fix the issue. When my tech calls run a long time, I have to work harder to connect with my customer and keep him/her engaged until the issue is resolved. My department if the last step in technical resolutions for our customers. I really enjoy when I see a ""poo"" (power of one) awarded in chat. A ""poo"" is a certificate stating that one of us technical reps has done an amazing job for a customer. My absolute favorite time at work is when my customers tell me that I did a great job and that they only want to speak to me every time they call."
good,Ensure an extraordinary customer experience. Sell all products and services offered by the Company. Meet all sales objectives.
good,Developed professional skills through training and learning new systems of management. I also banked weekly deposits and money counts
good,"AT&T provides flexible hours and is a great place to work. Sometimes they could do more to route their traffic throughout their network but other than that, and the ever-changing policies, I have no complaints"
good,"ATT was at one time a great company to work for, however for what ever reason the company had, its Customers and Workers became less important.  The last 5 to 6 years the Customers were those that were not computer literate and/or disabled and/or elderly and confused.  Today they are pretty much left by the wayside in My opinion.  Management did what they could but had their instructions.  My co-workers were struggling also.  We were there for the benefits and the pay - which was nothing to complain about.  I am very grateful for the employment and my retirement I had with ATT."
good,"A typical day at work involves back-to-back phone calls with small business customers.  This is a good place to learn the ropes as far as where telecommunications services are headed in a business environment.  It is also a  place where you are micro-managed, in a call center, at levels that involve 4-5 managers sending a total of 25-30 (approximately) instant messages to your computer desktop a day."
good,working at At&t help you increase your customer service skills because you deal with customers everyday.
good,"By most accounts AT&T is a great place to work.   Compensation is fair (but not great), and its one of the few companies you can stay with from graduation to retirement.  However, it has a large union which renegotiates its contracts every three years.  That translates into all management spending 100s of hours training (on top of their everyday work) to replace/SCAB for these workers when they strike.   It creates tension between bargained for and non-bargained for employees, and creates enormous strain on everyday activities.  Furthermore, you must be ""released"" from your current position to move to another position internally and that happens few and far between leading to a stalemate or trapped situation.   Finally, even if your performance reviews are consistently exceeds or far exceeds, your fair market value is much higher than what you are earning, and even if all levels of your management agree to raises, HR will shut you down as if competition does not matter."
good,its was very good people with a very nice staff and willing to help and lots of advancnment
good,"Great place to work, although not many customers come into the location. The majority of the day was pretty slow, so the day felt a little longer. My co-workers were not too bad, just a little lazy at times. I was the manager of the location so I had to put them in place. The hardest part of the job was getting customers to purchase Uverse, especially if they only came in for a question or for something silly. I would literally spend over an hour trying to convince them to purchase Uverse. It would always get done, just not as easy as people think it is. The most enjoyable part had to be when the sale was closed. If you are a salesmen, you know that closing the sale is one of the best feelings."
good,AT&T is a great company to work for. Diversity and excellence are core values and employees are valued and treated fairly.
good,Tasked with conducting in-depth review of invoices from all domestic and international Telephone Companies utilizing the AT&T network.  Responsible for validating pertinent information to adhere to contract terms and managing the uploading of information into AT&T applications.
good,A typical a day at work was sitting on the phone for eight hours answering inbound calls from customers regarding their bill or their cable television.  The hardest part of the job was sitting stationary for eight hours a day.
good,"Developed monthly variance reporting to plan and forecast and journal entry adjustments to actuals during monthly financial close process. Managed the creation and use of standardized spending analysis & metrics templates Supervised Chicago region retail operations audit and cash processing team, staff of 9."
good,I Did love the job until too any people became click-ish involvement. Yes there is Room to grow but its not based on your productivity its really based on who you know.
good,"good and fun"
good,Enjoyed working there and learned alot of new skills there.  Met alot of great people there and was a good company to work for.
good,AT&T was the most fun I had working. My office was my truck ( company provided) and I drove all over doing maintenance on a new service being provided.
good,"its a good company but not enough time for family. Great benefits, good values, and a great goal."
good,"I provided modeling and implementation of tooling, process, methodologies, doctrine, and documentation.  Given my extensive experience in IT with SCM, SQA, Metrics/Measurements, and such I conduct a lot of mentoring and training."
good,Revenue growth is getting stonger due to strong wireless gains driven by quality network performance and continued U-verse growth.
good,"Not life/family oriented because of a lack of time off when needed. Attendance is based on a 12 point system. You must stick to  a strict schedule. Management is good. Most enjoyable part of the job is the atmosphere. Pay and benefits are good. I learned that you have to be career oriented and want to do the best at work, adhere to your schedule, meet company goals and you will be okay."
good,I enjoyed the culture and diversity of my time shared with this company.
good,"Retail stores:"
good,A typical day at work allowed for me to meet daily sales goals and potential new customers. I would set up roughly 3-4 new customers and help 5-6 existing customers with new products. I learned a great deal on ways to please both new and existing customers. My management team was very helpful in achieving sales goals set by them. My coworkers were also very helpful in pleasing any and every customer that came in to our store. The hardest part of my job was the work life balance. The times were very scattered and I could not dedicate a certain time for my family. The most enjoyable part about AT&T were the customers and employees I was able to see everyday. 
good,Working for AT&T was a very good experience. My position at AT&T allowed me to enhance my customer service skills.
good," I am in the Payroll/Attendance department.  A typical day begins with logging into Kronos, our timekeeping system, IEX which is where we view the reps schedules. Data entry is my main job. That's what I do through out the day. Making sure all paid and non paid codes are entered on the reps time card. "
good,Not really fair in advancement. Favoritism is prevalent. Over time is forced and it is difficult to take off when your sick. 
good,"I troubleshoot customers internet and work to resolve the issue. AT&T s a great company. Our schedules changes every month due to school I"" need a permanent schedule."
good,Working here was a great experience with room for advance. Top of the telecommunications technology market with some ups and downs. Working under some management staff was a pleasure and working under others was stressful. As and RSM there was very little personal/family time as they would call you even on your days off with little concern of where you were or what you were doing. This does not hold true with all management just certain management at the time of my employment. I enjoyed working with new products as they were hitting the market and not only learning about them but teaching them to others.
good,"they provide tuition reimbursement, great health and vision benefits. fast phased environment. constantly changing."
good,"Door to door sales can be hard if selling is not something you do, but anyone who does it can have good days and really bad days. It is just about counting your losses and using them to motivate your wins!"
good,AT&T does not appear to have the same values as BellSouth did before the merger. 
good,"*Answering phones, dealing with customers, using the companies software programs, and dispatching technicians out to various sites"
good,Worked around time of merger between Cingular Wireless and AT&T.   Companies combined best of both worlds. With little senority you can expect to have a challenging shift for at least a year. Job security strong with customer service related positions. Good benefits.
good,It was a nice work environment and became friends with all my co-workers. I learned to be very positive. Every one in management was very nice 
good,"Although you will have to sacrifice your personal life to make a decent living, it can be worth it if you find yourself on the right team. "
good,Overall I wouldn't say that Directv was a bad company to works for but there is definitely room for improvement.   The management was great and so were the people I worked for.  The job was really stressful at times and I really didn't like not knowing if or when my scheduled shift was going to change.  That was difficult to work around when it was such short notice.
good,Very high turnover rate. Great pay and benefits. Management was very poor and under qualified for their positions. Very boring and repetitive day to day. 
good,"•the most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers"
good,"A typical day at work requires me to observe my team to ensure the day goes smoothly. Dependent upon the task of the day needed I usually multi-task several projects along with my work load. If a customer has a compliant or when we have difficult customer, I’m the one usually tasked to work them. My motto is to make sure all know that have been heard or seen. "
good,"     I worked four ten hour shifts 3 p.m. to 1 a.m. Taking calls from DirecTV customers dealing with installation issues mainly scheduling appointments. I would also activate receivers, add/remove programming, and help customers with some technical difficulties. I had learned some computer tricks such as how to navigate between several pages to better assist customers. I had great managers it was a real joy to have met them. The hardest part of the job would have been probably the angry customers. However as the saying goes ""a soft answer turns away wrath,"" of which as long as the customer knows and feels that you are doing all you can to get an issue resolved then he/she tend to lighten up. The most enjoyable part of my day honestly would have been hearing a customers smile after I would solve their issue."
good,"Driving multiple sales metrics"
good,"A typical day at work was very busy and included many different tasks that required organization and follow up.  I communicated with upper management and all departments daily. I made great relationships with co-workers. I was always in a managerial position therefore I learned to work with each individual on the basis of their position.  The hardest part of the job was the fact that I was to always be available at any time, any day, or what ever reason.  Work days varied from 8-16 hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was working hand in hand with different departments and learning new things daily that helped me with my success. "
good,"A typical day working for the phone company would be to receive my work orders for the day and then proceed to my first job. I learned so much from the job, how communication lines work the process of installing lines and repairing communication lines. The hardest part of the job was troubleshooting the cable."
good,"Dealing with upper level management."
good,This was a very enjoyable place to work. Benefits were great. Great environment.
good,"Being a member of management I felt that I was underpaid for the amount of responsibility I was given.   Being that we are unionized, I felt the non union support was lacking."
good,"Company has been through a lot, but has come out looking pretty good after divesting Lucent Technologies in 1998."
good,"great pay and benefits but get used to not seeing your family often, way too much overtime and if you take off for personal time you jeopardize your job"
good,From 1985 to 1991 I had the pleasure of working at Bell Laboratories in Holmdel New Jersey. I worked as an assistant electrical engineer building new computer rooms and other lab spaces for the research community. The 5 years I spent there were some of the most rewarding years of my technical career. I wish I could find another company that valued their employees the way that AT&T did during those years.
good,Enjoyed my job
good,. Overtime
good,I have enjoyed working for ATT but I find it very difficult to find a work/life balance. As a manager my days off are not actually days off. I have enjoyed working in wireless retail and truly love the challenge. I have a small child at home and find myself torn to be the best manager and the best mother possible. ATT is a great competitive company that offers great benefits.
good,"great place to start your career, lots of support, and room to advance"
good,We had spiffs regularly and it was an upbeat environment. however they constantly changed the commission structure making it harder to commission.
good,High stress and challenging. Enjoyed the people. Offered top notch training.
good,Buena relacion con mis compañeros de trabajo. Se valore el trabajo en equipo hacia un objetivo en comun.
good,I enjoyed the work and technology. Large company where they did not see the value of the products my division provided.
good,"Great job, great learning experiences. Professional enviroment."
good,was a good job just hard to balance family and job...pay was good but was spreadsheet management and always just felt like a number there
good,this job was one of my favorites because i enjoyed the work i did and got payed good money for it.
good,"A typical day includes driving performance of sales representatives, sales support staff and management. Assisting staff in providing an excellent customer and employee experience. The toughest part of the job is the work/life balance. Managers are required to work a minimum of 50 hours per week but typically end up working 70 or more hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is the social interaction with both customers and employees."
good,A typical day at work would be taking inbound phone calls. Occasionally meetings with team leader or additional training is scheduled in the middle of the day at least once a week.
good,a typical day would be to come in get some coffee tturn my computer on and wait for the frist call. Everyone there is great and greeting goodmorning to one another just a family enviroment
good,"review previous days numbers for each location, visit scheduled locations-train- side by side selling-"
good,Good company.Great benfits.Good discounts on phone services and products.
good,"• Very busy creating training courses (writing, graphics, audio, video, interactive activities; working with SMEs, editors, IT, LMS, and other project personnel."
good,"In charge of large Retail Sales Force (100+). Had strategic partner responsibility of managing the contracts and relationships with large retailers such as Wal-Mart, Radio Shack and Sears."
good,•a typical day at work
good,Great pay and benefits but they micro manage by making you do silly things..
good,"After being here nearly 18+ years, I think it is a great place to learn all the technologies of telecommunications. From DS0 to OC192. Great ! But trying to keep up with everything, you had to actually do the work, because once you had the training, that is it. Except what you and your co-workers teach each other. But that was great too."
good,"fue un empleo muy positivo porque estuve todo el tiempo en contacto con gente y para mi eso es lo mejor que me puede pasar. Creo que he nacido para eso, me gusta el buen trato y sobre todo ser simpática con quienes me rodean. Si bien el pago no era bueno yo lo hice con mucho gusto porque me hacía bien asistir todos los días a trabajar, además aprendí mucho"
good,"AT&T is a great place to build your resume, work at a big, bureaucratic company, and get to play with a huge amount of money. It's also frustrating, laden with unnecessary managers who mostly cannot do their jobs, and not great for career development."
good,At&t is a great job for student as it is very flexible. Company has high demands but work around students schedules which is a plus.
good,Most days were very high pressure with constant deadlines but I would rather be busy! I have always had to multi-task in order to get the job done. I enjoy working with people and have made a lot of life long friends through my work career.
good,Was very hardworking and bring in large three figure revenues
good,"Work in a fast pace enviorment. I learned how to put together car parts. The manageemnt was all over the place their were to many manager around and each looked the same, one person would give you in order and another manager would tell you something different, that would go against what the previous manager assigned you to do."
good,"Greeting customers and offering our products which are best suitable for them. Being able to setup devices and make them ready to use for our customers. Managers were helpful, yet very strict when it came to pushing harder to reach our goals. Co-workers worked together to help each other and be able to answer questions for each other. Being able to work in a friendly environment is very important for me, and I've learned to leave personal matters at the door to have a successful day at work. The hardest part would be assist irate customers, which I was always put into doing because I am patient with everyone and I know how to turn situations around without customers getting even more upset. Very nice place to work, good compensation but very high goals for a part timer."
good,Typical work day is helping customer agents with daily administrative access and troubleshooting tools they use.
good,"As a Team Support Specialist my job description included phone tiim at which time I communicated directly with the customer and their concerns. The remainder of the time I answerred inquiries from agents and customer complaints that escalated. I also addressed the team leader and manager about things going on with agent and customers to resolve issues. I learned alot about the technical aspects of satellite television and programming as well as strengthening my abilities to multitask and prioritize. The most difficult aspect of that position was adapting to the constant repriortizing of the rules, regulations and company policies. The most enjoyable part of the jobs was the ablity to speak with, relate to, and resolve the issues of both the agents and the customers."
good,"I was the ""go to guy"" when something needed to be done, or someone needed help, or on the job training. Also when the boss was sick or on vacation I filled in for him. Ran a crew of 20 techs, who reported to 3 different garages, then on to as many as 20 different job locations. I would handle all reports, meeting and problems."
good,"The compensation and benefits are excellent, however advancement in this company is based on other elements far from leadership skills. This job is demanding, but rewarding in the financial sphere and personal contact you have on a daily basis with different individuals."
good,"I thought I would be able to retire from AT&T however when the merger between SBC and AT&T took place over 700,000 lost their jobs. Great Benefits. Employees were like a second family."
good,Excellent benefits & pay but not much room for advancement. If you're a top seller don't expect your manager to promote you. They get paid off your sales.
good,"Training there was exceptional. Management seemed to be there by, ""who you know"" statuses. It was a fun environment, but instead of seeing mid-aged people dressed respectively, you would find almost kids, with hats sideways, foul language and music you would really not want your kids to listen to. Careless behavior, and dancing on the tables. A sheer lack of respect to what we call ""work"". a workplace can be fun, but has to bear some form of respect. A place of value. I was not impressed by what i had experienced. Although i will say the actual instructors and the training was still top notch, which is what At&t is famous for. Salary was good, but keeping your numbers meant pushing products on customers who had not even requested them, which is what some were doing. Dignity must be kept, in my eyes. Unfortunately, we are seeing that less and less in sales environments."
good,I was not a direct employee of AT&T but a contracted customer service corporation.
good,"Each day is an opportunity to learn more about different types of technology and to develop relationships with the customers to encourage return visits. I've learned a lot about excelling in customer service and developed sales techniques to achieve monthly sales goals. The hardest part of the job is keeping up moral among coworkers and managers, At&t is a very high stress job and not a whole lot is done within the work place to improve moral when employees get overwhelmed. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fast paced environment, the benefits and pay provided and the satisfaction of having a productive month."
good,"Distinct working hours, but little room for growth within current job as proficiencies increased. Opportunities for educational growth offered. Competitive salary, but future always uncertain."
good,"A day started in the morning where I would get my daily work. I would then hit the road to repair, replace, rehab telephone cables and make house visits to repair customer equipment. Co-workers would gladly assist if a person was behind or in trouble....like a family. The hardest part of the job was the physical demands. At times a tech could have to carry up to 100 pounds repeatedly. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom to be outdoors everyday and satisfying your customers needs."
good,"Provided second- level technical support for At&t uverse supporting 4 million customers throughout the U.S. Proficient in troubleshooting hardware, software and connectivity issues for both Mac and Microsoft operating systems. Additionally provided support with voicemail, telephone, and client email applications. Challenged to provide timely resolutions in a high-stress environment all while providing quality customer service"
good,I learned how to be patient with every kind of person. I was a part of a huge company that many people had different opinions about.
good,En un día típico de trabajo empezaba mi horario alas 7am y salia alas 330pm contestando y transfiriendo llamadas a diferentes departamentos como servicio técnico y re conecciones.
good,Constant work flow
good,"great company with great employees and management. pays well, youll get good working hrs, great benefits, able to move up within the company"
good,The culture was awesome. The help and support was outstanding. Their training staff could have used a lot of help. It was challenging yet rewarding. One must be very customer oriented for this job.
good,Typical day answering sell calls
good,Holiday Black Outs.
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for if you want to have a steady pay check with great benfits. You won't get rich unless you are willing to relocate and smooze with the right folks. There are a lot of generations of family that are in the company that has been around for over 100 years. So, don't be shocked if someone's son or daughter gets promoted over you and you've put in your time and know more that the person you now report to. It's a huge company with tons of networking opportunities."
good,- Great place to work
good,Completely a lot of reporting for CIP. Supported the markets Financial Analyst who manage CIP with the Markets.
good,Have learned how to interact with all management levels and maximize multi tasking under time constraints.
good,"Sales Representative: Day to Day operations include sales end operations, receiving inventory, auditing weekly account and sales credits, small business account representative."
good,"• Included massive telecommunication and computer skills, handling high vol. in an out bound calls, responsible for credit checks to determine eligibility for phone service, note taken every account, also using 10 key and word processing."
good,"Currently, I research trending issues in the call center and implement processes to better the centers performance."
good,Good opportunities - great learning experience. Resources are smart and hard working. Very large company so your projects are impacted by many others. Risk analysis and management are essential. Lots of politics on each project but should be expected with such a large company.
good,"While at ATT I took inbound calls from customers that needed their cell phones fixed. I processed payments for them, and added or removed features from their plans. I learned alot of technical procedures there. I learned alot of good customer services/ support skills."
good,Very diverse work environment. Engaged employees and lots of opportunity for advancement.
good,"The job was alittle stressful, but rewarding. The best part was all the product and services that were available to the customers. It was very interesting to learn them all. Sometimes being heard by the ""big wigs"" was impossible because it was such a big company."
good,"I was directly responsible for selling wireless devices to small local businesses. I learned about lead generation, how to think outside the box."
good,This was a great place to work for many years. I grew up at this company and made many specials friends and co-workers. The hours were flexible and management was overall pretty good. The hardest part of working there was having to work holidays.
good,"good pay, great people. sometimes has unrealistic expectations."
good,A day at at&t was a day on your own hard work get all you items for tha day and get it done
good,"Worked in scheduled shifts in a 24/7/365 environment. Learned numerous networking technologies and worked with many different kinds of technicians, installers and departments to provide excellent support for our networking infrastructure. Most of my peers were bright individuals always looking to give a helping hand whenever they could. Hardest part of the job initially was adjusting to the changing schedules while the most enjoyable for me was the challenging environment along with the flexibility that it provided."
good,"I learned a lot of technical information through all of the training I received. My co-workers were all very nice and professional and I do miss that aspect of my job. The most difficult part of the job was being on call 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. It left very little time for family life. I really enjoyed it when I completed a project/installation, and the customer said they really appreciated everything I did for them. That was very rewarding."
good,"buen ambiente, agradable inestable económicamente , sin sueldo base aprendi a estar en un ambiente laboral bueno, calidad de gente"
good,The work environment would be serious and lenient at the same time. It required constant communication among coworkers to ensure business efficiency. This was shown in the mandatory daily meetings every morning. It was lenient because of how there would be prizes for daily sales as well as a lounging area that would be available for all employees.
good,"Once you log in to your computer you take off running.. It's a high paced ,energetic company where you come in contact different walks of life, product knowledge and integrity is a must that will make you stand out as I did, my co workers were knowledgable and easy to come to if and when i had any questions."
good,Assisting customers with billing or technical issues
good,"a typical day includes assisting customers, selling phones, stocking inventory, balancing drawers, filing paperwork, keeping up with new knowledge of technology, tech support and meeting with management to discuss goals each day. I learned how to manage a store, deal with hostile customer situations, and explain contracts, plans and features to customers. Management is good within the stores, as you get up beyond the stores, they seem to lose touch at how difficult the job of a sales rep can be. The hardest part of the job can be scheduling and the unflexability of working retail. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people find the perfect device for them and having them leave with a smile on their face."
good,"Felx hours, great training, I supported the sales staff, management was in Dallas, the hardest part was competing with outsourced work from India, but I loved helping customers with advertising that increased their business."
good,•a typical day at work is ver fast pace also interact with a lot of customer
good,"I am a store manager so a typical day at work requires me to do inventory , scheduling, data entry, and conference calls. What I learned was that customer service can take you a long way if your willing to build value with customers. My employees are hard work and love the training manuals I came up for them, the manuals allow them to do their job easier. The hardest part of my job are watching customer leave the store without having that great experience. Most enjoyable would be the customer who leave with the idea of only wanting to shop at my store because of their experience."
good,ACCOUNT RESOLUTION y position. Overall good pay no benefits and the temporary position was to long to not go permanent.
good,"Ans incoming calls, assisting cust w/ telecommunication services."
good,"Straight forward work environment, with very nice co-workers. Learned a great deal of technical knowledge. The hardest part of the job sometimes can be the stringency of the policies and getting the technology to work as it should. The biggest enjoyable part is seeing new technology and meeting new people on a daily basis"
good,"This company is fast paced and always moving forward. If you like a constant change of pace, look no further."
good,"A typical day working in retail is fast paced,assisting customers every need with wireless services,billing issues an issuing credits for billing issues due to a glitch with the network. I've learned so much in the wireless industry, given the tools to continue to learn the many facets of technology via classroom and taken courses online. The Management is always helpful and willing to help you to be successful at your job where you can utilize your skills to be the best you can be. My co-workers were very team oriented and always thinking about the team and we pushed each other to be successful in sales. The hardest thing about the Job was the customers that came in belligerent, and Irate that we had to have escorted out the store because of their unwillingness to compromise and calm down. The most enjoyable part of the job was managing a team that helped each other close sales and how close of a team they were. They also"
good,a typical day would be a rep assisting a customer either business or personal with activating or upgrading a line on their account. i have learned several new sales tactics and how incorporate changes with in the ever changing wireless industry. Management is okay. My co-workers are adequate for the position. Overcoming the company's coverage in our area. The ability to impact a customers business or personal plan by offering a solution to them that allows them to maximize their plans and services.
good,"Generally I have a tech meeting once a week. I start my day at around 5:30 AM and end around 7:00PM. This is a self-paced, self motivated job; you control your income."
good,It was a great place to work.
good,"I learned great customer service skills working with AT&T. I learned how to handle many different personalities. I made a lot of great friends. Management was OK but could have been a better support system. A typical day at work would be to answer anywhere from 20-60 calls a day and answer any type of questions or handle any type of issues including activation's, billing, order's, and services."
good,There are lots of opportunities within AT&T given the size of the organization. It is a great place to launch a career and gain a lot of insight into business and to grow your personal knowledge-base. The training programs available are top-notch in any industry.
good,"Typical day was taking deposits, balancing drawers and customer service. I learned how to work with people, being responsible for a lot of money. Hardest part meeting older people and them passing. Enjoyable part was all of it I enjoy that as my first job."
good,"Each day I assited 900-1000 customers daily wit information for all 50 states including Canada. A large part of the day was geared toward problem resolution for our customers. The hardest part of my job was when I wanst given the proper tools to assist some customers with there requests, yet I still took ownnership for these issues because we worked as a team. What I most enjoyed was when a customer had almost given up hope for what they needed and I was able to assist and lead them in the right directtion."
good,"Great company, great training, excellent compensation. However, they have moved away from permanent employees toward temps and term employees. You can make a lot during the rainy season but they are focussed on reducing the work force rather than increasing it."
good,"Highly customer service oriented, fast paced and very detail intensive. Customer satisfaction, providing correct and accurate information through a constantly changing web based information source and upselling products and services is the three primary company goals. Directv does a fair and good job with employees, if you try and progress you will succeed. Great benefits included."
good,"A typical day at work included (on average) 66% of the day on the phone taking Access Card Distribution/ fraud prevention/ advanced technical phone calls. The remaining 33% of the day applied to taking supervisor requested calls, advising agents, and account investigation."
good,"I have had a lot of great specialists come in, and learn under me. I've helped each one of my team members develop into competent, adept SEM Analysts. I look forward to my next challenge."
good,"great, i had great managers great training well kept enviroment"
good,"A typical day with start with me loggin into my computer checking for updates, then our 1st of the morning meetings. From there I would log into my phone and begin to take calls. This was front end collections, no outbound calls. I would take payments, or setup payment arrangments for the company's customers. Answer any billing questions they migh have."
good,As a Customer Service Rep the job can be stressful at times for retention specialists. The people are friendly and the work environment is better than some comparable workplaces.
good,"Good company for the experience, schedule was always different from day to day and was hard to manage time outside of work as long days always came unexpected."
good,"A constantly changing & evolving company, its was never boring. This company offers room for advancement; although at times you may have to move into a different market to do so. The compensation & benefits are good, and you are recognized for for achievements. Overall a great company to work for."
good,This company pays very well and has the best benefit plan that I ever has with any company
good,I enjoyed working there and all the tasks that came with my postion.
good,If you enjoy a fast paced inbound call center environment this was the place to be! In this position I was able to hone my customer service and sales skills while learning about the Telecommunications industry. Management provided incentives and continuous support to aide employees in meeting daily sales quotas. It was a team oriented environment and co-workers worked together. The hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable and that was making sure my customers were receiving the BEST services possible!
good,It was a contract employment. I was a manager for small business and tier 1 tech support
good,Good place to work as a first time job working there can give you a good feel for a professional environment
good,I enjoyed my time at at&t as it was a challenging fast paced business which I am accustomed to.
good,If you have younger children the schedules might not work for you
good,"The jobs there are simple enough, but the layers of bureaucracy is counter-productive when trying to get something done quickly."
good,Working for AT&T was an experience I greatly appreciate. The money and benefits were great.
good,A corporation where you can work as hard as necessary to get ahead. Overall a fantastic company. Would definitely want to return in a different capacity outside of Sales
good,"In the store I work in, I work with really great and fun people."
good,"I enjoyed working for AT&T Wireless Call Center. The job training was easy and fun, and I enjoyed working with different AT&T Employers from various placed of the world. I believe interacting with the customers was my favorite, even though it was only over the phone contact you really learn alot about your AT&T customers."
good,I always felt stuck in the middle between demands of management and what the company expected and also fustrated with trying to meet the expectations of the customers and balance the two. Every day I wondered if this was my last day due to the extreme stress. I am proud of myself sticking it out for almost five years.
good,"It was an enjoyable friendly atmosphere to work in. Co workers were friendly to work with as well. Strong management team, that i have learned  a lot from. I would recommend others to work for AT&T and i would be happy as well to join again if I get any chance near future."
good,"Enjoyed working outdoors. Good managers instruct, guide, and help. Don't forget to CYA! Work closely with  other employees and the manager (at least 2 or 3)."
good,Many well organized engineering scrum teams. Scaled Agile environment. Wide array of technologies. Nice environment with many events. Good access to metro green line.
good,"Been working at AT&T for 21 years.  The company has treated me very well.  I can't think of one bad manager over this period.  Lots of good, interesting projects.  However, the last three years has been a lottery of who's getting laid off next, every quarter."
good,"They will try to give variable schedules. The company has great benefits that cover medical, dental, vision and discounts on your plans. The training for the new devices and plans are very good."
good,"A great benefit of my job is getting to work in a team atmosphere. I enjoy helping my team reach their daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly goals. There is always something to be learned day in and day out when working with a tech company as the technology field is always changing."
good,"Was a Great Company when was Bellsouth, but since AT&T acquired morale has gone downhill.  I use the analogy that we went from filling out forms online to carbon copies in many areas."
good,Thoroughly enjoyed the job duties and environment.  Good people to work with and know.  Best pay & benefits available for a job with no degree required.  Terrible system in place when surplus/layoffs occur.  No job security
good,"I really enjoy my time here, and I think just about everybody who works there feels the same way.  The company provides a wonderful environment to learn new things and improve ones skills.  I highly recommend it."
good,This position is all about taking care of the needs of the customer. It is a sales position. Zero to none in training on how push sales into more. No guidance.
good,There were many layoffs there perhaps due to the loss of a million subscribers and the integration of DTV and AT&T. People who worked after hours did not put those hours on their time card.
good,"In recent years because the company is rebranding and turning from primarily being a voice, data and video company to a content based company job security is not present for employees with tenure.  However, the company has excellent for-site. They continue to stay relevant by transforming from a ""phone company"" and continually adding services to stay relevant like cell phones, cable tv, internet, and now they offer content like HBO and AT&T programs.  Employees willing to upskill and make contacts outside of their organization will continue to be relevant during down sizing."
good,"At AT&T I typically entered multiple homes a day. I installed/repaired television, phone and internet. I learned strong leadership/management skills as a steward/chief steward (9) years over my 12 year tenure. it was a fast paced environment where I learned to plan out my day an meet safety, quality and efficiency standards. The most enjoyable part of the job was creating customer relationships and delivering a quality product that ensured customer satisfaction."
good,"Aprendí a prospectar para aumentar mis ventas, gestionar mi propia cartera de clientes, enfoque total en metas y excelente esquema de comisiones. "
good,Management position. Benefits and compensation are in line with the industry. At least one to two telecommuting days are offered in some areas of the company.
good,"AT&T was a good company to work for when it was Southwestern Bell.  It cared about its employees as much as the customers.  But slowly, after the purchase of AT&T, and taking on the name, it became more of a numbers only company."
good,Good workplace and pay. Super fast paced. There’s definitely a work culture here and a lot of great people that you will meet along the way. You can definitely get far along in life here.
good,"Un espacio muy tranquilo, aunque la gente son muy groseros, estuve de Servicio Técnico, checaba los equipos celulares, y encontrar la solución de la fallas, ya sea problema de carga, touch pantalla negra, etc."
good,"Good compensation, challenging work environment."
good,Decent start rate along With bonus and commissions there are good Incentives but not a lot of traffic at my location so not sure if I will hit all incentives
good,upper management is understanding of life issues and are willing to help accommodate those issues vacation time is abundant and management helps on calls often
good,Management could use some tweaking but the environment was family. I realized after leaving that this was my family. We celebrated together grieved together and supported each other.
good,"The company is in constant flux which does make many concerned about their future.  However, this feeling is cyclical about every 4 years and impacts every division."
good,El ambiente de trabajo es bueno y hay muy buena comunicación.
good,work load could be stressful at times but they provided an environment to allow you to de-stress. The management was open and encouraging always ready to provide support.
good,AT&T was a great learning experience.  It was very corporate meaning there are a lot of politics involved with advancement and success.  Granted I had completed a career in professional basketball over seas when I started with the company so I had a lot of adjustment to make.  Everyone worked hard and was supportive and I learned a great deal about corporate business.  The work environment inspired me to go back to school and earn my MBA.  The corporate politics is some I can do without but its part of the working in corporate America.
good,Overall AT&T was a decent company. AT&T is going through allot of changes right now causing uncertainty with the junior employees.  AT&T is mostly union and those on the lower part of the totem pole have to worry every quarter whether they're going to get bombed out of their position
good,"Granted I worked from a third-party office, the culture was very positive and motivational, and my coworkers genuinely cared for each other. The only big drawback was the fact that the pay was commission only."
good,"AT&T is a fast-paced company that will always change, as it works to be a game-changer in the telecom and entertainment industry.  In the sales role, you need to know what your role is as it helps build successful sales projections for your personal attainment and team goals.  "
good,"This industry is in a huge transitional phase. It is difficult to see where and how this will end. It's been a nice career here but times are a changin' rapidly. If you don't like the heat, get out of the kitchen as they say."
good,"Working for AT&T definitely taught discipline, how to stay focused and on task. There were always opportunity for learning and resources to find whatever needed to be done."
good,"Overall the company is amazing, great benefits, good pay and a secure future in most cases. In some cases the management is lacking in experience and knowledge and only cares about numbers, and not how those numbers are achieved."
good,I worked with a very competent  team and we all have respect for each other.  Another reason is the hours was flexible and advancement within the company  was within  your grasp.
good,Training is thorough and the company has a great many opportunities for all goals.  The people and community is probably the best part of working at AT&T.  You can begin a career here.
good,"It sucked, I spent a month learning nothing to do with the job. Followed by, once I got on the phones, not only did my manager not know the answer to a standard question, but their manager as well as their manager did not know either."
good,There is no set schedule as a technician.  The company is great to work for but lately all they care about are numbers and if you meet them.  It is a union job which is excellent.  The turn over the last few years have been horrible.
good,"Handle all administrative aspects of the sale including: completing customer contracts and warranties, pulling products from inventory, accepting customer payments and filing the completed orders. Maintain strong knowledge of all products, accessories, pricing plans, promotions and service features."
good,"I've done many different jobs throughout my life span and have experience in many fields but most importantly, have a friendly approach towards people and problem solving, solutions finder experience"
good,"AT&T is a good place to start, just like Target or other retailers. If you can get in, take advantage of the experience. I got a lot of good interactions with people/customers which can help you to break the wall if you are shy."
good,AT&T is a great company. But pushing directv was the worst move y’all could have done as a company. Cutting comp literally more than half left some us of in a whole with bills and mortages
good,The company  makes decision on the allocation of paid time off. During peak periods you have to come to work as scheduled or you risk getting a point which an accumulate and lead to termination. sometimes managers can work around such situations especially if it is an emergency.The paid bonus is great.depending on your ability you can make real good money.
good,AT&T is a very good job. I would build relationships with the customers and my coworkers. We had to handle customer situations with much carer to make sure the customer had the best experience while they were there. My only concern with the job is that the higher ups in management did not handle certain situations very well. They would handle it very secretive and didn't communicate with their workers.
good,"AT&T overall is a great company!  Like any large company advancement is dependent on your work efforts, relationship with senior management and willingness to move to other states/locations.  The culture could use some help in terms of allowing work from home but the office settings in Redmond WA is pleasant.  The people that work at AT&T are great as well."
good,"Worked Retail for 5 years. Really enjoyed the customer facing environment, and the teams I managed. My last area manager was the complete opposite from anyone else that I had worked with. For this reason alone, I left the company."
good,I worked in retention saving customers . It was easy to do but if someone who sold products told the truth people would not have been so mad. Benefits and pay were great . Managers were rude and treated badly so that ——— rolled downhill
good,AT&T is a great company to work for. i would recommend for anyone looking for a job not a career. They've a-lot of policies that will hold your possible promotions back.
good,"In general the job is fine. You don't have a lot of things at the same time."
good,"AT&T has been a cornerstone of the telecommunications industry for as long as most can remember, and for good reason. Since the early days of the telegraph, AT&T has been deeply involved in setting the standards for network performance. Even while looking forward to the changes in how people communicate, the company is resolute in its commitment for stability. The procedures and training AT&T has in place ensures that every employee has the opportunity to ensure the best product and service packages are provided to the customer."
good,"its ok pay is good atmosphere is good people you work around is good, management is not so great. has games for break and massage chairs. just the work environment as far as employee to management needs to improve"
good,"this job is all about numbers .. speed , quality , and customer feedback of your performance.. the company pays good with good benefits .If your not performing at 100% or following the rules/safety codes they will find out and get rid of you. they only want ""allstars"" as they say."
good,"Work is done by teams across countries across multiple vendors"
good,positives are the money and the fast pace interactions with customers. If you like to sell and you like your day to go by quickly this is a great job for you. The biggest downside at AT&T is their attendance policy. They don't care if you have to go to the doctor or your kid is sick. So many missed days a year and you are fired. No matter the circumstances.
good,AT&T is a great place to work. If you are gold oriented and looking to challenge yourself I definitely would recommend working for AT&T. The great part about working at AT&T is that if you are looking for a career and not just a job this is the place for you.
good,It was just a temporary job but I injoyed it I learned a lot from one supervisor she was nice and helpful and one female co-worker she showed me how to transfer phone data from a new phone to the old phone
good,"AT&T pushed the boundaries of the industry and wanted every employee to be at their very best, everyday. The hardest part of the job was trying to grasp the vision that AT&T had for itself."
good,AT&T was a good company  to work for. I just needed a change from the sales environment so I went into IT. I would go back to AT&T if I had the chance.
good,"After being at ATT a while, and in a sales position, I can honestly say it’s what you make it. The call center environment is like high school. Mostly young 20s and 30s. However it’s not many places you can go and make $70k for just showing up. In my office, attendance is more important than productivity. If you show up on time, that’s 75% of the battle. Majority of the time people come wanting the services and you don’t even have to work for it. I’ve been in stressful positions and this is NOT one of them. When people say this job is stressful I’m always like Wow you don’t know STRESS. Developing emotional intelligence is more important for your success at work than anything else. Knowing how to interact with people and also how NOT to interact with some people. The same with customers. Know your product knowledge . The more you know about a product the more comfortable customers will be with buying from you. 401k match is 80% up to 6%, good amount of time off, excellent health care ($110 for medical dental vision). People take care of you the more social you are and nice you are. This job is all about relationships. Standard hours are given to you and not flexible though most people trade their shifts. Must ALWAYS be on time. People get fired left and right for attendance versus productivity. Casual culture. Sales environment so you have to be self assured. Don’t get sucked into trying to keep up with the Joneses. Everyone around you has flashy stuff. Don’t have to dress up which is amazing. Pay is great. Work 36.5 hours weekly. Job is repetitive. You have to have purpose"
good,"Enjoyed working there, Gained lots of Telecom work experience in the years I worked there. I would recommend working at At&t to anyone. This job has provided for me and my family very well."
good,"Good place and colleagues to work with, friendly environment. Cab facility is provided and works 24/7. One should be flexible in terms of shifts and week offs"
good,I feel AT&T does a really good job at compensating their employees for their time worked. The role I am in is extremely stressful. It is salaried with long hours
good,"Cambian mucho de personal, incluso el director a cambiado demasiadas veces. Podrían mejorar mucho si tuvieran una mayor permanencia. Deben mejorar su cobertura y calidad de servicio así como atención al cliente."
good,"Great working environment with a lot of flexibility which is good for family, good opportunities but maybe not in my geo-location; job security is questionable."
good,Amazing pay and benefits. Management is a wide variety of things some good some bad. A lot of pressure to make sales. Insane amount of requirements per each call. But money makes everything better. PTO and paid vacation plus health insurance available almost immediately.
good,At&t is a great company with great benefit.. work life balance could be better. Opportunity for growth could be done differently. Overall it’s a great company to work for.
good,"Money was great, management was pretty great. Hours suck, their time-off policy/sick days/vacations SUCK. but you can make so much money... especially in small towns...oddly. there's no cap on commission."
good,Good products. Good benefits. Work life balance is always encouraged. Great place for remote work for certain job roles. Training is available online.
good,Excellent benefits. Not so many opportunities for advancement. Definitely grew my skills working for this company. It was very difficult to overcome office politics.
good,"Fully recommend working at AT&T great environment as long as you’re in the right store with the right staff. Benefits, and work life balance were great"
good,"Collecting money and safe handling of the cashier. As a result, obtaining great benefits with customers. A great Job experience, learn how to obtain great benefits by dealing with customers."
good,Great benefits liked the job hated all the Corp required verbage on every call too focused on average call time versus appropriate length via customer satisfaction
good,"Great company to work for. They offer many benefits. Fast paced fun environment. They offer tuition reimbursement, medical benefits and great discounts on their products."
good,"It was a fun environment with people who enjoy their jobs. The positive attitude was contagious and even competitions seemed friendly and not aggressive. Some sales goals, especially around holidays, were difficult to consistently meet."
good,Good company but every location is different. Just can be a little stressful with the goals you are expected to make daily even with there always being something new weekly
good,I worked for the company for many years. I did enjoy my job my only issue was management consistencies.  Not everyone was held to the same level of knowledge or ownership.   I did enjoy working with customers and account teams across the country.  I enjoyed getting different perspectives.
good,"A good company to work for, salary, benefits are ok, a Unionize workforce made it a more pleasant working experience...................................................................."
good,My time at AT&T was valuable to my development in the workforce and provided a solid foundation for my Marketing career. I would recommend any of my peers to work for this Fortune 50 company as you will learn a lot about your capabilities and how to effectively meet the company goals.
good,Good place to work and develop however your work life balance will be an issue because of the demands of the position.  Great benefits and discounts but management team needs some additional training.
good,It was alright. Good compensation but work life balance was not great. Other perks at the job included discounts and free merchandise from time to time.
good,"Very high stress job but the pay and benefits were worth it. $10 DirecTV bill, 50% off wireless phone bill, plenty of paid vacation and high pay were the pros. "
good,"Great company. Very flexible work schedules. Opportunity for advancement. Many issues with Commission payout, and expectations. Incentives hard to confirm or track."
good,"Fun place to work except during union negotiation time.  Having to backfill someone that installs television service and to be pulled away from other duties, was not ideal"
good,Nice place to work with challenging work and different technologies. Good people and wonderful Manager. Nice work-Family balance.Relaxed work environment
good,"Good place to work unless you mess up once then good luck getting hired again."
good,"I didn't mind working at AT&T, but one thing I will say is that the employees talk a lot of bs. Most are ""gamers"", and people who weren't sure what they wanted to do with their life, but the third party (one of the best throughout the whole company) I worked for was awesome if I were into sales. I learned a lot working at this company but honestly sales isn't my thing. I'm a ""either you're going to buy this or not"" type of person. I think it is so annoying trying to convince someone to buy something, but I actually did well at it because I know how to talk people to people. Anyways, if you're into sales then I think this is a good job for you. Depending on who you work for there's advancement and if you do well then quick advancement."
good,Great work environment nice area helpful coworkers and management always willing to assist good hours rotating weekends  nice incentives monthly bonuses
good,There is extensive training for the call center but the team management tried to encourage fun during work.  You were given a lot of time off and it was easily manageable.
good,Okay place to work..good benefits and discounts on att services... Good pay.. too much focus on sales and not so much on customer service... Sales quotas were hard
good,Reliable tech company. Hardest part of job is the forced reductions (layoffs) and never feeling like you have true job security regardless of your experience or years of service.
good,It was not for me but a good place none the less just a poor work and life balance. You were expected to complete sales if that meant 16 hours a day 7 days a week. The reason I left was I refused to lie to meet my goals as it was against my morals. It was explained to me that I was not lying I was simply being who the potential customer needed me to be so they would feel comfortable enough to buy from me. However I am a person that believes in not compromising ones honor and self respect for any reason by lying or anything else to damage ones integrity.
good,AT&T is a place where you can't become complacent.  You need to keep developing and honing your skills to stay relevant! The most successful people are those that love to collaborate!
good,"Por cualquier detallito te están poniendo cartas administrativas, si vendes, por que los clientes no pagan, y si no vendes eres mal empleado,"
good,I really enjoyed my time there. If many changes didn't happen as they didn't. I really saw myself retiring at BellSouth/AT&T.  I learned a lot while working there and built a lot of long lasting friendships. It was sad I had to leave.
good,"My main accounts were based in the EMEA and APAC regions. The hours were long and challenging. Through these challenges, I was able to improve processes and provide a meaningful impact to AT&T and my clients."
good,"Good work in ATT and learn new tech .Like work culture and had lot opertunity to leran new method and tools to work."
good,"The job itself was great. You got to meet new people in areas you probably haven’t been in & also help personalize things for customers as well as help them. My manager was hardly ever around, so the relationship w/ them was not built strong enough."
good,"I learn about selling products and prove myself i can handle it myself on situations where the costumer was hard to reach"
good,Good pay forced overtime make you work on days off no advancement from tech positions no work life balance can’t plan anything around your days off cause they will take them and make you work union is worthless
good,"I’m proud to say that I was blessed and lucky enough to be employed by one of the top telecommunications companies in the industry."
good,Great fun working with the customers. Hard working in making sure I make the most out of my time. Management was not great. Learned something new every day to better my work ethic.
good,"It’s not a terrible place to work. Directv was better with the culture, but its ok with ATT. On a typical day you come in find a setting mostly hot seating now because of all the new hires. If your on time you have time to prepare for the day of calls to come.  Thanks"
good,During my career at AT&T i had plenty of advancement opportunities. The pay was reasonable however the amount of hours you put in typically doesnt weigh out the amount you make.
good,Company was great i would like to work there again.Learned alot  of skills with the company. Met a lot of great people in the field of being a technician.
good,They pay system is base and commission. The pay is bi-weekly and once you start earning there is no limit to how much money you can earn. The more you sell the faster you can move up in position.
good,"Competitive sales, adequate training provided. Lots of opportunity to troubleshoot with customers devices, be sure you can handle unhappy customer interaction without taking it personally."
good,"I worked for AT&T for five years and enjoyed it very much. I definitely recommend working there, especially if your more technically inclined.  I worked for both Android and iOS support centers."
good,Great money and benefits . The learning experience was also very  good. The training was very productive and the knowledge was long lasting.The ability to advance was another good aspect.
good,"flexible schedule, fun place to work. Good commission plans although you have to be in a good location. Not much room for advancement. Rate plans are constantly changing hard to keep up with"
good,"Be prepared in order to make sufficient income you have to be will to work 12-14 hours any season, the staff all were awesome, from the top to the bottom. It has a family type affectionate."
good,AT&T is a very cultural diverse company. It is a company that strives everyday to have great customer service. I enjoy the interaction and how approachable upper management is. The hardest part of the job is the commute.
good,"Company is great to work for, not much room for advancement. Surplus/Downsizing is pretty often and unexpected. All Employees get along very well, even with management"
good,"After 5 years a lot has changed. In the beginning during honeymoon phase its all exciting and awesome place to be. My yard was very welcoming and helpful. Crews become your second family as hours are long. Some people there work up to 12 hours a day optionally. (can be forced up to 2 hours overtime up to 15 hours extra a week). The pay is pretty good if you put in extra hours, but the scope of work is ever increasing. First we only did copper, years later we added sattelite, then fiber after. All three take their own methods, quality assurance, and time. Sales pushes for the biggest package, so you often get the multi-installs that take more than 6 - 12 hours to complete. The cities I worked in mostly impacted the time it took. The benefits are good, vacation/PDOs are okay. Work is easy to learn. They pay for training. They havent hired in my area for a while though. Overtime is frequent. Only about a month out of the year where there isnt"
good,"Early in my career, SWBT was a GREAT company with good leadership, but after they bought AT&T and we consolidated resources, it became a numbers company and was not loyal to the employees."
good,"a typical day includes incoming calls addressing billing, troubleshooting, new service, adjusting programming and providing information.  I learned a variety of technical troubleshooting skills as well as addressing and resolving billing issues and completing new sales. The management tended to not be proficient in general managerial skills including manager/employee interactions.  The workplace was positive and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers and the most enjoyable was resolving issues making customers happy."
good,I learned great management skills from this company. Training was provided by AT&T and was used every day.  Also made alot of interpersonal relationships.
good,"I have had an opportunity to make money.  Work life balance is tough if you want to be successful. There is a lot of pressure to hit numbers, as is typical in any sales job.  Management changes a lot."
good,"Good working environment. Fast paced environment dealing with internal and external customers."
good,"Great pay, great benefits and huge discounts on their products and services. The longer you are their, the more your seniority pulls for you during times they may restructure or lay off. Great pension in addition to 401K."
good,Was a good job while I was in college. Learned a great deal of things that I apply to my everyday life. The job is challenging and stressful if your're not an aggressive sales consultant.
good,"simply over the bell to bell hours, no work life balance which has started to wear on me the most. In addition the required work ethic in this place is quite obscure."
good,I saw many changes throughout the company in my 40 years.  During the past 4-5 years it has become very difficult due to competition and downsizing.  The workload for those left was extreme.
good,"Hay muy buena calidad empresarial en todo sentido, el trabajador se siente parte de la empresa y el salario es muy competitivo."
good,AT&T is a good company to work for with great benefits. I have been in mainly sales roles and expectations to sell are extremely high. It is apparent that upper management has their own agenda and trickles down the stress to the direct reports. It can also take a very long time to climb the corporate ladder so be prepared to stay within the same role for many years before moving up.
good,"I started with AT&T in 1995 as a part-time operator because I knew that they would offer me the opportunity to grow and advance.  While I'm being forced to take an early retirement, I must admit that the company did right by me."
good,"AT&T is a great place to get your foot in the door. You must be competitive, sports-minded, and fast-paced if you want to succeed. AT&T has plenty of room for advancement if you are looking to move up in an outside sales,  management, higher up role. "
good,"The job itself is a challenge but I enjoy challenges.  Must be good at customer service and trouble shooting, as well as planning.  Pays well and benefits are good, the only real problem is management and company metrics that they beat you down with day in day out. Forced overtime during the summer was not fun, causes burn out and people having accidents. Must work well with others and be a quick thinker."
good,"When Our Dept was indefinitely laid off  there were no offers for opportunities for other departments, we had to reapply and start over as new hires, which I felt was unfair."
good,"While working for AT&T, I was able to greatly improve my skill-set. My communication, sales, customer relations, and leadership abilities improved by more than I ever believed they would."
good,"I have been employed for AT&t mobility through the convergys corporation multiple times, I found my favorite position there to be the nesting mentor position. I was able to train new hire agents in ways to sale, present products to customers, as well as recommend solutions. I was able to monitor their calls & provide them feedback and assist them with improving their sales. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to train others to advance at their job."
good,"Considero es una empresa buena para salir del paso, ya que las exigencias son demasiadas y mal pagadas en ocasiones"
good,Been working at AT&T in various roles for 27 years.  I have Learned tremendous amount about Information Technology and Networking. I am curious what other opportunities may be available.
good,AT&Ts schedule is based on seniority so you could be in the same position for years and never end up with a decent schedule. Other than that the work environment is fun and the pay and benefits are amazing.
good,"Great place to work, Many options to advance in your career. Long Hours. Every month Sles quotas are raised to drive better performance than previous months."
good,"Ever since I started work for AT&T fear was set in us for everything you can imagine to perform our job the way they want. Being  a part of the Union you soon realize that fear is all the company has to keep you in line, but every quarter we are in fear of being laid off. Otherwise I love the job itself."
good,"It was a fine place to work, but rather mundane. My favorite parts about it were the customers that were especially excited when things worked again and the friendly people I worked with. Some customers were quite trying though, so it isn't for everyone. They had something called intervals where if it was slow you could take half an hour off in the middle of the day. It was nice to be able to go to the lunch room and hang out, but if you weren't careful you'd wind up taking a lot more time off than you meant to."
good,"Great place to work in general, management can be dificul to deal with some times, pay is decent, it should be better for the amount of work that we do."
good,At&t has been home for 14 years for me. The business constantly changes and the work environment is stressful. I am thankful for the career and experience I have had at at&t. It has fed my family for many years and I have made many contacts and friends while employed with at&t.
good,Great company to start and continue your career. The staff I worked with cultivated a great work environment that promoted team building. I enjoyed going to work every day. They taught me the essentials I needed to start my career.
good,"Buena empresa muy buenas prestaciones, falta demasiada organizacion en areas de apoyo"
good,"Excelentes compañeros de trabajo, recursos humanos de lo mejor, jefe inmediato no cumple con lo acordado."
good,"Overall, it's a good place to work.   If you want to work remote, there is a lot of opportunity.   The company does seem a little old school.  Many have been there for 20-30 years, waiting to retire.   Although they are a telecom, the aspect I was involved with didn't seem cutting edge or progressive.   The management seemed discontiguous, and as a result you would get old run down offices sometimes, and people not knowing what's coming around the corner in terms of work or opportunity.  If you were on a contract, a little bit more stability.  Also, the contingency training that needed to be done because of the unions going on strike seemed overboard sometimes.  Every 3 years there was a possibility you would be training for weeks on how to climb a phone pole or splice cable."
good,"Adherence"
good,"Great place to advance, very strict on time and attendance.New building with features of Houston throughout the company. Recognizing is big for the company."
good,"AT&T provided me with an opportunity to grow as both an employee as well as a leader of people. I started with AT&T when I was 24 years old as an Electronic Technician in a repair center. I was able to excel at my role and was fortunate enough to earn a promotion to Network Manager. I was provided multiple opportunities to learn new aspects of the business as well as move up the management ladder throughout my 15 years. I truly enjoyed my time with AT&T, the people I worked with and the customers I was able to help. My only negative feedback would be after 15 years of growth and hard work I was placed in a surplus status. I understand the need to downsize and become a more nimble organization but the process was cold and very little assistance was provided to transition in to available openings."
good,"A typical day at work is being knowledgeable of AT&T services, provide excellent customer service, pitch/sell/close sales. I learned a lot about working for this company on how to be patient and provide solutions for customers. Hardest part of the job is reaching sales when working in a slow traffic store. The most enjoyable part of this job is working with awesome coworkers and being able to help customers who know so little about the products of phones."
good,"Great job overall "
good,"Good money and benefits. "
good,"My experience working at this company was exciting.  I was a greeter and I also helped customers troubleshoot different things with their cellphones.  I really improved my customer service skills,  being that I love working with customers & customer satisfaction."
good,"I don't care to write anything here. I enjoyed my job with them for the most part. The management could have been better, but hey that comes with most places. But for the most part I came to work and made a good wage and went home. and my schedule was pretty steady."
good,"This company has been know for hiring, developing, and mentoring young talent. It is a great company to work for and has given me many opportunities to grow and learn."
good,"As a Premises Technician I spent 9 years learning the art and science in-person and over the phone customer service. I learned how to examine a problem logically in order to troubleshoot efficiently  to provide lasting solutions to customers when they need it most. All services down, all eyes are on me to get it back up and running. That pressure is an adjustment for many people and I feel I am ready to take the next step thanExks to my experience at AT&T."
good,"A solid, dependable company, extensive benefits and compensation opportunities. However, there was some lack of harmony between different branches that would cause unnecessary frustration."
good,"I appreciated the majority of people I worked with, and the benefits were generous. The management could use more training and organization. Advancement was attainable. The regularity of lay offs hurt morale."
good,Good place to work. I was able to perform my job duties on a daily basis with the tools and resource that was given to me. The team was great at communication.
good,I was their health and wellness supervisor.  I designed exercise regimes and healthier lifestyles for their employees. My contribution was to promote a healthier way of life and in return reduce health costs for the employees. Most enjoyable was I could exercise all day and persuade people to exercise with me.
good,"Once I was hired I was being trained out of town for 3 months, with on going training every month for new products and tech advancements. Working for AT&T prepared me for the world in every aspect, sales, customer service, safety, IT Networking, OSP maintenance and installation, technical wiring and analytical troubleshooting. Facing new situations everyday and working through them to give the best customer service possible."
good,"Really enjoyed the team I worked with, the training provided was really good and the ability to learn was really good.  The company has done a very poor job of managing debt, thus a lot of layoffs have occurred."
good,"AT&T are a very large organisation with very smart technology innovators, whom i enjoyed working with. The network operations area is a very competitive space which poses challenges to all service delivery teams."
good,I have nothing good to say about this company cause they put a bad taste in my mouth when i left. Then when i died to come back they denied me and said i don't deserve to come back
good,"As a software engineer, I had the opportunity to work on various projects. However, in the teams I worked on there was a high amount of technical debt with no foreseeable future to truly address it."
good,"I truly loved the people I worked with, managers were awesome as were my fellow RSC’s. Job that pays you to be on a phone. Though I was unhappy with how the company kept making purchases to get the company bigger and paying the workers less or cutting jobs completely. 3-4 years ago with commission you could easily make 80K+ but now its a struggle. Great benefits though but hard on employees that have been there a long time."
good,"Great place to work. "
good,The comfort with the company depended on the group that you were within and the management style.  The lead management for your silo determines the culture of the entire group.  It is not a an overall company culture as each AVP has different management and personality styles.  Some are supporting and others empower lower level management that might allow dog-eat-dog practices where the strongest survive.
good,"The pay is good, you get 25 days vacation your first year. But overtime is mandatory when new phones are released. Hours are good. Perks are fantastic"
good,AT&T is a fine company to work for. AT&T is a company that provides good benefits and has a lot of opportunities for growth in many various fields.  AT&T is a fine company.
good,"Very competitive environment."
good,"It is a good company overall.  I believe pay and benefits are typical for this type of organization.  Medical benefits are high deductibles. "
good,it was good experience.A friendly environment to work with the fellow colleagues.Product manager was Very encouraging gives opportunity to enhance our skills.
good,My 27 years at AT&T were productive and enjoyable.  The work area was sanitary.  The lab environments had enough space and power and AC.  The office space was clean and quiet.
good,"As a manager at AT&T I was always busy.  The real reward and job satisfaction came in from watching employee develop and grow.  The people I worked with at AT&T wanted to do a great job for the customer, and usually responded positively to to my coaching.   Yes, occasionally you would have the difficult employee that wanted to do things their way, and eventually it could get to the point where you have to put them on discipline to get them to change their behaviors.  The biggest thing I learn while at AT&T is that you have to change behaviors in order to change metrics.  You can coach to a number but it will not be as effective and changing the behavior."
good,I've held various positions at ATT over my lifetime and feel that it has always been a solid place to work with good benefits and pay.  I feel that any job within communications is what you make of it and ATT still offers many ways to climb the ladder and make a good living.
good,AT& T provided advanced training that will help me further my career in business 2 business sales consultant. prepared me for careers in communication and account management.
good,"Assist customers manage their telecommunication accounts.  By answering their questions, offering suggestions and making any changes requested. Choice of lunch amount. Good FMLA program."
good,"I worked at AT&T for 16 years. It was a fun place to work and I met a lot of close friends there. They cared about you enough to help develop you and provide you with training that you needed to better yourself so you could do you job more efficiently and effectively. "
good,Sales and a lot of tech knowledge. Good pay and benefits. Customer service experience in a retail environment. High demand in sales to be reached. Hours are retail hours.
good,AT&T is a productive and goal oriented globally distributed workplace. Communication with management is easy and highly encouraged. New ideas and contributions are valued.
good,Working for ATT you must be willing to be flexible.  Understand change is always a constant.  I work with good people and upper management are interested in seeing you further your carrer
good,"Working from both a service and sales perspective, the days were always different. From fixing customer's equipment, to making the sales needed or maintaining the numerous sales locations.With technology moving so fast, we had to keep up with all of the new features out there for customers. the hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable part, the customers. It was always challenging meeting the customer demands but always found it satisfying when able to do so."
good,AT&T has been a place for anyone to groom their management skills as you work with highly educated and highly skills employees. Since you are able to interact with a highly knowledgeable staff you are always pushed to be the best at everything.  You are also a part of learning new technologies and products.
good,"AT&T is a enormously large company with over 150,000 employees.  In such a large company you may have to search out opportunity but it is offered through continuous training events, leadership, and technology updates.  The hardest part of the job is making yourself standout in a company so large."
good,Overall it is an amazing company to work for if you do not have a family.  The hours can be long and the work for outside techs is physically demanding. I would recommend anyone starting out to give this job a chance!
good,"I loved seeing the, walk out of the stored satisfied with their new phones and accessories. I would say the hardest part of the job would be when a customer came in upset or annoyed due to there mobile device not working or their bill being to high."
good,At the time this was a great position.  Easy job to learn.  Answered calls from the prison collect customers in regards to their bill.  Able to resolve all issues.
good,"good pay but often stressful and physically exhausting. Even though the pay was good, the company would often add more job responsibilities to your position without adding a pay bump. Has its good days and rough days. good benefits offered."
good,Exceptional company in many ways though little consideration for security. Much emphasis was placed on your ability to facilitate company growth and many resources were provided however it was clear that your use of them was to be on your own time.
good,"busy day at work with fiber install and repairs "
good,Worked with AT&T over 15 years through different companies that eventually were part of AT&T. I enjoyed the autonomies provided in sales and was pleased over all. Was an outside sales executive for the majority of my career there.
good,I worked for AT&T for 16 years in Information Technology. My supervisor and coworkers always treated me well. I was happy with the company culture. It is a very large company and I was located far from main headquarters and my supervisor but communicated with team members frequently.
good,"Pay was ok, for this job however long hours and pay was not standardize, where another's install for you a repair paid not the same as a new installed"
good,"Enjoy the outdoors, hot or cold. Enjoy the job, bad or good. You have to work it anyway, if you're 20 ft in the air or 5 ft less than ground along a drainage canal."
good,Company is in transition to restore its reputation to stockholders as result the company has had to cut cost which essentially means more layoffs in the future.
good,The new technology communications work was both challenging and rewarding. I was well compensated for the the work performed. Hourly pay and benefits are above average.
good,"Good union job. The company tries to scare employees with metrics that must be met monthly. Corporate officers have no regard for the livelihood of the employees, company is 100% numbers driven."
good,"You only get  so many days you can miss work so don’t miss a single day because when you have that family emergency and you go over the days that you’re allowed to miss they don’t care they will fire you.  I missed 2 1/2 days of work, called in every day, had a family emergency and they didn’t even care. "
good,"En general es una empresa muy accesible con los horarios nos facilitan mucho los permisos escolares, también realizan diferentes dinámicas para motivarnos."
good,"If you love phones and tech, AT&T is a good place to work. You will spend most of your day playing on phones, lap tops and Direct TV watching. Only down side is the customers that cant afford the product and complain about it."
good,Att is a good place to work. If you have a family or want decent  hours it is not flexible  at all. I use to enjoy working here but the environment  is no longer enjoyable. There is allot of stress created by micromanaging and unfair changes to rules. But it has taught me to work understress and to stress the quality of my work.
good,"This was a temporary to permanent position through Rightech, Inc. of Staten Island, New York for their client, AT&T, as a Data Verification Specialist for the clients DDR-CLLI (data defect reconciliation common language location identifier) code project."
good,Overall I enjoyed my time at AT&T. I was going to school during my employment at AT&T and they were always very helpful about scheduling me around my class times.
good,I worked for AT&T for 36 years.  A good place to work for individuals with a strong work ethic.  Self starters and being highly adaptable  is mandatory.
good,"Productive and fun work place. I have Benn learning a lot when it comes to tech. I have met a lot of nice , fun worker. I can say that I learned a lot from the company. '' fiber, trouble shouting,''"
good,I loved at&t as a job. Was physically demanding which I am a veteran and it was hard at times. But had to come home asap because mother could have passed at any moment.
good,AT&T is a nice place to work. Advancement however is slow; and lateral moves have become harder recently. The workplace culture is formal especially on engineering teams; morale overall has been low in recent times.
good,"Typical day was good, had the opportunity to meet a lot of interesting customer. The managers were great to work with and the staff. The only thing I wasn't happy with was my schedule"
good,AT&T departments will close and move locally and out of state without a lot of advance notice. The employees have to move or scramble to find another job within the company.
good,Great place but has its flaws especially if you have younger children like infant and toddlers. It’s hard to get good off days for your younger babies
good,"Had its game room (ie pool, ping-pong) just to relax and take the stress of calls. "
good,"I enjoyed my time as a call center employee at AT&T. The pace is fast and most times the calls are stressful. However, I found talking to the customers and understanding and resolving their issues to be gratifying."
good,"Overall a wonderful company to work. Competitive atmosphere with energetic staff. Room for growth amongst the company. However, my local center is closing."
good,"Great company to work for and learn the technology. However, company is large and no way you can actually have an direct input to implement changes. The technical portion of the customer service was moved to a company overseas."
good,"AT&T is a fine company to work at if all you want is to bring home a paycheck every two weeks."
good,"AT&T can be an awesome place to work, it really depends on who you work with. Often, objectives are placed high enough for you to not to meet them, but there are a few people, like myself, that meets the objectives and take care of my customers."
good,Working for ATT was a great experience. The training was 5 Star. The work environment was competitive but fun. The products are easy to sell because the quality speaks for itself.
good,"Job was pretty laid back, worked at my own pace.  Received bonus based on Sales quota.  Worked 8 hours a day per week, no weekends.  Hardest part was wondering if you would be able to keep your job which was very stressful."
good,"Learnt new technologies, worked with an experienced team,"
good,Sales are a fast paced rush. they throw a lot of lunches and make a lot of noise. Sales are rewarded with balloons and clappers. we have contests between teams and winners get free lunches.
good,"A typical day consists of interacting with staff and management followed by reviewing recent customer interactions to ensure that AT&T's quality standards are being met. "
good,I really enjoyed my time working at AT&T. They provided adequate on the job training. Management was always fair and communicated well with employees.
good,Worked as consultant so can't comment much. It was good place to work. Remote option was available. Team was good. Workplace culture was okay. Management was okay
good,"ATT was a stable and excellent place to work until the extensive mergers and acquisitions begn, then massive layoffs year after year . Benefits are excellent. Forward thinking company always trying to be on the cutting edge. Lots of meetings to keep you involved yet plenty of time to get your work completed."
good,I am a field manager. The work environment is mostly good depending on your work location. Processes are constantly changing and networking with  other departments is a must if you want to be successful.
good,i worked for ATT under Directv which from my understanding can be a different experience. However I enjoyed working for Directv and the compensation and advancement opportunities were great.
good,"The work was decent. You get increases each year for inflation based on their contract with the worker's union, so that is nice. Some of management was fantastic, and some was mediocre."
good,Great overall place for work. People that I have come across with work have been amazing. The work life balance is a bit of a hassle at times. Can have a great career if you put mind to it.
good,Quick pace environment.  Always striving to be the leader in customer service and improving the work environment for all employees.  Committed to training for all levels of employment.
good,Great place to work! People are interesting . From all walks of life and very diversified. A lot has changed in 40 years at this company. Technology  growth has soared and AT&T is ready for tomorrow - always working on new demands for making it easier for the public to view TV and high speed internet access that works.
good,"AT&T was a career type culture for most of my career, although it felt more like a financial decision when I made to retire. Corporate downsizing has become a priority."
good,"Great place to work and learn as long as you work the system. Some managers tend to pigeonhole employees but that is understandable given the specific skillset required for certain jobs. It was a great place to learn and expand my skillset considerably. Opportunities exist for advancement as long as you put in the effort, show interest and communicate to your manager. Networking among staff is highly recommended in order to learn of opportunities both lateral and promotional. Great fun environment physically, with awesome culture (DirecTV) that was under scrutiny by ATT. Did not stay with ATT as my contract was coming to an end."
good,La atención es lo mas importante y no contábamos con un sistema capaz de atender las necesidades reales de nuestros clientes y darle solución al momento.
good,"Overall ATT was a good place to work.  There were some minor issues, like any company. If an opportunity became available I would pursue.  I had no real issue working with ATT other than management confusion."
good,at&t has many different jobs to choose from and has a professional work environment.  Work is constantly changing to upgrade network to latest technology.
good,"It was a fun place to work, but the job became redundant. They were more focused on sales than employees. There were many clicks amongst the management."
good,It was online customer service work so it was good. It was a work from home job. You just could not advance enough. My sup. was wonderful and very professional.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job you get to meet a lot of new people and interact. Many opportunities for advancement with the company. Ongoing training is very good and helpful to help you be the best at your job. Managers are put in impossible positions but they also do a poor job in who they decided to manage. Sometimes too much emphasis is placed on stats and not customer service.
good,My experience at AT&T was many years ago. It was my first full time job in a big company. I have leant a lot in that job and it benefited me greatly in my skills development.
good,"Work for a contracted company thru at&t we are outsorced to handle billing needs, concerns, upgrade lines, add lines, and sale DTV and internet services. Overall it is an ok job but you can quickly get burnt out here. Becomes very old fast"
good,"Working at AT&T I learned how to handle people and technology in a different way. With that, it gave me a way to see different new friends in high places."
good,The company offers many opportunities for personal and professional growth through online courses and tuition reimbursement. Also there are many employee resource groups and mentor opportunities.
good,At AT&T I pre tripped and post tripped my van each day.  I delivered materials to about 17 or more central offices in the surrounding suburbs in Michigan.  I ran the mail room at the Detroit headquarters and delivered mail and packages.  I also unloaded semi trucks and drove hi-lo.
good,"Worked there for a few months and overall it was a good job. There was a base pay including the commissions, which made they pay even better. I would recommend it to anyone else."
good,At times we felt like the trainer was learning with us and they pushed us out on the floor because more employees were needed. I think they need to improve with that section since it's the beginning of your career .
good,Very flexible in regards of transferring employees from one store to another but lack of incentives and compensation.  Hard to get promoted most employers decide to stay at cells because there are protected by union.
good,"After acquiring DIRECTV, AT&T is going through culture changes in how depts are organized, projects are defined and executed, as they re-invent themselves in the video distribution and content management industries."
good,Great work place enjoyed my time there would go back if opportunity presented itself enjoyed the guys I had a chance to work with and workin independently
good,"It provided a suitable environment to contribute to society and growth of personal abilities. Easily, a good place to earn and maintain a safe living."
good,Day start early with a strong smell of diesel gas from the trucks. Then very noisy from the techs and manager getting the work together. Then from 8am to about 2pm its very quite.
good,My time at AT&T was a great learning experience.I met and worked with a lot of great people.I learned a lot of skills I can now put to use on other careers
good,I worked an 8 hour work day which provide seating phones calls of incoming call collections. I learned how to perform human connecting and how to collect debts. Hardest part of the job is stress from angry vulgar customers daily. Management is poor with coaching and meetings and helping majority of times throughout the day. I enjoyed the incentives ATT provided but that went downhill.
good,I started working for AT&T corporate when I was 21 and I was able to purchase my own vehicle and rent my first apartmet while attending college and working full time. if you work hard it really pays off with AT&T.
good,"	Analyzed Market data to identify areas of opportunity and trends, increasing sales efficiency"
good,AT&T is a great company and I learned a great deal from my managers and co-workers during my time there. I enjoyed a structured environment that allowed it's employees to make important decisions!
good,Mostly enjoyed my job . Very stressful with work load . Management mostly was clueless of process and technical details . co-workers are the best a real family environment .
good,good place to work but was recruited away to another company. Lots of management so you can get mixed messages and sometimes feel micromanaged.  Good people to work with.
good,Going more into fiber is the right direction for AT&T to be heading into   Yet because they are one of the largest phone companies they should not forget about the older people and should always secure them with working dialtone. It isn’t always about the dollar it’s about reputation
good,"Overall, AT&T is a good place to work.  It is not perfect, but what job is.  I have work there for 20 years and I have noticed that the benefits are getting worse, but I think that is standard these days.  There is a more of a formal workplace culture in the departments that have been around for many years, but the newer departments have a more casual environment."
good,While at AT&T I grew and really excelled as a sales professional.  I did my best to schedule out my day and stick to a calendar.  If you schedule it you can get it done.  Feel as though I was effective at scheduling time to keep in touch with existing clients and maintain and develop new business within my client base.  Hardest part of the job was being competitive with the competitors price point that traditionally was always lower.  Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting with the owners and really trying to understand their business and providing real solutions to some of their pain points.  Ultimately I went thru a divorce and couldn't maintain the drive to continue to produce so I resigned with the business plan to start Total Telecom Solutions of Louisiana.
good,"Great place to work at and even better people to work with. "
good,"This place was extension of college, fun place to work"
good,great company however after 18 years i was only a number.  co workers were great. good pay. good overall package company match still possible.  overall good place to work
good,"A typical day starts with meetings with clients/operations team. I learned a lot about software and networking technologies. In general, there is a good work/life balance at AT&T."
good,Good pay and benefits if you have a good management team you’ll receive mentorship and promotion assistance. Work life balance isn’t great don’t always feel like a priority
good,"I enjoyed working for AT&T. The work life balance is decent. Management has a tendency to hover and smother. Compensation plan is always changing. Flexibility in schedule is nice, real priority in seniority when choosing days."
good,Every day at AT&T will be fast paced and it is always a joy to work for AT&T as team and people are all across US and different geographies.  AT&T migrated itself from regular SDLC process of project intake (Waterfall) to Agile 4 years back and they matured into a great organization by reaping business and financial benefits of executing projects over Agile methodology and now they are transforming themselves into Scaled Agile way of working with monolithic applications being migrated into microServices right from presentation later to SOR (System of Records) . So working in Devops with CI/CD and Scaled Agile with microServices is always a fast paced learning and fun.
good,Challenging work environment. Dealing with multiple customers and issues daily. Often high call volumes with back-to-back calls. Strong training program to assist with abilities needed to service customers' needs.
good,Work is fast paced with little supervision from the field manager after your mandatory training periods. I would recommend this company for any person that likes fast paced work life and constantly changing environment. The only bad I can come up with is the lack of compensation for added responsibilities. Example is when the company added fiber optic cable installations without increasing pay and mandatory overtime.
good,The pay and benefits are very competitive. The stress levels are high due the challenge of balancing collecting money and keeping customer satisfied. Management was consistent with all expectations
good,"AT&T is a fast paced, ever changing work environment. The benefits are great. New products and service were frequently offered, however training and support could sometimes be inadequate at first."
good,"Work was always stable. We did have a few changes in our jobs, but it was all support related. Time off is nice and many employees used exchange time to balance work and life."
good,at&t  was a great company to work for. I had a great manager. some areas were not as lucky. sometimes work could be stressful but that is any job. we were paid well for the job that we did and the benefits and discounts were good also. I don't really have anything bad to say about it.
good,Fast pace sales environment where through hard work and dedication career advancement opportunities are abundant. jejkqewrjewkfbwejkrbfwqbfwebfjwefjed
good,"Half off AT&T services and decent pay.  Long and varying hours per shift, you work until all jobs are completed.  Inconsistent management direction and lack of empowerment for front line employees."
good,The company put into place a training and education requirements.  This requirement greatly helped in the execution of your current position and prepared you for future higher levels of responsibilities.
good,"A typical workday at AT&T was a good day. Working in the advertisement department as an account representative to the sales representatives was a great thing. Management knew there jobs and were knowledgeable in there everyday job duties. The hardest part of the  job was when the company made the decision to outsource the department overseas. The enjoyable part of the job was customer service week, department meetings and the holidays."
good,"I loved working for my bosses while I was their for my 3 years. However, Assistant Managers always change stores within a year and you will like or hate them."
good,"Great team and positive people to work with"
good,"Overall a good company to work for: fair pay, great benefits, employee perks, stability. With some of the new purchases needing to be paid for there has been a decline in some services roles (many of them outsourced) that puts additional pressure on other job titles to pick up the slack, but still a very good employer."
good,"5 surpluses in 3 years tells you that things are changing dramatically at AT&T.  Moving towards a software-centric, content-driven company with recent acquisitions leaves anyone working in network vulnerable to cost cutting."
good,Hard to make a life plan if you don't know if your job will be there tomorrow. Otherwise I would retire from this company. Coworkers work together to get the job done.
good,"Es una empresa muy bien, planeada ya que viene con ideas estadounidenses donde ponen al empleado primero, sin embargo en la practica aun le falta mucho por emplear."
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at AT&T!  There was always a sense of support by my management team and the coaching and development provided to me throughout the years was amazing!  I worked with some great folks!   Unfortunately, times are changing and so has AT&T.  As the company repositions itself for the future, not all existing groups/depts.will be needed and there will be more folks surplused and retired..."
good,"Company is changing at a very fast pace.  While I enjoyed my career there, I feel that they are moving away from the core business too rapidly and am not sure I agree with that strategy."
good,"It's a good company if your manager likes you, otherwise, you need to absolutely dot your (i's) and cross your (t's). It becomes stressful working for someone who discriminates and when that manager knows how to work the system, it's difficult to pin them to that act."
good,AT&T worked hard to train us well in terms of technology products and teaching us how to give the best customer experience. The most enjoyable part of the work is hatting with all sorts of customers and getting to know them while building connections.
good,The company eliminated all decision makers in Connecticut. Most were laid off or were asked to work excessive hours with no increases in pay. Ma Bell is not the company it once was.
good,"I worked for AT&T Portables, And my manager was honestly the BEST. He made work extremely fun and relaxed but always pushed positively towards reaching our personal goals and our goals for the kiosk. I enjoyed working there so much and wish that when i moved I had the opportunity to work with them in Florida. That was not an option at my location at the time."
good,"Culture changes frequently, hard to advance depending on the department you're in. Frequent layoffs, but the benefits are great and there's a good work/life balance too."
good,A typical day starts with the manager going over a tech's assignment as well as discussing any workplace accidents that happened throughout the company on the previous day.
good,I liked to work in AT & T. But I am working in same tool thats why i am seeking another for upgradation to my future. I learnt to manage work life balance and how to coordinate with team. Workplace culture is very good in nature. I didnot feel any hardest part in my job. The most enjoyable part in my job is weekly release project so systematic work is there and there is no need to rush up at the end time.
good,Started as Directv. Taking calls as a technical support agent then up to retention agent. Was generally a good place to wor until AT&T took over. Learned skills of handling customers first of all with empathy. How to position certain up sales and ways to retain customers.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, puntualidad en pagos."
good,"The job was great as an intern. But wasn't something I looked forward to as a career. Could not see myself with that job for more than a year."
good,"They put a few in positions who doesn't work for it. If you're interested in making quick money,  I recommend this. If you want to advance, I suggest you go to another place that really cares about the credentials"
good,"Overall the company is fine, but very much a corporate world, its a very structured enviornment with tons of videos and seminars you must follow.  There is no flexability"
good,Att is definitely a place where if you meet all of your goals you will make great money. Advancement is key. The more effort you put in the more yo will succeed.
good,"The Vice President of Employee Benefits hired me three months after finishing law school.  Although I began my ""second"" career in a very entry level role, AT&T gave me several opportunities to hone existing skills and increase benefits/legal knowledge.  I was fortunate enough to assist AT&T's benefits-eligible population roll out to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Exchange, a landmark project.  Though my job quickly evolved from a traditional employee benefits administration position into a very technical legal compliance roll, it transcended my career."
good,"AT&T is a wonderful employer with diversity a fun work culture. Because this company is a technology leader, lay-offs and re-orgs are a way too common occurrence there.  You may start off in the perfect job, but they will inevitibly shift you around to another role and another team. Very quickly, you will find yourself in a totally different job you never wanted. While this may be the case at any technology company, it happens very often at this company."
good,AT&T is a great place to work and advance in any field that you chose. They provide amazing benefits and I felt like I was a part of a team even though sales is very competitive.
good,Overall the company itself strives to help employees to feel confident in their performances by educating them about the job culture and providing them with tools to perform better. Some of the managers however seem to have missed the goals of AT&T and have taken too much of a personal approach as opposed to serving the company objectives.
good,Learned a lot about customer psychology and how to please and retain customers.  I enjoyed my managers and the ways they tried to influence us to perform better.
good,"Setting up the store and attend customer, to listen to customers needs, keeping sufficient employees on floor, meeting are goals. Making sure partner are happy"
good,Involvement with new technology. Opportunities to work in different departments and organizations. Work environment was stable but expected to change.
good,There is opportunity in several different segments of the company. They also offer many employee discounts to take advantage of. Online training is always available for career advancement.
good,AT&T is always pushing its employees to grow with the evolving technology that is developed.  Endless opportunities for the employee that has the go-getter attitude and is constantly looking to learn.
good,"Friendly environment, while challenging and fast-paced.  Outdated call center for a company on the forefront of technologies.  Potential for advancement only available for certain non-management job titles."
good,Get sales experience . I learned a lot within my time there. The customers were extremely nice. You got to build your cliental. My co workers were pretty awesome. The pay was also a bonus.
good,This company really does empower its employees and telework options are awesome (barring all the layoffs). Bad decisions led to several layoffs. It gets hard to focus on work when there are so many layoffs.
good,"Straight to the point..."
good,"It was a great place to work at if you don't mind retail hours You have to be technology smart, It had great beneits. You have to join the union with union dues.  Not much to say about the union since we rarely saw them."
good,"I enjoyed the job, it was fast paced and every generally worked as a team even though the employees work for commission (along with an excellent hourly rate). Upper management outside of the store wasn't always the best but in store management was generally excellent to work with and helped out in any way they could, whether it be work or personal related."
good,I started as clerical and within 2 years I was transferred to a technical position. Training was on the job and I worked with some of the best most knowledgeable people ever. I loved the challenges and the satisfaction of seeing a job well done.
good,we treat each other fairly. we made sure our department will succeed on expectations. we follow what we were told and we made sure we don't get in the wrong side out the managements.
good,"Busy busy busy, "
good,"This is a great job for young people looking to get good sales experience at the entry level. Plenty of perks. Not really a good job for someone who is more seasoned (Professional for more than 10yrs, etc). And its worse for a part timer."
good,If your not interest in relocating to somewhere outside San Antonio do not apply. Very limited career choices and advancement opportunities available to San Antonio market.
good,"Participate on branding campaigns."
good,The benefits were fantastic but difficult at time to keep up with the every changing expectations from management. Hard to meet the goals for a month when things never changed to the traffic coming into the stores.
good,AT&T is a good organization that pays well but demands a lot in return.  It offers many options to grow your skills and move within the company.  Like all sales organizations expectations can be unreasonable and thus effect morale.
good,"You will be fine at this job if you enjoy working long days and having to meet metrics that constantly change. "
good,AT&T is a company you can work at forever. Sky's the limit because in most roles you will make salary plus commission and you're given all the tools to succeed.
good,Although they have been doing a lot of layoffs and I was one of them they are basically a great company to work for. They have a lot of classes you can take to to advance your career and knowledge. Most of the supervisors are pretty good.
good,"Worked at Sutherland Global as a chat representative, chatting with 3 people at once, working with the multiple programs. Friendly environment. Commission opportunities if you reached the weekly and monthly quotas."
good,"I was a sales rep for 2 years and honestly the pay and benefits are great for what you do. But there is a lot of micromanaging and pressure to sell EVERY SINGLE PRODUCT WE OFFER to every single customer. I worked in 3 different retail locations and the stress level is based off the management for that location. Most customer are coming in for a broken phone or because they have bill complaints. So after overcoming those things, you then have to sell them a combination of TV, internet, insurance, accessories, etc. Even if they arent interested in anything at all. Management would rather the customer yell at for pushing every product than the customer actually being truely happy with you and their experience. So after 2 years of sales i transferred to handle the inventory and merchandising for a location. And i would prolly be doing this til i died if AT&T wasn’t eliminating the position."
good,"I had an enjoyable experience working with Direct TV before they where with AT and T. The training was fantastic and felt very prepared before entering the field. Management was adequate, but like most situations, some mismatched supervisors where in place."
good,If you are good at customer service you will excel in almost any position.  Company values connection with people and has proper guidance.  Compensation for efforts matches.
good,"This company has many great opportunities for employment, but can be a drain if you're not in a great organization. Those that are the most vocal about enjoying their jobs are absolutely correct. Those that express their dissatisfaction are also equally correct. It can be very difficult to move from one organization to another. The current internal process is more geared toward the hiring manager not having to interview too many people. It is not designed for potential candidates to apply for many different roles."
good,"AT&T Can be a wonderful place to work with great pay and benefits. The sales life can be and is very stressful, but the pay can really help offset the stress. The work/life balance is also not very good, but there is a lot of PTO available."
good,"Management is typical management. Job security is suspect depending on what market you live in. Compensation and benefits are really hard to beat. Moving up is simple in the company. However, you have to put 3 years in before any moves laterally or up can be made."
good,"Best part of this job is that the time goes by very fast since you're constantly moving. As long as you do your job by offering products and services that the company has to offer, you wont have a difficult time achieving your monthly sale quota."
good,Overall a great place to work. Unfortunately I was laid off with several others. I wish there had been a better chance and opportunity to find employment within the company.
good,Work for 10 years every year it got worse. Starting off for the younger gen it’s great. It wears you out overtime and wasn’t worth it in the end. Learned a lot and got paid well but you definitely get paid what you put in.
good,"AT&T is a wonderful company from my experience, and that does not include the fact of a surplus occurred every 3 years. If not for massive layoffs at times this is a great company to work for with awesome benefits. I would suggest getting rid of micromanagement as most take advantage of position to enforce rules."
good,"Great company, work hard and try to mind your business . AT&T will back you when you are right. They will invest in you as long as you are willing to do the work. A Great Company!"
good,"This job had me relating to customers on a daily basis. I enjoy working with the public and finding solutions for their wants and needs. The workplace culture was amazing. I worked with people of all races, ages, and personalities.  The hardest part of the job was when we were not busy.  The best part of the job was interacting with the public and coworkers."
good,"Typically slow days with a couple busy hours of constant customer traffic. "
good,"Showing up at 8 am sharp is a must or earlier if cleared in pre-call. Working at a fast pace and keeping organized.Culture was OK. Hardest part is deep attic work, in the summer. I really like Educating the customer and making the product seem worthwhile."
good,"Good place to work, lots of benefits, long work hours, work out of a vehicle, working alone but can communicate to peers for help and advice through a group chat"
good,The hours can be long and the days are pretty unpredictable. You start your days at the same time every day but the times you get off vary from day to day. A lot of your time is spent driving. You will be in customer's homes and when dealing with people you never really know what you're getting yourself into until you reach the house. Customer education is very important.
good,I would recommend working at AT&T for anyone trying to make more money and advance in a company. But their training is very confusing and chaotic and the management overall have not been the best.
good,"At AT&T, I had the pleasure of experiencing a company that has a great Culture, people, training, and compensation plan. I would definately reccomend AT&T and a place to grow!"
good,I working remotely doing Inter MSN Re balance and CCR and working on UMTS and LTE sites .most our work was in Cisco routers and switching and the UMTS was working on Ericsson sysytem
good,"Starting here, I enjoyed what I did. i knew that i would be able to advance in this company and it would never get boring. Fast forward 6 years and that is no longer true, there's no room for professional growth."
good,It was an amazing place to work coming right out of high school. Some calls we received were not the best but in the end I do miss the job. My managers were amazing but the call center I was at closed down.
good,I guess it would depend on your location. It’s a decent job especially if you’re transitioning from part time to full time. Store rules for employees are pretty laid back and there’s no strict dress code.
good,"Ambiente un poco toxico, todos se peleaban por los clientes cuando entraban al cap"
good,average work live balance. You work harder you will get paid more money. They set in place the tools for you to make as much money as you can. similar to several other corporate jobs.
good,Enjoyable job for people that are mechanically inclined and enjoy working outside. Must be physically fit and able to pass basic electricity test and drug test. Also need a good driving record.
good,"Typically working for Fye, we would show up have multiple conversations before our meeting, after the meeting was done we would g out to lunch as a group. On Friday (payday) we would have a long meeting talking about how the week was as a group and having some fun before we leave to work."
good,"Excellent work culture at company Hubs. Hub locations, Dallas TX, Chicago IL, Atlanta GA,  LA, CA. Outside of Hubs, most employees work from home or are in sales positions away from the office. Great ERGs."
good,"When AT&T took over DTV they eliminated most of the job functions so they could cut pay. Management prior to DTV was honestly a joke-maybe 2 were professional. Changes made to work was constantly changing and no one was ever on the same page, doing the same thing."
good,maintain positive customer relations and serve their cell phone needs as well as advertise products and services that could benefit the customer and create positive customer relations.
good,"The pay was great.  Office environment seemed political, depends on who you know if you are looking for advancement.  I gained a lot of experience because of my moving around in the company but never to management.  I went to school at night to earn degree hoping it would help in getting a promotion but no luck.  I ending up having to leave the company for other opportunities."
good,"Great pay & benefits, even without a degree. You can easily make over 100K/year. You also get plenty of paid vacation & personal days. The problem is the industry is changing & jobs are being eliminated as a result."
good,"Being part of several different departments, I can honestly say the leadership and culture within AT&T is among the best I've seen. The people there are great! Its difficult to rate Work/Life balance, compensation, job security, and others as each category varies depending on the department of the company. Overall, I enjoyed working for the company and would recommend them to others."
good,typical day at work: log in to take calls and talk to customer  most days are awesome. i have learned to have more patience. ethics and etiquette with customers.
good,"The job, pay and benefits are great. However, there can be a emphasis on metrics that can impede on work habits and providing quality work. The hours were long at the time."
good,Ran reports on employees.Worked with mail and used Copiers and Fax Machines. Attendance is a must or you will lose your job. No pension is offered to new employees so prepare early.
good,"5ess analysis technician. work night shift. Monitored alarms for the network. Hours of operation was from 12m-8am. Per form testing for equipment, and restore procedures"
good,"With the changes they are making within the company it makes the job security challenging for those of us that are working here.  Lots of years here, but business has changed."
good,Fast paced and fun for people that are interested in technology. Learn more about a large company with lots to offer as far as mobilizing your world..
good,My time at AT&T has been great. I've worked for a competitor for many years and having the CWA as our union made things much more fair for the employees.
good,"In every day at work, always expect to communicate with international customer or clients. It is important to give them the best service that they deserve. I learned and realized that in any job or work we should be more patient and also we need to be more focused on it for us to be able to know the different ways to do our job right. The things that makes my job interesting and fun were we can able to bond by communicating with our workmates and Team leaders while were working. We also have billiards, and devices like PlayStation inside our building for us to release stress and to relax ourselves. The hardest part of our job is to make irate customers remain calm for us to be able to explain them well and to give them the right resolution to their problems. The most enjoyable part of our job is to help them and fix the customer or client's problem and give them the best kind of service they deserve."
good,unpredictable hours and times to be off... ranges from getting off early to getting off as late as 10 pm.  Overall good place to work but there is a negative attitude with many employees
good,"Basically very fast paced, never know when calls may come in you can get them back to back on most days especially in that location cause employees are being terminated everyday or walking off. Some customers can be the most kind over the phone and some can be very irate and vulgar depending on the situation. In my experience for AT&T, management and Supervisor mainly really on patients for that matter alone. And because of that I was awarded several times as an employee for that company"
good,Great job with nice pay and good benefits. Lots of paid off time and travel perks. The work is often frustrating and these lots of things out of your control but you still have to manage them also you often never know what time you’re going to get off so it’s kind of hard to plan after work activities with your family.
good,"great company, always innovating with different products (home, Mobile,TV, and entertainment). great benefits and flexible work schedule. good employee discounts on all of ATT services"
good,The work affords good opportunities to learn about new technologies and new tools. Solving problems is the enjoyable part. Dealing with many layers of project managers is less enjoyable.
good,Fast paced global work environment with good benefits and pay. Much is expected of you and you need to perform. It is very easy to become over involved.
good,"AT&T is an traditional telecom firm working to reinvent itself, again. It  survived the past 2 decades by growing wireless and with mergers. This brought opportunities and attrition within the workforce, and more change is ahead. "
good,I learned a lot working for AT&T. They had the best safety training and I learned skills that I can use for other companies. I had wonderful managers and I would have retired from AT&T if I wasn't laid off.
good,"good job. I like working at AT&T. Have worked closely with many talented, dedicated and generous people. Good benefits package. Good discounts on cell phone, U-Verse, HBO."
good,I had a great time working for AT&T but I want to make more in salary  this is why I am looking for new job  with Better opportunities  better pay and more to come Flexible hours flexible schedules because of school and getting a degree
good,ATT was a great and still is a great experience. having said that the micro management is unbarable. the requirements needing to be met daily are stressful. and overall it was a negative work environment. the only plus was the money and benifits.
good,"Great place to work with great benefits, work/life balance and great management. Staying focused is the most important aspect of the job, stay focused on your numbers!"
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for. The company provides employees the opportunity to grow in their chosen careers within the company. If offers employees the opportunity  to learn new technologies and if you want to further your education, the company offers you tuition assistance"
good,"High pressure sales job. Like any sales job, they want you to sell everything under the sun. Directv is the hot thing right now. Do not go in expecting to sell phones. Your job is to move the customer from phones to tv."
good,I worked with this company for over 9 yrs. Communication was great and everyone helped one another along the way. Friendly environment with people who care.
good,"I learned alot about At&t Products and services, Developed my Customer service skills and Learned many Selling Strategies.. Grew Confident in myself!! Definitely a place to find yourself"
good,"Honestly, it is a really easy job to have working there. You just have to do as you're told and be able to learn about the company and how to effectively sale in order to do well at your job. There are opportunities to move up with the company but it takes time, a lot of time in order to see any kind of advancements."
good,There will be a lot of fun times but the job can be come stressful. There are a lot of events that take place to help you interact with one another. Working on the phone with customers can be stressful when they are stressed about their issues.
good,great place to work for. really love the day i had with the team. pay was great. u got to be your own boss. got to a point the weather didn't even matter. its always work to be done. sometime u do gotta watch your managers. some of them are cut throat and will do they best to get u out. customers was the best part of the day cause u never knew what u would get. funny.
good,"Muy buen ambiente laboral, prestaciones de ley y buenas comisiones."
good,'Excellent benefits and fair pay. Great company to work for.  Getting rid of wireline services but does have tuition reimbursement for retraining person.
good,"Working for AT&T in a retail sales environment was stressful, but because I was well compensated for it, it seemed like a fair trade. AT&T demands a lot from their employees and salespeople, having had them transition from selling phones and tablets into selling those, home security, directv, and other up and coming efforts. AT&T is a huge company and if you are a good salesperson and adaptable to be able to sell anything as well as very able to make up things about yourself that you think you're not good at as part of constant micro managing and coaching, it will be a great fit. This company was union when I worked for them though, and that meant raises every 6 months. I actually fell ill and ran out of FMLA and short term disability. I might still be there today otherwise because the benefits and compensation were very fair after working there for over 5 years."
good,"I worked here when I need to expanse my career. It was a great supervisory role. Unfortunately or fortunately the company was going through a merger which created some instability. But over all. it was good experience and a stepping stone, career wise."
good,"At&t / Directv is by far one of the best places I worked but maybe that's bc of my patients and work ethic, I've seen a lot of other techs get the short end of the stick and treated unfairly, At&t lacks on supporting the fields techs that give At&t a face, we are the ones that deal with customers day in and day out on the daily basis in a physical form. We do the customer service and the hard labor, no matter how many jobs you close a month you will never get paid anymore or less, you can close 70 jobs a month and still get paid the same as  a tech closing 30 jobs a month, must work long hours, high demanding metrics for a silly 100-200-250 a month (not worth it) don't matter if you a good tech or a bad tech you are all in the same pay scale (union),this is why I'm working on leaving the company."
good,"AT&T is a fast paced working environment in an ever changing industry driven by technology advancements. It is high integrity company with a strong work ethic.  The hardest part of the management job was terminating employees.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting and establishing strong working relationships with employees, peers and upper management."
good,"The unfortunate part of a call center environment, you would be hunted down in the restroom if you were off the floor for too long. The center I was in was closed down."
good,"During my time with the company, I worked as a tech with DirecTV and I truly enjoyed the leadership and my colleagues. Although it was a work from home position it felt as if I was actually in the call center."
good,No hay buen ambiente laboral dentro de la empresa.
good,"Very team and goal orientated, employees are asked to constantly seek sales and in a sense compete with fellow team members as individual sales are recorded on a board in the rest area. Branch manager was very understanding but often times put on the spot by higher ups to pressure his team to up the performance."
good,my time at at&t was good i like the people i worked with as well as the system for sales they taught us. digital life is the devil though you have to sell home security to people just looking for phones and it can seem very pushy and unexpected.
good,AT&T as a company offers great benefits and an endless amount of different paths to choose as far as advancement goes. Most work is union based so you truly have a voice in the company.
good,"AT&T is a great career, and I would recommend any driven person to apply. Like and job you get what you put in. The culture and camaraderie is the best part,"
good,"it was a very stressful environment, we had to sell up in every single call. even though the customers only wanted instructions or directions on how to use the products and features."
good,offered awards for performance as well. at times job was stressful making deadlines but other times not so much. Management was always helpful and supportive
good,"The AT&T work culture is very supportive for new candidate and provide lots of opportunity to learn new technologies."
good,"When I first started, I had minimal experience in the technical field. As time progressed, with AT&T's assistance and training, I was able to mature into a great field technician. The hours have improved. The job can be stressful some days as you are payed by the hour, but measured by the minute. Every day has unique challenges."
good,We deal with US based customers and employees and contractors worldwide. you have to be flexible and as understanding of the different work ethics and cultures of the people around you.
good,Loved the atmosphere in the Facilities Management Department.I would recommend working for this amazing company and miss my time with everyone in the group.
good,"I started out as an ssr (sales support rep) not to be biased or anything but I was very good at my job and I did it well!!!! When I expressed interest in wanting to move up within the company I got the cold shoulder from my Store Manager and told I wouldnt be good for the position. All because the manager didn't want to loose me as part of his sales support staff. Very frustrating, but not to mention selfish on his part. I loved the people I met and worked with but I worked at several of the stores and to be honest it was a lot of politics within the workplace."
good,"The job kept me on my toes; always a new challenge to overcome. Never a dull moment."
good,A very good company with room to grow. I advance from a MA to an office Support Admin in 5 years and was pleased overall with the company if i hadn't had  roots in California I would of relocated to Texas
good,"Working in management was nice. It really depends on your management and how they run it. If you are an ASM in Retail there is not much advancement unless you want to become a Store Manager. Other than that it's a really small amount of jobs and they get full quickly usually with people who know people in the department. So if you're thinking of a career in California it's hard to find something outside of Retail unless it's B2B or an Engineer or something. It's a good job but it definitely is not a forever job. The hardest part of the job is the ""baby-sitting"" feeling of taking care of the reps but necessary. The enjoyable part is the compensation overall (although it's down from before) and the culture is nice too."
good,AT&T had plenty of benefits as well as a good commission rate for each and every employee depending on the region. I would recommend to a family or friend.
good,Once people get hired they never leave. They get comfortable because of the pay and they generally know what to expect day to day. Whether or not you enjoy the job will really depend on your coworkers and management.
good,"Loved flexibility in working contract for AT&T but was let go only and I guarantee only due to my survey points.  No customers took time to give feedback although I had a clientele listing due to 80 percent of my customers insisted I call them monthly to review their bills."
good,"This was a solid place to work! Great work/life balance, benefits, great people to work with, and the campus is really nice with a gym, food options, etc."
good,"Decent place to work if you are self motivated, unfortunately a little lacking on job advancement for lower end employees. Overall, like many jobs, the environment mostly depends on your luck with your supervisor/upper-management."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work if you stay in a sales position.  The problems I have with AT&T come from being in management, they required a minimum of 45 hours as a manager.  As an assistant any time that floor coverage was required, was forced on the assistant."
good,Had good time working here as there was much scope where you can learn many new Technologies and get updated according to the market.Friendly management.
good,"mgmnt good about helping with needs of employees, co-workers are very helpful, hours are a little on the stressful side, overall it is a great place to work."
good,"Good place to work, Medical benefit, Vision, Dental as well as a great 401K plan and a Pension. All of this is now changing for new people coming into the company but it is happening everywhere. I enjoy my job because I am detail oriented and my job requires that. I believe I am a good fit for my job. The culture is positive."
good,"AT&T is a fine company to work for if you find the right position that suits you.It's a fair company that treats all its employees with respect, and I would recommend it to anyone."
good,I've been doing this type of work since I was 18. The work is extremely stressful. You are expected to meet sales quotas even when you take escalated calls. You have to request off months in advance in order to get the day and there is still a chance you would be wait listed. They pay is nice but the hours are not ideal for me.
good,AT&T provides ample opportunities to learn new skills. They provide readily accessible training classes. Management is supportive and there is an opportunity to apply to other positions internally.
good,"Typical Day"
good,"Great company. Just very demanding. Worked part time and received full time schedule for about two years. But they will work around school schedules. "
good,"20 years of diverse telecommunications skills within the corporate workforce. From the Calling Card, Sales & Support for residential and small business services to field management."
good,Somethings are different day to day and some or just added activities to enhance the atmosphere. Technology is ever evolving so there is no time to slack. You have to be ready to move on to the next level.
good,At&t is technology based and requires tech savvy people to help sell and maintain their products and services. Overall this is a good company to work for
good,I haven't worked here in a long time and I am certain it has changed a lot since I had to leave.   It was a great place to work with great people and a good management style.
good,"AT&T is an exciting and at the same time challenging place to work. Initial training was about 3 months from pole climbing to learning about u verse and direct tv products. After training you report to your assigned yard, there you will be introduced to managers and other techs. I went through three managers in a year I learned from all of them. I enjoyed the on the job  training constantly learning about the advancement of technology. There was never a dull moment fast paced and  very diverse environment. Co-workers were fun to work with.I can’t said enough about how the AT&T brought my skills to another level. If you are looking for a company to help challenge and stretch your skills AT&T is the place. I have nothing really bad to said about the company it’s all about what you make out of it and what you are looking for."
good,overall great company to work for . job advancement has great potential to advance within the company. enjoyed my training certification for training along with a few great coworkers
good,"My typical day sometimes starts off driving about 80-90 miles, to perform in field visit with technicians. It gave me the opportunity to work with low performing technician and assist them with  the necessary tools to get the up to speed. Maintain an open door communication, through feedback, feedforward and reward top performers, promote safe work place. Driving over 200-300 miles in a day may have been the hardest part of my job. Working with and developing others."
good,"During my tenure with the company, I had several great mentors and varied challenges.  In my area, the focus ion on margin, margin and margin.  This is not unusual for support teams.  Officers define whether the business unit leadership must be co-located or support remote working relationships.  When officer leadership changes and then requirements are changed requiring relocation versus work in place, good employees can become displaced.  Company does try very hard to provide reskilling opportunities to employees but be prepared to pursue these on your time with significant commitment.  Networking within the company is needed to transition from one role to another in addition to relocation availability generally.  All in all I enjoyed my time and learned a lot.  Great place to start."
