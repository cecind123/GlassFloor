bad,For 5 years I was in an unfaithful relationship where the bartender  J.P thought it was funny to sleep around with coworkers that we worked with at Longhorn Steakhouse (Yonkers) while having me take care of her child and do all the dad and boyfriend stuff no one wanted to do.The funny part was employees and management knew I was getting cheated on. Good luck with harassment ladies they condone it instead of preventing it.
bad,"Olive Garden 6423 is the absolute worst job I have ever had from a management standpoint. Once was written up for using the bathroom. They called it "" Poor performance"". If you want a toxic workplace with uneducated management this is the place for you. If not seek employment elsewhere. Out of all jobs I feel least valued here."
bad,"Managers only care about the bottom line. As an employee you are nothing more than a number"
bad,Constant pressure from corporate to force things on the customers but no backing from management when a customer would complain about the selling tactics we were forced to use
bad,abusive manager. poor money. liars about shifts. say full time and give part time. only good for play money if you don't have bills. only care about corporate. I'll leave here and tell everyone how bad it is and i'll never go in a dardens restaurant again.
bad,Poor training and not team oriented at all. Lack of direction from management. Poor pay for the work. Completely let down and dissapointed. Everyone is only worried about themselves and no one willing to help anyone but themselves
bad,"Dissatisfied with the management and corporate side of Darden.  "
bad,Horrible company bad management low wages very stressful overworked underpaid managers should be fired from that location very bad place to work.no help to workers not good starting wage no room for advancement
bad,Olive garden management team sucks they are unorganized they a petty like kids they are bad at communication with workers and they are not sensible and you don't have breaks they want you to work all day like slaves..
bad,Very poorly run restaurant. The general manager is clueless and can't handle when it gets busy. They tend to turn a blind eye to some things as long as numbers are met.
bad,"All four supervisors ended up being fired, treating staff badly and unfairly. They were partiers and unproffesional. Many staff complaints and low morale."
bad,"I worked at olive garden for 2 months. In that time 2 members of the management team, including the general manager, were either fired or went back to serving. It was a disorganized, completely unprofessional mess to work there. In the 2 months i worked there, not one member of management bothered to even learn my name. They tell customers waiting for tables that there are ""slim pickings"" for wait staff after they send 90% of the staff home before they should. Overall terrible experience. Would not recommend working at the hyannis MA location."
bad,Very very poor management. They treat the staff horribly. There were problems with customers and racial issues that were not handled the way they needed to be. Theft almost weekly.
bad,I'm looking for the highest peak of culinary experience postible the recipe is important to a culinary field so we peak freshness possible which creates the best culture for our guests
bad,"The restaurant I worked at lacked management who actually helped employee and guest but showed favoritism and did the bare minimum. a typical day is doing your job on top of other peoples job because either the restaurant is understaffed or because you are told to do so. Their is competition and hostility towards server,host, management, and kitchen staff."
bad,They don’t not care about the people that work there. They only car about making money and they will cheat the workers out of the hours that they are suppose to get.
bad,"I had worked for this company for almost 9 years. I was promised when I was hired that I would be full time. I was never given the oppourtinity, nor was I given training for other positions to try to gather extra income. The hardest part was to stop seeing all the customers that I enjoyed to see and speak to."
bad,Not ok  to work here thay do not value their workers and thay. Ask more and more of you with no incintives.   Just over all not apealing  job to be apart of
bad,"No respect, no leadership, no compassion, no input to hiring managers, the director is a jerk, very condescending, has no clue how to run operations. Lie after Lie."
bad,"Employees control weather you have a job or not as a manager. Long days, have to work over if someone doesnt show up. GM work when they want but expect other managers to work 12-15 hr days"
bad,"olive garden sucks big time. they treat you like garbage, expect you to do everything that a manager does and not get paid for it. Racist. White washing everything."
bad,"When I started working for Darden it was an alright job. The restaurant in WV was great. In South Carolina the restaurant I worked at and the one I ate at were poorly ran, slow, and had some questionable policies. Add on requirement and surveys will ruin your work life."
bad,Bipolar management who last less time than the hourly workers. Workers are treated as less than and have no say in anything. Always a stressful work environment.
bad,Worst company to work for in hospitality industry. To corporate and new board of directors are only in it to line their pockets. Between the Coupons and soup/salad/breadsticks and unlimited pasta bowl promotions serverS and bartender work their butts off and for no compensation
bad,Olive Garden is okay. The food is okay and is a decent place to work. I have been there for about 9 months and have gotten used to how the restaurant is run and upkept.
bad,"A typical workweek included 10 scheduled workdays with an average shift of 5 hours, alternating between opening and closing shifts."
bad,"At Darden enlightment center is fast working area, have to be on top of everything have to get everything done in the amount of time. Have to multitask 5 things at once. Straight men work type of job. There is no breaks in between. Pays under mid wage"
bad,The company is extremely corporate and out of tune with the entire business.
bad,"They spared no effort to make you feel like you were owned, not an employee."
bad,This place does not care about you. They will just find your replacement. Huge company and you are just a number to them. They do not care about quality of life at all.
bad,I would not recommend anyone to start entry level for this company due to lack of inconsitency with mangement team and lacadasical wait and kitchen staff.
bad,I worked for Red Lobster in Fairview IL. The management was under a tremendous amount of stress from corporate so in response to that they made our work environment miserable. We could not laugh or have fun. All positive reinforcement was ceased and threats and sarcasm replaced it. The managers comp everything and would never back up any of our servers. They had too high expectations of the servers and every meeting they would give us more responsiblity and take away more pay. Two different female servers on two different occasions were physically assulted by guests on Red Lobster property. They did nothing to help them and they did not make any other measures to prevent something like this from happening again. They demoted servers (cutting their pay and humiliating them) that were pregnant or had families to support. Multiple times they reminded us that we were all replaceable. Worst company I've ever worked for.
bad,Worst job ever managers are not honest people. If you are treated unfairly and make a complaint you will find not listening ear. It’s not until matters progress into
bad,"First of all management was trash. Tips were okay but not on weekdays. you get paid less than minimum wage, even though they’ll say you’ll make $10-$15 an hour. Hours were horrible, servers would come in late and customers would get upset and management won’t help. You would leave way later than what your schedule said. Would not recommend."
bad,"Constantly busy, with managers watching your every move, rude customers, and managers had no regard for the employees' schedules. Managers also were not helpful in anyway, but rude if there was a question about the job."
bad,The most enjoyable thing about this job were the people I worked with and even that isn't saying a lot. Darden actively hires felons and then outs the blame on innocent people when things go wrong or missing. They don't treat their employees with respect in my experience and have no desire to help with issues they've caused. I don't know if this is everyone's experience or if i just had bad management at mine.
bad,"Awful workplace environment, terrible management (managers would come in drunk and had been known to assault female employees), no chance to advance unless you were willing to do ""favors"", and wretched pay. The only pro was that all the employees were like family and we were a good support group."
bad,"Imagine having a manager who is constantly inebriated, now imagine three of them. Ridiculous. Every time I asked to be crosses trained they said “we have enough people there”. That’s not the point, I’m asking to learn new things and grow as an employee, and they hold you back, not letting you move positions (or even learn them) when you ask every day about it."
bad,"Cullinary Manager was not a very nice person.  Area Director solicited opinions from the team members without giving much credience to the views of the managers.  Pay and benefits were nice, however, you had little to no life outside of work.  Work life balance was poor at best."
bad,"The managers were awful, if anything went wrong even if they were the ones you did it. It was your fault. They pushed so many people to quit, in a month of me being there 60 people had quit. Ridiculous."
bad,Beware! Darden Restaurants is a money-hungry corporation who doesn’t give two f’s about it’s employees. My money was stole 3 times from other employees and guests dining and they blamed me for it and wouldn’t respect my story and I was accosted for it. They don’t care about the employees’ well-being and will work you like a race horse. Ye be warned.
bad,The resturant in Washington Pa was just opening when I worked their. No family like feeling as of that time. However the people seemed ambitious and unfriendly.
bad,"There's too many servers, not enough money to be made. It's a fight to get shifts, I was hired for full time work and barely get part time hours. Management is ok, but shady."
bad,"The only good thing I've acquired is friends here. There are no benefits, not great pay, and stressful to work. It's not a flexible schedule as they claim."
bad,"I loved the whole presentation from hiring process to being a part of the team. Very knowlegable staff, particular to small details, providing the best dining experience and awesome made from scratch foods. My co workers were young and lively and hard working. The hardest thing was knowing all the ingredients in all the dishes and the right garnish. I enjoyed the music and the fun enviroment. Great place to work."
bad,"Upper management is a joke. Unless you’re a recovering alcoholic, a womanizer or yes man you are going nowhere. Women are treated horribly in management. Just an all around terrible place to work for. Very disrespectful and unappreciative. You are just a number for this corporation."
bad,"When I started working for Olive garden, I was working 40 hours a week. Soon, those hours started to become less and less, because some hosts were being favored over others for hours. Servers who were proven to be bad at serving were then moved to hosting, cutting the rest of the hosts hours even more. If you were a friend of the host manager you got more hours. By the time I left I had been scheduled 8 hours a week 3 weeks in a row. that averaged me about 60-70$ after taxes, not nearly enough to pay any bills or rent. this was happening to over half of the hosts working there."
bad,worked as a waiter. management was poor. they just wanted to play around and flirt with the underage hostesses while all of the waiters are freaking out needing help.
bad,"Managment was unable to accommodate my disability for the first year and refused promotion without explanation. This leads me to believe that I was discriminated against, and in the end, I just got too depressed working for them. On a similar note, the management may not care about the employees at all. I had an uncle die and they called me during the funeral to tell me that I was late for work. This is of course after making sure ALL of my managers knew that I would be leaving for the funeral and what day's I needed off. Both of these stories were confirmed by my fellow employee's experiences in my restaurant. Otherwise, it is a decent place to work, all you'd need to do is make sure you're on the manager's good side rather than interested in promoting and advancing the company. Innovation is not an interest of Darden Restaurants. Keep your head down and do your job at the minimal amount and you can be a server in no time at all."
bad,Worst company to work for can put in years with job and when you do something they don’t like they will fire you. Management gets changed out quit frequently
bad,"Servers get stiffed a lot at Olive Garden. And it's not for lack of service either. The customers 9/10 are rude, very high maintenance and don't tip good. I've never seen so many people crying at work. Endless breadsticks, soup and salad and sometimes an endless pasta means the amount of time you spend refilling food another table feels abandoned. At a normal serving job you can have nine tables and juggle them fine. But at Olive Garden you get three tables and if one of them eats like Jabba the Hut you have to run as fast as you can so your other tables don't stiff you. Management does nothing about you being stiffed, the bussers not doing their job even though they automatically get your tips and they don't care if you are sick or injured. They won't cut your section even if you have to leave straight to the ER. Seriously."
bad,"I am speaking on the Augusta Ga location. The management staff is terrible. They would bully employees and get away with. It didn't matter if you complained to the home office. The general manager embarrasses his employees in front of guest and sleeps around with his staff members , while going unpunished. Very very unprofessional place to work."
bad,The only good thing about this place is the pay. Management is absolutely horrible. They don't care. And are power hungry. The turnover rate is through the roof. In the six months I worked there I saw over ten people come and go. On my first day I saw three leave. They over order product and things go bad. The place is extremely disgusting.
bad,"At yardhouse in south beach the money is terrible, there’s no volume whatsoever. The benefits for Darden are amazing and I feel like this location is the problem not the company itself."
bad,"Corporate Greed killed my job of 17 years. Red Lobster where I worked has now separated from Darden. The corporation slowly turned away from the darden promise which was a happy employee meant happy guests, Started the downfall when they decided there would be no more seniority."
bad,Darden is a terrible place for minorities. It is like a bad fraternity that supports only certain employees. Upper management bullies their employees and push them down.
bad,"this company is god awful, they only allow servers to have three tables at a time which means the place is flooded with servers which makes the job that much harder. the managers are perverts and corporate does nothing about it."
bad,Overall it was a great place to work and I really enjoyed it and I learned a lot about myself in other people and strengthen my skills I would go back definitely
bad,"Often times it can be too slow to make a decent amount of money. Unfortunately, the variability in income can make it difficult to wish to stay. Further, corporate chain restaurants abide by certain rules that sometimes do not benefit or take care of their employees."
bad,The busiest days were on Mothers day and Valentines day. our screens would never clear up for the whole day. it was a marathon not a race the manager would say.
bad,"Absolutely not don't work there at least not the one in Middletown absolutely madness in everything department bar, kitchen, severs, bussers absolutely not."
bad,"Darden is your typical Corporate Restaurant where they care more about profit than employees. While, it wasn't a terrible job as far as pay goes, there is little room for growth."
bad,This probably would of been a better place to work if I were older and was able to work off of tips but for the money I was making and the things I had to do. It wasn't worth it. They don't train properly. They expect you to know everything your first day before you've even been trained. This place was not for me. There was more drama in this work place than food going out.
bad,"Job responsibilities were overloaded. Pay was not enough for any person to to live on, unless you had more than a one person household income. Most of the time staff members were sent home after 1 1/2 hrs at the most due to business being slow."
bad,"Hour sporadic, scheduled on days requested off weeks in advance, unfriendly toward workers. Coworkers were typically pleasant to be around. Mainly just light janitorial duty and dishes."
bad,I learned to work at a very fast and unforgiving pace. My co-workers were eager to show me the ropes. The hardest part of the job was working every weekend.
bad,Good manager training program.  Need to change management structure so managers can focus on job at hand.  Did not like my work/home balance.  Many concepts to choose from at Darden.
bad,One of the managers uses the dishwasher to wash out bottles for her baby causing the dishes to pile up. GM cant hire anybody useful. Expect to be over worked and under paid.
bad,No work/ life balance.  Upper Management and Leadership offer little to no support to their lower level management and Leadership.  Face pace with daily operations and overall accountabilities exceed normal standards.  Turnover exceeds industry average.
bad,"You have to keep track of everything you do, because the company tends to ""short"" your paycheck quite often."
bad,The restaurant industry is always run by people who get their feelings hurt too often. The culture here started out as it should've but slowly fell into a pit of favoritism very quickly when new managers began replacing great ones.
bad,"This particular Olive Garden was by far the worst corporate organization I have ever worked for. In my 17 years in these food and beverage industry I have never experienced such a disorganized, mismanaged, dysfunctional, and pathetic establishment that was still operating without any corporate control. Perhaps the most Troublesome thing about this Olive Garden was the fact that there were several qualified and skilled workers being underutilized and underappreciated which caused low morale and the highest turnover rate I've ever experienced. I personally expressed my concern with the location managers as well as the Corporation as a whole. Although while I knew my position there was only temporary I felt like I always tried to improve things in both the front of house and back of house by expressing my concerns to my managers only to have them dismiss my concerns with attitude and mistreatment by loss of hours and broken promises of incentives such as increase in pay, schedule time off and promotion. By far the most unprofessional organization I've work for."
bad,"This company is all about maximum pay off with minimal effort placed into training, staffing, and supplying its many chain-restaurants. Employee concerns are generally dismissed unless they are severe enough to gather attention."
bad,"Terrible management, lack of structure, no communication, forget you have a life outside of this place. I truly have no idea how this location is even still standing and operating."
bad,"Loved the guests, but management is very hard on you.  Most managers don't stand by the standards that one is taught.  Professionalism is not rewarded."
bad,"The Management here is so pathetic and turnover rate crazy! I was employed here for almost 3 years ONLY because I needed a job and had regular customers and therefore made great $ but as the years past, the restaurant went totally downhill,  Mostly because GM is CLUELESS! None of the managers(4) had ever served before,  therefore they RARELY pitched In to help and you're left hanging out in the weeds! The fact that they have unlimited menu items IS A DISASTER FOR SERVERS!!!!! plus, COCKROACHES!"
bad,If you have a good relationship with the manager that shift you get special treatment. If you have a bad relationship with said manager you get punished. Such as giving away your table to “a better sever” or getting bumped from lead to a busser at the host stand. The management has such favoritism that when they work shifts together they argue. I was told for months that if I wanted to train to be a sever I could do that. Instead of giving me my training they hired server after server many of whom left after a week or two. It was all very stressful and caddy. There is a very bad attitude circling around everyone who’s been there for years on end. They are all like cancer in the workplace because they’ve built up entitlement to themselves. Especially the GM worst of them all. He is an avid liar. Who will put things in place for you to not feel comfortable in your work place and he did just that made me very uncomfortable anytime he was around.
bad,It was a balance of professionalism and unprofessionalism. Management could withstand improvement but apparently acceptable to company standards. Mediocre pay.
bad,Working at Darden for the first couple of months were fine but after a while I realized how unorganized management was and they really didn’t care about their employees
bad,"Long Days, Learned a whole lot in terms of management. Great culture. Lots of opportunity to help develop and grow your teams and help folks advance. ."
bad,They don't care for dishwashers. It hard dirty and stressful and as a dishwasher they let ppl walk allover you. But starting at $12 hr is nice but not worth it
bad,"New management, company losses and way to much responsibilities to keep up with. Stress was off the charts. It used to be like a family, but they kept adding more and more responsibilities with no more help."
bad,"bad management, not the best pay, hard to get promoted- overall bad experience"
bad,"I constantly had guests who were pretty much trying to get free meals, you could have given them the greatest service of your career and they'd be unhappy sadly even though many times the managers knew what was happening they would NOT back you up if corporate was called or if someone complained. I cannot lie however there are also great days where you have amazing guests who can many times become your regulars and some days you can make up to $250 in one day but if management doesn't look out for you as their employee well it's pretty much pointless because as easily as you can make those $250 during an off season you can end up going home with just $20 in your pocket."
bad,"I was sexually harassed during my shift by another employee(server) when I reported it to my general manager, I wrote a statement, and explained what happened. My GM insisted that it was an accident, disregarding how I felt. I found out during an investigation from the GM's boss(district manager), that there was another woman harassed by the same offender, yet he felt as though suspending the offender would be enough discipline. My general manager failed to report to the other managers on the flood that this situation was going on, therefore I ended up having to work with the offender side by side. Eventually, I quit because I could no longer feel comfortable in my work setting. I also expressed how unlawful it would be to have the offender still work the restaurant. I also called corporate to try and get some help, yet they failed to reach out after I expressed my situation. "
bad,The people are great. I had so much fun and enjoyed my position within the confines of interacting with my coworkers. My manager had something wrong with him. A truly devious person full of lies and deceit.
bad,"As a GM for 14 years it started as a good company but as soon as Darden bought them out it went to he!!. I can’t tell you how many times in the short time after their takeover that I heard the phrase “think about the shareholders” from my DM. No care for the staff, quality of food, or even the guest for most part. Just about the money."
bad,I feel like i was fired but i didnt deserve to be. I dont feel like my job should be at risk for customers decisions. I am a very hard worker it was overlooked
bad,"I wouldn’t go back to Darden. the company has proven to be inadequate in matters of hiring, and implementing training. The company makes a lot of empty promises."
bad,a typical day at work starts off great then usually ends in mass chaos. i do not recommend to anyone. used to be great had friends i wanted to hire in all the time now steer clear
bad,"While General Managers and Team Members are protected and offered job security, Managers are dispensable. There is little to no work-life balance. Managers are expected to work at least 50 hours per week with no guaranteed break. As a manager, there are days I am in the building for 12 hours without being allowed to step outside for fresh air, let alone sit down to eat a meal."
bad,"While I learned how to work for a corporation over the 7 years, I had to scrape for each penny. The management were jerks. I would never EVER return"
bad,"There was a general inconsistency with everything in this franchise. I was trained well initially but once I transferred there seemed to be a complete change in steps of service, standards, and different pay rates. I was also made to work off the clock."
bad,I overall enjoyed my job.  I loved the guests and most all of my peers.  I learned quite a bit about managing in a corporate restaurant. The hardest part of my job was the fact that I was transferred 4 times over a two year period.  I did not mind the transfers but it was difficult to continuously have to establish myself as a manager to hundreds of team members.  I was able to do so but I feel as it left me with less time ti grow than I would have liked.
bad,"Pretty standard food service.  Not much to expect here, but not bad for a young kid looking to pick up some experience."
bad,Very low career opportunities. Not very professional. The location I was employed at met very minimal EEOC requirements. All the while coming to work having to deal with discrimination and harrasment.
bad,Management treated bussers like trash and never had our backs on anything over scheduled and treated poorly by other workers no matter who they were and management did nothing about it
bad,"I was a minor when I applied here. I was continuously harassed by a coworker here and management did nothing to resolve the problem. Instead I just became another of his ""victims""."
bad,"Experience varys on location. I had never served before, and learned a great deal based on what my co-workers told me. Loved my co-workers, they got me through very stressful situations."
bad,Debería evaluar mejor los Gm que tengan más comunicación con sus empleados que al menos tomen tiempo de saludarles ganarle el respeto
bad,"id come in to open and nothing would be done, cleaned or stocked properly for the morning crew. At night i didn't close but could tell what it was going to be like for the next morning because people would leave with with doing the bare minimum if anything at all. friends were getting recommended for jobs, so people would come in and talk and hang out rather than work. When I asked to help stock or run food I would get attitude while Im running their food. i would notify managers and nothing would get done because the manager ""is too busy right now and in a bad mood"" or didnt have time for ""childish bickering"" there was ONE manager and I praise her who tried her best to help everyone and i feel she should be the GM. not the guy on vacation 8 months out of the year. i watched this guy come in after me immediately get promoted to bar then trainer then manger and he came in 6 months after me, always did the bare minimum and was just rude to his coworkers. but kissed the managers butt so he got promoted quick."
bad,Where to even begin. Worked in the kitchen. Laborers especially dish treated like nothing. Servers able to get away with anything including misstreating staff and creating drama and more work for Laborers as they sit around and eat bread sticks and soup and converse. Expected to do more than one full time station at once as servers rail you for having to wait 2 minutes because you're stuck doing 3 full time jobs. As servers over portion bread sticks making breadstation on a weekday a full time can't look away job ontop other tasks. Unannounced schedule changes. Consistently edited and took hours off my time clock. Managers do almost nothing to change or help back of house. Drama. It's a job but it's stressful. Knew two workers who went home and cried almost everyday. Good pay for a starter job and friendly but neglective managers. Funday Sundays. Would only recommend getting a job as a server.
bad,"i loved working for some of the concepts, you can learn a lot from within them. Some of them are scratch kitchen which i love and the others aren't but they are still busy."
bad,It was okay working there I just didn’t even make enough to afford an apt. I liked the people I worked with but just the other night I made 25 dollars after working 6 hours and they wouldn’t compensate me for min wage
bad,"Ok place to work! Busy place alot a business. Be prepared to run while you're there. High turn around rate, alot of people don't stay because of the demand of the job. Not your ordinary, typical restaurant."
bad,"Quite a negative and stressful environment to work in. Management almost never backs up their staff and instead rules in favor of the customer even if the customer is rudely swearing to their employees. Coworkers are nice, but the stress gets to everyone and builds up a highly negative workplace. I have had one coworker describe it as the most disorganized restaurant they haveever worked in."
bad,"see previous review, i worked off and on for this company for 22 years. i had my ups and downs, some good and some bad. towards the end it was really bad"
bad,"I worked for Darden for 23 years and felt for a majority of my time there the company aligned with my personal and professional core values."
bad,"This is a great company, unfortunately, sometimes the managers that are hired may not be such great people and mess it up for the entire company."
bad,"Poor Hours and Compensation, Lack of communication between supervisors.  Trainers forced to sit at a desk when not training clients."
bad,"working for Darden restaurant, Olive Garden was a such bad experience, first of all the management never let you have an opinion of what could work better the restaurant of if okay to be yourself as a server, for them was not okay to express yourself. they give you and week in half of training but it is a waste of time because all that you learn it is how to be a fake person and never show your real persona, if you ever sick you have to work, if you are not feeling during the shift you have to work because usually at my location we were always shorted stuff and my managers was the rudest person ever, she was GM but she did not know how to run the restaurant. She would get frustrated and start yelling to her workers and that was not professional at all."
bad,Corporate Environment.  Top Down Management. High Cost of Benefits.
bad,"I remember one day I got burned my neck and my chest at Work, the doctor's statements said I could not work in the hot spot such as  kitchen, but the management team was putting pressure on me to close the case so I can come back to work. they did not see me like someone the was hurt who needed some times to taking care of myself... To me that was the hardest part of my Job. like I say it, a man was born to work hard and take care of his family. working hard is nothing to me because I get use to it. And I have some good times too at my Job with the Co-workers I learn a lot from them."
bad,"What is taught in training is not followed by all managers.  I was there a long time, for the most part the servers were great.  Management usually lacked, and didn't have your back.  The ziosk is used as a tool to get the server into write up situations.  The work can be back breaking and labor intensive.  The money {tips} can be good, the company will only pay what they have to, by law.  I enjoyed most of my years there.  It isn't the same Darden as it was years ago."
bad,"I only worked for a few months with Darden Restaurants. For being a hostess I felt the pay was very low. We only received $4 an hour. We got tipped out a portion at the end of each shift, but after splitting with the wait staff and bar staff, we barely got a share at all. Shorts hours as well. Only worked about 4 hours a day, a few times a week."
bad,"Poor management that thinks it's better than it is, poor training besides the corporate assistances with the store opening, and a poor culture and environment adds to the hourly employees general dislike of their job."
bad,"I enjoy working, and taking care of our guest. I feel teamwork is important and enjoy working with my coworkers. Serving is obviously much different than caring for someone in a facility. I'm looking go back to School for nursing assistant."
bad,"Typical day was.to set yourself and others up for success, taking care of lots of guests, running good, bartending, prepping, serving tables , and being responsible for money, bar, and quality service for our guests. While managers wouldn't really lead by example."
bad,Not much room for any sort of advancement in house. Managers trying their best but are given almost no support from corporate and with lack of experience in most managers they are set up to fail.
bad,horrible place to manage because you were always spread so thin with upper management that was unqualified and often played favorites. Please ask for more informantion
bad,Darren was fun challenging but has no balance in family and work.  They go though 3 to 4 trainees before keeping one for 6 months or longer.  Not enough employee help for single patents
bad,"12  to 16 hours a day was typical. Only management's grossly planned project schedule counts. If its impossible to perform, to bad, make it happen  or else."
bad,"Company ""service standards"" range from unrealistic to physically impossible and you'll most likely get written up if you don't follow them to a T."
bad,The job itself was fun and tips were a plus but management was so unorganized and pre-occupied with their own whatever that no development occurred in my last  year working for this employer.
bad,Making the bread sticks and salad is what I did and I was getting less than ten hours per week. When I was there most of the management was pretty lax as long as your job was done. The staff were all fun and most were easy going. The hardest part of the job was the surprise parties of people that were of giant sizes coming in out of nowhere. The most enjoyable part of the job was most likely the people I got to work with.
bad,"Though sometimes things were out of order behind the scenes, it was pleasant in that I got a chance to serve the public.  That is something I truly have a heart for so that made it worth while for me above all else."
bad,"Having the opportunity to work for Darden allowed me to have a look at how fast-paced and stressful the restaurant environment can be for those in the service industry. Working at Olive Garden provided me with the opportunity to work with hard-working and seemingly friendly co-workers that take advantage of the obvious lack of leadership and management in that restaurant by stealing food, not showing up to work without warning and/or explanation, showing up to work late, getting into verbal/physical altercations, disrespecting managers, and not working while not being on a scheduled break. While I did enjoy working with most of my co-workers that I had the opportunity to meet, that was the only redeeming part of working in that restaurant. As a whole, working at Olive Garden was both stressful and frustrating. None of the managers at that store held either themselves and/or the employees accountable for any inappropriate behavior or wrongdoing that was going on in the restaurant. The employees, whether front of house or back of house took advantage of management's lack of leadership, which allowed them to behave and or perform however they liked, regardless of whether they were doing their jobs efficiently, correctly, or at all."
bad,"Did a lot of work, helped a lot of coworkers, you can do all the extra work you want, it won't be acknowledged. Managers are all on different pages and might not agree with each other, little room for advancement, and if there is, it takes YEARS of going above and beyond for a CHANCE of being recognized. Managers will push you to take as many tables as you can while still tending bar and making nothing besides hourly wage and tip share, which is still pretty low to begin with. Servers will not tip you out, will not help you, will still complain if you're swamped. Some managers will not know how to make the drinks to help you, and if they do, they're outdated recipies, so they only get in the way. There can be drama in the workplace, and managers will occasionally help, but they'll talk about it among other managers and coworkers they're friends with."
bad,Needed more hours  & asked to move to a host they said yes and never did it. If you were out for family problems or anything like that they expected you to bring a doctors note somehow
bad,"-minimal benefits provided to non-management "
bad,"Expectations of crew far exceed the standard for the industry. Business model seems to be built on taking advantage of staff by overworking them until they leave, and replacing them with fresh faces in a perpetual cycle. Approximately a third would not finish the mandatory 8-day training, and another third would usually be gone within a month. Within a year, probably 10% would still be around."
bad,"The customers are rude and the managers don't care if they want to throw hot soup in your face. The servers are overworked and underpaid. "
bad,"This company ethical standards are below mine, regarding food preparation and cleanliness. I only work there because I need the job and money to pay my bills."
bad,The staff are great people but the management is poor and unfair. The general manager is not very understanding and can be very rude to the staff as well.
bad,Darden is a great place for a young person to receive an opportunity but the job can be grueling at times.
bad,"Customer service skills acquired, entry level management skills and team building."
bad,"Too hectic, too little time to complete each task."
bad,Beautiful office building and large work spaces. Friendly co-workers. Found work responsibilities to be lacking and lack of direction from management. Would of liked to of had more project related work.
bad,"in my experience this job is not for someone who wants to get promoted or recognized for their hard work. however, this is a job for you if you want to sacrifice your dignity for unfair treatment, and if you are willing to let management take credit for your hard work in the end."
bad,"Nice place, no opportunity to make a liveable salary though. they will allow you to excel in your position for small amounts of money and then be unwilling or unable to pay the amount you deserve."
bad,Darden Restaurants was not a really good place to work because they were bad management. At Darden Restaurant I had to work longer hours then I applied for. The reason I left there is that I wanted to find a job I can work part-time and get good pay.
bad,This job you are able to transfer with. The hardest part is that the company is too corporate. Management structure is terrible. You can make a lot of money if you are in the right location. Do not work for Olive Garden.
good,It was a good place to start if you have never served before. I wouldn't want this to remain my permanent job there's a lot of work involved to make little amount of money.
good,"Had some great role models. Learned a lot during my tenure."
good,"Did not make enough money. Had to share tips on occasion. Two of the managers were constantly making fun of another of the managers speech impediment while they were talking with servers, cooks, bartenders, or out in front watching the televisions. It was very unprofessional."
good,"Well recognized employee who was retaliated against and terminated by a under developed management staff.  Calling attention to issues within the location caused trouble for me.  There was discrimination, harassment and retaliation and SVP level management and below were made well aware of the situation.  After eight years with no prior write up EVER I was documented for performance 9 times in a short amount of time for policies that other team members weren't written up for. They fought my unemployment and due to Nevadas misconduct definition being vague they won.  They settled out of Arbitration for what I considered a small fragment of what should have been awarded for what happened to me.  Its been a year and now I am back in Corporate America making six figures.  Jokes on them"
good,"I dont have much to say, this company has guidelines that only apply to certain people to their convenient. some managers are disrespectful and were always rude to the staff. I can go on and on but I, tired of talking negatively about this. Its not like me but I have had it with this company"
good,olive garden has no urgency to its employees as it makes everyone feel less important since there are so many employees you just feel like another one in the bunch
good,I washed dishes and sometimes worked in the front as busser.
good,"A typical day at Darden Red Lobster is generally slow unless it's Endless Shrimp season, in which case the wait to be seated begins around 11 AM and ends at 9 PM during the week, 11 PM weekends.  Management is scarce and unhelpful, much more interested in the happiness of guests, rather than the happiness or productiveness of employees.  Co-workers are helpful and friendly.  The hardest part of the job is the stress of the guests and demanding attitudes, and the most enjoyable part is the relationships with co-workers."
good,"You get great benefits working for this company but pay is not great for the bourse and the work life balance you get, their is none, working 55-65 hours a week."
good,The staff and management at this location Needs Improvement. There are many negative selfish individuals currently working at the Sugarland location.
good,its very stressful i just feel like i want to come to work and leave when i believe your job should be a place you love to come to
good,"There are great people to interact with in the work environment, some guests, and some employees. Management staff is not caring, not consistant, and not great to work with. Hardest part of the job was having to deal with the inconsistancies."
good,"Most of the time the job was great. The first GM I started under was AMAZING and I loved my job and working at Olive Garden. The tips were good and everyone was treated fairly. Schedules were fair, sections were fair and everyone made money. Then we got the new GM and EVERYTHING changed. She only put her friends and favorites in the best sections and best schedule and in positions that they didn't deserve or earn. It became so bad and so hard to make money there. It was ridiculous. Many of us left and found other jobs. It's a shame that some of the best servers in Tifton were forced to leave a great job over one management change."
good,Biggest thing is the managers at the restaurant level in general are very good.  I have been sincerely disappointed as soon as it goes higher than that.  Specifically the team writing
good,at first it was all work but when it was finally open and running they had hired to many people so work hours had to be cut down 40hrs a week to 15hrs a week
good,Its a great place for a college student. flexible schedule can pick up and drop shifts when you'd like. Very cut throat. a lot of corporate greed. Management needs more training
good,"They train well, you learn the basics of serving so it’s great if you want to advance to another restaurant. "
good,"I started working at Olive Garden while I was living in NY then I moved to Delaware, but when I transfered to Delaware the management team in Delaware was very bad, and also the restaurant conditions and equipment were way below standards."
good,"Stressful. management does not care about the servers, certain servers are shown favoritism and had to much control over other employees. they allowed employees to talk to each other like dogs and have terrible attitude using offensive language and violent tantrums without being reprimanded."
good,"Great staff, friendly college student aged staff. Management needs work. Tips are mediocre and good customers are hard to find lately."
good,I was a cetified Trainer and I was under a manager but over the other employees. I had to make sure that all of the host side work and duties were up tp par. It was very hard because no one did side work so I ended up doing it all my my self.
good,"Paid decently well but not many were. I was paid more an hour than some that were there longer but for how much over and beyond I went, I still deserved more. I cleaned places that had molded icecream scoops and tomato seeds caked on and after spending 30 minutes on my knees scrubbing while pregnant, I was accused and publically embarrassed for taking a bowl of $5 marinara sauce on my break by the General manager with not even a thank you for doing more than asked."
good,I'd love to learn new things and go far with the company and l would like to persist to help my coworker and I'd like to have more vision in my work l hope so
good,Overall the people & FOH & BOH were amazing to work with!!! The management sucks and make it a terrible place to work. If you want to make money it is a great place to work but the managers can make a good day go to a bad day. And a handful of coworkers were terrible as well because of their attitudes!!
good,No hay oportunidad de crecer. Deben estar más pendientes de sus trabajadores. Ofrecer beneficios
good,"I worked at Yard House and Bahama Breeze, both within the Darden Restaurants corporation. Yard House was amazing and well managed but Bahama Breeze was an entirely different story, you never knew what you were walking into."
good,"Overall, Darden is a good company lacking serious leadership.  GM's are not mature, nor or the other managers.  Bottom line is all that matters.  Hours worked do not."
good,overall good workplace. teaches multitasking and communication skills. Customer service is a must in this field of work. Everything is trained for you.
good,"Gather all knowledge and use it. Stay attentive to your guests, treat them like a family member you deeply love. They just want to feel at home. It's fast paced so watch and learn while retaining it all."
good,"Order accuracy and fast paced environment "
good,"Management is really incompetent. Always understaffed, and sometimes are forcing us to work 10+ hours with no breaks. Managers play favorites with other employees."
good,"The job is fairly easy, you get customer service and cash handling experience but the company does nothing when something happens to you. If you get your money stole you still owe the company from your own savings, they don't investigate your case or push the person who stole your money."
good,I loved it for the time I was there then it lead to being let go for not checking the ID of a 29 year old. days were busy and co workers were great!
good,"Now that they no longer own Red Lobster, I believe it will be a great company to work for. The company itself was great, but the Red Lobster employment experience I had was not."
good,I quit the job because the cut my hours down too much but other than that I like the job
good,"A typical day could be busy or slow. I preferred the handling the inbound phone calls to maintaining an assigned section (which was not easy)"
good,"I was a high school student that ran cross country in the fall season, so I had to leave my job as a hostess for Olive Garden. The managers at the time were very nice and understanding and told me I could come back after my sport was over. Well, I did just that and was back to work in November of 2018. Mind you I was still attending Peoria Notre Dame as a junior and the managers knew this, yet they kept scheduling me during school hours. After confronting them on multiple occasions about it I decided it was time for me to leave the job I enjoyed. I tried reaching out to them to put in my 2 weeks, but they didn't respond to email or when I called they put me on hold for a long time and eventually ended the call with no answer. Frustrated with the company I just never showed up for work, because education will always be way more important than a little part-time job."
good,"The company was great but the store was the WORST! From Day1 I was lied to by management about getting a better position then a year and a half later, 5 different managers and 2 GMs later no position and new GM complete monster so I left after talking to corporate and they backed up his bad attitude."
good,Darden I feel is a great company.  Cheddars was acquired by Darden 1-2 years ago and they have struggled with leadership in the environment of transitioning a Franchise Restaurant into a Corporate entity. The struggle has been features in the news. It is a challenging environment.
good,"Working at darden is good for young adults and servers straight out of highschool, not a lifelong career.  It is a good company for earning cash in  your pocket while you go to school."
good,"This is a place where if you work hard, with excellence and consistently, you can be promoted.  The problem is that the expectation of management regarding time spent in the workplace is brutal.  Regularly I worked 12-15 hour days, usually over 60 hours a week.  That is just kind of the expectation in food service."
good,"I enjoyed my staff and the food, but when it came down to the management it was completely chaotic. I couldn’t have a consistent schedule and many times ended up working 52 or more hours even when I was 8 months pregnant."
good,"If you're forced to be less than 40 hours a week, which everyone but managers are...no benefits, no vacation, no raises and no cares are given. Wasted 10 years with that company as non management. On the other hand,  it looks like they take great care of the management staff."
good,Darden is a company that is extremely difficult to work for.  Constant change leads to inconsistencies.  The pressure on the position I held was intense.
good,Working for Darden has been an average experience. Management is often difficult to work with and go against the best interest of their employees. Training is very thorough and staff is well informed.
good,"We have a great staff, with the occasional bad seed that gets weeded out fairly quick. However, management is extremely lazy, imcompetent, and poorly trained. In my personal experience, your attempts to go higher than your store's GM is pretty impossible. Nothing is ever done about these growing problems, and the unorganized cycle goes around and around. "
good,They recently instituted a policy where low server ratings on our Ziosk will result in less tables during a work shift. The argument is that it will give the servers more time per table but this is not true. All it does is lower the income you could make in a shift.
good,"Good place to work, maybe for a summer job but don't try and make a career out of it. I was hired in high school to work part time and stayed there seven years which was a terrible decision. The management is bad, the benefits aren't great, you work very hard for a decent amount of money and it is also very hard to move up and be promoted."
good,"A typical day at work included, greeting every guest, using proper rotation to figure out the perfect seat and the perfect server for the guest. Walk the guest to their table with the proper items (menus, silverware, and necessary kids menus) when guest is sat, explaining the ziosk menus and repeating with each guest. A typical day also includes side work such as cleaning bathroom, sweeping foyer, cleaning ziosks and emptying ashtrays."
good,"A typical day starts very early and seems to never end, very long hours not a lot of life outside of work.  I did learn a lot and become FoodSafe certified"
good,"Good company, with great managers just needs to modernize many things about this concept in order to survive in this market."
good,"I like some things about DARDEN, and others I do not. I feel as if their employees work hard, and still get treated like gum on the bottom of their shoes. If they could treat their employees better, then they would get an A+ from me."
good,"While it's possible to endeavor to advance through the company (something I know little about), the restaurant industry makes it a bit tricky (not just Darden). Not much different in the negatives; little care about employees as people and a little too much blatant disregard at times. Still, it all depends on the current team, management and otherwise, and the schedule flexibility can't be beat so far. It helped me get both my bachelor's and master's."
good,if your a prep cook and your used to working days you can toss that out the window they promise you day time but i work mostly nights and they don't really care about what your life entails  its all about the customer so if your looking for a set schedule not the place to work
good,It was a long 6.5 years and had a lot to great I fluences and experiences as the lead cook. My pregnancy took priority and so I chose another rewarding path after I decided to resign.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with people and making them smile. It is very stressful being a server at times, and the hours aren't ideal (either lunch 10:45-5:00) or dinner (4:00-10:00) are available. Working dinner shifts on the weekend is where the money is. I'd average around $115 working a 4:45-10:00 pm Friday night shift."
good,"Not pleased with new management  and General Manager.  Don't hold people accountable for actions, And give too many exceptions to the rules. Short staffed so they dont let bad staff go. Overwork good staff eith no appreciation."
good,"A typical day as a server can be both stressful yet extremely rewarding. As a server, I have learned to communicate effectively with other individuals to allow them the best dining experience I can offer. Being a server is a very quick paced job that forces any employee to become a professional in multitasking. Serving has taught me to remain calm under any situation."
good,You are not guaranteed a certain amount of money you are going to make but that comes with the job. some days are slower than others. I feel like at times management places blame on employees when the problems lay with them.
good,"Never being the one to jump into drama, i kept my head down and did my job. Staff, especially managers, were constantly changing due to in house disputes. Ended up leaving in order to attend college."
good,"Olive Garden/Darden was a great transitions place for me.  When I was transitioning from an office job, I applied at OG and worked long enough (one year) for a transfer to my current city.  The managers were great working with me during my transfer and also with my schedule."
good,"A typical day at work was always exciting and fresh "
good,I honestly loved working here it was so fun because I felt like I was working with my friends. You just grow as a family. However managers can be rude and insensitive. The management is always changing. the money was not that great. They did work with school schedule but that's it. They write you up for anything even if its out of your control.
good,"The management at Olive Garden is horrible there are people there who need that job but dont care they will cut your hours without notice , dont get me wrong some managers there are wonderful but some just like to micromanage."
good,"I thought this would have been a good job for me, but it wasn't. It was a good job at first since it was my first job, but now that I'm graduated high school I want something more beneficial. I want to make more money and get more hours and work longer shifts. I would just walk in, managers would start yelling and complaining to me for no reason. Only a couple managers I actually liked. Only a couple associates I liked. People were always trying to ask to take my shift. I have bills to pay too. It was alright whenever we got busy. They changed the rules and since I'm currently still a host there, there can only be one host working Monday-Friday."
good,The company changed their focus from quality to quantity and it showed. Not making product in house anymore everything was outsourced. Focus was not longer on guests but now saving labor and lowering costs.
good,"You build up a clientele throughout the years as I have.  You meet great people as you grow with the company.  I've had opportunities to move up the ladder but declined because the cons just outweighed the pros as far as being a manager.  With corporate restaurants like Longhorn, you are constantly fighting for your job even when you are a seasoned vet.  You would think the company and your superiors would have your back but I found out the hard way even after 10+ years."
good,The hours are not concretely established. The pay is very inconsistent and you must depend on tips of customers.
good,"Hired as an MIT in the York Red Lobster and was rated highly successful in the 3 positions of management for almost 6 years.  Promoted to General Manager of the King of Prussia Red Lobster in May 2004.  Lead the culture and environment to help in the performing to the first year ever of increased sales and guest count in my third year there. Was rated the best in the company in crew satisfaction and achieved the highest in guest satisfaction in the Big East prior to moving back to the York Red Lobster.  Rebuilt their culture and environment to where it is today in almost making a record Million dollars in earnings last year."
good,Multi-tasking from top to bottom
good,"This was a contract position. Overall there was decent pay, but no benefits and the position was repetitive."
good,"Love my job for the most part. Great money, fabulous guests, amazing steaks and the best coworkers ever......"
good,"Olive garden is a decent place to work at,sometimes it is high paced as well  as slow paced but if you get in with the mind set to make money ypu should make a lil something perhaps better money in the afternoon shifts"
good,Get out while you can! It's a stress nightmare! Horrible regulars come weekly and don't tip and you have to run for your life with all the unlimited refills! It's a joke.
good,"Easy overall, but you definitely have to put in more work than what you’ll be paid, you are required to help all other servers you are working with while waiting on your own (maximum 3) tables. Having this maximum table stipulation keeps you from making the maximum amount of money as a server. There are on average of 20 servers at a time working, making the workspace crowded and overwhelming at times."
good,"If you must work in a corporate environment, then Darden Restaurants is a good place to work. They invest a decent amount into employee training and activities."
good,"I was transferred into a massively under-performing restaurant. This did mean I needed to initiate disciplinary action with several under-performing team members. After doing this, those select team members banded together to corroborate a false accusation that led to my termination. My superiors did not support me and I was let go from the company with no proof of wrong doing, just the words of these handful of employees whom I had taken disciplinary action against. After 10 years with Darden I was fired for doing the job I was expected to do."
good,It's a job so I can't complain. I have been looking for other places to work since I started there. Mangement tend to over staff. So it is very difficult to make good money.
good,"clean/bus tables, run food, cash drawer daily, clean micros, and dining areas, help patrons. Plenty of work culture, when you don't have the assistance you need from others. Best to work with great patrons and employees."
good,"Managers make promises of your advancement to get you to do more and then turn around and hand the promotion to someone else "
good,There are many systems in place with policies and procedures ;but not genuine follow through on development.  Very difficult to be successful without the support system in place.
good,This is a great place to gain some customer service experience because of the multitude of personalities that you have to deal with. I worked at Red Lobster and the location had horrible customers.
good,overall is a good place to work. I enjoy serving customer and giving them the best dining experience. Management should be a little more understanding and open minded
good,"As a to go specialist you do everything, stock and make breadsticks, soup, salads, on top of trying to do your own job, taking orders and preparing for pick ups, stocking the alley with to go containers soup bowls, croutons, dressings, grapes, cheese, etc.. "
good,I enjoy the guest service industry. Every day is different and sometimes a challenge. The money is quick and easy. You can pick up shifts that are posted by other employees that need to give thier shifts up.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and you need to have good organizational skills. I learned to enhance my multi-tasking skills. Management is pretty fair, but sometimes when you need help they take awhile to help you.  Workplace culture is great, Everyone is friendly and willing to help out.  The hardest part of the job are the difficult guests, some can get real nasty. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a guest tells you that you were the best server that they have ever had."
good,"Excellent money, very hard work late hours, early mornings, very busy shifts. You have to be able to handle very stressful situation and customers everyday."
good,Worked for company for 7 years.Had a lot of new friends and family added because of position. Was able to move quickly into position that I was comfortable in and excelled in as well.
good,This place is great if you fit into their little click that they have. If you don't fit into what they want or you're a little different you'll never get promoted and they will find ways to get you out. They will write you up for something and if that would happen to someone in their crew that they like the look the other way and not write that person up. I thought all clicks orgone in high school but Darden Restaurants or Yard House that is a part of their culture. They want to know about every part of your life but then if you tell them they use it against you. The management is a joke at best
good,I was not getting the hours I needed and the pay was very minimal. I felt that some employees I worked with were not very friendly. The managers were very nice an caring.
good,"A typical day at work depends on what shift you are working. AM shifts are usually easier, but you make less. PM shifts take a bit more out of you, but they are worth the money. I've learned a lot from this job, especially how to properly treat someone coming into your restaurant. Management switches around a lot at this particular store, or it might be company wide. As soon as your schedule starts to make sense and you feel like everyone is working together as a team, a manager will be transferred or switched out. The hardest part of this job is teamwork. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to be personable with the people you are serving."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my experience at Bahama Breeze Restaurant. I am a great fit for the server position due to my great social and communication skills. I enjoyed the company of my co-workers who appreciated me lending a hand whenever they needed. The management was sub-par. Most of my difficult situations could be directly associated with a lack of proper management. I rarely point fingers but there are some tasks that cannot be effectively handled without a quality manager. Aside from that, developing relationships with frequent guest made the experience worth it. I felt appreciated by those who mattered. Considering tips were my wages, the guests seemed to compensate me highly."
good,"Day consists pretty much of same routine, so didn't get to learn more other than the same thing. Management was pretty nasty towards employees, showed no compassion or thank full of ones work integrity. Co-workers were always great and had positive mindset! There really is not anything hard to this job, just easy and straight forward. The most enjoyable part of work was communication within team excluding management."
good,One on one with the quest allows your inner service skills come to light. High Volume environment takes away from the guest experience.
good,"Opening, closing the builiding, reading/responding to email's, reading guest satisfaction reports, scheduling for the day, counting inventory for prep lists, opening/closing cleaning duties, safety standards, motivate employees, setup cash register for the day, reviewing productivity of employees, trash removal, maintenance of the building/parking lot, opening the doors for guests, employee's in position, food prep ready and safety/sanitation standards are met, dailiy line checks, bar checks, make sure all employees arrive for shift and make changes as necessary, call guests who experienced poor service, conduct daily meeting for every employee, stop by all guests in restaurant throughout the shifts, working 10-12 hours per shift, make sure all reviews are updated and inputted into the computer, look for new applicants on the talent aquisition program and call to set up interviews, resolve any issues with food prep/guest experiences, conduct daily cash drop/pickups per shift, line check again after lunch, check food prep is on track/finished, recieve deliveries such as liquor, beer, wine, produce, food, paper goods, linen, setup next shift for next manager, work many shifts as the only manager on duty, step in where needed whether it's serving, cooking, hosting, dishwashing, bussing, bartending, expoing."
good,"  I enjoyed the ""self-starter"" atmosphere. Very fast paced high demand job."
good,The hours restaurant managers are expected to work are quite long usually coming out to 11-12 a day.  You will be expected to remain reachable even on days off or vacations.
good,"Coworkers are amazing! I’ve made so many good friends. Everyone is really helpful and nice. Great place to work if you want great people to work with. Management, however, sucks really bad. They don’t care about what you’re going through in your personal life. They don’t respect you. They look at you as replaceable. They will just scream at you over the smallest stuff that doesn’t even matter when there’s actual problems that need to be dealt with. Customers can  be rude and needy but that’s part of serving anywhere I think. Expect to always be on your feet, you will rarely have time for a bathroom break. Especially on weekends and holidays."
good,"this is my first restaurant and i really enjoy it but after a while, it becomes draining constanly having to tend to hungry people. also, the fast pace environment isnt for everyone so choose wisely with this job."
good,A typical day at this job was very fast and frustrating. You would have to deal with angry people all the time. The management would come out to help every so often but not a lot. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with some of my co- workers.
good,"I worked at Olive Garden for just under 6 months when I first started working there I was told Most Bussers quit after roughly 2 months but I didn't understand why but after the 2 months completely understood why. When I was hired in April of 2019 there were only 3 actively working bussers including myself and I asked management if they would like any new bussers and or hosts I was told they definitely wanted more staff members for all positions. I then had 3 people I knew looking for jobs hired on one host and 2 bussers making our bussing staff the perfect amount of people for us all to get great hours and make plenty of money. Then not much later another busser was hired affecting all of our hours( mine especially cutting them in half). I then complained to management about this and they said we needed more bussers, but because bussers are paid $5 an hour then tipped out by servers and their sales we now had to split the money a third way on some nights greatly affecting my paychecks, 2 more months went by and 3 more bussers were hired and that for me was the last straw I love everyone there even the managers, but 2 out of 4 of them are extremely illogical. I started off making $12-15 an hour after all the new hires I was making only $9.50-$11.00( hosts made $10 an hour with have the responsibilities/closing duties ). I was fed up and decided it was time for me to leave. On a good note great first job for teens, but don't expect to be respected in the way you deserve no matter age or position."
good,The best perk of working for Darden is the Discount. Your discount is valid at any 0f Darden's Restaurants no matter the position you have. As a server you can count on the volume of tables.
good,If you do not have plans on becoming management then the serving aspect is almost not worth it outside of just the need for a job/money. I did not feel completely comfortable there even though I was a strong and accountable employee. So unless you have plans on moving up the chain I would only consider it as a part time situation.
good,"Work was easy. The other people were nice most of the time and the managers were nice to work with, but as a busser I felt stressed alot by the pressure. I worked in a Cheddars."
good,Most days as utility consist of washing dishes and garbage duty. Every now and then though there are odd tasks that we take cleaning around the restaurant. Very quick-paced job that can be demanding at times especially during the holidays.
good,Sometimes the day can be slow and wont make much money but other days are different. The different days can be fast paced and you can make a decent earning.
good,"love to go back to olive garden if opetunitie come "
good,The job was demanding considering I worked in the kitchen as a line cook with others who were not as qualified to do their jobs so I had to pick up their slack. The pay was good and so was the benefits.
good,"If it was busy, it'd be a great day. If its slow, it's really slow and you'd make at least $3 an hour. Management needs lots of help, in every department."
good,I was a host and a waiter at Olive Garden while I was also working another job. Their scheduling was pretty flexible and they were a good company to work for.
good,"It's ok, get used to working long hours.  Bad days and good days.  At the end of the day it's a job. It's not that they don't provide you with some things but depending on your location really determines your experience."
good,This place is very high pace and requires a lot of energy and flexibility with your schedule. No required schedule for lunches they just tell you to go when they think its an appropriate time. no bueno. temporary job.
good,Good place to work on good day! Servers are lazy. Management doesn't protect workers from upper management. Manager leave back of house short staffed and expect us to pick up the slack
good,"This was a wonderful learning experience for me.  I had the opportunity to manage a large staff, in a high-volume, high sales environment.  It was a performance based company so it really made to ""push"" to be better every day."
good,"Very stressful, customer service jobs often are, but you get to know alot about people and what pleases them."
good,It's a great job to have in college or to make a career. You can actually move up in the chain I went from host to busser to cook before I left. You can mover wherever you want and make it to management without college exp. just have to put in the work
good,It was very fun to work there. The management staff is a little wishy washy and you can get different answers from different people. I liked talking to customers and getting to know people. You certainly make life long friends at any restaurant environment.
good,"This once excellent company is going down the drain fast."
good,"Does not care about employees, do not get breaks, changes management all the time. There is a lot of favoritism. Do not expect to eat all day."
good,"The overall experience was educational as it showed me exactly what sort of job I did not want, and what poor management looked like in a restaurant space."
good,"nice company"
good,Was at one time a great place to work. With changes at the upper levels it has really become just a mere step above a drive through.
good,Most important thing about this job is making sure the kids are safe!
good,Good company for starting your career. Get the experience and then go get paid somewhere else. Pay is below industry standards.
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is when the customers are happy.  It's hard providing exceptional customer service when customers are just rude.  For the most part management is good however some can work on how they communicate with employees.
good,I was a server at Olive Garden for about 6 months. I quickly learned that the food industry isn't my favorite but I did enjoy being able to meet different customers on a daily basis. The workplace was definitely fast paced as we had to serve customers constantly and in a timely manner. The hardest part about my job was having to serve customers that weren't always the nicest but it also taught me to have patience and to keep moving. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people through work that made it a lot easier.
good,"I do not know, working in this industry made me miserable. do no want to come barck to work here, did not like, I do now know hoh I manage to work here for 5 years"
good,"Very fast paced environment, can get a little stressful when busy. Overall management was decent, and pretty good with flexibility and time off requests."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of  me prepping food portions every morning, then work on the cook line for few hrs, then work the dishwasher before leaving ."
good,Managers are consistently stabbing each other in the back.  Normal Crew members are great and enthusiastic.  Great Pay and Benefits with lack of compassion for normal everyday
good,"I liked working there , but the management was bad and there was lots of thinks they didn’t do that they could have. I also liked the work experience from that."
good,Darden is a good company to work with in a long run. They make sure you’re taken care of. They prioritize on working together and making sure your customers are satisfied.
good,"From the moment I transferred to the New Braunfels locations it was a mess. The GM forgot to tell the scheduling manager about my transfer and I went nearly two weeks without a shift. The managers were never on par with each other. Not enough kitchen staff, the wait for food was often very long. Certain servers were catered toomore than others due to favoritism amongst the managers. Overall a very bad serving experience."
good,It isn’t my favorite job of all time but it is probably one of the highest paying jobs around so I’ll probably stick to it for the remainder of college
good,"Food is good, wait time on food can be long at times.  Staff can be very friendly.   Hostesses are great at helping.   Bathrooms are clean.  Nice place to eat."
good,"A fast paced friendly place to work. Good management, good food, friendly and well serviced. I would recommend to a friend to apply as a career. Their programs are good."
good,Great job and great pay. Lots of friends with productive ideas. I love the friends i made in OG but the bad managment really gave everyone a bad taste.
good,"You're working at a restaurant, either cooking or customer facing. The job itself isn't hard, the only problem is dealing with needy customers. "
good,"Manage the operation of the Dietary Department to include staffing, food ordering and preparation, food delivery, food safety and sanitation in accordance with facility policies, physician orders, and resident care plans.  Assure that quality nutritional services are provided on a daily basis.  Operate in accordance with current federal, state, and local guidelines and regulations governing the facility."
good,Too cooperate of an atmosphere for me to enjoy working there any longer. Serving tables is not fun work and people get stuck doing it forever. it sucks bad
good,"Good, faced pace. The best part of the job was my team.  The guest came second to me.  Taking care of my team was the most important thing.  By doing that the guest would be taken care of."
good,there has been a big change at olive garden past six months all the preivous mangers were fired for lack of interity and new mangement isnt there transfers from other darden resturants to hold down fort its very unoriganised and hard to work for now i am very esperienced and ask for a chance to do my skills thank you
good,"Fun workplace "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of being assigned to either the front or the back since those are the two parts to the to-go department. I learned excellents customer service skills and how to satisfy an array of people. The management was a bit scattered and always dysfunctional, but together enough to keep things running somewhat smoothly."
good,"Good crew,  consistent rules and management, nice location. Many many regulars in his store that was inviting and good to see people coming back over and over"
good,"Typical Chain restaurant.  A lot of frozen food.  Structured management where everything come from above, no own ideas, everything must be approved. OK place to work"
good,family oriented restaurant. it was a fun place to work. it just truly depended on which location you worked at. tips from clientel was very iffy most days
good,It was very slow during the week. The hours were not very good. They say you make too share but you never really make over miniumum wage which is fine but you don’t make more than 7.25 on average
good,"Darden/Olive Garden was my 2nd home for 8 years of my young adulthood. I will always look at my time spend there fondly, but in reality it was full of drama and drinking too much. I would not recommend this restaurant or any to be someone long term employment plan."
good,"Darden as a company does an amazing job. I worked in multiple cities, and in my most recent location, the management was terrible, the restaurant was always behind, and little to no effort is given to the guests, or to the employees for that matter... It is easily the worst location I've ever had to work for."
good,Another great job for a college student. I worked as a server after studying abroad in China and was compensated very fairly for the work put in. Three table max.
good,"Not an overall bad place to work, pretty good company and benefits but once you get into management there is a poor work life balance and have to work on all holidays pretty much"
good,Made OK money. serving was better than cooking. cooks get used and abused while servers make bank. Really though if you need a job right now a darden restaurant will take just about anyone
good,"Excellent Company.  Management over works employees with long hard hours,  They would do a lot better in my opinion if they would not work employees until they were exhausted"
good,"Good to make money, but not tightly ran. Worried about too many little problems instead of identifying the larger issues at hand."
good,It was ok if you like making cash.Alot of work but was fun meeting new people. Too much to remember but you would eventually catch on...............................
good,"I wasn't a huge fan of management. I felt there was a lot of miscommunication and when asking a manager a question, one would say one thing  and another would say something entirely different. There wasn't much structure and communication between the various levels of employees was very poor."
good,"I have more than 19 years experience working in highly accredited and volume concepts, willing to learn new systems and share my experience with other managers alike. I always go above and beyond and treat my peers with humility and respect."
good,"Easy cash that day type of job.  My managers were amazing until the Area Manager decided to separate them all to help out other locations, which in return gave us underperforming managers; including an incompetent General Manager.  When this occurred, half our staff quit or put in their two-weeks."
good,"Some of the customers at the High Point location don't tip well or at all, even when great customer service has been provided. I'm not sure if they are aware that servers make $2.13/hr and have to tip out 2% of the cost of each tables meal back to the restaurant. So when you don't tip at all the servers have lost money, and essentially paid the restaurant for you to have a meal there."
good,Good company to work for at the time. Focus was on development of employees and satisfaction of its guests.There was a chance for growth and development.
good,I like the job very much but i think it's time to grow and search else where. The company is very lenient which is awesome but sometimes you work very hard and the clients/guests aren't to fond of the tipping service. Majority of us servers are actually living primarily off of our tips so it's hard to make a living.
good,Cannot live off of the daily money production tips do not pay the basic bills. Need higher paying job to survive or I will die. Most basic jobs will not cover basic bills...........
good,"I love working for Olive Garden, good training, fantastic food, poor management but for the most part, it was a fun place to work when I was in College"
good,Great Company. Lots of opportunity for hourly team members to advance into management positions. Great culture and a fun environment to work in. I would recommend!
good,"Good workplace.  Enjoyed time there, made decent money and management was steady.  Restaurant ran well compared to other corporate workplaces.  Overall a good experience."
good,"Typical day was way to repetitious."
good,"Fast paced and interactive environment. Supportive management. You are on your feet for multiple hours at a time, usually in 4-6 hour shifts. If working two shifts you get are clocked out at the 4 hour mark and then will come back an hour or two later as needed."
good,Always a manager there to contact when an employee is in need. Always business there to engage with. Great advertising through the media.
good,"Started as dishwasher and worked up to line and prep cook, pastry chef, and host."
good,I was new to the area and gained a lot of friends while employed with this company.  People were very welcoming.  My co workers were welcoming and they were great team players.
good,"A fair, albeit complex job as server.  There are many standards to practice that can handily carry-over to other restaurants."
good,A typical day begins with many greetings to employees who are getting ready to end or begin their shifts. The day always begins with checking areas to make sure that the building and restaurant meets standards that are safe for patrons and staff. I learned alot about handling situations in a calm quick manner under extreme pressure.
good,"When I started at olive garden it was great over the years the management changed a lot immature, no communication' and irresponsible"
good,It was an nice environment to work in. The people were nice. I enjoyed working with others and also working hands on. I learned a few techniques about different dishes.
good,"Darden is a company that has been consistent to change and improve their practices as the market demands it. They're focused on delivering great service and have a plan to do so. However with the staff they continuously hire in they will not be able to implement this successfully. The buy in that they have is not there from their employees and their management  staff is not willing to step up and have it addressed immediately. The management staff needs to be leaders and support through recognition, coaching and development."
good,Fast paced restaurant that focuses mainly on the customer. Employees aren't always necessarily treated fairly and management is poor.
good,"Never really took care of their employees, but the benefits were good.  Some of the managers did their best for the employees but they were hand tied by the company."
good,I've worked in the restaurant business for Darden Restaurants for at least two and a half years. It can really be a very good chance to make good money fast and very healthy relationships can be made there. Everything else about it seems random and unorganized.
good,"Greeting guest with a smile, and being their verbal menu at times.  Explaining promotional items using words that will tantalize their taste buds.  Careing for the needs of the guest during their dining experience; refilling drinks, delivering quality service that they can taste touch and feel. Hardest part of the job is having to put a smile on your face after receving or not receiving sufficient funds for your service.  The most enjoyable part would be those guest that really allow you ""dine"" with them by sharing why they came to eat, and allowing you to make it the best."
good,Great environment to visit and well prepared meals provided on a daily basis. Clean and well organized with good staff.
good,Management at this location had some issues but overall Darden Corp. Is An excellent Company. Benefits are really good with ample chance to mive up.
good,Typical day you can work multiple stations that requires strong communication and a strong sense manual dexterity to complete the task at hand.
good,Working for Darden was a positive and rewarding experience. Opportunity for growth within the company is always available to hard-working and committed individuals.
good,"Pay their workers very well from my experience, but with multiple layoffs in just the one year I have been here job security is lacking."
good,"The guest always comes first. That said, meeting different people every day along with the same each day is a diverse yet familiar experience."
good,Really worth while working for them. Managers were not good
good,"I've learned about running a corporate high-volume restaurant and everything that is included.  I've been responsible for food counts, and ordering, as well as scheduling of employees. The management is fair, however is very fluid and often inconsistent."
good,"I trained servers  and served food drinks and deserts as well. I handled cash, customer service and data entry"
good,Management does not work together and they pick favorites. Once you look past that as a server you make pretty good money especially on the weekends. Co-workers are great too still in contact with them.
good,Good company to work with and would love to work with the corporate office one day.
good,I enjoyed the company and the fast pace of food service with a slow family feel to it!
good,Enjoyed my time at Olive Garden!  There was  a chance for advancement and great managers!
good,Good place to work with great benefits need some fine tuning on the work life balance.
good,"Every day at work is a new experience and you never know what obstcales you might be met with. It's a great job for a young person going to college to make extra money. In my time being employed there I learned how to be more disciplined with money since I handle cash on a daily basis and to exercise control with spending in my own life. The most enjoyable part of working as a server is the people interaction you get to meet someone new every day. The hardest part is the physical labor, over time it tends to run your body down the hours can tend to be very inconsistant as well as the amount of money you make and it also has an effect on your sleep schedule."
good,Your income is based on your performance. Be a good server and make good money.
good,"Military is what you'd think. Exercise, grunt work, odd hours, extended travel from home."
good,"very flexable, fast paced, easy job if your out going and confident."
good,Marketing driven concept. Employees have control. Quality of life is fair and reasonable.
good,"Learned invaluable customer service skills, where i ensured the guest food was always hot and their drink where always refilled. Enjoying company of the customers was the best part of the job"
good,"The hours were very flexible and easily switched amongst coworkers. Coworker interactions were mostly positive, making it a relatively enjoyable place to work. The only issues I found were with management; lack of communication, lack of organization and favoritism."
good,"Easy job, with flexible hours. Managers help you out as well. "
good,"Working for Darden Restaurants was a good first job to understand the working world. It is fun and gives you the opportunity to meet many new people whether it be coworkers or guests that come in. Although it is fun, it is physically taxing on the body. It is tiring work and extremely stressful."
good,They were extremely accommodating to all my family needs and willing to bend for me. Management really does take your request into consideration. A great environment and work place.
good,It was a learning experience. Very classy place to work you would think. Management is very careless. I loved doing my job everyday tho. Customers were always friendly
good,"Most like any serving, there are good and bad days. Management has changed a lot, and everyday is face-paced and different. Employees come and go quickly sometimes. The flexibility is great, and the current management is the best it has been in two years. I enjoy my job overall, but everyday offers a change in dynamic. Money is low given the amount of work you have to do, but it is consistent."
good,"You're whole life is this job. Constant communication from co-workers on your days off. Advancement opportunities are there if you want to stay in restaurant management. Supervisors are very supportive. Only advancement into corporate positions are in Orlando, FL."
good,"They are a growing company and offer great support to all of their locations. We have a high end and loyal clientele.I a have multiple roles as a Sales manager and Service Manager. It's difficult to have a work and home life balance. I think that certain days, I am not set up for success with not enough management support."
good,"While working at the Olive Garden, I was able to learn from some very experienced, caring managers. The general manager believed in his employees and wanted to see them advance into successful careers, even if they weren't with the company."
good,"corporate style restaurant that had cookie-cutter expectations, good training, but poor employee care. definitely felt like just another number, and did not feel appreciated by the company."
good,"Great place to work, a lot of different positions of advancement, very stressful new company to the West Haven’t established a good business relationship with community or other businesses"
good,The company focus is to deliver a hot piping food at the highest quality to the guest to achieve 100% guest satisfaction. It is a fast pace environment where cross training comes in handy to perform at the highes level.
good,Good work environment but benefits are expensive and there isn't much room to advance. Scheduling is flexible but not enough hours. Full time only for management.
good,"There are too many ""smoke stack"" motivations by departments.  Separate teams work well within the team but not well with each other."
good,"Working at Longhorn as a line cook I thoroughly enjoyed most of the people I worked with. The crew was amazing and it really did feel like a family. The crew environment really made me want to come to work. "
good,As more business must focus on stock holders and bottom line... companies are more immediate profit driven.  There are still super parts of the company to work for and great operations leaders that develop and mentor.
good,"Great systems, top of the line restaurant technology and market knowledge.  Great experience working for one of the largest restaurant companies in the world.  I enjoyed most developing employees into great managers.  The hardest part of the job, was when politics got in the way of pure hospitality."
good,Great company to work for. Flexible work schedules and great for students working and going to school. Great management. lack of growth in the workplace and in some area's there is a lack of diversity. Great employee discounts and great employees stock purchase plan.
good,"challenging work arena where balance is necessary to be successful, it a very driven by the numbers environment and considered to be a sales job by upper management."
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people and connecting with them. The regular guests are like family to me now. Being able to coach the employees, increase guest counts, and decrease food waste was challenging and fun at the same time. Everyday was different and that is what made work enjoyable."
good,"Good company to work for, but a typical restaurant.  There was not much room to promote and the management were hard to have a conversation with.  They were not very accessible.  I did enjoy paid vacation which they took away from the new hires."
good,"I have been employed with this company for a while and really the only complaint I have is all the managers toe the company very closely, there is no room for interpretation on the rules."
good,"Darden is in every market and now only has room to grow INTL. This means for all you servers, bussers, hosts and cooks that they will now find a way to become more efficient and grow sales in each of their existing locations. In states that the server min wage is low, managers will cut more expensive kitchen staff, and bussers and ask servers to do more side work in the kitchen and at your tables. Out of the three restaurants that I have worked for (California Pizza Kitchen, Outback Steakhouse & Red Lobster) you will be better off going to CPK or Outback. They provide a positive  fun environment and FANTASTIC management. "
good,Great company if you like operations. Difficult to get out of operations if you didnt start out as a Darden employee and was a RARE Hospitality before.
good,Good place to work at in the beginning but there was a big downside when it came to managment.
good,It used to be great years ago for an employee. But the Chief Officers became greedy. Vacation pay requirements changed. Some positions were getting paid less than before. It's still ok for certain positions.
good,I always end up learning something new they always make sure your doing your job right and making sure everyone is productive and always working and push you to your best abilities
good,"there are some managers that get frustrated when you ask a simple question which is pretty frustrating but usually, everything is pretty chill. you must be able to multitask or else you're going to be really behind. honestly, a lot of people including servers, hosts, and dishwashers don't like working there and are constantly complaining about managers. it's very negative feedback from almost every server. and pay is usually pretty low."
good,Good company to work for. Red Lobster and Olive Garden. Good benefits. Not enough tips with Olive Garden because of the 3 table sections only. Good people to eork with.
good,I loved the people I worked my but i can't live off the money I'm making I had to take orders and clean tables and cash people out I had side work and had to make sure the guess had wat they needed
good,our management team worked really well and our head manager immediately when placing into the position he was in laid out his guidelines and expectations so it is known what you are expected and if you follow what you are supposed to do you are respected and treated well.
good,"A typical day working for Darden Restaurants was seeing to the day to day operations. I was in charge of staffing, scheduling, inventory, bank deposits, petty cash, and training of new employees just to name a few of my responsibilities. I enjoyed the stability of my salary but it was a very demanding job."
good,I Had the pleasure of working with great staff member and managers. overall it was a friendly environment while and temporary job while I got my degree.
good,"Overwhelming & Stressful. "
good,"The matriarch of the restaurant makes it a fun, friendly place to work."
good,"I come in and to work and it`s relaxed and I start off with my responsibility's at the proper pace to do the job right in a relaxed manner and I have learned how to maintain things in a proper way, management is good. the pace can be very fast pace."
good,The general manager at the time I was there was very rude but other than that the employees were very nice and supportive. So yea... that's about it really
good,"The job pays the bills. Its more built on location. Hard to make connections depending where you are, but I do love the people I work with. The job itself...it gets old after five years is what Ill say."
good,"Great Job security they are always busy, they hire great people. very hard to get terminated. bonus system is now terrible."
good,"Worked here for 2.5 years and have been through THIRTEEN different managers. This only includes those who stayed long enough to have a business card."
good,I feel that my skills are not being properly utilized in this position. I also don't feel that I am being seen as having any skills.
good,I have worked at Darden for 13 1/2 years and held several positions within the company. Throughout the years I have worked with some really awesome people.
good,"Promoted progressively and guaranteed consistent planning, production, preparation, and prompt delivery of hot food, and foster energy, teamwork, and excitement within the kitchen to ensure excellent food taste, quality/brand control and temperature ratings."
good,Long shifts dealin with high volume casual diners and seemingly endless paperwork. One of the best places to work if you want to truly be an effective Food and Beverage Manager.
good,It’s was a good job because I gain more experience in my life that can actually help me out in the future.But it need to be more organized and needs help with working as a team in the whole restaurant not just the cooks.
good,"Structurally, management had his and downs. Competitively, everything was downhill from there. Mission oriented, there were some great apples. adaptable to change, not even. Ability to stick to recipe guidelines.... Awesome. Flexibility to changes in schedule and work load... Superb."
good,"It’s a good job if you have the right attitude for it. The workers were cool it was kind of like a family, our slogan is “we’re all family here”. I know multiple people worked there for years so that should tell you something"
good,Love the managment and the work environment... Dislike salary and lack of benefits.  No vacation or sick pay.  They do however offer flexible schedule to work around other obligations.  Manager really care about there staff.
good,"A typical day started out with a ""talk-in"" basically the manager would let us know if we were out of any items that day and what section we were in and who our service partners were. Normally there is a lunch/dinner rush. Soon it slows down and thats when they would cut the doubles. Almost everyone got along and would hangout outside of work. Hardest part of the job was giving great service, racking up a check to over 100 dollars and not getting tipped at all. The most enjoyable part was working with friends and not having any side work."
good,"Working at Olive Garden was challenging when we'd be on a wait, with a full section, and managers hounding you to get side work finished or run someone else's food. Money was good if you were willing to work for it."
good,"Working for Darren restaurants was a great experience "
good,"A typical day at work consist of clocking in greeting tables, selling certain items on the menu such as wine to maintain a certain server rating which is important for promotions and weekly performance skills in the restaurant."
good,"On a typical work day, the flow of traffic fluctuates. Would go hours with very few visitors to having to put people on a wait."
good,"A typical day was made up of serving guest, taking orders, running food, and providing friendly service. the management group was friendly yet maintained authority."
good,everything was good. everybody had their own job duties or tasks. everyone likes to help out. not so stressful when working. everyone like to have fun to show a good time.
good,"I for the most part, enjoyed working there because of my co workers. The worse part was management. Their lack of compassion was appalling. The general manager lacked the ability to do her job efficiently anything you asked her she would provide a text book answer instead of a realistic one. Seating all your tables at once is an everyday issue. In instances when you pick up tables outside of your section (and the host close out 1 or more of your tables) the manger would open your closed section and seat you additional tables when your only supposed to have 3 total(an example of her lack of touch with reality and good management).  The servers took the weight of responsibility meaning any mistakes made by the hosts, kitchen and management ended up on the servers. We would start shift and be told by management we had everything and through out the shift we would learn we were out of shrimp or a certain desert ect. Over all its just and unorganized unpleasant environment. The scheduling was terrible, management would schedule you on days and times outside of your availability. Management would also do thing like schedule a closing shift Monday have you as a first in opener and a last out double on Tuesday, then assign you 2 more doubles. Its entirely to much to explain."
good,Management was always on different pages. It was good flexibility for part time work who is doing school also.
good,"I love working there, I have been there since 2016. I started as a host then made my way to the back of the building where they cook. I very nice place to work at."
good,Darden restaurants are great for a person that love to work at fast pace their benefits out weight it pay some but for the far most its a great atmosphere the work in
good,I would serve guests and ensure they enjoyed their dining experience.
good,Our job as servers at the Capital Grille is to create an individual dining experience for every guest. We take pleasure in making that experience as memorable as possible from placing rose petals on the table for special occasions to getting to know our guests on a personal level.
good,"Customers from the area are very rude to workers. Must know how to handle yourself professionally at all times.  Overall, you will meet very nice team members while working here that make the job easier because it feels like family, for the most part."
good,The workplace culture was very fast-paced. The benefits are great but the hours are far & in-between. They will give you a new meaning of customer service & maintenance.
good,"All the employees were very welcoming and nice and I was close with one of the servers were still good friends. The managers were all very nice. The general manager like to create drama, be two faced, spread rumors, and flirty, he fired me with out warning or any paperwork."
good,"Great friendly co-workers, HARD work. Low tips due to negligent customers. Very fast paced when busy and VERY slow when slow."
good,very fine and dine in restaurant.I wish I would of became a chef while I was working there
good,very decent job but dont depend on it being a career unless you are in management.
good,"Typical day at work included greeting customers and getting their correct order. Checking back to meet their needs. Perhaps a bit of small talk and some sidework and balancing cash flow at the end of the shift. I learned a gazillion names and learned patience and that you can't make everyone happy sometimes. Co-workers were awesome..turnover was ongoing. Worked with over 25 managers throughout my years there. Hardest part of the job was to not get upset by rude patrons and the ever changing protocol that was required. Most enjoyable part of job was meeting new and wonderful people, some of whom I developed long and lasting relationships."
good,While a student I was working here. I was in nursing school and it helped me while I was exploring my wants in a career.
good,Was a good company to work for easy system to learn friendsly people and they always worked with you I learned a lot with this restaurant front of the house and back
good,"Very unprofessional atmosphere. Owner and management are not professionally respected by employees, kitchen manager/chef is not respectable towards employees"
good,The people who work at Olive Garden are for the most part decent other than the managers. The managers never communicated with one another so one would tell you one thing and the other would have something different to say. Scheduling was a complete mess. I was attending college when I worked at Olive Garden and certain days in the week that I specifically told them when I was hired I wouldn't be able to work those days because of classes. Still somehow I was always scheduled outside of my ability at least once a week and it was just a mess.
good,"12 to 14 hour work day. Got paid for 8"
good,High strain on work and life balance and hours can be extreme pull on your family.
good,"Job was fun loved the money and hours but did not enjoy poor management. I like working and making money but when the management says things and do the opposite , it’s a hard place to stay at."
good,There were good and bad parts to working for red lobster. Our management came and went so fast that it was up to us servers to take up a lot of slack and really pull our weight to get through even a moderately busy evening
good,"I have grown so much working for one of the leaders in the restaurant industry. Leading a team, and being a leader, managing time and getting it done. It is sad that 80% of managers do not make it past two years. If it were not for the high turnover, and constant turmoil I would still be there today."
good,"Over time company adapted working environment of working more with less with cause environment to become stressful.  Also, cause the core value of work-life balance to go downhill."
good,"very physical, managers are okay. Salary is pretty good, but you never know how much you'll make. you must be a good people person, know how to interact, and multitask for busy times."
good,"Co-workers were fun to work with, management had their days, but overall it wasn't different than any other serving job. Money was okay, would have to work 11-12 hours straight through to make $100 sometimes, was in a bad location for making money."
good,the people that i worked with was almost like family. everybody always made sure that everybody else was taken care of. the management staff could have been better and the money was not worth the time unfortunately. with a better salary it would have been a better job.
good,"- Great customer service."
good,"Working at Darden is great; for someone who doesn't have any other commitments. They tend to give many hours in as few days as possible. I have reached upwards of 35 on-clock hours in 3 days. I love my co-workers and what I do, but the management and the way they love to pick favorites has drove me away."
good,"I guess it was ok i enjoyed making the money that was it ..the manager communication really isnt that good."
good,very busy atmosphere. salary was based on tips. Some days are better than others. Dealing with customers and food service is a very complex job. job teach me a lot of patience.
good,"Working for Darden has given me the opportunity to work with all types of people, I serve many types of people. Dealing with management gives me motivation to do better and keep working to move up in the business."
good,"Once they ""settle down"" employess show their true colors.  The senior leaders are all men and tend to only reward others who look and act like them.  Conformity is rewarded."
good,The atmosphere is okay and all but it's stressful . The workers are somewhat snotty but you have some that are really sweet. Managers are a pain in the butt and some that are rude and stuck up but some are chill and lay back
good,"Darden is a great company to work for, but currently, our management situation is not the greatest, and since the management can not get a grip, our kitchen thinks it is quite alright to send out 20 minute checks, which is completely unnecessary, I know they're trained to send out food quicker than that. However, the team members that I have been surrounded with are awesome. Everyone works together, and knows how to support one another when needed."
good,"Not very Busy usually but it gives time to interact more with the guest being served. Everyone that works together gets along well, many have become really good friends."
good,Great opportunity I was at longhorn where I started as a server and worked my way into the kitchen on the fryers. I worked my way across the kitchen and became a BOH trainer as well as a FOH trainer and then a key employee
good,"It's been many years since I worked for Darden, however I enjoyed it. They offered a great working atmosphere, I gained experience and friendships that have lasted."
good,"Great company. Its about hard work, dedication and protecting the brand.  This is the restaurant industry, you must be quick and set goals and follow up."
good,Each day i encountered new pros and cons on the job. Overall i enjoyed my Coworkers and many of the familiar guest that would come in and specifically ask me for their server. I Enjoyed my Environment and was happy to be apart of the Seafood couture
good,"Greeting and serving guest needs"
good,Great place for a career. Builds your skills and provide great leadership training
good,"Serve guests at the rate of at most 3 tables of 7 guests at a time. Collaborate with coworkers to serve parties greater than 7 guests. Deliver the many different ""free refills"" OG provides. Lots of walking. Be constantly encouraged to help coworkers on their busy times and do many sidework tasks to keep up with business. Putting up with guests is the hardest part, but serving sincerely kind guests is the most enjoyable part."
good,This is a place where high stress and fast work methods are involved in everyday work. The management team is quick to help and resolve any issues that you might run into.
good,I worked for Olive Garden for a combine total of 5 years on and off which worked out fine since my father was in the military.  I enjoyed working for the company very much.  I had some of the best management I have ever had the pleasure of working with ever.  I went to Cheddars whom are now Darden Restaurants and it was about the same.
good,"On a typical day you would come in set up the restaurant and schedule reservations. Olive Garden is a high volume almost fast food joint so you have to work fast and go for guest satisfaction in all you do. There would be slow times and then you could hang out and chat with coworkers but mostly you are on your feet moving, cleaning, and directing guests to their tables. Organization and prioritization are key for success in these roles you are the servers right hand person."
good,enjoyed my experience working for Darden. Overall a great company to work for just for me and my family a better work life balance as far as hours went.
good,"Its a pretty good company. If you need quick money, fast pace, and friendly in your life, olive garden is the place. Great customer service is a MUST!"
good,The collaborative culture at Darden is fun and enjoyable.  Everyone is friendly and professional.  I enjoyed my time with the company and hope the best for its continued success!
good,Management and environment at Olive Garden it laid back and friendly family like atmosphere. 
good,"Longhorn in Amherst is overall not a bad job, however the staff there are very friendly and a great team, but don’t care about helping others when struggling, and only care about themselves so they can quickly get out of the restaurant. There’s nothing hard about this job, if you are a hard worker, the most enjoyable part is talking to workers, and guest that come to the restaurant."
good,"Working there is stressful at times especially during busy hours. The particular restaurant I worked at didn't really have the best management, they did what they could with what they had though. You get 1 week paid vacation for your first year up to 5 weeks if you decide to stay."
good,"Fast paced outgoing had fun Moments, food will never go Hungry lol.. free drinks such as tea, water, soda. Could switch shifts with people or pick shifts if needed"
good,"I worked as a server for about a year and I enjoyed working at the Olive Garden. The restaurant was not very busy. You can make decent money if you work hard, but overall the place was not where the big bucks are. Not a bad place to work and they hire from within for managerial positions so that is a plus."
good,"Honestly if you can deal with fake management then you should be fine. I wouldnt recommend going to management about any issue if it has to deal with one of their ""favorites"", because your issue will not get handled, only laughed at.  They do not believe you have a life or think people get sick.  if they did get sick (as i did) they will make you stay and work, and give you extra to do in the process.  they do not follow osha guidelines.  "
good,"I would say that any Darden restaurant struggles to offer a server full time hours. I did what I could to range between 20-30 a week but sometimes business can drag and run slow. This causes issues  with pay and securing viable wages to sustain living. That being said, my management team has always been very classy and I'm appreciative of them."
good,I enjoyed my years at Darden Restaurants.  I really learned more about the restaurant industry.  My previous experience was with hotels only.  My position at Darden really sharpened my skills.
good,It is just like most restaurant jobs you would encounter. A lot of staff at this particular Olive Garden. You can definitely tell some managers care more than others.
good,"being in the darden family, I've learned customer service. communication skills regarding empathizing with guests from all round. being knowledgable with all there needs and concerns."
good,I was given the opportunity to learn how cooperate industry operates and was trained regarding cooperate operations on a state-wide basis.  I was challenged on a daily basis and given opportunities to move to higher positions within the organization.
good,"Darden -Olive Garden specifically- is a very interesting and fun place to work sometimes, but it can also be very difficult and stressful to work with some of the staff."
good,Working at Olive Garden has taught me how to communicate with people of all ages.  I learned how to go out of my way to make conversations and I will continue to go above and beyond to make sure everyone is highly satisfied from the second they walk into the building until they leave the restaurant.
good,"Many years put into the company, with little reward. Working for over 4 years in the restaurant, I didn't see one promoted from within. If you are not the managers favorite, they schedule you bad shifts and isn't always the best place to work."
good,"Olive Garden provides a wonderful opportunity to people who need a flexible schedule. While attending school, it is a great place to make good money in not so many hours. Wonderful staff and hardworking individuals."
good,Multiple meetings mixed with onsite dining. Never a dull moment. Always learning new things. Support multiple sites. Flexible hours and ability to make decisions.
good,"It has good environment where setting was relaxed and enjoyable to guests and employees alike. Overall, management worked well with schedule and understood needs of employees."
good,"Working was a different opportunity, I love to drive and being part of the catering and delivery team was what I like about this job. Working at Olive Garden is a challenge because you have to be one hundred percent accurate."
good,"The frequent rush of work and press of business could be balanced better. At times, I had to remind my manager that they were directing me to violate company policy. Service is not as important as money for the company."
good,Darden's was a great place for those that are wired in a way that allows them to handle the pressure and any of the other issues that come with high stress jobs.
good,"Great experience, great culture, and benefits."
good,I like working there met a lot of memorable people I loved the food there the managers were very cool but firm I loved all my co workers the environment was very face paced
good,"I went to work at Darden to work part time while I was unable to work full time.  It was a great transition job for me.  I enjoyed the work, the people and the management."
good,"The work was good but can be difficult if you where not staffed, not with the job it's self but with the many tasks when short handed. If your team stayed focused on staffing the shifts where a breeze."
good,Overall rating of 4 stars as far as a good place to work. They tend to play favorites and promote less qualified employees rather than the more qualified/more experienced employee.
good,"great place to kick off a career! extremely challenging to move up, though. The resources at disposal are very much worth the time and there's a reason it's the top place to work. Evolution is key for them in terms of retention though."
good,Serving is tough- at olive garden you have UNLIMITED soup and salad so it could be worse but overall not a bad company. Location and management makes a huge difference.
good,Things were very busy but they chaos makes the learning curve high. Theres lots of regulars and this was a place you could work at and still want to eat at later.
good,The resteraunt  industry definitely takes time to get used to but im very much a people person and if i needed to i could go through that stress again.
good,"Fast paced environment with opportunity to advance and sharpen skills. Great for single, but difficult for anyone with a family. Long hours, minimal down time. Expect to work every holiday"
good,Severing was good. Made easy money while I was going to school. People where rude sometimes. Management was okay to work for. You have to be a people person.
good,For the most part it is a lot of repetition. Once you learn what to do and how to perfect it the steps will be super easy. Keeping your guests happy should be the main goal. In return you are tipped for your excellent service following the olive garden standards.
good,"waiting on tables, bartending"
good,Darden was able to accommodate my busy schedule and allows me some flexibility. It is a fast - paced job that requires multi-tasking skills and personal service.
good,It was horrible they didn't really care if you couldn't work a certain day they would still schedule you either way . Not flexible hours or days something would always mess up .
good,"Darden has an excellent benefits program. "
good,"Great if your a student and need a summer job. Gets pretty boring after awhile, did it for 3 years and it definitely got repetitive. Its mostly teenagers, not really any room for adults"
good,"while working at olive garden it was easy but hard and i learned to work as a team, and i loved my job, the hardest thing was leaving because my co workers became family."
good,Disliked that I was the one working hard the most and managers couldn't see my fellow co-workers slack off and be unproductive compared to my own work.
good,I learned a lot about time management and team work and how to work independently along with what it takes for total guest satisfaction
good,"I daily recruit, hire train and lead a team of  diverse individuals whos goal is to delight and nourish each and every patron. As a leader I ensure that the employees working for me also get the same respect and nurturing that we give our guest."
good,"Overall good company to work for, difficult life/work balance. Great Benefits. Opportunity for growth and development."
good,Fast paced day to day life with a wonderful staff. Decent amount of micromanagement but this is expected with a well known chain. Expanded my knowledge of wine and customer relations as well as problem solving. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling as though I was part of an extended family.
good,Make our customers feel welcome special and appreciated and treat them like family in a warm family like atmosphere. This job gave me flexibility and the ability to be a great leader and taught me many life lessons as I started right out of highschool and had three boys while working here I definatly grew up while working for darden!
good,Great place to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside a great team and being able to meet new guests everyday. Watching them leave happy meant we were doing our jobs and that was reward enough.
good,"A very cool place, the people and management are cool.  I learned a lot here about almost all facets of the restaurant business, just need more hours."
good,"When I first started working there, I wouldn't eat there until it was clean,after a month of detailing the place i finally ate the food.  I learned that if you work hard that everyone doesn't like you and makes it harder for employees that goof off!"
good,This job gave me a better knowledge and mental gain in the restaurant business and its operations. Your co-workers are vey diverse and social.
good,Productive Fortune 500 company. Fortune 100 best company to work for
good,A typical work day weather calm or not would always turn out great because of the great communication between my co-workers and I.
good,"very good management/"
good,"Love the restaurant business but as the years go on, the family grows and the need for more money does also."
good,"the company was great work for, a lot of perks and great people."
good,Darden has a healthy corporate culture which promotes personal and professional development.
good,"The company itself is okay. They just put too much work on one employees dinner plate. A typical day at work involves setting up dishes, baking, cleaning bathrooms, taking and emptying out all the trash, baking bread/potatoes, and maintaining both dishes and baking. I learned to get my duties done as soon as possible so I can start my next task(s). Management needs to manage the duties shared between the employees better. The hardest part of my job is balancing the different tasks given all at once. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing what I can for the customers and knowing I make the business better by doing my job."
good,Great place to work in a fast paced environment with lots of customer interaction.
good,Being a student this job helps you achieve both your monetary and educational goals without adding to your stress most of the time. Sometimes it adds to the stress but thats only on a busy Saturday night.
good,"Darden has grown considerably in the last 10 years. Even during the recession they still were opening restuarants. There is a variety of areas you can work within this company. They are becoming very ""corporate"" so with that there is a lot of politics and over management."
good,"An overall good working experience, but managment refused to coach appropriate team members when necessary."
good,"Serving customers in a casual family diner. Good training, teamwork, but management is slowly decreasing in quality."
good,I loved working for this company and built many long lasting relationships
good,"Quality atmosphere and menu, in house preparation and quality focused environment. Good place to work."
good,"This is a great company to work for for those of you who enjoy weekly pay, benefits for part time employees, various discounts on a variety of services and goods. Good atmosphere and workplace"
good,"I loved my job at longhorn steakhouse. The atmosphere was professional, and I enjoyed the benefits that came a long with it. The management was new and inexperienced. But was of great of help and professional with everything. There was racism, but was un-acknowledged."
good,"Darden restaurants are phenomenal places to work with flexible schedules to meet financial needs. The only down side is that when business is slower, there is a greater need to work longer hours to compensate a significant loss of income. Management is very open to learning multiple job positions and personal growth personally and professionally. There is a lot of positivity in the restaurant and helpful nature throughout."
good,"The environment when starting was a little overwhelming due to it being my first real job, but it took only two months for me to master hosting and then to start falling into other job places and learning to help others with their jobs. It would be a nicer place if management was constant with repercussions on employees who do not do their jobs appropriately."
good,"Everyday you know what you need to do for your job and position. Its a continuous daily routine of doing the same things but different orders, shipments, and inventory."
good,Ok job for a students. I worked for the company for a long time. The biggest problem here was management ran the restaurant however that particular manager wanted to and managers promoted who they liked. Only partially considering skill or senioity. Not knocking the company over all I would recommend it.
good,"Teamwork is key, its a great place to work, the environment is upbeat and solid. The hardest part of the job is making sure the meal goes out looking the way it should"
good,"Knowing what you get from the restaurant industry, working for Darden leads the way! They have opportunities to improve some aspects of the compensation package, however if you can properly staff your restaurant and keep a management team in place then you can obtain a work/life balance."
good,"I learned what the basics of being a host. First real job that taught me a lot of new great things. Opened my mind on a lot of scenarios. Taught me more about game plans, teamwork, being the leader."
good,"Great place to work, good experience and learning."
good,"I met people working with Darden that I still consider family. I learned how to be quick and efficient. I enjoyed my regulars and getting to know new folks from all walks of life. Management at our particular store was lacking, only because they lacked a business/relationship balance. They were too focused on the business and not building relationships with the employees or guests."
good,"Job duties included providing training to new employees on facilitation and orientation of kitchen procedures as well as OSHA health code requirements.  Managing inventory, providing culinary prep for daily menu items, provide quality customer service menu request, prepare orders for transportation, facilitate representation of chef for Olive Garden during community outreach and culinary vending representation.  Ensure safe, sanitary practices for health code inspections."
good,"great atmosphere and coworkers , this job taught me how to have a great sense of respect for guest while dinning in building also gave me a sense of respect when i went out myself to eat."
good,"Flexible with school schedules"
good,"Restaurant level management is overall good.   HUGE company and corporate office that is much more silo and filled with 'corporate politics'"
good,"The Olive Garden is a very busy place to work, and you are expected to catch on quick, and keep up. Slackers need not apply! The staff are treated fairly by management for the most part."
good,"Lucrative place to work, good service culture and fairly objective management. Not a lot of diversity, however. Be prepared to be reviewed and secretly shopped often, so always come with your A game to work. There is always continuous educatin (food, wine and cooking preparation) so be prepared for quizzes and random tests. Overall, a good company to work for. I worked at Capital Grille for almost 4 years then came back a few years later to another Darden franchise."
good,Great company to work for. Learned a lot from fellow co-workers to district managers. The pride in the culture is very vigilant from restaurant to restaurant.
good,Working with Darden restaurants can be a bit overwhelming for a line cook but the upside was it kept me on my toes. The managers were more than fair with their employees.
good,My typical day at work would consist of me clocking in and getting right to work. Although the hours were long it was a fun environment to work in.
good,"Fast pace, creating new and original dishes, remembering the recipes. Improved long term memory by needing to recall recipes on hand. Management is super friendly and seriously ""when you're here you're family"""
good,"On a typical day, it's rally not too bad of a place to work. I enjoy cooking and preparing meals for the guests, the only real problems that effects the work environment are rooted from outdated management methods, but nothing extremely interruptive."
good,Made me take initiative to find extra tasks. the most enjoyable was having contact with customers on a one on one basis. built lifetime friendships.
good,The company provides great management experience. The company  has a good training program. The work/life balance is an opportunity in any company in the industry because a manager works nights and weekends. You're schedule can be a close and then turn around and open. You may work 9 days in a row to get a weekend off with the way the schedule is set up.
good,A day at Olive Garden was always busy. I was held accountable for most of the employees and I enjoyed every second. The Managers were good although there were many General Managers.
good,"The best part of the job for me was the people I worked with. Every day I was able to work in a state of the art facility and call center. Although at times the calls would be relatively routine there were always cases that I had never heard of and needed  to research with other departments looking for legal advice or some other information."
good,I gained experience in a fast paced  environment and valuable management skills  that prepared me for the future.
good,"hardest part of the job, is not getting a pay check, but the tips are great."
good,"Highly enjoyable place to work, a lot to learn and a great company vision"
good,"Whether I was a server, bartender, or manager, I arrived fifteen minutes early and prepared for my shifts. Looked at last years figures to get estimate on how busy it might be. Was a leader and asset to the company. The hardest part was being able to manage 60 hour work week with family life, and the most enjoyable was meeting, helping, and watching others grow within the company."
good,Good place for a single man with no home life. very difficult for a woman with children and a husband.
good,Great company to work for if you are happy in one position because upward movement is rare due to long tenured high level management. Still they are good people and deserved of their continued success.
good,I made some life long friends with Darden! They also introduced me to serving. I am very greatful for that.
good,Overall a great company that cares about the employees. They have many opportunities to grow and help you achieve any goals you may have. A great place for someone who likes to relocate.
good,"A great fast paced place to work. Friendly, Fair, Fun and safe working environment. The co-workers always willing to help out. Everyone works together as a team to make sure that all requirements are met by the end of each shift."
good,Darden as a whole is great. The cheddars concept is a total mis step for them culturally. There was no support for managers in that concept and retention of qualified long term employees was non existent.
good,"I have been working for this company for almost 8 years.It's faced paced, and can get strrssful but you can make good money here, and also pick up extra shifts if needed. I love that management work with your schedule. Coworkers are nice and management is decent, definitely the best company i have worked for so far"
good,"I liked working for Darden. I would like to be a little more creative and responsible. We worked with a line of 4 to 6 individuals. It was high volume and very fast paced. It does not leave any room for creativity. It does, however give you opportunities to learn different aspects of the restaurant business"
good,It was fun and ok ther where some crazy day and some slow days. The most part it was fun and interesting. I learned almost everything from then and I will use it
good,I worked there while I was in college and high school. It is a good place to work. You make a good amount of money and you get it everyday before you leave. I made a lot of friends and the staff really is friendly. I liked it and would recommend as a short term job.
good,"It’s a fast pace job, there is a lot expected of you at this job. I worked many job codes meaning I did not just serve. I had a little more background with the company meaning I was able to help people more. Its a good job, definitely keeps you on your toes"
good,"A typical day at work can become very hectic and stressful. You need to have a lot of patience and always try to stay calm. The hardest part of the job is having to allow guests to insult, belittle, or curse at you and give no feedback. The most enjoyable part of this job is having an amazing work family, and always having someone to help you if you get extremely busy."
good,Working here was fair I got paid minimum wage and when it got busy I don’t bieve that was enough. A typical work day was ver inconsistent and either dead slow or packed lack of food
good,A typical work day consist of productivity and team work. I have learned that hard work comes at a price. They promote work life balance but that doesn't seem to work for managers. What I loved most about the job is the people.
good,"Working for the company Darden Restaurants is a great opportunity for anyone. It is a company that cares about their employees and rewards them wiht great benefits. How ever, working for certain restaurants for Darden is different. But Darden itself is always their to help in case something goes wrong, it is a comonany that strives to make sure you’re needs are met as an employee."
good,Darden is a good company to work for with an environment that changes daily.   A typical day is filled with challenges.  The hardest part of the job is aligning 30 personalities up to complete a task.
good,Working for Darden Restaurants is never dull. There is always something to do. A good environment for those who need to keep busy. Training was not always the greatest and some of the people were a little difficult to get along with.
good,This was one of the best places I have ever worked. While the management can be iffy sometimes it is always redirected to make you better. Sadly there is often no room for advancement.
good,They treat you well. They are always happy to help you and they work with you when it comes to hours. There is a very strong family environment. You will always feel welcome when you go into work.
good,"Great place to learn new things."
good,"I love the LoHo atmosphere, great food, high turnover rate, discounts on food are always a plus, but understanding of employees needs is a must for any business..."
good,"Fast paced work environment. This has taught me to think fast,Multitask and be proactive in solving problems. "
good,I was hired in at Red Lobster as an hourly employee and in two years I was promoted to manager and in another three years I was a general manager in another three years I was first in line for the next multi-unit position when that position was eliminated
good,"If you've ever been a server you understand how hard you have to work at this position. Many let downs from your efforts, also there were many positive rewards from them also."
good,"darden is reliable for hours and customers, each restaurant offers the ability to really make a suitable pay check. its a company that does its best to think of the employees. training is adequate. management is flawed but bearable. dont burn the darden bridge. no opportunity for successful advancement"
good,"Not a bad company to work for. Whether it is waitressing, hosting, or doing take out. Managers were a good group to work for when I was working there. Turnover rate is a little high as well."
good,Typical day at work consisted of lots of standing and very little breaks. I enjoyed the culture as a high school student working with students from the UA.
good,"On days that are really busy, it can get a bit disorganized but the team helps each other in order to finish a task faster and and accurate. The managers are always there to help as well."
good,Working with Darden has been a positive experience with a very flexible schedule. The mgr staff has been very supportive. It has been a great part-time job.
good,"Everyday was pretty much a balanced pace, throughout the day we would have certain waves of people that came in. Nothing dramatic, our biggest harp was on keeping the primary foods stocked up. what i've learned from working there was how to adjust to the different environment in a fast paced setting, an aside from the desserts an other foods we have to fry, it did not take long for me to get the hang of things. Our managers were cool, they always keep busy an for the most part they treated people with respect. I would say the most hardest part was getting use to the new orders ad the time that they needed to be fried, I'd often over cook something an it kills when you have to re-due an order. What i enjoyed was my co-workers, they'd always find a way to make me laugh no matte what it was"
good,"i was a server for a few short months with Darden so i don,t have a large picture to paint. i just need more income to support my family. Great managers and staff."
good,A typical work day was fast paced and challenging but rewarding. My co-workers were fun and would help me out if I got overloaded. The hardest part of my job was juggling multiple responsibilities at once.
good,"Good job to have for instant money in your pocket.  However, if interested in job progression the progress is slow and not always guaranteed.  If you hit 32 hours a week you will receive medical and anniversary pay which are nice perks."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs because I got to meet so many new people, some of whom I am still in contact and my children are now friends with their children."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of making sure the dining room is neat and orderly, running food to the proper tables, resetting tables for new customers, making sure all customers are well taken care of."
good,Great systems to learn and grow with many opportunities in entry level management and ability to learn systems.  Ability to hire great staff members and serve guest daily.
good,"It was a great restaurant to have my first serving experience."
good,"Well a typical day at work all depends on the guests and how we treat one another."
good,This is a great company to work for. There's many opportunities to advance and do great things. The benefits are very good and the management is very understanding in flexibility of your schedule.
good,Dareden is a good company to work for if you have the right managment. Alot of the darden restaurants have poor management though.
good,"On a typical work day one comes into the restaurant, checks their ego at the door and starts the grind.  I have learned that everyone has different needs and expectations.  All one can do is smile and do there best to be attentive to their guests needs and give them a reason to come back to the restaurant.  "
good,The atmosphere was clean and properly set. It was a pleasure to work in that environment. Friendly guests and co-workers!
good,"Great company to work for. Stress is limited, and the work is very interesting. The toughest part of working for the company has been the massive amount of layoffs that occurred over the past year. It's very sad to see friends and colleagues leave, but at the end of the day I feel the company made necessary decisions to ensure future viability."
good,"Being a server at Olive Garden allowed me to have a flexible schedule and ability to work with new people on a daily basis. Everyday is different than the day before. It is a fun, fast paced work environment where everyone works as a team. Our goal is to have overall quest satisfaction. I am looking to move on with my work experience and start building my career. While serving was great while I attended college I am ready to move on. I love working with people and making their dining experience enjoyable. The most difficult part of my job is not being able to grow. After working with the company for over 8 years, I do not think I am gaining anymore experience than I already have. I have worked for four different Olive Gardens over the past 8 years because of moving to different locations. The management and co-workers at each one has been enjoyable. While working for Olive Garden I have learned how to be prepared for anything to happen. While working I have to implement my social skills, sales skills, time management skills, organizational skills, team leader skills and how to react quickly when a problem occurs."
good,"I have been with darden from the age of 16 they will work with you to make you a better employee. They hire from within for hardworking, team orientated employees."
good,"Working at Olive Garden, or OG as the employees call it, has been a valuable experience for me. OG has improved my teamwork and customer service skills, and has been one of the better jobs that i've had while in school. Management is better than most, and my co-workers for the most part have been good. However, it's not a career path that i'd ever consider, and I look at my position here as an means to have money while in school."
good,"A typical day at work entailed cleaning the dining room, cleaning the lobby, clearing and resetting tables. I was responsible for training other bussers in addition to cleaning and resetting tables. At the end of the night I would make sure that the entire side station is cleaned and broken down for set up the next day."
good,"Prepare food list. Clean and prep seafood. Complete cleaning list for the day, cook food and complete fish and seafood order. "
good,I enjoyed my time with Darden Restaurants. A typical day was filled with interaction with many guests. My most enjoyable part of working with Darden was the money I received in tips. The insurance is not very affordable and I don't believe worth the money.
good,"I learned from top to bottom, I did everything from bussing tables, hosting, serving and bartending. It was a great fast paced environment, which I enjoy!"
good,"Overall this was an amazing experience working with Red Lobster in The Heart of Time Square. "
good,"Great management, bennefits, half priced meals, long hours, great co-workers"
good,"Enjoyed working for this company for the 4 years that i did, they have good benefits and are a team oriented company."
good,"As a server and host at Darden Restaurants, I was exposed to many interesting situations. Some managers were fantastic, some were... not so qualified. The corporation as a whole however seemed to care about the employees and the quality of their business. It wasn't anything to brag about but also wasn't a bad job at all. It's hard to see how things could be made better but not be able to change them because managers are sometime just managers and not owners of their business if you know what I mean..."
good,This was my 1st career. I worked there for 19 years. Had some fun day and some bad days. A great experience.
good,"In the restaurant industry, there are rarely typical days. As managers, we must constantly review overall restaurant performance by the half hour and make decisions that will positively impact the restaurant without diminishing the guest experience. Balancing my time on the job and having foresight are some of the things that I have learned. Knowing when and how to react to constant change is very important. Having vision and a well thought out plan to achieve daily goals and duties is important to being a successful manager. The management team is very cohesive. We first have our departmental responsibilities, then overall restaurant responsibilities. We work well together to achieve the overall goals of the restaurant and hold each other accountable for developing each other as well as the crew members we manage. The hardest part of the job is getting a consistent great performance from crew members. The most enjoyable is meeting guests and achieving all restaurant goals.When restaurant goals are consistently met, the restaurant and the crew members and recognized for their achievements."
good,"Employees are treated fairly, and the business is good. The hours can be dreary, and night shifts make a social life somewhat difficult. I enjoy working for Darden because they are equal, and very much invest in their employers."
good,I’ve worked there a while. It’s a great place if you have a second job or are in school. They offer training in order for you to meet minimum standards. The rest is up to you.
good,Great company to work for. If you're in a department without favoritism you can grow within the company.  Outstanding environment and employee friendly.
good,The managers at Olive Garden is a well trained  management  and working  for them was a good way to learn what I had to prepare me for the job at hand.
good,Coworkers were great. I really love my managers. Of course there is always going to one you dont completely love but it happens. Great place to work at.
good,Day begins with checking in with managers going over goals for the day(sales goals). I then go grab some coffee before my first table to get things going. After that is smooth sailing for the day until i get tired but by that point the shift is done.
good,Enjoyable opportunities and many growth potential. It is something new with the ability of interacting with multiple customers. I am grateful to have work for the company
good,"It has been great working there ,just need a change,i love working with people works great with schedule close to home,would be intrested in other restraunts,been working there 8 years"
good,Its an okay job just wished it payed more money than it currently does. You get paid weekly but being an adult with responsibilities making $300 or $400 a week isn't enough
good,"Good company, hard to advance, Good quality food at a reasonable price. Fun place to work. We were allowed to recognize and reward out team. I was able to gain more culinary skills"
good,Darden was a great company to work for. I enjoyed the team that I worked with. The work life balance can often be harsh; however you do get paid well.
good,"Enjoyed working for Darden Restaurants. Very fast paced and my co workers were awesome. Sometimes you will find yourself in a hostile work enviroment, fortunately that wasn't the case."
good,the moment I walk in everyday were packed and sometime I have a hard time even finding a spot and it pasta and sauce mostly but there is a lot of turn over kitchen staff wise so its never consistent
good,"i loved working at olive garden but i was promised to be promoted to server from being a hostess, and after becoming lead hostess and numerous talks with my managers about moving up, it never happened. i ended up stopping working to go to cosmetology school and that was hard for them to compensate for"
good,Working at Longhorn Steakhouse was a good job that helped me pay for my secondary education. The work atmosphere is generally fun and lighthearted which made working there fun.
good,Only reason I left Darden is because I was traveling 7 days a week. Closest restaurant I was in charge of was 2 hours away. Left for a better work schedule.
good,"The company culture is committed to both guest and team member satisfaction. "
good,"A typical day you are by yourself or only with one other person in the dish tank, making it already stressful and a burden on any single person. Management never held the schedule together correctly, there were always multiples problems and no-shows each week with no retribution. The weekend is the only time there are more than 2 people at a time in dish and it was often still not enough. They only gave me a raise after the head guy left and we were stuck with two of us who performed adequately enough to have it not be a nightmare. I learned how to overcome needing direction in how to handle myself alone or finding the next item to start on. I needed to hone and focus my anger towards productivity in the work place instead of at my coworkers or myself. It took the length of the year but I fully believe i have made significant progress on that and able to function as a cooperative employee."
good,"They're family friendly, all diners are guests not customers, all smiles, very clean, high standard, employees show loyalty to the restaurant, and the food is amazing."
good,"Overall it was a great place to work. The hours are generally flexible with an online place to swap shifts, if needed. Benefits weren't bad but on a server wage, they were expensive."
good,"Pay is pretty good.  Benefits are good.  MIGHT get 1 holiday off per year.  1 weekend off per month if your GM is considerate in scheduling.  Start with 2 weeks vacation and at every 5 year mark get another week.  (Start with two weeks.  At 5 years I got 3 weeks.  At 10 years, you get 4 weeks.  At 15 years, you get 5 weeks.  Caps there.)  Fantastic company match.  6%, and every quarter match never went below 96% and got as high as 146%.  If I could have worked 9-5 Monday through Friday and done exactly what I did, I never would have left."
good,no review at this time. I worked for numerous locations and they each had their strengths and weaknesses. I would recommend someone give them an opportunity
good,"Company provided training and developed employees, opportunity for advancement  good benefits and salary was fair,  cooperation between departments was not always good"
good,"it was a quick fast paced working schedule, good people, good food the waitresses, bartender and managers were very nice I would be more than willing to pick busing/serving back up again"
good,"It was a very nice place to work at. It's very flexible with hours, and you're able to have a second job or spend your time to go to school. It's very quick placed and you're able to work on teamwork skills."
good,"Dependent on restaurant it can be very busy or slow which will require a all members to shift gears on short notice. Multitasking can the hardest due to the push to sell wine by pushing sample where when busy can slow you down, along with the potential of being sat multiple times within a short amount of time."
good,"The Capital Grille Part of Darden is quite a place to work. Great money, the hours are not that demanding, but if you want to advance in your career, you need to make sure your management likes you. They seem to have favorites (at least at my location) where they will help advance those in their ""inner circle"" regardless of competency."
good,"Darden is a nice company to work for overall, but restaurant life is hectic in any situation, Management and coworkers can sometimes be difficult to agree with, but with teamwork these restaurants can run efficiently and smoothly."
good,I loved working at Olive Garden one day I would like to go back. Just very poor management at the moment when I was working. Very stressful fast passed work but very fun if you can work well under pressure.
good,"Being a server for 5+ years taught me many priceless lessons and skills. Customer service, multi-tasking, as well as learning a corporate environment."
good,"Fun environment,  many things to learn . Wine tasting and food tasting how to present new dishes to customers was very interesting.  Staff was always fun to be around from front of house to back kitchen.  Many contests and different competetitions where offered."
good,I could write a million stories on how I feel I have been mistreated by management. But if you don't get caught up in the restaurant the money is pretty decent.
good,"Pride in job, love of making others happy, good workload, room for advancement, strong emplloyees if motivated properly,  great managers, strong ethics and great atmosphere"
good,"Great company, and great culture with solid compensation/benefits, but the work life balance scores a zero. Weekend and night work is constantly expected to keep up with an unbelievable workload."
good,"You encounter a lot of people, ones you know and ones yo don't know. Some of them are kind as can be and others not so much. You're always moving, if you're not then I'm pretty sure you could be there is always something to do. We have a great staff and we all feel accepted by each other, obviously, we are still human and aren't perfect but we try our best. The hardest part would be the pace of it when it gets busy or the days you work because they are not always convenient to your schedule. The best part is interacting with the guests and the team!"
good,	I manage the operation of the restaurant on the daily basis per Darden standard. I manage the bar and all the catering operations at the restaurant. We are one of the highest volume Olive Garden in the area ranging from Naples to Sarasota.
good,"The Olive Garden is a wonderful organization to get your ""feet wet"" in the service industry. The guests may not always be the best but depending on the staff and management the possible complaints will not seem that bad."
good,Multi-tasking to assure my guests dining experience is excellent. I involve management only when necessary. Work as a team with co-workers. The hardest part of my job is working weekends and holidays that cause me miss special time and events.Enjoy exceeding the expectations of my guest.
good,"Fast paced environment with multicultural employment.  Well managed establishment where knowledge of customer service, hospitality and culinary procedures are met."
good,"Well balanced and no side work. Tip out was a little more than other restaurants, but my only duty was to go into work, make the guests happy, then go home."
good,"The experience I've had working for a Fortune 500 company has been an amazing ride, with a lot of opportunity for change and growth."
good,"A typical day at work is communicating with all team members and guests to ensure that each one has had a memorable and pleasant experience dining in our restaurant. I have learned a great deal about labor and food cost. Management is supportive and encourages advancement, however, it seems very few are actually promoted. My coworkers are my absolute favorite part of my job. They are an amazing group of people that know what the true meaning of teamwork is. The hardest part of the job is trying to be ten places at once. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great team and knowing that the customers are happy."
good,The people you will work with are amazing. Management is lacking.
good,"At a typical day at work, I worked behind the bar where my main responsibility was to prepare cocktails for the servers from chits that printed. I also served the any guests at the bar top and tables in the bar area. In addition, I answered the phone to take orders for carry out, kept a balanced drawer, fixed server checks, cashed out servers at the end of their shift, communicated with managers about guest complaints or server errors. Before or after rush, I washed all the bar glasses, stocked the mixers, beer and wine, cleaned the bar area and took inventory the last Sunday of the month. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to meet wonderful people that would come in and make positive guest connections that promoted repeat business. The bond between co-workers is another one of my favorite parts of the job. The comradery generated with the massive amount of teamwork this job entails spreads throughout work. Some of my very best friends were made at work! The hardest part of the job was, of course, dealing with guest complaints. I always strive to have everyone leave completely satisfied and anything less is a disappointment that I try to avoid. I always got a manager and attempted to remedy the situation as quickly as possible. The management team at all of the Darden restaurants have been very well trained at talking to the guests, but some of them fall short with employee relations. For example, I had a general manager throw ramekins at the dishwashers that were not clean, until two walked out, and that is not exactly appropriate. I have learned technical skills"
good,"Red Lobster is a great college job! They will work around your schedule and give you as many hours as you want or as little as you want. As long as you work hard, they treat you amazing!"
good,I enjoyed the the change into a Italian atmosphere verses Cracker Barrel.
good,"its not a bad place to work for, just not getting the best of hours right now and looking for a second job.  New mangers come and go so fast, each one different in personallites and such make it so you never know what to expect."
good,successfully fulfilling our guest needs and orders. Helping team member through out the shift.
good,"Great company, great benefits, but not personal. It is a large corporation, so do not expect to advance quickly or be treated as an individual."
good,"As a host we meet, greet and seat guest and cooridinate seating for large parties. Working as a team with the servers and bussers"
good,"I was trained as a cook and also baker, there many opportunity given to empolyees to pursue their career in restaurant business."
good,"I didnt enjoy working in Owensboro, Kentucky. I definitely didnt feel included as a new manager. My manager often didnt include me but would include the male service manager saying he was farther along than me. Especially when it came to training and developing me as a new service manager. I did enjoy some of the challenges it posed but felt very isolated and unsupported by my manager"
good,"Great pay, and benefits! Company has great values and great leaders. Understand committing to advancement opportunities means total life investment, physical, mentally, and socially."
good,This is a good company to work for but you cannot be lazy. You must work together to get tables turned. There is definitely favoritism but only with certain managers.
good,"Hourly team member based . Team members can gang up on the manager to easily get them fired . "
good,"Training & management is top notch at least in Pittsburgh Allegheny area!!"
good,My coworkers are friendly and some people try to help everyone out but usually it's just 4-8 people doing everything meant for 28 people and angry guest because the people who help everyone get overwhelmed and tend to not get tipped for being generous to coworkers
good,"Good management, team work .. positive work space .. Great employees.. flexible schedule.. career opportunities..Really treat you like your family when your with them"
good,"I had been with the company 24 years worked in different departments, I enjoyed the hours benefits and the employees. I learned a lot about the upper level administration of the company. Interacted with higher management a lot. The hardest part of the job wad that it was stressful and lots of work to do. The most enjoyable is that everyone worked for a common goal and the it was job security for a while. Benefits were great, but really no room for advancement for minorities."
good,Great company to work for however the quality of life can be poor especially if you are a parent. Schedules are made for the month but are often not made until the week before the next month which makes planning your life nearly impossible.
good,Working at a Darden company is incredible. The staff get along real well for the most part and the managers are amazing. The work environment is overall great and employees are helpful.
good,A great company built on family ideals. I have worked at 3 different Darden locations and every one of them was amazing. Advancement isn't as attainable as you would want them to be. Wonder benefits and fun working environment.
good,Great place to work and grow. You can start in any posistion in the company and can move into many different roles. Training is usually top notch in all roles.
good,"The management was always great and made sure everyone was held to the same standards, the pay was really great, especially for hosts, and the Darden app made it very easy to check schedules, paychecks, and all other information."
good,"Darden is truly a great place to be.  Darden completely supports a well diversed team, participates in many different community involvement activities and has programs and support for all team members and managers."
good,They take decent care of their employees and promote from within.  At least 2 of my friends ended up being promoted from server to bartender to manager within a few short years.
good,"They do give you a chance to move up in the company for sure! But they give it to just anybody, that’s why management is poor. "
good,"This is a good workplace that provides a secure income. At times it could be really stressful because of its fast pace, but It is a good restaurant and fun to work at."
good,I really enjoyed working for Olive Garden. Gained a lot of knowledge & customer service skills there. Work was typically a pretty smooth day. All about being competitive with our sales & giving guests an amazing visit while they have their meal.
good,"Working at Olive Garden may not be the easiest job sometimes. You have to make sure you conform to the recipes and standards of the food industry while also delivering the food in a timely manner. As long as you and your coworkers pull your weight, working with the whole kitchen in mind and not just your station, things work harmoniously. However, one person's lack of work can upset the whole process for everyone and make coming to work stressful."
good,"Olive Garden is a great place to work, fast paced, high volume turnover and good food and always greeted with a smile.  Benefits were provided and management works closely with staff."
good,"I've worked for Darren for over 10 years and have always felt like family. I currently still work in their restaurants, and I love it the way I did the first day. I started as a server, eventually worked up through Certified Trainer, Certified Service Professional, and went on to be a Restaurant Manager by 21 years old! The company has great upward mobility, with most management positions being awarded to crew members from within the restaurants."
good,I was able to take care of my young child and myself comfortably. I worked for them for years and it was one of the best experiences of my life and only left the company due to going back to school.
good,"I would clean tables and all areas of the restaurant as needed, help guests to the best of my abilities, and communicate to the hosts of tables cleaned and dirty."
good,"Management is great. My Co-workers are awesome. Guests are nice and tip respectively. The hardest is part is I guess our ""rush hours"" where everything becomes busy and a lot of guests come to eat, you have to very quick yet very precise with everything."
good,I made good money working there. Had great managers. had good hours. very good atmosphere. they closed down so I lost my job. I had great customers we served great ethnic jammacan style food.
good,"I really enjoyed being able to work with fans , have lots of guest interaction and also being able to contribute a very well detail oriented and precise employee for Garden."
good,Good managers and good place to make money as a server if you are good at your job. Must be able to multitask in order to be a good server thus resulting in better tips.
good,"My time with this company was heavily based on hitting a set number of dials each day and was overseen by a outstandingly difficult manager who is no longer with the company, but was the catalyst for myself and many others to seek employment elsewhere."
good,"I did have my good days and bad days there, but it was never short of a great time every shift I worked. Typical day would vary, there were the slow lunch shifts, and then the fast paced nights, though sometimes stressful, I would go back. The management wasn't always on top I felt like; Sometimes I felt looked down upon and favoritism was a big part. I did always have a smile on my face regardless of how I was treated, I respected my managers at all times. I would say the hardest part of the job was working our busiest nights and powering through the immense stress that was put on top of me even when I thought I was breaking. Some employees there treated me like family, like a sister, some weren't the best kinds of people at times, my coworkers were the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,Very good practices for food preparation and sanitation. Quality ingredients and a knowledgeable staff. Plenty of options for advancement. Hours can be rough
good,"Learned a lot about the food industry particularly sea food."
good,Job with endless possibilities. The company offers excellent benefit compensation(s). You work a lot of hours but the experience is fun and exciting.
good,"Working for Darden Restaurants gave me the opportunity to enhance my customer service skills, while interacting with guests and providing them with exceptional service. I gave 100% everyday for 13 years and received outstanding reviews throughout my employment. My co-workers were easy to get along with and open to any expertise I had to offer. Management turned over quite a bit and since each new member had different ideas on how to enhance dining experience , it had become quite difficult to change so drastically in such a short period of time. I cant say the job was hard , but it's not for everyone. I enjoyed most about working for Darden was the chance to meet new people everyday , and see the smiles and hear compliments of what a great experience they had while dining with me."
good,"Handling of orders placed by customers."
good,"Olive Garden is great to work at, service wise. However, the management team isn't the greatest since I've worked there the past year. Co-workers are great but the management team definitely needs improvement. The hardest part of the job is trying to get used to all the changes they continuously make."
good,"As a Sales Manager with Darden, I develop, nurture, and sustain relationships with local businesses and organizations to maintain a broad network of clients. My responsibilities include managing my allocated funds to effectively drive sales growth, planning and executing private events for social and company functions, and managing team members in the execution of events. I work closely with team members throughout the Darden concept to ensure that my efforts are aimed towards company goals."
good,"I love the people I work with. It gets busy at my location and everyone helps everyone else out. Things could be more organized with scheduling, etc. but overall you make good money and have fun doing it."
good,"Number 1 priority is customer satisfaction, always keep watchful eye on labor and food cost. A good is when you suddenly realized that it is time to close for the day."
good,Management lost touch with those that do the work all the way down to the server and dishwasher level.Darden was a good place to work. It is a large company that is a top heavy on the management side.
good,Darden is a large company that has lots of opportunity.  There are many great people working here.  The difficulties lie with it being a large company.  You also have the added pressure of dealing with hourly team members. 
good,Company in a whole is great to work for. There are people who do not always have your back and hang you out to dry.
good,Good stable place to work.
good,Management was warm and welcoming a well as thoroughly knowledgable and equipped to help train new employees and assist customers. I served as a waitress for this company for over a year and it was one of the best serving jobs I have had. The hardest part would have been theunstable pay because as a waitress you are unable to predict a given amount which you will make in tips. Most enjoyable part of the job - the people you meet in the work team and customers.
good,"Olive Garden was a fantastic place to work. The culture is rich in what they believe for customer/guest service. I was a manager for them for years and enjoyed it very much. the compensation/benefits that the company provides is great. advancement can be quick, job sercurity between 1 and 10, I give it a 5. reasons that cant be explained. Work/life balance they try to give, but can be more work than family balance. The job of Manager in itself is a great opportunity for anyone who like a fast paced and productive line of work."
good,"As a server my main objective is to have superior menu knowledge. "
good,Buena compañía responsable. Buenos beneficios. Buena iteración con los empleados..
good,"Un lugar muy positivo para trabajar dependiendo en el"
good,"Everyone is friendly, we all help each other on whatever needs to be done."
good,"It was good to work at but getting 100 dollar a week wasnt cutting it and wasnt enough for my living arrangements. "
good,"Working for Darden, Olive Garden specifically, is a pretty good job to have as a supplement to your income or while in school. The work load is heavy compared to other serving jobs because of the endless soup salad and bread but the flexibility makes up for this. Since the bills aren't typically very high the pay isn't as much as a high end restaurant but compared to other hourly waged jobs this one pays well. If you work hard and take more tables than required you can make pretty good money. The hardest part of the job is the endless options, including the soup salad and bread and also the seasonal never ending pasta. It also becomes difficult when things run out, such as glasses breadsticks or food items, but with a good staff and management this shouldn't be a daily problem."
good,"Very busy, fast-paced, sociable, keeps you on your toes. A regular day at my job consisted of helping customers, cleaning, prepping, making sure you manage time & getting everything done."
good,"Decent place to work, advanced technologies and big corporate guidelines make job easy to perform. Company made flexible schedules easy to obtain. Can easily pick up shifts if you wanted more hours."
good,Enjoyed working for Darden for 4 years. Management was very professional and helpful whenever there was an issue that needed resolution. Flexible for me while i was in school.
good,They are very understanding and this is a nice place to work and have benefits. The most enjoyable this is you gain family. Everyone looks out for each other.
good,"It is a great place to work with lots of benefits. However, advancement is inevitable and sometimes as good as the environs is one has to part ways or go part time."
good,"The managers I've worked with come off disrespectful and rude, that's the only con about working here but overall great place to work at. Awesome coworkers."
good,"Was a good company to work for, but the pay was too low so I moved to another company.  I got experience working for them though which helped to move into an IT company."
good,I was with the company for over 10 years.  I grew and then I had to leave. While there I learned a great deal and then i hit a plateau on growth with the company.
good,I worked at the Olive Garden Restaurant is was great. The teamwork was great. I would highly recommend this job to my peers. Opportunities to raise your pay came often.
good,"The restaurant is a great place to work. As a server, it is very islandy and the music makes you feel like your away on vacation. Management is strict, but well understanding."
good,Working for a Darden restaurant(Olive Garden) has taught me a lot about handling a face paced stressful job. The people there were very friendly and it was very easy to get along and work together. The best part of the job was seeing my hard work turn into tips.
good,Darden is a great company to work for. It should be understood that if your work ethic is not there someone else can and will step in. There are many different job codes and growing opportunities as well
good,I loved going in everyday because my Manager was the best.  I learned new things everyday and went out and marketed often which was loads of fun.  I would go back to the company if they offered me a good position.  When my manager left I went with to outback.
good,My time at Darden although short I enjoyed my time there learning about the history and culture of the company there are great people at Darden who make the job worth wild and also some negative veterans who do the company a disservice.
good,Working at cheddar's scratch kitchen was much lower paying and more poorly run than working at olive garden.  It's nice to be able to swap shifts and change your schedule around when necessary.
good,"Over all Olive Garden at the Legends in Kansas City is a wonderful place to eat, but not the kind of work I'm looking to do. The people there are all nice and care about working as a team."
good,"Great teamwork oriented job, GREAT management, training servers are very friendly and hands on, very attentive. all the managers are great, if i needed anything they were there for me."
good,The company has struggled to decide where it fits in the Darden family of restaurants. With Darden taking on higher-end brands it is quickly becoming the stepchild of Darden.
good,"Everyone was pretty friendly "
good,Darden is a good company to work for. One of the largest in the restaurant industry and they care about their people very much. Would go back in a heartbeart
good,"Dish duty's night shift stays until about 3 hrs after close. The grill area gets to be about 125 deg f°. Truck order was my favorite job duty, but interacting with the guests was the most satisfying part of my days."
good,I have enjoyed my time working for Darden Restaurants. I have been able to meet many wonderful people from guests to coworkers. Management is very helpful with scheduling conflicts and is always willing and able to help you with needs or concerns.
good,"This was a great place to work while going to college. The shifts were short, and my part-time schedule was flexible. I enjoyed being part of a customer service team that really cared about the customer."
good,My serving position was relatively standard. I needed this position to cover basic expenses while attending university. The most enjoyable part of the position was building relationships with my co-workers.
good,"The money is adequate, the staff works as a team and the management is flexible to students. Although I did not recieve weekly paychecks because of my job as a server I was compensated well throughout my six years."
good,I think Darden is a great company to work for and has lots of opportunity. The environment is fun and open minded. Darden has a great benefit selection as well as Banking/Gym/Clinic onsite.
good,"Good money, good clientele, best management I've ever worked for. Fast paced. I could work less than 20 hours a week and still pay all my bills. It was nice."
good,Overall good company to work for. Very stressful but nice considering the entry requirements to work your way up management. If you like people you will like working for Darden.
good,I worked for multiple Darden concepts and I enjoyed working for all of them. One of the biggest changes that I have seen is the growth with upper management and taking care of the people below them. It all trickles down hill
good,Fun work place.  Long hours.  Didn't see much room for growth in the city that I worked.  Had a great time developing young talent.  Made great improvements to my location.
good,working for darden can be great at times but the cost of staying extremely competitive  can begin to weigh on you.  Over time leadership loses focus and changes direction quickly.
good,The people make this a great place to work. Teamwork is used to take the burden off one and shift it so customers have an awesome experience. The food is delicious and inexpensive.
good,"Average tippers, great staff and friendly management. If you have little to no job experience then Olive Garden is a great starting point. You have the potential to make as much money as you want and its honestly not that hard to accomplish that."
good,"fast paced, quick money, friendly people. I learned how to truly multi-task in a restaurant setting. I like coming in on a busy day and making about $200 cash in four hours."
good,"Olive Garden has provided me with great flexibility with consideration for my young family and pursuit of my education while working. It also provided me with benefits for vacation, health,  vision and dental, and life insurance. These benefits are rare for someone in the service industry."
good,many great benefits.Good opps for advancement as long as you can re-locate.great bonus potential but difficult goals to achieve. Must ACE all categories.
good,its fun working with the people at olive garden and while working there you're always busy. while working it has it's ups and downs but it's a good place to work.
good,Learned a lot from working here and enjoyed working for longhorn more because the managers were way better. The environment was better and more enjoyable. But I made more money working for red lobster.
good,"While working at Red Lobster and Olive Garden I built people skills, organization, and problem-solving. Worked with a great team of servers, bartenders, host staff, line cooks and management."
good,It's a great company to start being young and while in school. Very willing to accommodate teenagers attending college or high school. Nice platform to start your hospitality career.
good,Mangers are real professional  and hardworkers hardest part of the day is in the afternoon it really gets busy the most enjoyable part of the is going home.
good,"Listening to music with a fast paced cooking environment, while communicating and keep track was what truly interested my reason for staying at the job."
good,"I love working here, but the only problem is that if you let them they will take over your life. I barely get to see my family on holidays anymore because I'm working all the time."
good,"We work hard and play hard.  There is always something going on at Darden Restaurants, be it large process improvement project or integrating a new restaurant.  Darden is an exciting place to belong to.  Our restaurant operators come first as they serve our guests.  When the Restaurant Support Center is successful with supporting our operators, we take the time to celebrate the harvest of everyone's hard-work."
good,I have worked for olive garden for 7 years now. I have always like the way the business has been run and they have been very flexible with my hours since I've been in school
good,"Great training, great growth potential, awesome bosses. Always helped us out when we needed it and was always able to get hours in any position if needed."
good,Darden is a great company to work for.  Consistent bonuses organized training and structured policies in place. Consistent development from Directors and great communication from upper managements/ operations.
good,"While working at Eddie V I spent my time mostly waiting tables and being responsible for my specific section. I ensured an excellent dining experience be describing the food and its preparation, offering expert wine and side(additions) pairings. What did I learn? I learned a lot more about wine due to an amazing wine list. The hardest part of working there I guess would be the long hours and heat during summer, but for the most part, Eddie V's La Jolla is a geat place to work. The staff is A+ and the culture and comradery there is second to none. I look at my time there fondly and I plan to go back and visit often. I wish them all good health and success!!!"
good,Decent work place. Flexible schedule from Monday to Thursday. Your Friday to Sunday are pretty non-existent. Management is fair. Make a decent amount of money.
good,"had a lot of time to be able to be at home with my family"
good,"I worked at OG for 10 years, I met many managers and had many coworkers. I liked working for this company. We had training sessions, we were constantly informed of new policies and our managers were always approachable. This is a good place to work. "
good,"I really enjoyed working at The Capital Grille because of the way all of the employees worked together as a team. Everyone treated the guest as if they were guest in our homes. We all worked together, when one needed help whether it was in our job description or not, we helped each other! I enjoy keeping things in order so running the front was fun for me."
good,Overall working as a server for Darden Restaurants has been quite enjoyable. The following restaurant franchise offers a wide variety of wine beverages and menu cuisine items. Highly recommended to both visit and work for.
good,"I loved working at the Olive Garden Restaurant in Oxford, AL. The management staff was exceptional, and the coworkers were very friendly. We were like one big family. The hardest part of my job was when we were extremely busy, and wanted to provide every guest with the best service possible. Sometimes it was very intense and could be very frustrating. But at the end of the day it was worth it. As a bartender I made an excellent income. The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction I received at the end of the day with a pocket full of money and friendships created with my coworkers."
good,"I loved working at Indeed as an intern! The culture is wonderful and the in-office perks are cool. From my experience on the Sales team, I can see that there are lots of opportunities for growth!"
good,"Busy hotel front desk, with many chances to learn the business."
good,"With Darden, I was able to completely exit one profession and industry and within a year, I was able to excel and exceed even my own expectation in an entirely different profession and industry"
good,"Great Company to work for.  They are currently restructuring, so nobody's job is really secure at the moment.  Management is great to work for and co-workers for the most part are very helpful and eager to lend a hand."
good,Great job. Has been very flexible over the years as I attended college. Excelled and mastered customer service and sales skills. Management and co workers worked as a team.
good,I started as a server here and grew very quickly. hard work and being knowledgeable is key! I would work for Darden again just because of the great opportunity to grow!
good,"Pros"
good,"This is a fast pace and fun to work at if you enjoy seafood, the days start early and only on some occasion have to stay late. Management is good and very smart on there jobs. They offer half off on lunches and dinners."
good,"When Darden executes their idea there are strict & well organized/understandable directions to how exactly it needs to be done. Therefore, the outcome is positive because the expectations of those who are the leaders of execution, such as myself (manager), had already been previously stated.  Very good at ""Follow Up"" in every department."
good,The staff are really great people. It is nice going to work and being with a second family. Management does their best to keep everyone happy. When you aren't in the slow months money is really good there too!
good,Loved working for Darden. Hours could be long but advancement within the company was always encouraged.
good,I am a people person so being able to meet new people every day was nice did not like the food to much because I am not a seafood type person but my experience there was great. Management was great we always had fun on the job.
good,"I managed opportunities in running food and labor cost."
good,"A typical day at work I come in clock in and prepare for the shift."
good,"it was ok, cleaning dishes and getting tips rocked. prep was easy but tedious."
good,"Technology & Security focus... Social Media focus"
good,I started with Darden in 2006. I was recruited by Darden from Bethune Cookman University and also recognized by Walt Disney World as one of the top hospitality students at my university. I have had the opportunity to grow tremendously over the past 8 years. Great company to be with.
good,"My managers were amazing. They genuinely cared about you and worked with you to excel. Typically, a dinner shift would be busy with every person working 3-4 tables. I learned how to prioritize and manage multiple tasks at once. You really need to work as a team to get things done in a place like this. Any personal issues you have with someone can be taken care of later but at that moment you have a job to do. The hardest part of the job by far is getting triple sat with a large party. Which means you have three new tables all at once and one of them includes more than seven people. That is when team work is most essential. The most enjoyable is meeting and interacting with different people and personalities, and building those ties with your coworkers."
good,working at the location I did required not much time for error was a very fast paced work place where mistakes had to be as minimal as possible the management and crew got along great everyone worked well together learning all the personality's and change in how each manager like their shift ran the routine of the restaurant only changed with the seasons. the hardest part had to be the slow days that seamed that they would take forever.
good,Work consisted of me assisting others and greeting guest with a smile when they walked through the door. I developed social and leadership skills. Management was great and consisted of honest caring people. They really treat you like you are part of one big happy family. I got along well with co-workers. They were there whenever assistance was needed. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was adapting to change. With it begin a family restaurant there were always changes to be made to better guest experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people on a day-to-day basis.
good,"Busy and high paced stores, menus change with the seasons and keep people happy."
good,"prepare, cut cook restack clean and make sure that my station is ready to go."
good,"I imagine that the experience differs widely from restaurant to restaurant, but from my time spent with three branches of the Olive Garden division, I felt respected as a professional in a positive environment."
good,"Dardens is the only restaurant  company in the fortune 500."
good,"High Volume"
good,"Working for Darden restaurants got me through college and was a fun work experience. Everyone was like a family and we all helped each other out and built strong relationships that I still have and value today. The management was great and kept us positive. I worked for Red Lobster in Tallahassee and then transferred to Seasons 52 when I moved to south Florida. These were two very different work environments but both were great in different ways. I was sad when I left but I was ready for a day job with a steady schedule and paycheck. My favorite part of Red Lobster was my co workers. Best group of people I think I have ever worked with. My least favorite part of working at Red Lobster was closing. Being a closer was never fun because the kitchen was ready to go, the crowd that came in late usually tended to be on the rude side and as your co workers were getting off you were left at times on a scavenger hunt trying to find what your customer was requesting but you push through it. At Seasons 52, closing was completely different. The clientele in general was completely different and the kitchen was ready to keep going until the doors were locked. Seasons 52 was much more organized and less scavenger hunts took place. My favorite part of working at Seasons 52 was the atmosphere of the restaurant and when we switched menu's we had meetings to go over it and everyone got to sample the dishes. My least favorite part of Seasons 52 was working nights and weekends and not having a set schedule. Overall, working in both these restaurants I learned so much about working as a team, speaking"
good,Darden Restaurants Inc. provides several different employment opportunities with more than a handful of different companies to work for.  
good,- Manage crew members each day to reach desired objective to serve all guests as best as possible
good,Great team. Corporate was a pleasure. I met many people including the president. I was treated as an equal and would suggest this company if you are wanting hospitality as a career.
good,A typical day at work can be very challenging as well as exciting. I have learned the value of people and how to operate a multi-billion dollar operation. Working with my peers is great because I am continuously learning from them daily. The hardest part of my job will probably be those days that I left for the day and I felt I didn't give 100%. I like to be the best at what I do and that feeling of doing a great job makes my days complete. The most enjoyable part of my job is when we get the opportunity to promote enternally. The looks on the team members faces when they are recognized makes my day.
good,"Darden has its up,s and down just like most companies ,  It was ok working there but I felt everyone was always fighting for hours, I thought it would be more organized."
good,"Its a really good company with a lot of benefits, its a good start for those that dont have a lot of experience working at restaurants."
good,I worked for Darden Restaurants through a branch of the company known as Olive Garden. While working there I quickly amassed a great number of friendly and hard-working coworkers that I grew to call friends as well. I worked hard and it payed off almost instantly becoming not only a full time employee but also a certified trainer in my job code before any other employees that were not already one in my job code. The managers were like family and treated everyone as such. The motto when you are here your family not only applies to the customers but is also a bond between the employees themselves.
good,The environment was good for the most part.  Overall the restaurant I worked at was very fun and energetic. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be a server
good,Darden is a great company to work for. All in all it was a great company. Just expect to be pushed hard to both achieve the concepts and excel at your contract. Help is needed if you desire but expect them to make your situation seem like a walk in the park.
good,"I would recommend job to my friends and family."
good,It’s one of my favorites jobs I like my coworkers my managers it’s a nice warm place for work.they pay weekly I had benefits and always is a opportunity to improve yourself
good,Management could be a tad more adhesive. The team members make work life feel family oriented. Training is amazing. You really get a sense of fast paced experience
good,"I had to leave for personal issues and due to poor management (who is now gone). However, being a host here was an awesome experience where I made tons of friends, learned lifeskill, and overall made me more mature. The job isn't too hard but can be stressful on high volume nights. I did love the atmosphere and still have great friends that were co-workers."
good,"Red Lobster was a good place to work for those who needed flexible scheduling and who needed more shifts. The job is stressful, but the culinary members you work with are great."
good,"Fast pace, always learning and providing genuine dining,  can be busy and need to multitask.   learning is constant as dishes do change and wine knowledge is a plus"
good,"Great structured work environment, great people to work with, enjoyed the food. Management are there for you when in need."
good,The work environment becomes your home and your co workers become family which is both good and bad.  Management is really nice but could be more firm.
good,"Maintain a controllable and relaxed restaurant"
good,"This job was a great opportunity that I've had in my life. While working in the restaurant business, it is difficult to find a decent paying job WITH benefits. Darden accomplishes this. Their pay is decent for the jobs performed, and they also have a great benefit package as well as 401K. I enjoyed being challenged while working here."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when you make it out of being super busy with a nice amount of tips because you know you put the work in to get it.
good,Olive Garden was an enjoyable restaurant to grow in. I started as a host and moved up to a full time server. I began server training and although I was not able to finish I still experienced plenty of great skills. I was never short on friends and family while I was employed it was a very tight knit corporation. We were always being pushed to our limits and exceeded our goals multiple times. The only reason for leaving was moved current location.
good,Darden Restaurants was a great company to work for over the past 15 years. They provided me with a challenging position that stretched and helped me grow professionally and personally.
good,"I enjoyed my 14+ years at Olive Garden."
good,"great first job, I learned many different positions from making soups to bussing tables. the co workers are great, every one is family at the olive garden 1540"
good,"I am not a very outgoing person. I think this is a wonderful company to work for if you're good at your job and I was not. I'm not server material, it kind of ran me ragged. I didn't make much money here BUT I had many friends here and everyone else seemed to be doing much better in tips than I was so I think I was the problem, not the establishment."
good,Very much what you want from a company supportive but fair if you are wrong you will be told so and how to correct the issue. The training was great rewards were fair overall I should have stayed with the company
good,"A typical day was pleasing the guest/s.  I learned that faster is not better, however thinking and understanding the guest was much more pleasing and appreciative to the guest.  I believe the management was fair and balanced.  I, honestly know, that many co-workers, as much as they were liked by me were caring and honest, but sadly, some were not.  Which to me, is a part of life.  The hardest job was dealing with ""the same person"" week after week, but they still had some issue.  I just smiled and the person was seemingly happy, but then again, that is part of life.  They still returned.  Sadly, with another issue.  ha.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers who smiled, the management who appreciated my work, the co-workers who all loved me.  I got a hug by every co-worker when I walked in regardless of male or female."
good,"I love my job and the people I work with. I admire my managers. They have so much they have to do day in and day out; from helping seat guests to helping prepare food. My co-workers are great. We always work as a team (the whole restaurant does). We help each brighten each others day if one of us is down. "
good,Great place to grow while in the food service industry. They have a great mentoring plan in place. and they are an employee first type of company.
good,"Work included interaction with customers on a daily basis. Training and following company standards through implementing core values of respect, integrity, genuine caring, hospitality, and teamwork. Fun work environment where teamwork is highly encouraged. Great benefits for crew. Lots of opportunities for upward mobility and promotion within the company."
good,"Great company. They are good with employees and the employees love working for Darden. I would still be with them, if I were closer. "
good,"I have no complaints about Darden, everyone makes you feel very welcomed and the job itself isn't too hard. The only thing is I feel like at times the work we do is unappreciated. Also I feel like the start pay should be at least $10.50 not just $10.00."
good,I believe this job is best beneficial in developing social skills. They are happy to help with as much as they can. The company provides many benefits.
good,"Things break down, people go crazy and over all you should expect complications anywhere."
good,"Darden restaurants are a great place for employees to learn top level standards. Standards ranging from safety, appearance and customer service. Most restaurants are high volume and fast passed which is a great environment to learn and grow in."
good,Is the most enjoyable work i have worked in my life.  It was a good place to work it wasnt stressful at all. I love the empolyess in the work place.  Everyone was a good place to talk to wihout problems.
good,"Pretty good follow throughs with advancement on management, if you work hard they see and appreciate it. Pretty fair and solid money. Late hours but out before 3."
good,I started on august of 2017 after moving to ohio from kentucky . What i loved about Darden was everything it offered to it's employees ranging from paid vacations to meal discounts.
good,"Like most restaurants, when you have a great team to work with this job can be really easy and fun. Some of the restaurants are better than others but they all have pretty good deals."
good,In the morning its get there and go. Our Managers are in relax mode. Having to do the managers work was not fair for anyone. It was enjoyable for awhile.
good,"A typical work day was busy.  I was a service professional, so my job was to assist the managers with the guest.   Hardest part of the job was dealing with guest that were unhappy.  I enjoyed talking with the guest"
good,Busy weekends but always fun to work given the large staff levels. company required for every 3 tables one server. Th hardest part of the job was on documenting employee performance as the company truly believes team members need to have job security.
good,"I learned all positions, so I was able to bounce around for being cross trained.  The only thing hard was working a 3 man station by myself. The most enjoyable thing about working was atmosphere."
good,Great opportunities and room for advancement. Great training. Job security and insurance provided as well.
good,"I have been with this company for over nine years and love the environment, benefits, employees, and management. I have learned how to be a better team player as well as how to give exceptional customer service. In addition, I have had the opportunity to learn leadership skills through their Certified personal trainer program as well as the certified culinary professional position. Being a leader in my profession, has set a higher standard for myself which has lead to the work ethic and drive that I have today. I have come to know and respect my fellow employee and management staff and look forward to see them grow as I hope to continue to do as well."
good,"It was a friendly work environment. The promotions come easily as long employees do their work. Raises are given every six months according to employee review,"
good,"the restaurant was always busy, first thing needs to b made when I walk in is sauce never fails check the prep food the line was low on and make a list and go from there. usually they need help I try to help the best I can make some dishes and stock the best I can very fast pace job but it was fun and keeps you busy. I learned a lot of recipes and dishes and how to work on a full service restaurant. the hardest part of the job wa the cleaning at the end of the night"
good,"A wonderful employer, fantastic people, and an experience of meeting and getting to know dozens of guests a day. We had a team of strong and efficient managers, and wonderful helpful coworkers. It was difficult working around getting tipped instead of hourly wage because it was difficult to plan around a constantly fluctuating amount of hours and income."
good,"A very hospitable environment and fun place to work in."
good,Worked with positive employees and very popular restaurant.  Learned about wines and how to sell wines.  Management were a great support when I started.  Hardest part about the job was losing good employees.
good,"manage 3 to 5 tables, making sure geust satisfuction with the food and the service, manage time"
good,Company is very strong. Flexible with your schedule. They are apprecitive of your job performance. Chef's are hands on all the time making sure all items are prepared correctly.
good,"I worked at The Yard House Fenway and Springfield.  By and large the Management teams at both locations were outstanding. The culture, the food, the beverage offerings, and the comradery are aspects that I carry with me to new jobs.  If there were a Yard House near me I would be working there still."
good,"Working for Darden was a good experience. I learned a lot about their computer program for Hostess. I was able to meet lots of people and interact with other employees, management and customers. The job does get a little fast paced and can become very stressful very quickly when first starting out. Overall, working for Darden was a very pleasant experience."
good,"Darden is such a great company to work for! I graduated high school, got my first job at Red Lobster and loved it! I’ve been with the company since May 2011."
good,"Very well, friendly. Great benefits and a great management team.open door policy and are willing to listen and assist you. Work tools and and a very well training process."
good,"Great benefits programs"
good,"Darden restaurant are a great family restaurant. With different types of food."
good,Enjoyed working for Darden Restaurants. Managed to learn all stations in the kitchen in less than 2 months. Was also called in a number of times to help with doing morning prep. I mostly worked nights on the line.
good,"Coming from working in restaurants for a while, olive gardens menu is pretty straight forward. Food rotation is always accounted for, the trainers know their facts, organization is static."
good,"Good working environment, steady year round employment but busier in the summer.  Decent pay and benefits.  Excellent food and management.  Recommend."
good,I started with the company as a bartender and within a couple of years I was promoted to services management then a couple of more years promoted to general manager
good,start off with great spirits and people and if you  are a coffee fan you will fall in love with fresh brew  good vibes all day long
good,"Great management, taught me how hands on leadership within a company is extremely important and being able to use time management wisely."
good,"Good management. Excellent company. Slightly slow at advancement paperwork for hopeful advancement candidates, and sometimes small favoritism played at the restaurant level"
good,Everyday is a different experience because working with the public can be unexpected mood flow. The most enjoyable part of my day is being able to make someone smile and enjoy themselves. My co workers are like family Olive Garden has that slogan for a reason the Italian way is to welcome and it is a wonderful place to work.
good,"The management is great at the Olive Garden I work at. There is not much sidework which allows you to focus on making a great experience for your customers and not getting ""in the weeds"" and potentially messing orders up. The staff there is very friendly and willing to help out if needed."
good,"Longhorn steakhouse is an interesting place to work. At times it can be stressful and full of surprises. We often stay busy from clock in to clock out. It is an entertaining place to work, we tend to get interesting customers at times. I enjoy staying busy and communicating with the customers and my co-workers. I have learned many things from working here. It taught me how to handle stressful situations, deal with distraught customers, and promptness. The co-workers at my job are hardworking and were very helpful when I first began working there. The management at Longhorn is tactful and professional. All of the mangers were friendly and understanding to every employees' needs. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was managing time and making angry customers satisfied even when some were disrespectful. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing satisfied customers. "
good,I learned a lot about cooking different foods and how to prepare them. it was always enjoyable working with my co-workers. Management was always available to talk to about anything.
good,At Darden there was a quality of life with all employees if felt like they cared about what went on at work and outside of work. They always try to grow the employees coach and continuously training.
good,Management was super friendly. Everyone there really felt like a family. Great benefits along with a really positive and energized environment. Job task were very easy and manageable.
good,I was there a while and have a lot of experience under my belt because of them.  Enjoyed working there and making good friends with management as well as the team.
good,Great at delivering the Italian dining experience with a focus on 100 percent guest delight. A passion to maintain a high standard of service.
good,"High turn-around rate leaving many untrained employees. Managers never around. All other locations had advancement opportunities NOT available in the R.Mount location the entire 3 years I was there. If you happen to be a strong server, management will place all parties on you so they can get a good rating and NO gratuity even for parties over 40 people!!"
good,"Co Worker insults is not at all etiquite in self awareness, The lanky shaved headed manager was extremely unreasonable selfish/thoughtless creature . All Crew members aren't entitled to the dishwashers boss title position . ."
good,"I have worked here on and off for 18 years"
good,"I worked at two different locations. I liked different things about each. While I liked the restaurant atmosphere for a job, I got perspective about how controlling it is to work for a corporation. After I started working at a local restaurant I could not put up with the dictatorship of the corporate world."
good,"Working at there was very interesting.  I enjoyed working there to meet the customers and provide them with excellent dining experience.  I felt I was very good at my job. However, the management at the time I did not approve off.  They treated customers and their employees every bad.  My co-workers and the customers were the reason I stayed for so long."
good,The most enjoyable part of Darden Restaurants would be the guests and the opportunity to serve them during their special occasions.
good,"Darden has not cared about employees of all levels ever but will give just about anyone the experience need to start up a career. I earned my first restaurant experience here and took these tools with me, I was able to be confident working in any restaurant environment because of Darden. I will say that Darden looks for little to no ways to accommodate employees that have put there heart and soul into the jobs, only management and they do the minimum best but get treated better than the working machine, the employees make Darden to what it is today. Just working well always pays off in the future no matter how rich or poor you are treated, because I benefited."
good,Limited advancement opportunities.  More opportunities to contractors rather than FT team members.  Hardly any work/life balance.  Pay and benefits are above par.
good,The only problem I had working at with an affiliate of Darden is that the restaurant couldn't work with my college schedule.
good,"I love Olive Garden because I was able to implement and develop very important skills such as multitasking, time management, and customer service. It is essential to be one that is personable and knows how to treat their guests. My management was all about the benefit of the company in that, I do my job effectively, the company will prosper."
good,"Good place to work but management culture changed more towards making the customer happy, no matter what. I agree the customer should get what they order but it got way out of hand."
good,"The company has a strong culture, values its employees, provides a great work/life balance and i recommend the organization.  Great opportunities across all levels."
good,So you get paid weekly on hourly pay which is depending on what position you apply for. Then everyday your tips will load on your card. So you technically get paid every day. Host get I think 2% of each table pay.
good,I enjoyed working at the establishment very much. I had a good team and a great management overhead. I would highly recommend anyone looking into the service industry to join this team.
good,I loved working for Darden. Great atmosphere. The flexibility was incredible. Anytime I needed to leave early or had an emergency they helped. Scheduling was always what I needed
good,"Intense environment. Lots of opportunity to grow exposure and experience with a wide range of platforms, in house apps, and COTS solutions. Not much of a career path once you hit the senior technology levels. Great benefits and bonus/LTI programs."
good,"Enjoyed being part of an elite management team, that achieved Darden’s Diamond Club status 4 consecutive years in a row. If it wasn’t for my ankle issues, I would have never left such an awesome work place. O-Town YH rocks!"
good,A typical work day would consist of high volume customer and server need. The overall hardest part of the job was to maintain a high level of response between the back of the house and front of the house staff. Supervisors were very well balanced in both aspects of the communication. I learned how to maintain a high level of customer service through strong ethic and strong verbal and computer skills.
good,"•	Accomplishes restaurant and bar human resource objectives by recruiting, selecting, orienting, training, assigning, scheduling, coaching, counseling, and disciplining management staff; communicating job expectations; planning, monitoring, appraising, and reviewing job contributions; planning and reviewing compensation actions; enforcing policies and procedures."

good,"Darden is a great company and working for them was like working with family. The management always made sure everyone had what they needed to get the job done with a smile on their face. "
good,"Serving is very hard, especially at Olive Garden because of table set ups, but it helped shape who I am. The management was great and I am forever thankful for the experience I had working there for so long. I enjoyed guest interactions."
good,"This is a fast paced working environment with great people, helpful co-workers and great management.  The hardest part of this job is timing.  Great service equals great tips."
good,Worked with really awesome people while working for Darden. Still go and visit because everyone is still so close to me. Everyone helps each other and also has good competitive spirits≥
good,great hours and benifits. learned alot about working for a super large company. Has a huge support team that helps managers in the field
good,"Great management team. Darden Restaurants was a wonderful company to work for. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to make someone's day and make them ""feel like family"" when they were at my table."
good,Working for Red Lobster (Darden) was fun and rewarding. But I moved up in positions until there were not any management opportunities available. I had to look for a place I could advance
good,"when i started working here i pretty much know how to do everything and make all the food, the team members was all nice and everybody help one another"
good,Loved working here.  Company took real good care of employees.  Great opportunities to learn and grow.  Management did an incredible job of supporting the employees.
good,Spent 7 years of my life at OG. They always worked with me so I could continue to better myself and complete my education. I would work there again if I ever needed.
good,Very interesting at first. Takes some time to get used too but a great learning experience. Would def go back and do it again. Love the ppl as well.
good,the training i recieved at darden shaped a lot of my opinions about customer service and the way that people should be treated as customers.
good,not the greatest resturant all abOUT LOCATION. IF YOU WORK HERE WORK HURSTBOURNE BUT BE PREPARED TO WORK
good,Darden is a good place to work. You have to work hard and get results if you ever want to be promoted. Senior Leadership is good support.
good,Open at 11 get first guests by 1105 wow them .Stay busy all day and love it.I learned that every person is important and should be treated the same way.Our management team is awesome.My co-workers are my friends.The hardest part of my job is not being able to correct an issue.The most enjoyable part of my job is making someone smile when they are having a bad day.
good,Keeps you busy which is a plus for me. You can advance in position but only with 100% availability. Employee appreciation is not a priority.
good,good place to work was a lot of fun. management was a lot of help with training servers and making sure table selection was fair.
good,Great company because of the friendly professional people.
good,Fun corporate environment.  I really enjoyed talking with the customers and resolving any issues knowing we were producing a high quality product.  I was involved with all areas of the restaurant and I learned about the workings of a high volume kitchen.  I really enjoyed the hiring of new employees and the training of these employees into positive and competent representatives of the restaurant.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is actually interacting with many different types of people. Being able to communicate with others is definitely a plus while maintaing this position. Although some people try to ruin your day, the fun part is maintaining calm and continue to serve them with a smile on your face."
good,An excellent Fortune 500 for those interested in hospitality.
good,Darden Restaurants allowed me to gain experience in the hospitality industry.
good,"Darden is a great company that has wonderful benefits, promotes fairness and integrity in the work place as well as total support for career success."
good,I liked the fact that I left there with cash in my hand.  It made me appreciate all the other jobs that came after it.
good,"excelente, aprendi a hablar un poco ingles, a preparar alimentos, buena relacion con mis manager, fue dificil el idioma y me gusto mucho conocer acerca de los alimentos, fue nuevo para mi todo."
good,"Walking into Olive Garden is like a break from the world. I feel that they are more than just co-workers, they are like family. From the coworkers, to the managers, to the guest(s) everyone acts as if they knew you for a long time. They accepted me in with open arms and i am forever grateful to be part of such great environment. Working here, i have learned numerous things, one main thing I have learned is Spanish. Everyone is willing to help and take time to make sure I understand them and that they understand me. as the To-Go specialist, i have realized how much people depend on me. I dont only take phone calls and place orders but i also help different departments such as the bar, or the host stand, or the alley where the food are made. My co-workers depend on me to help them get through stressful situations and so do my managers. I dont find anything at the job hard for me to do, I enjoy everything I do so whatever i did not get the first time, i repeat it until I max it the second or third time. I learned how to accept each and everyone no matter what, doing final bank drops for the company was something else i learned. Olive Garden also taught how to communicate better and be more relaxed and comfortable with the guest(s) that walked in everyday. They also taught me ""open-communication"", and how we do not blame nobody, we are all a team."
good,Darden is such a wonderful company to work for. Providing insurance and benefits to those who seek it whether your a young college student or have a family of 6! Very affordable in my opinion!
good,"The co-workers, management, and higher management were all great to work for."
good,Excellent leadership within the company.Constant company growth.Ongoing training provided.
good,"basic serving job that requires customer service, cash handling, and communication ability. pretty easy to work with pasta. Soup and salad combos sucked and would drive you crazy."
good,The company surprised me with how much they care about their employees. I would recommend working there. I was a server at Olive Garden and it was fun and fast paced
good,My review on a Darden restaurant was fun and competitive at the same time the only problem was dealing with the guests and the employees because we’re suppose to be a team not arguing and fighting one another .
good,A great place to work for building a resume and to get some experience under your belt. Customer service is a great skill you will learn while working here.
good,Loved it I was a team member and I grew in the company they trained you and treated you like family and ppl always helped out was very busy and there was never a dull moment
good,"Working in restaurants is not for everyone. This is a fast paced job that demands good teamwork and attention to detail always. This job comes with high levels of stress but can also be extremely rewarding. The chance for career advancement is almost none existent though as there are so many restaurants nationwide. Once you have made it to manager you begin to see the ceiling quickly falling down around you. If you are looking for a position that allows you to work 4-5 hours a day and make great money, then I would highly recommend looking into the serving/bartending but be warned that with this comes quite a bit of demand and stress."
good,"Fitness Center, Wellness Center, Pool Table, air hockey and Starbucks! Perks are great! 35% off of Darden dining card accepted at all Darden restaurants. Don't settle at a lower position to get your foot in the door, working your way up is very difficult, wait for the position that you are most qualified for. Managers are hit or miss, I have experienced the best manager I have ever had in my entire career and the worse. Some managers have a dictatorship mentality no matter how the employee responds to that leadership style they continue making everyone miserable while others treat you like family and focus on solutions and learning from mistakes without pointing fingers.When you interview remember you are interviewing the Manager as well so ask many questions!"
good,"Managers wearnt bad it's all you can eat everything plus entree wtf. Unorganized in wine the bartending jobs to much on guest, bar and employees. Could use more kitchen staff"
good,"no input accepted...Darden is the jolly green giant and is too caught up on who they were once were,  Too much of a mindset their **** does not stink and do it like this because we always have and it works.   Rigid to change."
good,"So, this was odd position for me to be given. I went into my interview applying for a server or a host, after talking with the kitchen manager he thought I had what it took (without any kitchen experience whatsoever) to be a kitchen expo for a very busy restaurant. I tackled the challenge and succeeded. It took some time to get a hang of running the whole kitchen from the dishes getting done to the plates of food being run out to our customers! Management was good however lack communication skills with its employees. I enjoyed working here and thought it was a good experience to add to my resume."
good,"The job is good, one of the managers is not good at all. She intimidates employees and make the workplace very hostile. Some good cleaning is done in the restaurant but it could be better. I enjoy working with the people."
good,I worked there for four years. I loved it most of the time. It was really hard to leave. I was trained in many positions. My only problem was there is not alot of chance for promotions.
good,Darden is a great company to work for. Initial salary and benefit options are great. However after taxes and insurance I feel I'm not paid what I'm worth. You have to rely on others doing their job in order to meet bonus.
good,"It was ok could of had better benefits for servers"
good,"I liked this job managers where friendly and caring, co-workers where also caring and friendly,I dont have nothing bad to say about long horn steak house"
good,Everyone there works hard.  There is not much drama in the work place because there is zero tolerance for bad behaviors.  Everyone prides themself to provide excellent guest satisfaction.  Those without these goals don't stay long there.
good,"Darden corporation better known as Olive Garden, is a very beneficial for college students and parent. Great benefits and opportunities for advancemen"
good,"I learned to be a server, bartender, and seafood expert working with this company. They do have a high turnover rate for servers and management."
good,Typical days at work are fast paced and can become very hectic. In an average day you take care of more than 50 guests if you work more than 4 hours.
good,"Friendly and fair management, and a healthy work environment."
good,"Serving was a great job for being young and choosing what path to choose in life for your career and also they were awesome with me while I was in school with working with my schduele.. I started working at Olive Garden in Longview, TX , here at home Clarksville, TN and while I was in school in Fort Myers, FL."
good,Darden does hire felons but you are unable to move up u stay at the same status u came in with no matter how hard u wrk how good u are there is no room for growth when u have a criminal background although I am great Full they hired me and gave me a chance I been there for 6 years I know the back of the house and the front of the house like the back of my hand but I’m stagnant
good,"Working here has really helped me keep a busy schedule. As a student, working as a sever was so helpful. The schedule is flexiavlw and the money was great."
good,"wonderful management that worked as part of the team, encouraged growth, and a good attitude. while also holding themselves to a high professional standard. an understanding of others capabilities, and positive encouragement to help them reach their highest potential. with shift discounts, and off shift discounts. discounts at darden locations other than your brand (e.g. work at Olive garden you also get a discount at long horn). wonderful company sponsored programs(darden Dimes), group health insurance with low rates and good coverage for entry level employees, and servers. tech forward thinking, great training program, knowledgeable staff that attracts a crowd of wonderful, and happy customers. a large, and growing business that doesn't follow business trends, but makes then perfects them."
good,"If you're a dedicated server, you'll be set here. Hours and breaks are great. Management is managed well without being micromanaged into stress. My only concern was theft by other staff members and no cameras for security."
good,"Its' good, only you are just another employee, everybody is friendly and helpful if you need help.  Hard to move up if you don't have a degree, and if your good at what you do and want to do something else it is difficult to move out of that department, not much opportunity of that."
good,I have worked for both Red Lobster and Longhorn Steakhouse. Both companies have been a pleasure to work for. I will continue to work with Longhorn Steakhouse until I find a career in nursing.
good,"Great up beat place to work. Fast pace environment with places to grow within the company."
good,"This company was great to work for and allowed me the opportunity to grow in my management style and offered benefits, bonus structure, and growth.  However the company as a whole started to take a down turn and in the management field you are aware of changes that a corporation will make in order to hit profit margins.  I seized the opportunity to continue with a different company"
good,The company is a great one to work for. Well at least on paper when it comes to execution some things maybe a little misguided but the goal is always to ensure a wonderful guest experience which is the most important vision.
good,"Typical waitress job coupled with a fun staff. Management was very flexible when working around my college courses schedules. My co-workers were the best, they covered for me when I needed them to and made the environment fun to be in. Hardest part of the job was balancing work, school, and family."
good,My job is fun and I get to connect with all different people. I have a hard time reconciling my home life and my work schedule and it is difficult to make a constant salary while earning tips.
good,"I was a host at Olive Garden. I eagerly greeted & seated guests as they arrived. When it got busy, we would pass out appetizers to the guests as they waited to be seated. Buzzers were handed out so they may walk about freely without losing their place in line. It was also up to me to maintain the cleanliness of the store, each morning & night & stock each servers section. I learned how to deal with difficult people, as people would get irritable when they've waited awhile and are hungry. I've learned to hide maintain a positive attitude when it got busy, such as multiple large parties arriving at once and how to keep a cool head when things don't go as planned. I couldn't ask for better managers, they were always willing to help out their staff when needed. They had excellent listening skills and were empathetic when their employees had to deal with additional stress in their life. Their positive recognition made it fun to go to work each day. The hardest part of my job there would have to have been working a split shift. I was commuting to work and with a three hour break in the middle of the day it made for very long hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was the constant interactions I had with the guests. They brightened my day when they would leave satisfied and return a week later and acknowledge me. I like making people happy as it comes naturally to me. Their happiness made me happy. I also liked that if a guest had a bad experience there, I was the last one they spoke with and often times I could amend the situation before they left. It made my job all that more rewarding."
good,"Fine dine restaurant with its top priority to make each and everyone that steps in the building feel welcome and as if they can leave their stressors at the door and enjoy a comforting and happy environment in turn growing the restaurant, guests, happiness, and overall success and a drive for more."
good,I've worked for two different Darden restaurants the last 8 years. Honestly they were pretty great as far as restaurant jobs go. If I weren't starting a new career I would stay longer
good,A typical day a work would be me walking in the door saying hi to the host or hostess on duty finding the nearest manager once they see me I’m asked home I am doing and if I’m ready to work or not .
good,"A typical day there, can be anywhere between hectic or relaxing ease, all depends on the day and time. Darden is a fantastic company, but it can still be trying at times."
good,"Darden owns many restaurants, They offer great benefits and discounts on there food to employees. Flexible schedules, Good management from my experience"
good,"i worked at an Olive Garden under Darden Management. The work experience there was enjoyable and fast paced and is a great transition job "
good,Darden is a great company to work for. They really do invest in their team and you definitely feel like family. I have never worked for a company with better management staff and would gladly go back.
good,"Great for the most part.  The management team can really make or break the store.  The menu changes often, which is nice to have a variety.  This sometimes is an issue with guests who are upset about the item they liked no longer being carried. "
good,Would always in a positive environment and would be able to have a good vibes coming my way all day. I love how the restaurant makes you feel like your in an upscale fine dining place but its cheap enough to afford for a family of 4.
good,"Over my period of 3+ yrs management at Darden, I worked many open/closes, sometimes 2 a week.  Was having to travel to other restaurants for relief over 100 miles one-way, while opening the next day w/o any concern for my safety.Team members spoke to me in an unprofessional manner, cursing and being rude, not doing as asked.  If the team did not get their way, they made false accusations regarding management.  Fellow managers demeaning me in such a manner that the team followed their lead, leaving me with no respect at all."
good,"I currently work for a great company. A lot is required, but the return is worth it. I loved my management team as well as my staff. Culture is an important part of Darden. I'm only looking for better opportunities closer to home."
good,Overall it's a great work environment for students and someone just needing an easy going part time job but it's not to be made a career out of. I would only recommend this to someone not in dire need of money.
good,"Great company, Expect good training then be ready to work. Hours are good as long as your General Manager is focused on keeping the positions filled and schedules fair."
good,Darden is great to place work.  You work a lot of hours Weekends and Holidays but it comes with this type of industry. The company structure is great but the Benefits are a bit pricey.
good,A tipical day at work here as a server is fun. You come in and say hello to everyone. Its a safe place to work at. You are in the middle of times square ny. Lots of good moments here.
good,all co workers get along and work well together ive learned quickly to work in a fast paced environment this is my first experience in food and beverage and ive learned alot very quickly
good,I enjoyed the guest. My co-worker always worked as team. Management was very supportive.
good,the hardest part of job was the beverages as a server you have to wait on bar tender the best part was the satifieing the guest
good,"After working there for 12 years . Darden is one of the great place to work. They care for the employees . the mangement team was always there to help. Benefits great , fittness center free lunches."
good,Really good job for a high school. The staff was really fun and the managers tried their best to compensate with my school schedule. It is hard for you to move up in positions though. Had to beg to do certain jobs
good,My Job at Darden’s Olive Garden can not be applied to all of them. I have very qualified managers and a team I can depend on that allows me to perform at my best to achieve the most growth for the restaurant and earn the most income for its employees in tips and salary.
good,Its a fun working place overall. They have some of the best team members. Everyday is a great working experience. If it was easy to get rehired i honestly would attend another Darden resturaunt.
good,Fun work environment had a good time there would go back there if I didn’t need more money loved the place and all the people I met that I now consider family
good,"It's a comfortable environment. No problems, learn how to deal with very complicated guests. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be interacting with very different people."
good,The environment was not stressful compared to McDonald. Very easy job. Loved working at Longhorn. Management was great never a problem with them. Would apply again.
good,The people make the job and it is a gift to look forward to going into work each day. Management is supportive and are allowing of flexible schedules.
good,The company really supports their restaurant team members and they support your growth through education and certification programs.  There is a great workplace culture and a family atmosphere.
good,Great place to work while attending school or if you need a part-time job. They are very flexible with your schedule and let you work the days that you desire.
good,Typical day at work are fun full of energy and guest connections. You will learn how to be a great leader as you interact with your peers. Great place to work as long as you are willing to work smart and hard.
good,"I still love seasons52 that's one restaurant you work nice and hard, them always expect more from you, managers are amazing, company is very great, good benefits everything is good."
good,"A fast pace environment that flourished with high expectations, good communication, and excellent teamwork. Very flexible with allocated time off and friendly management support."
good,Really good way to get an idea of how to manage a lot going on at once. And I really think that Olive Garden treats their employees extremely well and fair.
good,Fast Paced but rewarding work environment. Gives employees the opportunity to bring home enough money to sustain a decent lifestyle and save a little. I would reccommend working here.
good,"Fast past environment, if you enjoy working with people, you will"
good,Darden offers opportunities to those who apply themselves.  I enjoyed the time I worked at Olive Garden.  The team and leadership were a great group of people to work with.
good,"One thing that companies seem to be doing is only hiring contractors do their work. It's cheap for them, but it leads to high turnover. I had a particularly poor manager but it seems that the company has some great leadership too."
good,"Mostly fun environment. great for college students. friendly coworkers. easy to complete tasks. as a host, greet, seat, and be happy when doing it. Try to make the guest as happy as possible."
good,"Very Flexible hours. "
good,"When I worked there this restaurant had one of the greatest teams in Darden History.  We ranked number one site in the company for 4 years in a row.  Our manager was not he cover of Restaurant Magazine 5 times.  Each time he was interviewed he explicitly said in his article that if not for the team then he would be nothing and would spend most of his interview calling out our greatest accomplishments by name.  We were more of a family than fellow employees.  Our manager always showed his appreciation for us in many ways.  Also, Darden has some of the best benefits in the country.  During the recession this was mown as one of the most safest companies to work for."
good,Fun environment but also a hard working place. Olive Garden in McKinney is a great place to start your first job because they work with your schedule & motivate you to do good in everything your doing outside of work .
good,Fast paced work place with good managers. very professional. Great place to learn and advance your culinary career if desired. Vacation pay is ok not great.
good,"The Olive Garden Family was one of my favorite jobs. The staff was extremely friendly and we grew to be a family and not just co-workers. The company ""Darden Restaurants"" really does care about their employees."
good,Longhorn was nice. But I feel that the company doesn't take care of it's employees better. Sometimes it would be negative and bad hours. I have met some amazing people at the company.
good,I worked with the Darden Application for Service and Hospitality team for maintaining Point of Sale  Systems of 7 different type of restaurants located all over US & Canada.
good,My job is very fast paced. I take care of peoples needs when dining out. I have learned how to care for peoples needs and how to be better organized for each situation. The hardest part is when we get really busy and have a line out the door. I love helping people and making their visit enjoyable.
good,Review available upon request if needed from the staffing agent. My experience working at Darden was a good one. Great team and staff to work for.
good,"Very family orientated environment to work in. Training is hands on and as well as a fun experience. Learning the menu is easy, especially since we get to try new foods."
good,- Service Manager responsible for directing and organizing activities motivating and retaining team of 45+ servers by providing ongoing training and development; regularly measuring and evaluating service levels and standards using guest and employee feedback; developing plans for continuous improvement. Guidance over the successful promotion and completion of 11 Manager In Training programs.
good,"Before my time working for three Olive Garden locations across different states, I had an extensive work history in the food industry. I have had roles varying from manager to server. Throughout these roles, I had witnessed workplaces with low work ethic displayed across all positions throughout the current business which always seemed to result in low ratings in at least a few categories that I knew were easy to fix. This all changed with Darden Restaurants. Through Darden, Olive Garden has been a beacon of hope to me in regards to customer satisfaction and to truly respect your job. My time at Olive Garden has allowed me to thrive in sales and to perform my absolute best. Out of all the jobs and leadership positions I have held, I found myself surprised to learn that my true passion lies in service and in ensuring guest delight in sales through public speaking. I hope to use these new skills throughout my career thanks to Olive Garden."
good,The valuable set of interpersonal skills that I learned while working at Darden resturaunts has been a great asset to me.
good,"I had this job while in college, it is your typical server position. The people I worked with were great and made the job more fun. I enjoyed going to work each day and providing excellent service to our guests. I even made lasting relationships with customers which resulted in repeated business."
good,Darden is a wonderful company to work for. A typical day at work starts with answering emails from vendors and internal employees. Throughout the day I am answering questions from my team and assisting my supervisor. The most enjoyable part of my day is assisting external customers resolve their issues; with the hardest part being trying to juggle an extremely heavy workload while answering questions all day from my team.
good,"Darden was treated me well, management team is professional however i am in search of a more lucrative job. Entrees ay Cheddar’s continue to get more inexpensive"
good,"Friendly and understanding leadership, great coworkers and benefits, but corporate structure does impose a lot of changes that aren't always in an individual store's best interests."
good,I love my job but I had to leave because the manager wouldn’t hear what you have to say and there not respectful with there employees. There’s a lot of favoritism
good,"The Workers of Darden resturants is all friendly and helpful.! The Managers are the same. Some times, there be compitive competions, that will help the say go by faster."
good,Like my other jobs a typical day of work would be fast paced and involve me working with a wide variety of people to get the job done. I learned excellent customer service skills and how to manage time effectively.
good,"I bartended for Darden for their higher brands and although the pay was great, we worked hard and the business was cut throat. All though you would work hard you would reap the benefits"
good,"As any service industry job goes, its the people that work there that make or break the experience.  I had alot of fun with the individuals that I worked with over the years at Olive Garden."
good,"A typical day you will make somewhere between $40-$60 on a good day you can make up to $150. Lunch is slower than dinner rushes, dinner time you have an opportunity to make more. The hardest part of the job is dealing with other employees who only do the minimum of their job requirements."
good,Enjoyed working for Olive Garden.  Fast pace with lots of challenges.  Great benefits (went to Italy twice).  Would still be working if not for relocation - move was family choice.  Good company structure with great support when asked for.
good,Darding company is an amazing company to work for. The salary truly is what you make of it being that you are working off of tips. But if you have the right attitude and learn how to become a good salesman you will be surprised how your income inflates.
good,"Olive garden is a great place to start at straight out of highschool and if your in your early 20's mid 30's , the pay is great , especially if your a cook , managements on point , Darden restaurants definitely knows what they're doing"
good,Love Darren people are amazing good culture amazing food high pride very busy lunch and dinner rush I manage 17 people who are all unique in there own way but we all work well together
good,"I was angry when they stopped grating the large party checks.  I was angry about a few things, but not the kind of angry of a disgruntled employee.  Darden was like a family to me and they were very good to me.  Any family gets upset at certain things, but overall they were about the best company I ever worked for.  I still maintain those friendships and always feel at home when I go there.  Were they perfect?, absolutely not, but they were loyal and fair and I will always have their back."
good,"You learn something new everyday when you walk in, you interact with the guests and your hear about their day and how their life is going so far, and you come to realize that your problems may have to be on hold, because they need you, and we are heroes to them."
good,"Very clean, very well ran, management was very uplifting and motivating. Employees were all treated well and everyone was expected to contribute to the success of this company. Enjoyable."
good,"At times management could be a little unstructured but at the end of the day, we always ended as a team. From time to time we struggled with favoritism, which made the staff poorly function as a team at times. It was a family oriented place which was amazing, team and management proceeded to encourage advancement, a lot of coaching and constructive criticism."
good,Working for Olive Garden has given me many life experiences that have been valuable.  The flexible schedule has allowed me to participate in my children's activities.
good,"A great place to work."
good,"There was no room for advancement after I became certified trainer,  Fact is the General Manager was only advancing the guys.  After 7 years of serving, and training I realized it was time to move on.  My body just couldn't handle those heavy trays anymore."
good,"Responsible for greeting guests, explaining the current promotional items and selling the most desirable entrée. Treating every guest with respect and understanding at all times. Listening to every need and following up in a respectful and timely manner. On a manager level insuring the best food quality is delivered with perfect presentation while maintaining waste prevention.  Successfully resolving guest complaints and issues with concern and urgency. Highly successful in controlling labor hours and extremely accurate while conducting inventory. Creating an enjoyable atmosphere with a high level of productivity and constantly striving for success."
good,"Darden is a great company to work for. They offer full-time benefits to part-time employees, treat their employees well, and create a fun, flexible, helpful environment to work in. I have made so many friends working for this company. Don't get me wrong, there are some people I don't like, and the managers can have their moments when they seem to make everyone mad, but overall it's been the best company I've worked for so far."
good,A typical day at work consisted of hard labor.  I learned to communicate with people that spoke a different language than I did and to push my own stamina boundaries.  Management was great.  My co-workers were very patient with me when it came to learning to communicate with one another as we did not speak the same languages.  The hardest part of this job was weed-eating up and down large hills for 12hrs a day and learning to communicate with others that spoke a different language.  The most enjoyable part of this job was taking pride in the hard work that I accomplished as I was the only female on the crew as well as learning a little bit of Spanish.
good,"I enjoyed working at Red Lobster because I could be myself and I love conversation with all guest. Meeting people and different personalities kept my place of work fun at all times. Meanwhile this position took your body a few months to adjust to the long hours (8+) on your feet. No breaks even with double shifts, we all ate on the go. Working there took a toll on the body such as carrying heavy trays of food and beverage( includes wrist, shoulder, neck, and back pain); walking and standing on your feet for long periods caused severe pain in the knees and feet. However, this position also helped me get acclimated in dealing with new customers on a daily basis. I also learned to listen more closely to the guests needs, I acknowledged them and explored possible solutions to resolve the issues the best way possible. Some guest became my ""Red Lobster Family"". This family made it a point to dine in on days I was scheduled to work, I felt fortunate to be their only server each visit. Furthermore, working in the city I was located in offered very minimal room for advancement. I am in pursuit to lead and advance from this point. Besides that,We had plenty of teamwork, hardworking and honest employees. Working different job codes also kept my interest. I believe doing so really helped me learn the restaurant as a whole. Red Lobster is fantastic place to work and network if you ask me. I would recommend a position like this to young adults fresh out of high school, college or perhaps the retired."
good,"The management was awesome, and I had so much fun working with my  co-workers."
good,Darden has been a great company to me. Honestly I am ready to embark upon another journey in life. However the job market of Dallas is up and coming and has seen constant growth and I honestly feel as though Darden has taught me plenty of consumer skills that will be a great asset to any opportunities that may be forthcoming.
good,"Fast paced work place"
good,Red Lobster has been around for over 40 years. They have tried about every approach to casual dining. The company has owned multiple other chains. They have got it down to a science.
good,Great teamwork throughout the restaurant. Management is very personable and easy to work with.
good,"The best part about being a server for me is meeting new people and walking out with cash in hand every day or night. Also, the idea of not knowing if it is going to be a busy or slow night. Many chain restaurants stay busy constantly and never slow down throughout the year. The worst part of the job is probably the wage - 2.43 hr. It is awful, but you almost always make more than enough throughout the week in tips. The job can be very challenging on busy days to very lax during morning/lunch shifts and easy. I have been serving tables for 8+ years now and i've pretty much turned it into a career. I'm looking forward to management in the near future. There is almost always opportunity for growth in the restaurant business as long as your willing, motivated, and hard working."
good,"I learned that it takes everyone to do a great job, and that it's not enough to want to good yourself, you have to want everyone to do well to succeed."
good,management is great. they are really into helping people. we helped with victims of katrina and rita. they knew what it ment to be a team
good,"Fast paced, hussle, Co workers are friendly and unique. Managers work with you in achieving company goals."
good,Love the people  but manger s don't get along  well forget  to communicate  alot short handed sometimes but good pay friendly  workers love dish staff my favorite  is bam bam
good,Great management that pushes you to do your best and become your best. A typical day at cheddars involves working with the guests and providing guest satisfaction as well as working as a team with your fellow employees to promote guest satisfaction.
good,"I honestly loved it so much in the beginning, but as the years progress it gets tiring. I feel like the high level of stress follows me out the door when I go home at night. It’s not bad other than that."
good,"Was a great experience for me.  I was one of your trainers.  As for the servers..... I found that the lunch hour was hard for the to make money."
good,"I have been a leader in the food industry for more than 30 years ."
good,"Darden is a good company too work for, and I would recommend them to anyone. The company always gives back through a charitable cause called Darden Dimes and makes sure the families in need are taken care of!"
good,"Everyone is really nice, and helpful when you need it. There’s never any bad days, and you always stay busy. Management is amazing, as well as the coworkers."
good,"I very much enjoyed working for Darden. The work environment was always positive and the management and team was always approachable. Kitchen was always clean and well run. Overall, every day was a positive experience."
good,I would recommend Darden to anyone that is seeking a company that is principal based and has high standards.  This company is not for the complacent or one who lacks ownership.
good,"Great experience helped mold me into the fun-loving man ,or employee .I am today ,and granted me a great start into my career of hospitality. I can say the best almost 7 years ,besides the lil college. I had."
good,"Culture is server-friendly enough.  On busy days there is a salad person, and bussers and hostesses are encouraged to help out servers.  Customers are regular and plentiful, but they want lots of service, fast good and cheap.  Management is cream of the crop but corporate trickle-down means adapt to a lot of change all the time."
good,"I worked as a hostess for Darden at longhorn steak house and it was a great company to work for and a great environment with flexible scheduling. Every shift, you and your host/hostess co-workers decide what they want to do. Typically one will lead, one will greet, and the rest are either seating guests or clearing tables. Other duties include side work such as checking restrooms, wiping down highchairs and booster seats, changing trash bags at hostess stand and in restrooms, and making kid menus. My favorite part about this job is that the employees and managers were nice and professional and it's a family atmosphere as far as the employees. The hardest part about this jobs is the fast paced environment and listening to multiple managers at a time."
good,Great place to work with great benifits. Goal oriented with self earned Bonuses driven by getting results. Laser focused atmosphere with great rewards
good,"They are very flexible with your work schedule. Only thing is if you don't work, you don't get paid. It's a fun atmosphere to work in and the hours are great!"
good,Most enjoyable part was working with the team and having relationships with everyone from the hostess station to the bar and back of house! It really had a family feel.
good,"Darden is the best, working with the many chef's was always a pleasure and challenge, they are smart, creative and a pure joy to be around.  In the Procurement department we were always working collaboratively with Total Quality, Culinary, Distribution, Accounting and Marketing to provide the best overall service, products and value for our guests.  Darden has some of my favorite restaurants."
good,"I love  to work in Olive Garden , its competitive pay and very nice people. They care all the employees, and you are family once you work in darden company"
good,"While being at employed at olive garden my position was a Busser."
good,"It is a very good company to work, give you help and they are flexible when it comes to give you a schedule, respecting the own opinion and a good environment to work"
good,"Would love to work for the company again, have many opportunities and benefits.  Unfortunately the management team performed poorly."
good,"I loved the work. You will sweat gallons daily!"
good,It is very easy to work at a restaurant and a very fast pace but you would learn as time go by ................this a very good place I love it great place
good,Olive Garden has brought me out of my shell a bit. A great place to work while going to school or even just some spending money. Great opportunities to move up in the company.
good,"I enjoy working for Olive Garden. The people I work with are a joy to be around. We have a great management team. They do everything they can to make sure that we are happy, the guest are happy and that the restaurant is in great condition. I can say that there is never a dull moment at work. You can always count on people to make you laugh, make you feel important and even some times make you a little frustrated. I would have to say the hardest part of being a server at Olive Garden is not knowing how much money you're going to make from tips."
good,"Handled customer interactions."
good,"A wonderful job that works around your schedule. Supportive of family and work balance, many opportunities to advance."
good,I love every part of being a server. The people I work with are what I look forward to every day. Darden is making it increasingly difficult to serve the guest. As a service professional I take great pride in the work I do and I'm unhappy with the path this company is choosing to take.
good,I learned how to deal with the different personalities and different communication techniques. I also learned the importance of working together as a team to achieve a common goal. The hardest part of the job would have to have been learning to hold a tray full of food or carry Martini glasses without spilling them :). The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting people and hearing about their day.
good,I think that this is a job that takes skills and attention to detail. Not everyone can do what we do and it makes me happy to know I can make it. I have always enjoyed working for the company and they make it easy to move up in position and allows me to go to school.
good,This is the place that I spend my last years growing and learning new things every day and the place that make me realize how important it is to be able to learn and get results and at the end to be appreciated for.
good,"Of course family brings everyone to the table. "
good,"Great people, Great managers and, Great food. really keeps you on the ball. no time to slack off at busy hours. team meetings are beneficial to work place activities. very down to earth area but slight racism amongst customers but the overall experience was wonderment at its finest"
good,"I strongly enjoyed my time employed by Red Lobster, and had I not needed to end my time with them due to relocation, I would still be a devoted member of the team. I learned the value of teamwork, how to manage any difficult situation, and I learned that if you have a problem, don't be afraid to discuss it with your managers. My co-workers were and still are my very best friends, and becoming part of this family was my favorite part of the job."
good,"I fully enjoyed working here. Unfortunately one of the managers didn't like me and while my general manager was away on business he bullied me and started to take me out of the bar (I was hired a bartender) and force me to work as a waitstress. One of the other managers saw my boyfriend at the time was African American and then they both proceeded to bully me and actually made me cry on several occasions. The first manager then had me removed from the bar, without my knowledge. I ended up walking off the job the same day that one of the other employees informed me of his plans. "
good,"this was definitely a good place to work because it made me be more focus all the time."
good,"As a single parent I was only able to work during the day, luches were ok but they money was at dinners."
good,"A typical day at work would be described as busy and very productive. I would clean a lot, prepare drinks and salads for customers, serve customers and help other servers out if they needed anything. I learned how to work as a team member and I also learned what great customer service is like and how to provide it for any customer at any time. My management was awesome. Very helpful towards me and every customer that walked into the door. The management very seriously encouraged everyone to ensure that every customer leaves happy and comes back in the future. Every manager was on the dining floor greeting customers and helping the servers as though they themselves were serving tables as well. It was a great place to work as far as management goes. My co-workers were also very helpful and responsible. We all worked as a team and helped each other out with any table that needed it. The hardest part of the job was the long hours of lifting heavy trays and dishes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with every day. The management, fellow servers, and the customers. Each day was brightened by someone and I always had a smile on my face knowing that I served a table well and the people left happy. I love the feeling of doing a great job and helping someone out."
good,greet the guests and escort them to their tables .
good,My personal opinion is if your a lazy always tired type of person then this job isnt for you.  The managers well get really upset about you not moving fast and being on top of ur work
good,"Super friendly environment. Managers actually care about their employees and their lives outside of work. Very flexible schedules and, like i said, a super fun and friendly environment."
good,They are able to retain managers long term. In 15 years of service there are still many managers that were there before me still currently employeed. Thats rare these days.
good,I’m so thankful with Darden Company and the management at the Olive Garden for giving me the skills and the opportunity to grow in costumer service...
good,It is a good job. You learn so much and really get interact with guest and your coworkers. You learn hospitality and that your guest are the most important.
good,Darden is so bar the best Corporation I ve work. They do invest a lot on people and guests. They provide the tools needed to be sucessful and they will hold you to very high standards.
good,Nice coworkers mostly everyone gets along. Managers are understanding and do their best to accommodate you and help you strengthen your weaker areas or areas you struggle in. From the 3 months I've spent their I feel like anyone that has anything bad to say about their experience at the Midland olive garden must not have had a very good attitude or wasn't very good at their job. This was a great place to work and it is no one's fault but my own that I am not still their.
good,Darden was an outstanding exception in the Restaurant Industry. The benefits and their commitment to work/life balance was motivating and the staff was held to a professional standard which made for an exceptional environment.
good,Most amazing job. I cried when I put my two weeks in because I loved working at this company. The staff is amazing and everyone is so loving and supportive. The management makes sure that everyone is getting along and there are no internal disputes not to mention there are several managers is if you feel you have a problem with one you can always communicate your feelings to another.
good,"Overall loved my time with darden, they really helped with career advancement and teaching. Hardest thing I dealt with was time away from family!

good,"I loved working for Darden at the Olive Garden, Everyone worked together to make the guest happy. i left Olive Garden and i felt bad for it but there is nothing i can do now. The managers were amazing they played there role if we were busy they would come on the floor and help out with everything."
good,"Great place to work, fast money and flexible hours. Also great benefits and lots of different jobs within the job to learn. I felt like family there and was always taken care of."
good,its busy and fun place to work.  Management culture is there from the moment of orientation.  Hardest part of the job is that its not a monday through friday job so your life is not like your friends.
good,I miss the great atmosphere we had at longhorn. UNFORTUNATELY I HAD TO RELOCATE. But would work there again. Received discount on great steaks. They have the bst seasonings I have ever tasted.

good,I love serving so I loved my job.  I worked very few hours with competitive pay.  The company was involved with the community.I also enjoyed the diversity of people that I worked with and took care of as a server.
good,"The Capital Grille is a fine dining establishment that offers great food and an extensive wine list. Working here is fast paced during the holidays and sees a slight dip in business during the summer months. Costa Mesa is in proximity to many tourist destinations an under 20 minutes from John Wayne Airport, which makes it ideal for travelers looking for a consistent, high quality meal."
good,"Fantastic company to work for in the service industry, they offer actual Benefits to their full time staff which is hard to find in this kind of industry. Management on the whole is very supportive and Helpful along side ensuring that you are pursuing the kind of advancement that you are interested in."
good,I had a great supervisor I was my own boss line lead to be on point enjoyed working outside in the sun got to pick my own crew to work with me
good,I really enjoy worked for Darden.  I decided to start serving because I was in school at the same time. Serving gave me a very flexible schedule and the ability to support myself while in school without having to work 40 hours a week. Made some great relationships with guests and coworkers. Overall it has been a rewarding experience.

It is very fast pace and managing can definitely keep you on your toes, however the day goes by so fast like that. Before you know it were closed and it time to go home. Balancing work and home life can have it's challenges only because for every holiday we have to commit to our guests. If you work here you know that the guests are the reason why we have a job, and for that I am thankful."
good,"Working at Darden was a full, quick job where you are expected to learn quickly. The pay was very good for the industry standard, and the work was gratifying. The people made the work very fun."
good,"A ton of guest interaction for sure! I learned teamwork. If it get's hectic during a dinner rush you need to be able to count on someone and they need to be able to count on you. The management team is fantastic the restaurant is new so we never know what to expect they do an excellent job in managing all of us efficiently. The hardest thing is probably knowing the menu back to front as well as the drink beverages. When you get to leave however, you need you did great because people will smile at your table and thank you for the great work you did. That's what makes my day/night at least"
good,"great company to work with,great training,good benefits,awesone work culture"
good,The company is professional and offers benefits to employees where many others do not.
good,"On a daily, I would communicate to my team exactly what our focus will be for that day. Place employees where they will be assigned for the day. Learned how to be on the same level as my employees, learned how to handle different personalities in order to run a smooth kitchen. I worked with an awesome team, front of the house as well as the back. The hardest part of my job was the patience, and calm nature I must show while others acted in their own manner. The most enjoyable thing at Olive Garden was the incentives they offered such as: schooling, training, traveling, the new equipment used, and how organized they are."
good,"Hostessing includes greeting guests at arrival and showing them to their seat, explaining promotions and introducing servers."

The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting people that are traveling through our state and talking about their trips and vacations or what there is to do around here."

good,I received the proper training and gained a lot of solid serving experience working for this employer during my time there. It was fast paced and profitable

good,"I feel that working for Darden and any of their restaurant locations are suitable for anyone trying to make money to live off of while working toward future goals. Decent hours pay is ok if you're a kitchen staff employee but not for someone looking for a full time job. Serving staff is where the money is at if you are looking for decent money fast, however if you are a kitchen employee you will unlikely be able to get moved into that position since there is such a high rate of turnover for kitchen employees."
good,Darden really is all about family and a joyfull dinning experience... Darden took me in and was always understanding... I believe in just about all of my time there witch was 7 yrs of my life I never got bored I was trained in every area and that made me able to extend my work ethic and was there for all of my fellow co workers...

good,Management was attentive and respectable. The restaurant is well managed and operated. The workplace is well staffed and operates an enjoyable relaxed atmosphere.

As his employee, I have no complaints and absolutely enjoy working there. Walking in and always being greeted with a smile (working or not) is one thing I look for. Constructive criticism is given in a professional manner and he always wants the best. Benefits are good. All of the employees there support each other. When one is down, everyone lifts them up! Its extremely hard to find a place where the employees are like family. On a hard day, all management steps in when needed, as well as fellow employees.

It has management who genuinely cares about its staff and their needs and the coworkers are all so easygoing and easy to get along with. The job may be a little strenuous and exhausting, but it's such a great company to work for. If you work as anything other than a server, you also get a 10 cent raise every 6 months, and that really adds up, too!"
good,"overall an excellent workplace"
good,"Great company, excellent benefits, productive work environment, excellent team, great place."
good,"The training at any Darden restaurant functions to high quality standards. Everywhere I have moved this company was able to transfer and work with me. My schedules were always flexible. My managers always maintained professional behavior but were able to connect with their team really well. It felt like a family, if I were to return they would remember me like family. I enjoyed my experiences with Darden, it is just time for me to get out of the service industry. A typical day serving people endless pasta is exactly what it sounds like.

They let me know that it's okay to be myself and not worry upon the approval of others, which surprisingly has helped me every day of my life. They changed me for the better and i'm still with them to this day. I will never forget the experience they handed down too me and even if i leave they are still like family too me. And that's a bound that i wish to create again, where ever life takes me."
good,The managment staff were great and lots of fun. It made the resturaunt a great place to work.
good,I would go in and check my section and prepare to give customers 100% satisfaction. I learned a lot about wine and how to open a bottle of wine. The management was very knowledgeable and helpful. The hardest part of the job was learning the wine. But im very thankful to been apart of the Darden team.
good,Taking care of people.
good,Cash Handling
good,"Arrive to work 15 minutes before scheduled time in to work, speak to manager to clock in and assigned a cash drawer, speak to other co workers about specials, things we are running low on or out of, refill things like beer, ice, glassware, fruit, to be prepared for my shift."

The managers were also very respectful.
