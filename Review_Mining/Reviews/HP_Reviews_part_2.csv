Managers at HP were excellent: fair and people-oriented with a lot of smarts.The tough part was always meeting deadlines, especially if your end component was included ""in the box"", like the projects I worked on. Each day of delay could hold up shipments -- a VERY bad thing. But somehow we consistently made it all happen on-time and on-budget. I will always be thankful that HP was a huge part of my work life.

A typical work week included multiple meetings to ensure all the pieces to a project were in line. Most of our projects employed the help of other groups whether that be Regional Operations to put in disks or move servers or the Active Directory team to change around account permissions. When the weekend rolled around was when the fun really started. We would normally show up a couple hours before a change and take screenshots and backups. Then we would perform the change and take post screenshots.

good,"I loved working at Hewlett-Packard.  I feel like I grew up there.  Every single manager I had was incredible.  I usually worked independently with very minimal supervision.  A typical day was scheduling meetings, conference rooms, booking travel, procurement and ""putting out fires"".  I was working closely with Engineering Services doing the bulk of paper work for transferring our data center to Houston and Bangalore.  This also included keeping track of equipment for the asset inventory.  I also ensured that the Professional Service Agreements/Statement of Work for all the contractors were properly filled out and renewed them as necessary.  There was a lot of transition going on during this time and I learned to be very flexible.  The hardest part of the job was the reorganization that was happening quite frequently.  Besides the org charts changes, there are a lot of public distributions lists that needed to be maintained and keeping those up to date was difficult because we had many engineers from China and India working on the projects as well and the information sharing was rather slow.   I enjoyed working in R&D because I was given the opportunity to help engineers with some of their work that was not on the technical side."

There was one delivery route in the morning, during which mail and packages would be delivered, and mail and Fed Ex packages would be picked up from around the campus site; Fed Ex / UPS outbound Shipping items would be dropped off in Shipping for processing and any outbound USPS picked up would be taken back to the Mailroom for processing.

Our core team stayed together to the end and they were the most amazing people I have ever worked with. The management was top notch and somehow created a family atmosphere - not forgetting that employees are the most important part of any organization. We often had pot-luck lunches where we were made to relax, have fun and get to know each other as people. I've never - to this day - have worked anywhere else that had this approach to teamwork.

good,"It was a wonderful experience in HP. HP Service Activator (HPSA) is a service provisioning and activation software platform from Hewlett Packard. Once installed and integrated with a Customer Service Provider’s (CSP) environment, HPSA automates the processes inherent in the creation and activation of new telecommunications services. It is not specific to any network or service type and can apply across fixed, mobile, or internet environments. HPSA software is activation-centric, but engages the entire fulfillment stack as defined by the TeleManagement Forum’s eTOM framework, including order management, resource inventory and service activation. The core of the platform is a highly scalable workflow engine that executes activation-oriented workflows, and is designed to support various plug-ins that control activation targets in a CSP’s network and IT service infrastructure - irrespective of the protocol used for the activation. Open, standards-based architecture allows HPSA to be integrated with content partner activation systems and other OSS/BSS software. Responsibility: Assigned to work in fixed line communication side and responsible in stucying, examining and developing workflows for HPSA. Carried out test on workflows and write JAVA programs for a specific module"
