rating,review
bad,"There is no work life balance as your schedule changes monthly, HR, management and all the other departments don’t communicate so no one is every on the same page making things difficult for the employees. I never leave reviews but due to my horrible experience at Aetna i decided to so others are aware that when accepting a position here be sure to do your diligence in researching the job and it’s culture"
bad,They will treat you like a slave and you will not feel appreciate here. They will make some people work harder than other people and sometimes make you do their job.
bad,"management made fun of my disability, (ADHD) ignored an ada accomadation request, cut our training by four weeks, was alienated and when I asked for help to do my job better they laughed at me and made fun of me. staff made up rumors and lies about me behind my back, hr lied and manipulated me and the security guard tried to threaten me. they also withheld my tax refund, workers compensation, underpaid me, didn't pay my insurance benefits and made me pay 200 dollars after I lost my job because they didn't feel like paying my mental health claims. promised me additional training then the very next day fired me for ""excessive sighing and asking for additional training"" and I called the better business bureau on them and got them fined. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone"
bad,"No support from management "
bad,The pay is decent but the work is too much. They change how they want things done every week which is very frustrating. The insurance is terrible. High deductibles. No acknowledgement or praise for creativity or being a team player. Do your work get your check and go home.
bad,"Mgmt was in the middle of the merger with CVS. It was not a good time there, everyone was afriad of losing their job. There was reorg going on, lots of changes and my manager was particularly bad because she never was there, I received no job training or direction."
bad,Very bad management and over all manager is worthless people they don't know to behave with their employees. Management wants to employees in there backfoot
bad,"Working in the call center for Aetna Better Heath in Maryland, was the most horrific experience. Over worked, in adequate training, stress level is to the roof, favoritism. The supervisor treats you like children and put co-workers against one another. She’s not a team player, would rather her dept. fail then to take calls. The Coo, acts like she’s above everyone, refuses to speak and is very revengeful!! Horr"
bad,Horrible horrible company they don’t care when your being harassed. They do not do anything to help you and if you have anxiety they will tell you everything is in your head! I was harassed by three ladies and reported them taking photos of me and patient demographics. Also those ladies made things up and there was documentation on everything and the supervisors and HR did nothing! Do not work here I should have listened to others when they warned me about this horrible place.
bad,"Not great. I would not recommend Aetna as a workplace. Now that the company has been bought by CVS, things are likely very different, but my experience at Aetna was not good. At all."
bad,The person who interviews you never gets on the phone but they get all the benefits of your hard work. This is a slave shop. They don’t give you any incentives!!!They over work you and under pay youAlso they will haunt your advancing when it’s suitable for them
bad,"Team leads are not leaders, they have no management skills. They discuss employee issues with other employees. Extreme favoritism toward certain employees, resulting in unfair granting of PTO, write ups and overall team atmosphere."
bad,3 days after my Mother Died I was told by my manager that maybe I should find a new job due to the amount of time I missed.  We were hired to do concurrent review and 3 weeks out of training giving precertification duties with an hour's worth of training.
bad,"Full of lies"
bad,There is no professionalism there it’s nasty bed bugs invaded the building 2 times of my 7 years there very nasty company and employees and pay and raises suck.
bad,"Short-staffed, high pressure, poor work-life balance, high stress, large caseload, demanding. No opportunity for advancement.  No employee involvement in company decisions."
bad,I will never work for this place again they have no respect for the worker's they work you like a slave they talk to you any kinda way so don't apply.
bad,They offered me nothing I was there through a temp agency for one year nothing absolutely nothings I could care less because they care less I would not work for this company for no amount of money sucks
bad,In my tenure at Aetna I worked for 6 different managers/directors/executive directors.  I only had one supervisor during my second promotion that I feel was a genuine leader who cared about me as well as the company.  Most leaders were completely self centered and only cared about their personal success treading on the backs of the front line workers.  I despised this culture.
bad,"Kiss butt and you will go far. Rules are always changing. Managers have favorites and those people can do anything. For example I was there for 6months, had great feedback etc. I was told by 1 manager that after 6months with good stats you can work from home. My manager said 1 yr to me, and to work from home or change hours seniority comes first. Someone who started after me and had my manager was allowed to work from home prior to their 6months."
bad,I hated working there from day one. Very stressful environment I would get hives daily because I was so stressed. Their follow through is very poor. Could not take any time off due to deadlines.
bad,"They dangle the ""work from home"" carrot in front of you to get you to do more. 2 months... then 4 months... then 6 months.... a year..... etc. During that time they have you work in the office at least 40 hours, usually more. They give you a laptop to take home after work to allow you to get all your work done. I'd be up until 4am at home working to get to work from home.  Scam! No OT!"
bad,"A very stressful place to work,  no sick leave , to much work for little pay. Supervisors and managers are not trained to do all the work the rep's do."
bad,"My typical work day includes visiting provider's office to make sure they are in not in need of any services from the health plan. "
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked for, over worked and under paid, no one smiles,  left after two months of employment. No respect for the training classes."
bad,This company is filled with under qualified people. Managers know nothing about the job function and because of that they have lots of time to harass and micro manage. Training was a joke for twelve weeks of “Netflix and chill” then the last two weeks is actual learning but not enough to be confident with your job function. The violate Medical laws by using live members to train. This place is a joke.
bad,"In claims analyst department it's unprofessional and unethical processing claims. Also the pay is not worth the harassment, not truthful, unexpected and misleading department."
bad,"Leadership is horrible!  They dont listen, blow you off when you ask questions.  Manager sits behind 2 monitors looking out of her office, supervisors"
bad,There trainer is horrible and she likes to pick on older people and get pointers in her job....all higher ups are Caucasian and when there wrong they back them up.
bad,"At first it was a great job. The atmosphere was nice, however now it’s not they make you work longer hours to meet the call volume not enough training on anything new, don’t take the needs of employees in mind.  I would NOT recommend this job to anyone"
bad,"NO work life balance - no career advancement, and condescending attitude from leadership.  They believe in punitive actions - at least in the OLD school east coast leadership style."
bad,"The job does not give you enough training, if you are needed they will definitely cut it short. As soon as one call ends another is popping in without even 3 seconds in between If you are not done with your notes from the previous member it will close out. If you are away from your desk for 10 minutes there is a segment you must enter or your time will be off for the day. It got bad to the point of you would have to let your supervisor know you are about to log off the phone regardless of the reason (restroom, sick, etc.) They would always hold training to add more to your job description but with no pay increase. There is no food cafeteria at all on property you either have to leave for your 30 min lunch and rush back, or if there is a food truck on property hopefully it is one you like."
bad,Really trying to find a place to be more useful and paid for the work I am doing .I need benifits they do not offer any. Expectations are set high for a small amount of pay with no pay raise after a year of not any days missed.
bad,"The company will promise the moon to attract talent. Once you are there, your pay will be frozen as they move you to a lower pay band and reduce your title."
bad,The culture of the department was not inclusive of all staff members.  Management working in the same area would not even acknowledge all staff members on a daily basis. Work assignments were minimal and work was not monitored. Feedback was only provided during annual performance review and was not accurate to day to day work that was completed.
bad,"If you apply here and become a new employee they will try as hard as they can to make you quit. the Manager hates new employees and cant keep them around, that is why only employees that have been around or 20+ years stay they. They don't like new young smart people because you will make all the old people there look incompetent. They will harass you until you leave physical and verbal."
bad,"If you apply here and become a new employee they will try as hard as they can to make you quit. the Manager hates new employees and cant keep them around, that is why only employees that have been around or 20+ years stay they. They don't like new young smart people because you will make all the old people there look incompetent. They will harass you until you leave physical and verbal."
bad,"Horrible place to work, they lie about job duties, stress is overwhelming and keep adding job duties. Training is 21 weeks long and a hurry up just do it attitude. No respect from upper management oh and you better not have kids or a life because they will write you up for missing a day at work, doesn't matter the reason, they dont CARE."
bad,Keep looking you will be disappointed with training and And inexperienced  management  this is nothing I would call reliable                .     .     .
bad,"Not worth your time or effort to work for this organization. They do not set employees up for success, nor are the available when needed. No high level support offered to lower employees."
bad,"Where do I even start! The member services department is beyond clueless no one knows what their doing. Training was a complete waste of time, No one had answers , they had to ask senior management what do. Senior management had the worst attitude ever because their training was incompetent at best. The members are angry because no one knows what their doing. The information to provide is very vague, no one wants to help anyone just play the blame game. The calls are ringing non stop from members who have been given incorrect information or just to complain about Aetna. Managers micromanage you all day long and the QA dept hahaha, just one person who is so unprofessional you wonder how did he get the job. Seriously I wouldn’t even let my dog work there."
bad,"Working for Aetna in Tucson, AZ was the worst. The leadership did nothing to help advance you, but were quick to chastise for any error. When you did something incorrectly, your manager, your 2 leads and the director would bring you to the office and each one would have a turn at digging into you."
bad,"I would not recommend anybody work here. First off - you have to go through FOUR stressful months of training and learning new systems that you wont even use for the job. Im a current college student and this honestly felt like another class I was taking! The instructor I had for the training was extremely unprofessional, rude, and just did not care. And when several people & I complained to upper management they did nothing. The people on the floor are extremely messy and full of drama, and so is ONE supervisor. The pay and stress of this job is just not worth the money. And im not one to complain about any job! If you can, go elsewhere. They have an occurrence policy where is you have 3, your out. They dont care if you have kids and a family or even an emergency and you have to go to the hospital FROM WORK - its still held against you. They try to give out stupid gift cards to distract you from the fact that they have low pay, horrible benefits, and an unrealistic attendance policy. If you have other job offers, go there. You wont regret it."
bad,I was caught in between two supervisors ... the one in Texas that wasn't my supervisor but whose team I was working with and the one in Arizona that was actually my direct supervisor.    The employees chosen by the Texas supervisor to train me didn't like the Arizona team and wouldn't allow me to speak with them.   The lead in Texas stopped me from talking to the Texas supervisor when I had been asked for information by the supervisor.  The lead told me the supervisor was busy... actually she was standing right in front of me on her cell phone.      The TX and AZ teams spoke badly about each other and called each other names to me which didn't inspire me to work with either team.    It was hard to respect them when they didn't respect each other.      There was no plan in place to train me and in the span of 1 month my hours were changed 3 times.   Stay away !
bad,"micro managers, managers retaliate against employees and bully them. must cc manager on all emails of work accomplished live as work is being done. do not recommend anyone apply for a job at Aetna"
bad,The training you receive does not really help you deal with the lack of support you need. Very stressful environment and the worst job I have ever had.
bad,"I seen myself stuck at this job with no benifits,o worked really hard here,but it seemed as though it was a slave job,only one person got to move up here,no matter how hard you worked the results were the same, they care about nothing but there glass,and I wouldn't recommend no one to every work for this company"
bad,"I do not recommend. No work life balance,  lack of promotions, favoritism, non-diverse. Not a good company to work for. Please stay as far away from this company as possible. Horrible management."
bad,"Emotional/bad decisions are made because of tunnel vision, sometimes as knee-jerk reactions.  These decisions are sometimes reversed while others remain short-term (ineffective) solutions.  Managers ""lead"" from the back (work at home), have limited band-width and are unprofessional.  Several defensive and/or immature mentalities exist and unnecessary drama is created based on incorrect assumptions.  Aetna hired a consulting firm to teach them Management 101."
bad,"Leadership in HR is incestuous.  While they use the right buzz words about being an inclusive environment, they are not.  They regularly dispose of people who are not like them.  BEWARE"
bad,"no comments to say. On a typical day it is very busy, over worked and under compensated. Management do not care at all. The workplace not good, hard.."
bad,"I wish I could rate this more than one star, however it has been a degrade in appreciation and the managers do not care for their employees this company has a terrible turn over rate of employees"
bad,"Age Discrimination, Job Elimination . Illegal practices .  There is nothing more to say about this company that I haven't already added.  This company follows poor practices and has a history of same prior actions in past"
bad,"Fast paced, PTO, Inbound call center, Claims processing, Micro managed, Paid holidays, Health concierge, Authorizations, Patient Benefits, Customer Service."
bad,"Fortune 50 Company. Culture varies by office and mid to lower level management. Sales roles and assignments are typically not merit based, nor equitable.  Sales and Implementation support is also not as robust as other competitors."
bad,"punish yourself on an daily basis. management sucks, co workers are catty and petty, and unsupportive. boring, just like this review without caps. no zest for life. sit in the cube, push buttons, go home."
bad,Customer service position was a very stressful job. Worked in 2 operating systems and training for Aetna system was not good.  Working hours not flexible and unrealistic expectations to meet performance goals
bad,"working for aetna included poor management, a clique environment, not team driven, was more quantity or quality with minimal raises annually.if you even got a review"
bad,"If you don't have an option and are a man you'll do great at Aetna. Women with thoughts are pushed out and harassed as you are ""crazy"". People openly disrespect and taunt others and that is acceptable."
bad,"Aetna in my experience was not a very pleasant place to work, I would not recommend Aetna.  Must, not all of the management should have mandatory training in the area of soft skills and what it means to lose intellectual capital and how it affects the overall  performance of Aetna services."
bad,"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."
bad,"Working for Aetna was through the temporary service Total med. The position was temporary, but the better health of Ohio branch was new and very unorganized. Personally resigned due to multiple management issues. My previous lead no longer works for the plan due to this."
bad,Very unprofessional work environment . Managers were also very unprofessional. Inconsistency in scheduling with floating shifts and shift bids. My manager was not even in the same state .
bad,Women do not advance into management very often.  The predominant culture is male and women often are not even considered.  I found executive leadership to be hostile to women who challenged them especially the Chief Architect.
bad,Climbing the ladder is all about who you know.  Communication regarding company stability is slim to none.  During my time at Aetna cross functional work was frowned upon.
bad,Everyone in management is racist seen it first hand for myself and I'm not even colored. They have their favorites and they only promote their friends.
bad,The current CEO has had multiple issues with mistreatment and harassment of woman in the workplace.  I witnessed this at a working dinner.  This corrupt management style is evident in middle level managers as well.
bad,The standards they require of employees are not followed by management.  The do not always hire form within.  At the time I was laid off they were send local jobs overseas.  I would never again work for this company and highly recommend anyone running the other direction and live in the street before working for this company.
bad,"very poor management team, from the company we acquired, benefits were great and hours also, days off were paid and some of the hours were overtime if asked"
bad,"Handle customer inquiries, complaints,billing questions and payment extension/service requests.Calm angry callers, repair trust, locate resources for problem resolution and design best-option solutions."
bad,"Once you go to their work form home program you loose all ability for advancement.  My manager formed a clique with the girls who bought her fake purses, and since I didn't-despite being one of the most qualified people on the team, I was no longer assigned special projects"
bad,"If your not friends with management you might be gone when they get rid of nurses at least twice a year."
bad,"Former Coventry employee. Coventry culture was outstanding! They cared about the customers. Aetna is terrible. They don’t pay for performance. Training is practically non-existent. The production and quality metrics are unreasonable. All they care about is the numbers and the money. Upper management is clueless and don’t seem to care. They have a “wheel” they tout...integrity, caring, etc. but they don’t actually follow it. Members are treated poorly. If they give a wrong benefit to the member oh well, too bad. Members are just a number. They talk about customer service being the face of the company but they are the lowest paid, so lots of turnover. They outsource EVERYTHING.  I would guess 75% of their reps are from foreign countries...India, Columbia, etc. and those reps do a terrible job. Sad when you go to the doctor and they see where you work and then tell you how much they hate your employer. It’s sickening. They lose SO MANY highly qualified employees because they treat people badly. The better you are at your job the more work you get.  There is really nothing good I can say about that place."
bad,"harassed about meeting metrics and no focus on the customer and not given the proper tools to meet the metrics set forth , which are not measured fairly"
bad,"The company lacked true leadership, and didn't want to promote to positions of relevance. They wanted to keep you down and not allow you to advance to a more desirable position."
bad,"Never work for this company in Atlanta, Ga. I had the worst experience in my life. I had to train myself via the company intranet. Do not bother applying."
bad,"Very simple, this company has NO culture and NO loyalty to any of their team members. The first 3 months with Aetna, I received 3 new directors to report to. One after the other like lego pieces they plug and play until they find a structure that won't comment on their complicated methods or constant turn around in ALL roles.  "
bad,"There is little to no management help with advancement in the company or elsewhere with your career.  When the Humana acquisition fell through, there were no bonuses or advances so there is little drive to stay at this company"
bad,"Broker was unprofessional and not informed of current procedures."
bad,Apparently this company hires relatives sight unseen. There are qualified people wanting those jobs who should be considered first and they go and hire some inept relative. Customer service is suffering because of it.
bad,"they want a nurse to handle a call to a patient in 10-15 minutes when the initial intake call can take up to over an hour depending upon what is going on with the patient. their model is NOT patient focused.  it made me feel, after 8 years, that I was violating my duty to my RN license.  not good.  not at all."
bad,"My work day started there by opening the mail, stamping  of the mail, delivering the mail interoffice. Checking my over night messages. I most likely will have to fill orders from Providers and other clients. Transfer calls, Fax information, file and copy materials.Management was fair. Work place culture was professional. I enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job, it was fast paced, I learned a lot in that area. The most enjoyable part of my job was being on the phone assisting customers."
bad,"Translating over 300 prescription per day,Management or software issues would constantly interrupt your work progress. Inbound doctor calls was ran by a Pharmacist mostly,often had to find work to do."
bad,"company doesn't offer advancement  it is also very stressful , company does not hold values and the management is horrible if you want to have a peace of mind stay away!!!"
bad,"if you value your health, peace of mind, a decent culture of integral work ethics, loyalty,accountability, and career/development, focus your professional endeavors elsewhere."
bad,This job at Aetna was the worst job I ever worked at. It was not what I signed up for and was not told that I would be going through boxes looking for lost files and claims that has not been paid in years and the different hospital and billing dept was looking for payment that Aetna has not paid.
bad,"Managment was horrible, the office was unorganized, the management was rude, disrespectful, and gossiped. A typical day included so form of a manager coming to me with some type of ""oh I heard that you said...And it goes against company policy"""
bad,Not enough staff for tats and workload. Expectation work 24/7. Terrible health benefits high deductibles. Unorganized . Poor management skills. Treated like children. No voice. Aetna does not want to hear what employees have to say
bad,"Management does not provide adequate training and is very impatient, expecting people to learn everything about the work in only 15 minutes!"
bad,"It was a lot of work but I love it , staying busy, but they changed management and began outsourcing, that is when it began going down hill for us American Staff. every year there was a lay off, they kept change the work flow the changing it back, cutting staff  adding more work, changing the criteria that we reviewed by, micro managing the staff they wanted to lay off especially the people of color."
bad,I worked for Coventry now under the name Aetna. I started in september 2010 and I just departed July of 2016. There is minimum to no opportunities of advancement unless you are one of the picks..if you don't kiss tail then you won't advance. The supervisors have no knowledge of anything besides the latest gossip on employees. The Manager Stephanie Fields has her picks and if she doesn't like you it will definitely show because none of the people in management will like you. You will remain a customer service rep. They have shift bids now which are given out based on the supervisors like..Judith Ruiz is the main supervisor who does not know her job. She will not help you with advancing and would prefer to see you remain on her team until she retires. Aetna has its percs and would be a good company IF they get rid of all the  old management from Coventry. If you have a medical issue and have FMLA upper management will get upset about it they do not want you using FMLA at all. You are over worked. The starting pay now is $16 and they feel that since you make that amount that no other company can top that. If you have a supervisor call you have to pretty much message every supervisor in the building until you find 1 that will take your call because all of them are lazy and will avoid taking the call. Micro managing. Unfairness. Underpaid for the work done. If they don't like you your bonus will be $150. I filed a claim with EEOC against them and won for pregnancy discrimination so that should speak for itself.
bad,Very intensive learning process in short period of time. The time sitting with an experienced rep should be extended. Fellow employees very approachable. Instructors very knowledgeable.
bad,This company is the worst job I had ever had! You are consistently over work with low wages. Management is non supportive and self center with a one track mind.
bad,"If you are a robot then this is the job for you! "
bad,I worked in this school for few years. No job guarantee anytime you will be fired depending on managers mood. Management expectation is to keep the employees as slaves. No growth. Worst management and HR service ever I've seen in my career. And now this company's management and operations are handed over to few cheapo people on earth and they are ruining this company. They are packed with internal politics and favoritism racism. No value or respect given to employees.
bad,"Very stressful place to work, only able to advance if you kissed butt.  I would cry every day before going in to work because I was so miserable"
bad,"taking care of patients is the best part, the worst are the constant non efficient changes, micromanagement, controlling administrators and office politics make it very stressfull"
bad,Experience at Aetna was negative from the very first day. Lack of competent leadership and management teams. Overworked on a very small salary. Hiring package included an annual incentive. Worked at the company only 8 months so it was decided I would not get the incentive until after one year with the company.
bad,"I love aetna best company to work for . "
bad,EEOC being filed against them. You be lucky to get a good working vacuum cleaner that doesnt fall apart. The workers dont do anything and managements clueless. Really. Some of the workers dont know how to clean professionally. Pay isn't any good. The client however were fun and interesting. I enjoyed them over Aetna employees.
bad,The company shows little interest in developing employees with training or professional development. Work changes from day to day. Employees are hired for one role and end up doing another. Leadership is non decisive. Great place to work for people who want high blood pressure.
bad,"compensation is too low for the type of work being performed"
bad,A typical day is confusion. I really didn't learn anything. Management they are unpredictable they like to change hour the next day. Co-workers are nice.Hardest part of the job is setups. Enjoyable part is breaks and going home.
bad,Overworked & Underpaid.  Amateur management.  Stressful environment.  Little recognition for going over & above.  Top down know-it-all management does not seek opinions or suggestions on how to improve any aspect of business operations
bad,"I worked out of Fresno, CA for the public & labor area for Aetna. This department is absolutely terrible & there is no way to move up unless you click with upper management & do her work for her. "
bad,"A typical day at work is claim management adjudication and time management....Team player, and demonstrate ownership."
bad,"They do not process you COBRA immediately.  You have to wait weeks and then you have to call in to get your account fixed."
bad,It was handling calls about the plan the was in and taking payments from the customers.
bad,Assist agent with applications and billing questions. All other complex issue. Learn nothing no chance for advancement. Management is absolutely horrible no support. Don't show any appreciate for employees. Most of the coworkers were nice working with. High turn over everyone quit or looking for another job outside the company. Hardest part of job is not being able to help a agent because another department has not fixed a problem. Lots of system issues. Most enjoyable part is the friendship you develop.
bad,"everything they tell you in the interview is not true, the pros are you can flex however you have to be off of audit, to get overtime or a bonus you have to be at 10 claims an hour which is impossible"
bad,"Just finished four weeks of class room training for Aetna through Optum.  Sat around eight hours a days doing basically nothing!! Except taking test after test and you have to pass with a 90 or above. You don't have to be qualified to train and they pull anyone of the floor to train and they don't know what they are doing.  Pay is terrible..Dress code was something to be desired. Kept stressing dress code was strict and had to be business dress and no jeans,  which I didn't mind. But the majority of the people wore jeans and looked like they just rolled out of bed.  Will not be going back."
bad,"I worked in customer service at the amherst office"
bad,"Very busy, productive. Assist customers w/ helath benefits. Enjoyed helping people."
bad,"Aetna is only concerned about your typical beauracracy. With nepotism,  cronyism, and favoritism, you'll find that climbing the latter is basically at the mercy of the warm and fuzzies upper management gets when they see your face, unless you're black, then affirmative action supercedes any competency anyone may have. For the record, i was promoted thrice in the 5 years i was there, it just was so unfortunate i saw others suffer, especially those i tried to help that merited the promotion through hard work. They have a dress down policy but discriminate against you when you do. If you are a veteran and have issues, they target and get rid of you. They make inept people managers based on how apathetic you are towards others. In other words, if they find that members of your team like you, they will not choose you for leadership unless you are their drinking buddy. Plantation aetna is a modern day slave ship and the fact that it's in Plantation Florida seems to be rather appropriate."
bad,"Aetna has the worst bullying techniques that I have ever witnessed."
bad,My supervisor was in a different state! Very hard to establish a working relationship with her.  Customers very disgruntled about their premiums and crabby/rude insurance brokers.
bad,"great job, love it , Unfortunately they had lay offs and I was affected. "
bad,Not a place for growth or advancement. Management very impersonal and unapproachable.
bad,I hated this job more than I have ever hated any job in my life. It took everything in me to get up and go there everyday. I hated the way they the company treated the people that worked there. It felt like I was pulling time for eight hours of my life. The worst company that I have ever worked for in my life.
bad,"A typical work day is getting started by organizing and prioritizing my job duties."
bad,"I worked in the Provider Service Department for five years. Was never given an opportunity to advance and I tried several times. The company does not value its employees at all. The Call Center feels like a slave ship or prison. You can not go to the bathroom freely. You are MICRO MANAGED Over the top. Your ideas, concerns or anything of the sort is never addressed. And what is really annoying is your supervisor will know less about the job than you and is in no position to help you grow at all. than they lay you off by calling you into a room one day and walking you to the door."
bad,"This job was the worst job I ever worked in my career so far. If you like MICRO MANAGERS then go ahead apply. People are so to faced there it made me sick!!! Management only sees you as a number not an employee!!! I have nothing good to say about AETNA except I worked with good team mates and had weekends off. The benefits are horrible and every year they get worse. I dreaded going into that job!!!!! I had migraines everyday because the managers are rude and with threaten to fire you over everything!!! They do not care if you have a family and doctor appointments, they are always changing the rules!!! And favoritism is a huge thing there, if your not buddy buddy with your manager, then forget doing any extra projects!!! You will get treated like you are nothing!!! Now that I no longer work at Aetna I am stress free and happy!!! My current job I do the same stuff as I did at Aetna and there is no stress involved at all!!! And advancing yeah that won't happen either at Aetna, there is people who been there 30 years and still in that same spot as day 1!!! I tell you do not work at this place!!!!"
bad,oK JOB IS YOU JUST NEED SOMETHING NOW.It is not job you could make a career out of.
bad,There is nothing good about this company and job.
bad,"This job is pretty stressful and demanding. They expect you to educate the members yet, you have to do so in a certain amount time. The best part of this job is the co workers. That's about it"
bad,Orlando Aetna is a different work from any other Aetna location. Be aware of this when applying for a job there.
bad,"The job has no security, no good pay and management is terrible"
bad,treated professionals like children always under pressure about reviewing with quantity and time limits. Would not suggest this job to anyone. Terrible people to work for and management has no conscience
bad,"Terrible, awful, run, run as fast as you can. Nasty working conditions. Inept management."
bad,"Aetna was a horrific company to work for. No family values, no claimant values. It was all about the money and geting corporate reports to read correctly for the clients benefit. No employee support."
bad,"no coment at all, just nice trainning and good results but no work was done"
bad,"Human Resources does not support the workers. Job descriptions and actually work environment are not the same. Too stressful, not friendly, unappreciative of workers. Management has no idea what they are doing. Too many meetings and not enough productivity."
bad,"This company is not a company that values employees. Working there for over three (3) and being one of the top employees in that department I felt unappreciated after requesting time to work from home due to my mother’s illness. Meanwhile, other employees with less years within the company and still in training we able to work from home. Knowing that their performance was not to standard la to"
bad,They tell you things you wanna hear during the interview to get you to be a part of the team if you’re hired once hired the expected training time was increased by an additional three months making training six months they stated that members pay extra for health concierge meanwhile you don’t pay the employees a salary to match the Work we do
bad,Work here if you want to be stressed out treated like a child and get paid less then a McDonald’s worker. This company makes millions and pays under what they should but expect A1 customer service. They don’t let you get enough training in their computer systems before they throw you on the phone. Not a place to work if you have children. Good luck to all that apply here.
bad,Do not work here!!! Management here is horrible. No work life balance. They treat you like  trash here. The pay is not enough for the amount of work that you have to do
bad,"A typical day at work starts and ends with you running; you can never make it to the finish line. You can never do enough.  The more you do, the more work they give you.  There is no time for breaks or lunch, and if you are salary, plan on working way over 40 hours a week.   When evaulated for raises and you tell your supervisor this, they tell you everyone is working like this, so what do you do that is above that for a raise.   I feel the pay is decent,  but is not equal to the amount of work you do.   They push people as hard as possible to get as much as they can out of you till you burn out and then quit.  I'm looking for a new job.  Stay away!"
bad,"This place had ghetto managers. That barely speak proper English and have bad attitudes. Mostly temp and very few permanent positions offered. Favoritism, and rudeness. Company doesn’t value employees"
bad,Employees are treated as a number. Management and HR are all remote...there is no sense of community or connection with coworkers. Business needs always come before employees well being. Management is atrocious.
bad,"Aetna hires and fires people based on the sales seasons not based on the quality of your work."
bad,Was not paid fairly and hours were not enough for a supervisor position. I had a vast work load that I was responsible for and not enough help or time to do it. I was a supervisor and made one dollar more an hour than my crew
bad,"Very production oriented,  dont care much for quality. The team I was on was very micro managed, from being told to use your 10 minute break for the restroom to watching Skype. Being 3 minutes late results in a write up."
bad,The management was hard core and very hard to get advice from. Rarely available to help and was condescending.  The best part of my job was the contact with my customers.
bad,Truth- They have no clue what they are doing. Disorganized. Poor planning. Chase logic is a mess. I will not work with them again. Oh and pay is lower than standard.
bad,"only lateral movement within the company, unless you actually know someone in the position you're seeking, then nepotism works for most. For my specific position, Aetna pays much less than our competitors, even with the company-wide ""raise"" from April 2016. I was once in a department that had great management and communication within our team, made the mistake of thinking I was going to a better department, one that promised during the interview that I would work-from-home, only to later find out that not everyone on my team is equal, and that only a select few were allowed to WAH. Communication is terrible now, in my new department, and I feel as if others who aren't qualified for my current position, are ranked higher."
bad,"Aetna will create a leadership role for you and in less than a year, eliminate that role to cut costs. This creates terrible morale for the team that watches you work hard and career advance, then they fire you and send out an all associates email with no warning that your name will be included."
bad,"My supervisor played favorites and if you were not one of your favorites you were nit picked all the time.  In fact 3 of my ""pod mates"" are now here where I work now. No one ever smiled there or was happy."
bad,"When I began my career with Aetna 16+ years ago, it was the best company I could have asked to be employed by. I loved my job, I learned something new everyday, developed open, honest and trustworthy relationships with management, co-workers and most importantly, every claimant who's claim I handled. fast paced"
bad,"Poor management, they don't give raises and they don't promote from within. I've worked for them for 2 years and still haven't got a raise."
bad,"incerdibly understaffed, impossible workload, 50-60 hours per week expected and needed, all paperwork, no real focus on members, constantly changing priorities, lack of effective management, poor supports. Your talent and experience is not appreciated, only your ability to work under horrible pressure"
bad,"none stop work, too busy we don't have even time to go to the bathroom"
bad,"Just an overall horrible experience, no one knows what they are doing and you are expected to be perfect...Micromanagement and favoritism,  expectatations are unfair, workload is rediculous....Just stay away"
bad,"Orlando branch is unorganized,workflow processes are counter productive. This branch does not support work life balance. Training is lacking, long hours, unpaid on call weekend rotations. Terrible benefits,corrupt unprofessional management that lacks sincerity for their employees."
bad,"Completely dissatisfied, was a Nurse for Aetna, resigned after 1 year.  Management concerned with relationships with clients and do not support employees.  Very adversial relationship between NCM and claims examiners."
bad,Horrible place to work!  Managers play favorites with the staff & people with the most skills are overlooked for inexperienced workers.  Incompetent upper management but are rewarded.
bad,"Could be a great company if they had great management. Everyone is struggling, and fighting against each other instead of working together. time to move on"
bad,Worked 9.5 years there and would never go back to the company.  Management has no idea of the dynamics within the company.  Truly hope the close the specialty pharmacy and focus on healthcare only.
bad,"Lots of rules and points. Two faced ppl and cliques. The mangers were very petty, very much wanting to be in the cool clique. The insurance is affordable and pretty good."
bad,"Aetna (Woodland Hills) is a collection of employees who have been there for a long time. Meaning all processes are outdated, which means no innovation, and work is doubled. No one is open to new ideas or processes. Senior employees feel that their time with the company allows for them to be unprofessional with no consequence. Management is afraid to speak up and correct those behaviors.. this makes anyone new feel uncomfortable. The work could be less if their processes were improved. But, the environment is absolutely toxic and the pay is awful. I would not recommend working there."
bad,The management and leads here are terrible! They will talk to you like you’re a kid. Most gossip comes from the call center manager. This place also allows harassment. If you bring it to their attention you will become a target. The stress is not worth the pay. Every caller is angry due to being lied to by the agents. Hard work is not recognized and you’re there to help with numbers. If you don’t have any health issues now...you will working here.
bad,"I felt from the beginning that we were being used by that company, we were a clase of 34 people and I think just are working 4 of my clase, poor training and they through us under the bus to reply question on the telephone without to have the knowledge that we needed in the health insurance industry. I won’t recommend that job to nobody. Manager they don’t support new hires and they are controlling every call and trying to blame you for everything."
bad,Location no longer there. Expectations were to make health coverage calls that should not be made at the education levels that Member Service Rep required.
bad,"Working at Aetna in New Albany Ohio is a joke they hired new employees at a higher pay than established employees who helped open new department. The management was a joke they only allowed certain people to advance in certain departments. "
bad,"poor review due to nobody has any experience especially the supervisor and manager has no experience, company is very unorganized. the company is failing"
bad,"Management tended to be very off hands when it came to managing.  They were not very helpful and management did not seem to be together when it came to implementing policies.  You would go to one manager and they would tell you something and then when you went to another manager, they would tell you something completely different."
bad,"Use to love my job at Aetna. The past year management made the job difficult and became a very hostile environment. "
bad,"Working at Aetna was my first corporate job. When I first started I thought that this was my dream job. But as time went on it turned into my worst nightmare. Management was unprofessional and very devient, rude. They set me up for failure and didn’t provide the proper training. Then would look at me and treat me like I’m incompatent for their misdirection.They also discriminated against me, judged me talked about me to other collegues it’s like high school almost. That toxic energy that doesn’t belong in the corporate work place"
bad,"Overworked, culture is negative. They ask you to do the impossible. Constant change. Calling members post discharge and pre-admission is enjoyable. But all the meetings and constant work flow changes get in the way of helping the members."
bad,"Wonderful c- workers. The employees of the Rocc appear to be able to enjoy their job. They get their work completed while still having a positive environment. "
bad,"very stressful. no work life balance. lack of support management. management reactive not proactive. management distant. too many chiefs not enough indians. lots of turnover in staff, always open positions. which leaves short staffed and long hours on ongoing basis. the um nurse consultants in this department do both um and prescert surgery, one paycheck.excessive documentation and clerical work for nurses. be prepared to work long hours to meet tats. sat, holidays and eve work required as well as some friday eve.favortism is rampant"
bad,"Once a very enjoyable and exciting job.   Within the past year, but especially the past 6 months policy and procedures change daily if not hourly.    Tenured nurses that should be in management are overlooked.    Literally the absolute only thing that is still enjoyable s the ability to work from home.   Even that is a potential hindrance to work life balance due to the EXPECTATION of the work numbers in conjunction with the EXPECTED lengthy documentation for required quality reviews.  Which I might add are also new and have changed numerous times over the past 3 months."
bad,"As a supervisor you are expected to work 60-80 hours per week, evenings and every weekend. Even though they tell you that every weekend is not required, it is! You will receive texts and phone calls at all hours from the manager and time off is discouraged and frowned upon. No matter how hard you work the manager will do everything to keep you from moving to a new position."
bad,We were all told we would be working from home.  We are not working from home.  This is a state contract job.  We are about to lose the contract and our jobs due to poor leadership from our Director and Supervisors.  We have high turn over.  Managers and Director have no clue what the job duties or time frames to accomplish tasks consist of from outreach calls to creation of documents.  Our program does not follow the company Core Values.  Pay increases are a jock.  Top performers were not given equal pay increases to those just picking up checks because some people were hired in at a higher salary than others.  Insurance for employees is not as good as insurance offered to spouses who work at other companies but get Aetna insurance.
bad,"100% Stressful job, a call center with uncaring management and customer are always rude. Management suck and is unfair about everything. Training class sucks and does not allow you time to learn the job."
bad,"it was fine at first, then they started picking favorites some people could do whatever they wanted the ones they didn't like couldn't, seating charts, timed personals, you only had two mins to go to the bathroom if it wasn't on your brak which you only get two of. that place is a joke only good thing was the pay, the staff was horrible."
bad,"The work is not hard, but there is no clear organization of workflow as it constantly changes with no notice.  There is overt favoritism and FMLA will be held against you when it comes to job performance."
bad,Senior management takes a punitive approach to everything. Praise or appreciation is rare but criticism is abundant. Senior leaders do not trust the lead team that has made the department successful since long before they joined the company.
bad,Demanding work environment with little financial rewards or opportunity for advancement. Horrible benefits package for a company that offers superior coverage to others. Major disconnect between upper management and the workers who run the company who issue policy changes that difficult to implement and therefore nearly impossible to achieve.
bad,The benefits they offer to their employees was horrible. There was minimal opportunity to advance. My skill set was too much for the position. The management was unorganized
bad,"Very under appreciated and very stressful.  "
bad,"Terrible Management, Blatant Racism, Ungodly Mandatory Overtime.  Unfair Treatment towards employees who are African American, No help from Human Resources."
bad,"Horrible culture. My immediate team leader would walk by me in the morning, completely ignoring my ""Good Morning"" greeting to her. This happened several times before I gave up. Call center work is computerized sweat shop, with timed bathroom breaks, heavy on scripting compete with poor grammar that we were expected to stick to verbatim. Example: ""Our internet access is currently unavailable at this time."" Yes, really. And the computer systems are circa 1980. Management used Salesforce, but the call center used ancient programs that failed completely at times (see above scripting)."
bad,"Long term care department is disorganized. Management is blind leading the blind. High caseloads, no support. Everyone is stressed out. Worst place to work!"
bad,"Based on what the I was informed by the recruiters, it is not what I expected. There is no work from home like I was told. They are micro-managers (timing restroom breaks). There is no room for advancement. The social workers caseload is over 600. The work expectations are unrealistic as well as productivity. Weekends have been mandated to catch up. Senior workers have to help others who fall behind in their work with their same expectations being required of them. Management is terrible, messy and manipulative. There is also a high turnover rate from Directors to clinical staff."
bad,"I worked as a for Aetna/Coventry in Richmond VA. This is the worst place to work. They base performance on how team leads and supervisors like  you. They also choose poor Team Leads to train new hires. If you are not liked you will not be properly trained. `I would not recommend working for this company unless they change Manager Supervisors, Senior Techs base any advancement on who likes you."
bad,"I worked for this company for about two months when I first moved to Indianapolis. It was very poorly managed and I often found myself doing the work of two-three people due to the quality of people that they would hire in. Very low pay for the amount of work that is asked, and I also had to wait 8 weeks just to receive my first paycheck. Lets just say that my money management skills really had to be applied while working for this employer. Very low rating from myself, and I don't recommend this job to anybody."
bad,"I work for mail handlers benefit plan through Aetna in Scottsdale az. "
bad,"Not only did she not care, she was clueless about the workload.  She came in and made life miserable. I was working at home and she didn't like that. She started to bully me. I contacted HR multiple times. They really don't care about you. I was on the MMIC contract and it was so poorly managed. I worked the contract for 5 years previous with Magellan but no one cared to hear what I knew nor was my experience respected. Aetna was reinventing the wheel very poorly. About benefits, of course, employees receive theirs through Aetna. Aetna finds ways around paying you for claims as an employee. Very weird feeling to be cheated by the insurance company you actually work for. They totally make their own rules. So much for the Aetna Way. A lot of talk and no action. Whatever you do, don't work the MMIC behavioral health contract. No work from home and no care about family or a life outside of work!  Chased all the good employees on the contract who knew what they were doing right out the door, including me."
bad,"This company has poor management; it is a new program to Bayou Health and they are severely behind.  The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals need to make a few visits, as well as Aetna's top management (outside of the Kenner Office).  Employees are not judge based on work performance, but personal feelings.  This company has a high turnover rate.  The Member Services Department Manager has created a lot of tension between employees with lies and deceit.  The Provider Services Manager has such a negative spirit and is very disrespectful to employees, but never to the management team above her.  Upper management refuse to investigate; they support the negative behavior."
bad,If you want to work at a job that thinks you are a robot this job is for you. Aetna wants everyone to think they care about their customers but it's putting lipstick on a pig. I went without internet service for 6 months. Management continued to be 'working' on the issue when I left. They are offering programs to their clients that they have no idea how to institute. The people who are in management positions don't even have backgrounds in the healthcare industry. This is a very frustrating company to work for as they do not want to change anything to make working conditions better or improve outcomes for those they serve. Thinking outside of the box is not encouraged. The CEO talks a big game about better processes to improve working conditions and achieve results but management is not listening.
bad,This customer service position you are required to sit and answer phones eight hours a day with a 8 min bathroom break per day.
bad,Was nice at first being the new person in the dept. Made friends very easily. Busy from morning to end of day & took on several tasks at hand to be completed in  one to two days.
bad,"Very good place to work, excellent benefits..."
bad,inbound call center for both members and providers calling regarding claims and benefits.
bad,Chicago Racist and will let you know it !
bad,"If I had known that Rich D was a homosexual before my termination, and only hired me in hopes of getting into a relationship, then had me fired by creating a paper trail, once he realized he wasn't going to get what he wanted, I would have sued for secksual harassment. "
bad,"All and all I learned effective time management skills, as we were always trying to beat the clock with numerous dead lines and preparations for countless meetings weekly.  I am grateful for the experience but the time crunch and fast paced dead lines were causing anxiety and stress for all the office environment."
bad,"Aetna tells you when to take a break & when to go to lunch. If you go when you’re ready or need to go, u get an occurrence. Once they add up, you’re out the door. "
bad,Micromanage was the main thing that was annoying. Managers gave empty promises and made excuses to keep me where I was staying at. Also favoritism everywhere. Please note that I was 1 of 5 males in the entire building. Never again.
bad,"Initially, great training & learning experience, but management created hostile environment. Co-workers prohibited from speaking to each other or taking lunches & breaks together...fake fire drills conducted for sole reason of having everyone exit building & leave personal things behind to be searched, & upon re-entering bldg., some summarily prevented from entering...they are fired. EVERYONE walking on eggshells daily in fear of being fired for insane reasons or no reason at all."
bad,"Training is 5 months long you literally don’t learn nothing you won’t learn until you’re taking. Calls. The quality is a joke management is a joke the whole company is a joke. If you miss 7 days unapproved in a year they will fire you doesn’t matter if you have doc notes or not. Calls are back to back you do billing, check processing, benefits, claims, send claims for reprocessing explain why they got denied explain why appeals got denied explain why precertification got denied etc. you do everybody’s job for them as a health concierge only plus is Monday through Friday. If you fail quality you will get fired. They make it sound so easy during training once you get on the floor you will realize it was all a front. There’s a reason why they are always hiring you get 12 hours every month but every time you miss it deducts from that. So you never have time accrued pay is 16 starting off .24 cent raise every year if your quality and numbers are good."
bad,"I did my work thoroughly everyday in an efficient manner."
bad,"I took this job after being told that being hired through a staffing agency was temporary and that we would be hired on as permanent employees. However, about half a year later the company changed their minds, probably to save money on having to pay out on employee benefits, and it became an indefinite temporary job. We were sent to work from home which was nice, but the management was awful. I was always told conflicting things by different people. There is no paid time off, sick time, or vacation days. They do not follow their own attendance policy with employees and will let anyone go regardless of their situation- car accidents, surgery or other medical reasons, etc. Bottom line- they do not care about their employees."
bad,A child could run the teams at Aetna. Management only complains but can’t assist . Always an issue with taking time off. Forced to take 30 min lunch even though your supposed to have an hour. Overall not a good place to work. Stressful for all the wrong reasons.
bad,"If you are considering employment within the NY/NJ Aetna sales and AM team please proceed with caution. Great company overall but the local management  team ruins it (Sales/Acct mgmt).  Exceptionally high turnover in this office.  Many unhappy employees. Mgmt leads by fear and plays favorites. Unfortunately, it’s a very toxic environment. It’s a shame because the company is doing some really great things. Other offices around the country have a much nicer experience. Can’t wait to get out of here. I like the company overall - so I would like to stay with the company and transfer out of this department (as so many of my colleagues have done!!)"
bad,The management are in cliques you would think you're in school all over again. There is no open door policy or confidentiality and low and behold if you tell upper management anything about the floor managers they take sides and get rid of you. You have managers stealing time off of the clock and when reported their boss did not care. They do not like if you tell on them but right is right and wrong is wrong.
bad,Cut-throat. Supervisors always at odds with each other. Constant gossiping and backstabbing. The director is a horrible elitist woman who hinders the advancement of her team- unless of course you are part of her clique. Agents are insubordinate and spoiled. Call avoidance goes unpunished. Bad; just bad. You work swing shift hours with horrible days off. No weekends off.
bad,"Leadership/Mgmt is way more concerned with being busy rather than effective. In their view high numbers equates to success. Couldn't be further from the truth. Several positions had 100's of applicants who have been sourced, screened, interviewed yet no hires for that given position. "
bad,This company has management that is not supportive or professional. During meetings if you are not there you will be the topic of discussion. Many have been there years and are stuck in there ways. Those without ethics continuously are prompted. The money is not worth the horror you will experience in this cut throat atmosphere. Move on
bad,"I was hired after a long 6-7 step interview process where I was told I would be getting paid a certain amount with vacation time. I started the job and a couple of months into it. I was told I had to bill all of my work in 6 minute increments for each contract/ file I worked on. I had to bill for more time than I was meant to work, e.g. 8hrs pay needed me to bill 9.5hrs a day. To bill 9.5 hrs you need to work about 11 or 12hrs. You don't get paid for training, they say you will get credit in time but you don't. You only get paid part of what you bill for. Many phone calls you make are not paid for. Calls and emails from the company are not paid for. You are expected to answer the phone and emails various times of the day/evening.  If you take say a week 40hrs off they charge you vacation time and then you loose all overtime pay which is less than regular pay until you have earned the 40hrs extra and more.  You end up loosing holiday pay and any bonus time pay you made so you are charged twice in effect. Overtime pay or bonus is about 10% less than regular pay, it arrives 2 months later and is taxed at an extremely high rate, so is t worth it.  You are expected to find your own clients/files to work and to market yourself. "
bad,"Aetna as a company, through programs, emails, and other communications tries hard to educate employees and promote collaborative team work. Unfortunately, there is management in Government Programs who undermind corporate efforts and create an environment where staff learn to be agreeable and supportive of all Management's views, ideas and initiatives regardless of their true views and feelings in order to avoid the rath and alienation that comes with anything less than total agreement.  New employees are literally told that if you want to stay here, just smile and agree with everything they say and don't  make waves. If you are not willing to sell your soul for a paycheck, don't work at Aetna particularly in Government Programs."
bad,"My job title was inside sales Representative. I was responsible for making 70 calls a day. At least 25 sales a week."
bad,"The employer brand image and perception of culture that is marketed and sold to candidates is not the experience delivered. There are serious issues with harassment and workplace bullying. Poor leadership and management reflects highly on the floor. Absent leadership has allowed atrocious behavior. Management chooses to ignore the behavior- ignored behavior is condoned behavior. If you take your concerns to HR, the leadership will subtly retaliate against you. Aetna’s Code of Conduct is a one way contract - you abide by it, they don’t."
bad,"Poor management and limited progression opportunities. No feeling of job security, one day your fine and the next your on the chopping block. There is no employer loyalty to their employees and they slashed most of the benefits over the last 8 years."
bad,"UM Nurse"
bad,"Aetna is full of clicks, if you are not one of the favorites, you will not go far here at all. You can not advance unless you are willing to be a brown noser. The rotating shifts in the medicare department are not the best either."
bad,"Aetna Payflex made alot of management changes at this location near the end of 2016 and up to date, Not all metrics and rules are on a level playing field, if you go to your supervisor with concerns you may end up getting termed or put on performance plans and possibly  just finally quit do to all the wrongs going on at this location. When it comes to the attendance policy not everyone is held to the same standard some people have been let go with 6 points while others where able to get up to 14 points ( we are not supposed to be with the company after 8 from what I was always told). The job itself was simple and yes it could be stressful due to everyone wanted their reimbursements or their debit cards working. I finally just quit due to everyone not being held to the same standards, how the rules applied to some but others did not have to follow the rules at all. I did go to HR regarding an issue or two when my supervisor would not help with the situation well HR would not help either. For any new hires your co-workers will be the best help you will have, management not so much, my supervisor was not helpful,"
bad,.Log in to receive benefit or claim calls. no help line they were away for meetings 80% of the time. They want you to try to figure it out no one to deal with escalated calls. I knew how to handle but dealing with  providers they had their own way. The hardest part of the job was lack of manuals for training with different calls and how to handle certain calls with different outcomes.
bad,"Due to legal reasons I can't go into details, but Aetna treats its employees like garbage, and does not value loyalty or hard work. Company morale is extremely poor, as well."
bad,"It was very difficult  dealing with the micro-management requirements, it seems that an employee can't never meet the call metrics, there always something wrong, always finding errors not to give you all the points required to pass.  Management is careless about the employees, they spent their entire day blaming other departments for their lack of competency."
bad,Focus is on productivity not quality. Processors are steered towards spitting out claims and the focus is not on the quality. I have seen poor quality processors go far in this company.
bad,"I was at Aetna for 2 years and it started bad and quickly went downhill.  First was waling in the door there was little to no organization.  Training for a new employee was going through a web automated presentation and receiving a checklist of things you were responsible for doing in your first 30 days.  Any questions?  Call HR who has no clue most of the time. (they're outourced)"
bad,I had no insurance experience and was eager to learn. With the CVS merger there were alot of jobs that were lost. This company is all about helping who they want and promoting those that are not worthy of promotion. The AETNA culture is not real. Rules are for some not all. AFA new sales is a joke.
bad,"Aetna is a good company to work for overall (pay, benefits, 401K, health insurance, wellness reimbursement, etc.) However, leadership in the complaint and appeal department creates a toxic stressful work environment for it's analysts, no room to development or post out into other departments or positions. No regard for your personal life, treated like a robot...all they care about is numbers & production. Too much drama and shadiness, bonuses & metrics not scored and weighted properly. You will cry everyday."
bad,It was horrible place to work. they pay was great but management didnt know what they were doing. very stressful and they would macromanage there employees
bad,Worst company I ever worked for. They don't allow you to use doctors notes for REAL issues. Then you get FIRED and can't get unemployment for something you can't control.
bad,"Management sucked coworkers alright  no chance to advance to another department the manager and assistant were mean spirited  didn’t care a"
bad,"In healthcare there are numerous details and Aetna fail to train properly and expects employees to figure this out for them selves when it comes to a customers health, you never see management due to them working from home and you have to email and wait for a response to what should be a quick question"
bad,Mgmt is miserable & the toxicity trickles down to the staff. You’ll be thrown to the wolves after poor training. They lie and pretend to be there for you and promise to help you but they don’t. All they do is gossip about you and laugh at you behind your back like it’s some joke that you’re struggling. Don’t work here. You’ve been warned.
bad,"The supervisor I worked under is afraid of conflict. Therefore she will never defend her employees, and she will let her supervisor talk to you any kind of way and treat you very poorly. The entire department is miserable and hates their jobs. When one person messes up, they mess it up for the entire team. Instead of fully investigating problems, you get blamed for other people's mistakes. You have to suck up to management to get the ""special projects"". The training is mediocre at best, but then you get in trouble for not being fully knowledgeable."
bad,My personal experience with the company was not the best. The specific location I worked at was a dedicated location so there is very little room for growth. They only thing positive I can speak on is that they DO NOT like to fire anyone. This is also a bad thing and can make the rest of the staff feel unsafe.
bad,"Aetna is a diverse and dynamic place to work with excellent employee benefits.  The corporate culture really values ethics and integrity which most employees embody.  The best part about working there was the camaraderie of other employees who are typically well educated, articulate, intelligent, and very ethical. There is alot of autonomy which can be good, but at times is not helpful if you want to advance your career.  Salaries are not comparable to other companies.  The company is short on real focus for helping employees advance their careers.  You really have to manage it yourself.  Expectations for performance are very high, and it is difficult to earn a five star rating for your performance bonus.  It is important to take time for your own personal goals and tasks, because otherwise, it is very easy to get caught up in meeting everyone else's expectations (except yours!)"
bad,"Other than salary and bonus there were no other pros working for this company. This was the Medicaid division and they were clueless on how to run the operation. Just continued to bring in friends and friends of friends regardless of skill set. "
bad,"Typical corporation, worked there far too long ago to offer meaningful or relevant impressions of this company as it operates today. I’m sure there are more contemporary reviews."
bad,"I did invoicing and data entry every day.  "
bad,Worst experience ever with direct manager. There were special treatment towards certain employees.  There was targeted behavior reported to upper management and hr and nothing was done.
bad,"No job security, management is not transparent. Salary is very competitive. Obvious nepotism. Work at Home is a plus. Onboarding process is expeditious."
bad,"Management Has very poor integrity, unprofessional business culture.  Headquarters presented a very different company than the Detroit office presented.  Poor work ethic, lacking integrity, management has little interest in it's employees and succeeding."
bad,Horrible management with no management experience or training. Many thing done virtually when they could be done personally in office. Managed by a manager in Los Angeles while there were several locally
bad,I've worked here for 7 years and it has progressively gotten worse. Everything about the job has gotten worse. I have had issues with management playing favoritism with other employees and leaving myself and others out to dry.
bad,This job is horrible!!! The managers are horrible and they don’t take care of their employees at all. Mangers do not help you they have favorites and they lie.
bad,Typical workday is stressful to say the least if you are on the phone. They seem to ask for a lot of extra work knowing you are a phone rep and talk on the phone all day. The hardest part is dealing with customers who do not know anything about insurance. The most enjoyable part is when you get hired at a better job.
bad,"I wouldn't work for this company, I was being laid off at my old job , that the only reason I accepted the position. It was the worst mistake I ever made. All management do is yell and gripe, No positive influence, I wish I would have just stayed at the company I was being laid off. No work life balance."
bad,This was a very difficult organization to work for. The management was unprofessional and negative. There was no trust among employees. The intranet site that i required to perform you job was disorganized and difficult to navigate.
bad,"This job provides great pay."
bad,"At first Aetna seemed liked a great company to work for however, it was very clear in a few months that the company had culture where talent was not valued. Managers were allowed to take unreasonable decisions and hire and fire at their will. Managers are very biased both racially as well for employees that they have personal relationships with"
bad,"Cut throat, throw under the bus environment. Many members of the leadership hide their incompetance by blaming others and setting up subordinates to fail. Multiple and conflicting demands,  condescending tone from executive leadership. Inconsistency in managing employees. Many team leads developed medical issues working in this ""war zone""."
bad,"If your looking for anything but an entry level position then work here."
bad,Great benefits and great job to get experience but overlooked hardworking employees for family members and friends.  Long hours and overtime was mandatory and unable to take off during holiday season.
bad,"Management was horrible"
bad,"Don't believe anything they tell you about policy, mission statement or anything in the interview - because that will all be completely different once you start your actual job. Happened to me and others in my department - promise one thing, do another. Horrible culture of favoritism & unrealistic expectations. I always felt like we were having to reinvent the wheel so to speak, instead of learning from corporate or other state Aetna plans. Would never go back."
bad,"I entered into Aetna Better Health of Ohio with great expectations. My hope was to be with this company until retirement. From the start, I felt that management was very eager to just push me around into different categories and the right hand did not know what the left hand was doing. A LOT OF TURNOVER!!! Providers are constantly told we have your claims, appeal, dispute information, then they call back after 30 days, then they are told, sorry your information is lost, resubmit it again, this is done after 3 times in a row, going on 2 years now. Very unethical company. I am glad I no longer work for them. Benefits were ok, similar to what the members have...."
bad,"No real room for advancement, I was merely a number. This was a very stressful job and the management did not support their employees."
bad,"Majority of the health plan people are very hardworking and care deeply about their work. Aetna is is huge company, and with the large size it can be difficult to be innovative."
bad,"Terrible location to work at. Pay is good only because they make you pay for insurance out of your own pocket with super high deductibles. Manager and supervisors for this location micro-manage, they are always in your personal business. Favoritism is their specialty. you have to tell someone if your in the bathroom for more than 5 minutes . they monitor your every move. supervisors never care to help but always there to make sure your review is terrible. this location is terrible. the company in general is decent."
bad,"Demeaning mangers, I carried a caseload of over 100.  I worked will with my co workers.  I never had a member complain about me."
bad,"I was there for years!! I did not like the place, they failed to put the customers first. It was all about the numbers!! Not about doing your personal best!! I had seen things that where not the most ethical things in the world!! I failed to stand up and reported what I seen, until those unethical things hurt me!"
bad,"If you like being under trained, cliques,  and being mistreated by your bipolar boss then this is the place for you.... If not just run. This is the worst job, my boss was always down our backs micro manager,  the nurses are petty. The Bosses will never stand up for the Dept. The nurses don't know how to talk to people correctly"
bad,"Nice to place to work. Tuition reimbursement "
bad,"terrible management that made the job unbearable and high standards unattainable. Insurance company was ran like a production line in a factory."
bad,Reviewed request for exceptions for medications from providers via fax and phone calls. Approve and or pended the requests for the Pharmacists or the Medical director to review.
bad,"If you like a high volume of calls and being attached to a desk all day with short break and short lunches, then go work here. When your away from your desk too long or in a certain status too long they send you an IM ask if your ok cause they just want you on the phone they don’t care. Calls are back to back to back with no break I’mn between and they pay like 30,900 a year to start And to say your working at a health insurance company, this was the worst insurance I had in my life."
bad,"It is all haphazard and the classrooms are packed out and out of control. It is mainly based on lectures and computer based training, They mainly teach to one or two learning styles."
bad,"The company is not very understanding to parents that need time off to take care of their young children, especially single parents. They make you feel guilty when you take time off and then treat you badly when you return, Furthermore, for being in the healthcare industry, they do not seem to value their employee's healthcare needs."
bad,Hard to keep up with task list. Enjoyed being the only maternity utilization reviewer. Was impossible to transfer to maternity program. Good hours. Regular days.
bad,"high turn over. very poor culture stemming from the CEO. Lots of work that doesn't go anywhere. "
bad,"The training instructor at Aetna/Coventry in North Houston: "
bad,"Hated pulling in the parking lot! I dont mind a good challenge but overwhelming is something I did not sign up for. Although I was told I would be a  Nurse UM consultant I was thrown into a Pre-certification role as well. 2 roles/1 check. "
bad,"The Aetna call center in franklin tn is a joke. The management are like a bunch of clowns in a circus act. Especially the call center manager Elaine. They are very unorganized and unprofessional. The pay is great! However the temp services they go through are all located out of town and are terrible as well. When you go to interview for the position they do not tell you it will be through a temp until after you are offered the position. Not much room for growth or advancement in this department. If offered another position at the same time as this, take the other and run!!!!"
bad,"I am currently with the company but seeking a position outside Aetna.  Promises made to me when negotiating for my hire were not kept, my role keeps expanding with no adjustment in salary, and an exemplary review resulted in about the same pay increase as an average employee. I believe there is significant pay disparity between myself and a male colleague with the same skills, education, and experience."
bad,Always busy and productive. Great coworkers. The compensation and benefits are great. However there is no job security.
bad,"Horrible company! Noone ever knows what's going on. The call quality review team are very miserable people & take great pride at picking calls apart. there is no job advancment, could be fired at any time. Which makes for a stressful work place. Policy change everyday an dthey would never tell us, but expected us to know. I worked in the Medicare field I had to educate mebers on plans. They basicall wanted us to have PHD . The knowledge they expect you to have on subjects isn't fair. They required so much then what they hire you for. I never miss work, but even if you're one minute late you woul dbe markd for an accurance. They only hire to get them thru peak periods and then afterwards you will be picked apart on every call until they can fire you."
bad,"Very poor training, management wants bodies to fill positions since there is high turnover, co-workers are friendly but stressed (don't plan on making friends), low pay, poor health benefits, cafeteria is ok."
bad,"Aetna is a faced work environment. Education and training both on the job and formal are available. The culture is positive despite very little job security in most departments. The hardest part of the job, surprisingly, is not the job but the expectations placed upon its workers; This along with a management culture of not valuing workers contribution make for a really stressful work environment."
bad,All I can say is for this company communication sucks stay away  this company don't care about nobody I was told it was going to get better the only thing I see it's getting worse
bad,"Training was terrible you get on the floor knowing nothing, yeah they are flexible if you work around management schedule. Put it like this they have a high turn around, they try to tell you the reason why nobody is there is because they retire no it’s because everyone quit. I never worked at a job where they don’t even give you free coffee. Would not recommend working here ."
bad,"The office environment is horrible. It starts from the top, I have never seen a place where management doesnt know anything about the job. One minute they talk down to us and the next they sing our praises. We have care Management assistants and they treat them like dirt. I would honestly recommend that if you want to work at an MCO you look elsewhere."
bad,"I loved my job when first hired.  I was trained daily how to properly set up and code SQL scripts used for correcting database information.  However, about a year in, our IT department was re-organized.  After that, we had a new manager at least annually.  I worked extremely hard, sometimes weeks without a day off.  After I was promoted and had to fight to get the raise to go with it, my husband begged me to quit.  Instead, I hung around hoping to find a way to get out of IT.  After I was diagnosed with cancer, I decided I wasn’t going to jump through their hoops any longer. I reinforced my physicians mandates and refused overtime and weekend work.  Ultimately it was my attitude, I believe, that led to the termination of my position.  The job cost me my marriage."
bad,"they said that they wanted nurses to make nursing judgements based on our knowledge if we could back up our statements with documented and referenced material. When I did this, they counseled me and hung working from home over my head if I didn't do it exactly like the robot they want you to be."
bad,"Company presents itself as 'Aetna' and you are hired under all the Aetna onboarding processes.  But it ends there as far feeling like you are working for a progressive company that supports training and mentoring new employees.  Job posting was extremely misleading and discovered after first 30 days that the PMO didn't really exist - it was only 3-4 SME's that had been with the company for a long time and it seemed everyone had the title of Project Manager regardless of your responsibilities. Changed the methodology 3 times for a major project and contract resources were cut randomly and suddenly and constant turnover impacted productivity and project delays. Team building, training and mentoring does not exist at PayFlex."
bad,"Old management ran the company for 5 years and left it in the black, the new CEO & COO ran the plan into the ground in 1 1/2 years.  Ran a lot of good talent away until corporate ran them away.  Leaving the plan in the red and in shambles. They were the weakest link in what use to be a very strong chain of employees.  "
bad,Expectations of management changed with a new manager in place. The working hours exceeded 10 hours per day and this was the norm.management did not seem to support or help empolyees.
bad,"Low salaries and micromanagement at it's finest, Used to be good poor management and now horrible work life balance. No more pension either. Managers treat their ee's like children and no respect. Family work life balance is a thing of the past at Aetna. Benefits are offered and flex time but managers don't allow it or let EE's use it."
bad,The call center was poorly managed and there were no career advancement available in the Grand Rapids office.  The management is the reason I personally left the company!
bad,"Aetna claimed to care about our health but overworked their staff routinely without compensation. Poor wage increases. Enjoyed the work, excellent co-workers, excellent immediate supervisors."
bad,Most unhealthy corporate culture I have every worked at in 30+ years.  Political backstabbing was a regular occurrence.  The company is not prepared to change in an evolving marketplace.
bad,"Answer calls Greeted policy holders/Data entry"
bad,This was a great company to work for. Pay was good. Had fun. Was a challenge.
bad,"Aetna pays well."
bad,Work from home. Job growth was available. Team was great to work with. But the management for Payflex was not well organized/lack of mentoring internally. The product was new and needs updates.
bad,"The position I held was monotonous & could be overly stressful considering the job. It's a call center, so calls could literally be back-to-back for hours."
bad,"Medicare is not a very good option to work for Aetna, Most of the older people are angry and hate the plans and cost of the insurance. If I had the option to work in a different area of Aetna that is what I would recommend."
bad,"Their current incentive bonus structure allows petty, personal animus from the lower-level ""Quality"" staff to disqualify front-line Customer Service workers from an otherwise earned bonus of up to $900 per quarter, and even the highest levels of management are unwilling to examine this culture issue and correct it. Shame on them!"
bad,No support with job opportunities working in a temp role seeking full time employment. One week of training then placed on the floor with a manual and a phone. Very low pay for the work they expect you to do to support their team and do majority of the work the same as a salaried Disability Benefits Manager.
bad,"I use to love my job before Aetna bought us out. When Aetna bought us out, everything changed. My first, second, and third complaint about Aetna is salary. We are some of the lowest paid claims examiners. For the last three years, I have only gotten a 2% raise. I was promoted to a Senior Benefit Examiner last year and I got a 4% raise. 4% was not even a dollar. Who gets promoted to a new position and doesn't, at least, get a dollar raise?!!! Aetna pays us an extremely low salary then, they completely took away our overtime. Which, was supplementing our low salary. Low salary + no overtime = living paycheck to paycheck. I'm too old to be struggling like this. We didn't have these problem with Coventry. On top of that, they've outsourced just about every aspect of the company. Including HR! And, let's not talk about how horrible our health benefits are. Oh, the irony of working for an insurance company and having some of the worst health benefits. I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to work at Aetna."
bad,"Was a good company 10 years ago.  The morale there is bad now.  Management keeps taking away benefits from employees."
bad,"Poor Management, no job security,  poor training,  the Aetna way is be prepared for daily changes. No flexibility for WAH position and no patient interaction and everyone is not treated equally."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with my members. I love helping and doing all the extra research to provide aid to a needy person. I love teaching and listening to my members. and together, me and my members to seek for a solution."
bad,It's all about the quantity not the quality which I don't like being a part of. They outsource most of their representatives overseas and by 2018 98% of the staff will be outsourced.
bad,"I work Aetna Mental health my manager was never there good but when she was it felt like elephant was in the room everyone tense high turn over rate // I got into a car acciedent and still got pointed for it with medical paper work . Im not sure how aetna ""cares"" when they don't even care for there employee's I have afamily to feed and to ensure wellness"
bad,"Aetna has a lot of flexibility, there is a culture of true diversity. Upward mobility is limited within your position, but given the right leadership you can excel"
bad,"Receive incoming calls all day an average of 80-100 calls a day."
bad,"Reverse descrimination unfortunately. (in Orlando area)"
bad,TechM is the contractor for CVS Aetna and they go waay out of heir way to short you on your pay and try to fire you with stupid idiotic 6-sigma NireshQA. They DO NOT give raises even after 2 years. They don't identify already talented people. Just hire from outside to a decent spot and have YOU train them. They twice did not pay US for 5 weeks! no apology either. REALLY arrogant folks. They truly lack morals and compassion of their good hardworking AMERICAN employees.
bad,Started working at home for this company 2 mnths ago. All I can say is inadequate training and huge turnover rates. Not worth the hassle. Coaches speak very condesendinglu to employees and nitpick to the point that it's impossible to do your job.
bad,The company name was Aetna until a new company brought them out the name the Hartford group. The managers are horrible I would never in my life respect them
bad,"I work for Aetna through Concentrix, Concentrix is a terrible place to work for, aetna was our contract , i dont know if they do things different if you actually work for them but through concentrix is stressful and not a good career at all."
bad,"This is a job for children that has never held a job "
bad,Aetna is a great job.  I love working at aetna. The Environment is really nice and the people are really friendly the support that you will get is great.
bad,"Once Aetna took over all Coventry accounts/ bought the co. It did go downhill and continued to be plagued w/daily system issues,. Poor processes, untrained managers and a company more focused on making dollars than taking care of their members. Too much favoritism shown also .......wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to work there."
bad,"Very busy no down time. Constantly on the phone back to back phone calls. Pays well , was my first real job and was able to learn many skills that assisted me further in the business world"
bad,"Aetna has been a wonderful employer to me.  Room for growth and many opportunities for advancement.  If you are willing to work hard and give 100%, bonus and merit increases are great"
bad,"I took incoming calls from providers regarding medical benefits, and was also trained to evaluate claims.  "
bad,"Support staff with Human Resources Department. Fast paced, customer service orientated environment for employee services."
bad,"Excellent place to work, co workers are fun and we work as a team."
bad,Learned a lot about healthcare and my knowledge has brightened. Loved the enviornment and coworkers as well. Company is under staffed.
bad,Be Aetna's face in the community promoting health and healthcare.
bad,"no job security if you are a temporary employee, they are also very disorganized"
bad,"A typical day at work is fast paced for the most. It was ran off production so at times there was alot of pressure to get so much work done in a day. During my time of working there it gave me the ability to learn more about health plans contracts and provider management. Management was nice, but at times employees felt as though their voice wasn't heard as far as work load and special projects."
bad,"I would prefer to discuss with an attorney and  Arizona state official with the govenors office. Lot's of discrimination. How individuals from the state of Arizona had contacted my supervisor and management and falsely gave information that I was on some kind state program, that required company employees to come into your home, to be monitored. Never had a criminal background, both civil and constitutional liberties were violated."
bad,atena mmic was not a structure facility manager didn't want to work or take calls have nothing more to say about Aetna I couldn't see myself going bck
bad,"Management is production driven, excessive unscheduled overtime, working non stop from break to break, no regard for employees or their families need for a good work life balance."
bad,"Inconsistency in work direction would best describe a typical day, but you get used to it.  Ability to work under pressure is something that was gained."
bad,This job is repetitive in nature as we provision security requests that have to stay consistent to comply with security standards. There is minimal supervision so you are able to work independently in a team environment.
bad,"Start work at 7:30 am Pull files and start to scrub them to make sure all needed was there. Start the data entry in data base. "
bad,"Aetna doesn’t care about its employees. You feel like just another number occupying the seat. Our benefits aren’t the best to actually work for a health insurance company. There is no work life balance. The managers have poor moral which brings down the energy in the work place. If you can avoid, please say yourself the heartache and stress in advance."
bad,"The company is alright only perk is their 401k is matched right away, the health insurance is terrible . It  takes 2 years to transfer to another department if your lucky.  My department had a high turn over because the management didn't  know how to treat their employees."
bad,"First 6 weeks of training is heavy. After being on training for benefits, they automatically send you for claims training, without asking if you want to go. You have no control of your pace. It's a must. Supervisor down grades in a conceited maerism."
bad,Company cares more about meeting metrics then they do about truly helping the customers.  They use old DOS systems still and the newer software they have is unreliable.  Computers are always crashing or freezing and it's hard to find answers or get anything done. It's high stress for not so high pay.
bad,Need I say more.  QM Director is a yes man and pathetic.I was once so proud to work at Aetna and loved my job.  Then we bought a particular company who's QM Director was unfairly hired in and our Department and the Company has never recovered from its downhill run.
bad,A lot of nepotism and gossip which constantly made work uneasy and uncomfortable. The hours were ridiculous and your entire week was basically consumed by work. So imagine being stuck at a work space for about 50 hours a week with inadequate managers who micromanage and gossip about their experiences with employees to OTHER EMPLOYEES. One of the worst working experiences I've had. When my contract ended I was honestly relieved.
bad,If you like poor management then this is the job for you.  They will fight what HR says in every aspect and will find the small things to go after you for and find the loopholes in the policies
bad,"horrible management; low salary; they are not family oriented; stressful. Lots of favortism, managers have no clue about products and are just there to get paid"
bad,"Over the years things have gotten pretty bad. Multiple benefits taken away, raises average 1.5% but you loose your raise because they increase health insurance premiums so it's a wash, layoffs are the norm, they refuse to upgrade systems and expect people to make up the difference by working longer/harder. "
bad,"The pay is low and advancement opportunities scarce.  Environment is very stressful.  Overall, it is not a very good place to work.  I would not recommend it to people."
bad,"Assisting members with their plans. We can handle issues from address changes, explanation of benefits, co pay questions to enrollment issues such as termination ,etc."
bad,"They choose favorites, and do not go by the rules when dealing with employees. The management is unprofessional, and do not act according to how a manager or supervisor should"
bad,"Not able to move up in this company.  There is always a change in the workflow  You get more demerits than complements."
bad,Management lacks good leadership skills.  Many positions get outsourced lack of job security unlike the prospects when employee first starts the position.
bad,"Large company that does not value their employees. Horrible management. Pay/benefits are good until you experience the job."
bad,Horrible place to work! Management is simple minded and uneducated. People here have no ethics or values. No opportunity or advancement especially if you are person of color.
bad,Extremely low paying organization while I must admit that the training was awesome.  The organization will continuously train you on the various functions so that they can utilize you while paying you practically pennies.
bad,"Horrible.  Non-stop totally focused on your productivity & QA numbers only.  Minimal raise; no incentive to perform at 100% for such a low raise.  Very structured with no flexibility, micromanaged to the nth degree.  Co-workers are overworked so coverage for vacation time is non-existent.  Lots of supervisors and managers, not a lot of staff.  The only benefit to this job is being able to work form home."
bad,You are not valued here at all. People are moved around or out every other day.
bad,It's a call center experience with poor training and outdated systems. Way too many places to have to dig for information for the customer. Nothing smooth about working here...but they have a nice cafeteria.
bad,For the 1 1/2 I worked there they never gave us a raise or the quarterly bonus we were suppose to get. After a while they finally fire the manager and hired a new manager that laid off everyone because she wanted to bring her own people at less pay. Since we work at a right to work state there is nothing we can do.
bad,The Member Service Manager is very self centered. He is concerned only for those he personally know. He does not care about his employees only his money. They work you like a dog and give no promotions or raises.
bad,"After 9 years I realized its not what you know, It’s who you know to advance your career."
bad,"The management isn't always helpful, unless you are one their favorites. If you ask for help, they will look like you have seven heads, and ask why you don't know this and or you should have learned that in training."
bad,"Training is 3 months and still does not teach you the main points you need to know. Management is a joke, a lot of things are done on the buddy system there. They act like they care but they really don't. They don't even care if you fully understand the training, they just see you as another person to answer phone calls to help out their numbers. Team leaders like to micro manage. You have to work in your position for a year before you can transfer. After a while the 16.00 an hour is not worth it. Also the plans to choose from for health insurance could be better."
bad,"High turnover, disrespectful, not a team environment  paper pushing, no resources, micro manage, bad energy, Mgr's lead by intimidating.  DON’T DO IT!"
bad,Poor team morale and poor management communication. Very distant management and self taught type of environment...........................................................
bad,"No room for advancement, no work life balance. if you get sick it comes out of your sick bank and there is no time left to have a real vacation with your family."
bad,"I worked at Aetna for 26 years.  In the beginning it was wonderful -- the company cared about it's employees, who they insured, how they were doing.  It has now become a very vindictive society -- back stabbing and relentless.  You went to work every day not knowing if it was your last -- the stress and pressure they put on their employees is such a health risk.  When my area was being downsized after the VP of the area was let go, I hoped and prayed I would also get the package-- it was a blessing in disguise."
bad,"It started off being a great place to work when it was under Coventry and then became a cut throat and backstabbing atmosphere."
bad,"I worked in a call center and was not shown the respect that I deserved. The Management staff is why to strict. They watch you constantly, waiting for you to make a mistake so they can yell at you for it. Sitting at my desk taking call after call after call, not being able to get up from my desk until it was break time. IF you were one minute late logging in from break or lunch, you would get told about it. The management staff keeps track of your every move. This made me fell very uncomfortable. I am glad that I left the company "
bad,"When I interviewed for the position i  was advised I would be working wit providers. After starting we all ended up in customer service. when we tried to more to other departments, management made sure none of us were moved"
bad,"Worked here for a few months, training is less than adequate in order to do your job, and when you ask questions your answered with attitude or you get inconsistent answers. I can't do my job correctly if I don't have the right answer or the right tools and when you question the inconsistency of their system, they get mad. You're constantly worried about meeting their numbers bc thats all they care abt and when you dont meet your numbers expect a write up , then your soon to be on your way out the door. They dont have the decency to fire you to your face, you get a phone call to let you know not to return. Pharmacist's are lazy and patient care is the least of their worries. Prescriptions are constantly routed to different que's bc no one wants to work on them or they just don't pay attention to the obvious. I seen scripts due weeks ago and we're still trying to contact the Dr for some stupid reason or another that Aetna didn't like, like the qty. This is not real pharmacy work, this place is a joke. It's a revolving door there, your expected to sit down, shut up and work. And God forbid you try to take time off, asking months ahead doesnt help, your denied bc only 10% of the dept can be off and if you call in to take an occurrence you better make it worth it. And now with this merger with CVS, things can only get worse. I worked for CVS for 8 years and left bc they don't care abt their patients or employees, Aetna is headed in the same direction."
bad,"The job is secure, the benefits are okay but this is a place where you come in, do your job and its hard to get any recognition or get advancement. Management promotes transparency but is completely not transparent. No one seems to have the power to get anything done."
bad,The position duties were constantly increased and continually changed. The work life balance was not feasible. The expectations were greater than most case managers could endure.
bad,"i wouldn't recommend Aetna to anyone. they are very reactive, no follow through, no room to grow, unreasonable expectations, understaffed. negative enviroment"
bad,"If you're a parent this could be a bad employment choice. Because the hours are late. Management isn't understanding of that. However, if you're in school they may consider working with you."
bad,"Dislike the management very unfair practices."
bad,"The call center side of the business is horrible. Your direct supervisors are sometimes located in different states. Every second of your time is measured and reported on. Sometimes it would get so busy that the supervisors would tell us to ask permission to use the bathroom, and/or if we needed to get some water or a snack that they would do it for us. ""Business Need"" supersedes all. And I mean ALL. Need off for a doctor appointment? Can' take off on the busiest days of the week (Monday & Tuesday). There is one PTO bank. You don't get separate sick days. There are ""occurrences,"" which are unscheduled, unprotected absences or late/early days. You can have   10 of these per rolling 12-month period, which means they don't reset after one year. This makes it awfully hard to advance from within. It also makes it hard on a working mother/father with kids in school. So take all of this into consideration before accepting a position in their call centers."
bad,coworkers are very hard working group of people trying to assist members to receive the most of the insurance and services available.
bad,"Company offers up empowerment session, high $ motivational speakers then announces layoffs ever 3-9 months. CEO shows videos of himself around the globe and then announces little to no raises."
bad,"micro managed work environment with unclear expectations of desired functions.  Lots of lip service from senior management,"
bad,"I was hired to work 4 ten hour days in the After Hours department, working overnight. I enjoyed it a lot when I started, but then the management changed. I was changed to 5 8 hour days, and the days off I had earned through seniority were taken away and given to someone who was related to a manager's assistant."
bad,"Typical day is steady work of mailroom duties.  Wait for deliveries, log them onto a sheet.  Deliver them.  Process incoming mail.  Stamp outgoing mail.  Document all data and submit daily reports at end of day.  Update procedure documents.  Revise department cost center numbers on the Neopost machine as needed.  Assist with offsite facilities manager if I am asked to check on something.  Direct visitors or vendors to correct location.  I have not met my offsite Xerox manager yet, he is the 4th one I've had but I'm sure he's a nice person.  There really is no hardest part of this job.  It's steady work but not too challenging.  The most enjoyable part of the job is fulfilling the needs of the customers because it helps them out.  I like representing Xerox through Apple One Temp. Agency for Aetna.  I love my Aetna customers.  But I just really wish Xerox would hire me permanently because I wish to grow with a company."
bad,"Worked 7-3:30 our department was the only department not able to flex our time because management didn't want to come in early. "
bad,"I'm a LVN and I worked in the prior authorization department. The LVN is not valued and viewed as incompetent. LVNs are limited to only the prior authorization department and must comply with a daily production. The work environment is fast paced, and can be  stressful, and you must pick up the work workload for other co-workers who don't work as fast. There is favoritism involved, others have been excluded from working on projects because upper management may or may not like the person. Working from home was a plus however you do tend to work more and the daily production metrics are higher. Working from home and home life can become unbalanced depending on the needs of the business. There is no flexibility with scheduling for going continuing of education. There is no part-time and hours are 8am-5pm Monday-Friday and do not deviate. There is lots of micromanaging from the supervisors. Salaries are capped."
bad,"Ok so I was hired by this company only two months ago. First I was so excited to be working for such a big company like Aetna. Boy was I wrong. I was hired as a Claims benefit specialist.  Sounds fancy right. Well its really not. Its completely different from the job discription. They will change your title as soon as they make everything sound so good and put you where they need you more. In my case I was put in the department that everone was dropping  like flies. I have seen 4 people leave in my department alreadt and I will be #6. The manager is horrible. Not professional, no knowldege to anything in health care. My biggest problem was that I was trained for about to weeks in a room full of managers and others that did not do what I did. Then they wanted to throw me on the phones to help pts. Smh. I used to work from home taking calls from 7-4pm at my previous job. Why would I want to take a step back to take calls from 10-7pm. Beware and ask lots of questions during your interview especially about the time u will work. Because they won't tell you until you sign your agreement."
bad,I didn't have experience but I learned a lot. Wouldn't give me a raise so I decided to seek other employment.
bad,"You are asked to do above and beyond what your job description truly is. When you are in a call center environment, this is not a benefit to you. You are expected to do extra projects while doing your regular job and doing extra work gets you nothing in return in terms of advancement opportunities."
bad,Very fast past environment; good training on product; intensed work environment; limited team spirit/morale.
bad,Please stay away if you want to survive.. They micromanage every second of your day. back to back calls...no time to breath..30 minute lunches and they time you to make sure you are back.
bad,I like the company however my supervisor was a micro manager.  The company had a great wellness program offered to the employees and a gym with option to take exercise class which I found amazing.
bad,Work life balance is nonexistent. Very siloed and disorganized processes to get the work done. Extreme disappointment. horrible manager. You can work 70 hours a week and not good enough
bad,Constant back to back calls without proper training. Your work schedule time can be taken from you if you don’t pass all of your calls. Your time on bathroom breaks and hold time on the phone
bad,"For the hours you had to work each week and not able to work at home plus the drive was just too much. The culture was very toxic not one I would want to be in ever again. No advancement, no pay increases, but expected to give up all work life balance, there was only work, no life."
bad,My coworkers were the best humans in the world. Managers were applying for jobs and looking to jump ship whilst telling us that everything was fiiiiine. We felt like the band playing the violins on the titanic as it sank.
bad,"Reviewing commercial appeals for members following state and URAC guidelines. The expectation was to prep five cases per day. The appeals included medications, DME, SNF, and inpatient reviews using MCG guidelines."
bad,"If you are hired on directly, you may not have the same issues, but temp associates are literally thrown to the wolves. To be hired on you have to be able to make miracles happen. Breaks are only 10 minutes, pay scale is average to below average for the position and communication is non existent even amongst teams. As a temp employee you will not be valued and OT is MANDATORY no matter what you may have going on, and they do not mind telling you to bring your kids in during your mandatory OT shift."
bad,There is no need to write a review because everyone's experience is different according to the location and department that you work in. This is a case by case review.
bad,When offered the job myself and others in my training class were told we could work and were offered morning shifts the last few weeks of our training we were told that we were to work a later shift ans if we did not like it too bad tak ot or leave the company.
bad,"They need to focus more on accuracy and less on pushing numbers.Training falls to the individual to teach themselves, the"
bad,Although I did love job and the people I worked with I hated the lack of covered or help with and had a huge deductible you had to cover after 80% was taken out of my paycheck every two weeks just for myself. The lack of communication was well lacked and didn't communicate very well with other employees and hated when was asked any type of questions.
bad,"This was a temp job while I was searching for a permanent position.  It was good but seemed very disorganized as to what I was supposed to be doing for them."
bad,"They promote a healthy work life balance but most of their employees are sipping 40 oz soft drinks at their desks because they are basically tied there for every moment outside of breaks and lunch. Lots of lip service to doing great things but the reality is much different. "
bad,I dont want to write a review other than this company is a joke and I hated working for them and I hated the management I hated the employees and the politics there they discriminate against women and lgbtq
bad,"The company misrepresents itself, they are not family oriented and does not have empathy or a work life balance. There was extended multilayered processes that weren't streamlined. The departments were  siloes and there was not team work."
bad,Company culture was destroyed with the Coventry merger. Aetna is just heartless corporation which pays no regard to the health and welfare of their employees.
bad,The amount of work that you have to do does not reflect the amount of pay that you receive. The management is not so great either and employees definitely don't feel appreciated.
bad,"I was initially very excited to not only work with Aetna, but to be provided a new challenge to continue to grow and develop my career. As time progressed, I've noticed much of the management team refused to take accountability for their team and actions"
bad,the job is not entirely what they promise and management needs to change their views. the company is not efficient and make you do more unnecessary work for little pay
bad,Telephonic case manager position:  
bad,I really dont have much to say i would not recommend anyone to work at Aetna they are not the company they use to be. Supervisor have their favorites and it makes it very uncomfortable when you are not treated as equals
bad,It's been almost 3 years since I worked at Aetna. I have no comments. I did not leave on good terms. I would no recommend this company as a place to work. They care more about the bottom line and the company then their employees.
bad,"Heavy caseload:telephonic and visit members in their home. Cared more about the number of people in case management and productivity than caring for the member.  You had your productivity spreadsheet reviewed with you each month and it is never good enough.  It broke down how many minutes you looked at email, how many minutes you were in non-production platforms, how many minutes you spent IM’ing etc.   All your phone calls recorded so they could audit you. It was ridiculous.  No room for advancement unless you knew someone.  Managers only cared about how you made them look so they were always on you to improve productivity.  So sick of that word!  So many workflow changes they couldn’t even keep them straight. So glad I left!!!"
bad,"Aetna has some great benefits such as stock options and work from home, however, there should be more open mindedness towards change and improved ways of moving forward."
bad,"Worked here for 20 years. Management SUCKS. They don't support their employees. They create a hostile work environment. They lay off their employees in November and rehire them at lower pay. They take back their ""seniority"" status. Managment is remote. No in office support, therefore, the staff does whatever they want and they don't hold anyone accountable until its time for someone's heads to roll."
bad,"Work load is high and not enough people to work. Amount of claims given can be over 100.  Work Life balance is promoted, but is not followed. If you are salary and are behind in your work, you are told to work late during the week and work weekends. Management is not approachable. No formal training was given."
bad,"Low pay, no opportunity for advancement, stressful hours, mocro-managing, manager turn over rate was high--we never kept a manager because they quit, no work/lige balance."
bad,"Assisted other representatives with questions, issues, and or inquiries they may have regarding a member's medical, vision, Flexible spending Account, and dental benefits."
bad,My work days were great I was a self motivator and create a entire work ethnic in the medicare/medicaid dept being able to collect millions in revenue
bad,If you are coming into an entry-level position it's very difficult to advance your career and most likely your salary will be on the low-end of range.  They rely heavily on offshore developers which in many cases are entry level and FTE devs have to rewrite their bad code.  It's a big company so not all areas operate like this but this is what to expect in many the IT departments. Things move slowly and getting newer technology takes years to approve and adopt.
bad,Can be a fun place without the negative chatter and workplace gossip. Rules are constantly changing for call handle time. Very easy to be written up..
bad,Too much reorganization and redistribution of work to different teams in the past year.  There is lack of stability of leadership and lack of ability of the organization to keep good talent.
bad,This job was temporary. They were not looking to hire permanently. It was very hard to work do to the room always freezing. If you had doctor's appointments you would receive occurrences.
bad,Management does not make employees feel worth them being there. Management is always getting the credit for the work being completed.  Employees don't feel like they are appreciated.
bad,"Everything you would expect from a call center but a very nit picking position. Slightly unorganized, I have been with the company for going on three months and still have not had phone training."
bad,Innovative benefit program included reimbursement for engaging in healthy activity. Good 401K. Health care was expensive.
bad,Do not ever work in a call center unless you want to hate your life. The company pays very well but the management isn't very attentive and the job is draining.
bad,The folks their are overworked and it is micro-management at its best. They do not trust you to do the job you are trained to complete. Not any posiitve comments made to employees alot of negative
bad,"training is non-existent, its either sink or swim and the work load can be crushing. the only up-side is the ability to work from home. The biggest problem is the disconnect between the goals set out by executive management and what middle management sets out as its goals."
bad,Review medicare supplement and life insurance applications for approval.Hostal working environment without opportunity for growth. Benefit working from home.
bad,"I was an ananyst under the Aetna umbrella, step-daughter company: Cofinity (formerly known as Ppom). Before Aetna took over -- like some former employees from Coventry said -- ppom had a much more relaxed atmosphere.  With a plan to use Aetna's reputation as the largest healthcare giant, they continued to expand and puchase other insurance firms.  As you know the hub is in CT; and the farther from a hub, the less attention you get from the corporate office.  "
bad,Use to be a productive and great place to work. Due to change in management there is no Job Work/Life Balance. They need to value the employees and not set them up for failure.
bad,Company had deceptive practices toward employees. Undersold an overbearing and unreasonable workload and frequently left employees feeling betrayed by management to customers
bad,Constantly receiving inbounds or making outbound calls. LPN's are not valued as clinically competent.
bad,"Aetna allows for telecommuting, which is nice.  They keep up to date on all of the buzzword/phrases. (Work/Life balance is currently very much in vogue there.) If you are a Beloved, then you will be able to pick your nose in public and be given gratuitous praise.  If you are an ""Invisible"", (a work at home with a disinterested supervisor) then you can expect to be given a ""meets expectation"" on your yearly review even if you have exceeded their benchmarks.  An ""exceeds expectation"" is reserved for Jesus Christ and the Beloveds. The only time people will take any interest in you is if an issue comes up. The issues basically stem from the enormous amount of documentation that you are expected to acquire in order to approve the claim. At Aetna, the ""process"" is more important than processing claims.  So you will either: make numerous attempts to acquire MRI and Cat Scan results (and if the claimant has Aetna Medical, it is a wild goose chase since they will not approve the tests until conservative treatment has failed) or you can demand that your claimant gather submit the clinical.  This is can be difficult if the said claimant is in a coma or in a mental institution. Many folks choose the second method since requesting clinical gets in the way of maintaining a two day turnaround time. And they get to close out a claim, which saves time at the end of the month because you will be ordered to close claims two weeks past their approval date.  If an issue is raised to your supervisor, (I did had one supervisor who successfully evaded calling back clients), then you can beg you Nurse"
bad,"Excellent training program with good benefits and solid trainers. Once you graduate, the gloves come off. The job is extremely stressful due to the overwhelming mix of company and Medicare rules and procedures that must be followed. Nervous breakdowns and heart attacks are common events there. "
bad,My mother always said if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all.
bad,"Poor management that allows slackers to get away with doing nothing all day, yet takes no responsibility for team. Ridiculous insurance coverage with such high deductible it is 15% of your annual salary before they start kicking in for anything."
bad,Would not recommend
bad,"Rating of this company is very poor and they need severe improvement of their management, work/life balance, poor communication between Managment and Employees."
bad,"Nice facility, intensive training program, competitive, harsh environment, negative treatment from managers, overall culture is stressful, back biting, and a difficult place to work if you want a happy life. Good benefits, the pay is low for the work claim adjusters do, and the high amount of stress and criticism."
bad,The benefit of CVS acquiring Aetna remains to be seen  Culturally the two companies are very different  CVS drives hard with deep retail focus  New and old management is very inflexible
bad,Do not recommend a career here. There was a merger with CVS recently and since many employment benefits have decreased. More are coming. Job reorganization is also rumored to be coming.
bad,The new service line is not going to last very long. There is not a solid structure and the leadership for both the advocates and the clinical team are not on the same page and are not developing there teams.
bad,Was mostly data entry. Some outbound calls were required. The hardest part of the job was trying to get proper answers to questions on how to do my job.
bad,I would not do it again. Management has their head in the sand and do not care about the people that do the job! Management would rather you report all tasks being successful even if it is not true.
bad,Leadership does not support you. AETNA cares more about people in the seats able to do “some” work rather than quality work by its employees. You invest your time and hard work into this company and do not get promoted accordingly. Promotions are given based on favorites by the current leadership and not merit based.
bad,You are replaceable no matter how much you dedicate to the better of the company.  I loved Aetna overall however the specialty business of DME plus continues to struggle with ethics
bad,"I wouldn’t go back. You are treated as if you are replaceable. Also they hire a lot of temps for the busy season(Aug-February) and then get rid of them and repeat the process each year. Every week you get a report of what you’re doing wrong even though you don’t receive training for all scenarios. All mistakes go against you whether or not you were trained on it. If you’re okay with having to meet ridiculous metrics then this is the place for you. Also if you don’t like"
bad,"I stay on the phones answering calls for MM's about there Medicare. Some days are good, and some days are bad due to there systems breaking down just about every other week."
bad,"Current director has gotten away with bullying, favoritism, and constant lying on employees. She has been reported numerous  times but is still in her position. Employees feel like they have no one that they can trust and are in constant fear of retaliation if they speak up. However, since an investigation was finally conducted by HR and upper management and nothing was done to the director no one speaks up anymore on her wrong doing. The nurses caseload are double them what they should be. Department can’t keep nurses because of management and workload. Horrible environment due to management."
bad,Corporate environment.  You felt like less than a number.  Little positive feedback and general disregard for employees needs and goals.  Disconnect from corporate goals and actual work.
bad,"The company is very male top heavy. The"
bad,things change daily and no one wanted to be held responsible for the amount of errors made to the customers. Claims not being processed timely. Not enough Training on different accounts
bad,"Training was twelve long weeks. Trainer was young and childish. Was not very respectful of the older generation. Played favoritism constantly. Refused to use a microphone; as voice was very soft and low. No accountability for lack of learning on part of classroom. Playing games seemed most important. Struggled with power amongst the classroom. "
bad,Ridiculous what they expect from you. 5 months training on Material you will never use. A Encyclopedia of information that you must be able to find in 20 programs plus. Not worth the stress
bad,"when they say it is fast paced - it definitely is. If you are young and dont mind sitting down your whole shift then this will be the job for you. I went into this job with a mindset from what I was told in the interview that I would have a chance to do something more than just be on the phones all day...after a year I am finding out it is not the case. Your supervisor is in a different state, you have no idea who is on your team in your location, you never have meetings with your team, I could go on but I will leave it at that."
bad,Rules and criteria changed daily and no one could ever agree on what the correct procedures were.  Favortism was very obvious and not hidden.  Micromanagement made me feel like a child.
bad,"It was an ok please to work, it’s a high turnover rate. I also wasn’t crazy about management. The pay was good tho and there was a lot of over time. The"
bad,"We were to call patients that were discharged from the hospital and to assess if they needed home assistance.  What I disagreed with was the Aetna manager wanted you to call them daily and push home care on them.  I felt the patient had a right to their own decisions, and left my phone number with them if they changed their minds."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of working at Aetna was the people I worked with. The management, hours and pay were horrible. Management picked their favorites."
bad,"Poor management, to much favoritism, hostile work environment. Upon starting to work at Aetna, I had issues with trainers for no reason, I was called to the back numerous for issues that I could not understand. I was belittled, and cursed out on the work floor by another employee. It is very sad that a company so reputable was so awful to work for."
bad,"Management played favortism. They created a hostile work environment, pitting employees against each other. The director of my department was hateful, lied and was unkind."
bad,"I really cannot recommend anyone to pursue long-term employment with this company.  Management is poor, employee morale is low, and they suffer from a high rate of turnover stemming from bad internal management practices and non-competitive wages.  As an analytics professional I was dismayed at the lack of data quality and associated practices, which led to inaccurate/incomplete understanding of the underlying operations and how resources could be allocated to deliver positive results."
bad,"Aetna is a large company with many difference sections and programs.  The Medicaid and Medicare programs are quite different across the country, however many employees share the same complaints about the Aetna design and management process.  The company appears to be content with working less staff and subject matter experts in order to save on their bottom line.  This created poor relations with the state and federal agencies die to lack of attention to detail on state funded programs.   The employees are working twice the amount in order to compensate for lack of personnel.  This causes a high rate of turnover and decreases the internal relationships needed to make most programs successful.  The stress and blame is shifted to the employees by the management because of the environment and the continual turnover.  The company lacks innovation which will be a reason Aetna will have to downsize its' operations in the states."
bad,"I worked for a company that was purchased by Aetna. The culture at the company I originally worked for was wonderful, however after the purchase, the culture of Aetna soon overtook what was once a wonderful place to work. The IT Leadership at Aetna is a very tightly knit group of professionals that have all worked together for 30+ years. They limit growth potential for new candidates and have positioned themselves in such a way that internal growth is stifled very early on."
bad,Upper Management does not have a sense of process improvement. Place friends in leadership positions that they are not ready for. They are not people first which can cause them to lose great employees.
bad,when i first started work environment was great but company restructured and management changed and required unreachable goals. VERY STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT!!!!
bad,This was a contract position. No training for the position. Management never explained what was needed for the position. Not a good environment for growth.
bad,"Job expections have changed since I was first employed. As a nurse case manager who works for a plan sponsor who pays our salary, we are expected to cover for other plan sponsors who are also paying the salaries of the nurses who were hired for them. When a nurse leaves, they don’t replace the nurse and expect the nurses who were hired to work exclusively for their own plan sponsor and  now covering for 1-3 additional plan sponsors. This is wrong in so many ways. Not only is the plan sponsor being ripped off, but it’s very dishonest and the expectations placed on the nurses has made our work/ life balance non existent. The nurses are expected to work as many hours as it takes to meet the unrealistic productivity expectations. The nurses are salaried and work 12 hrs day or longer every day. Now, the case managers are expected to be licensed in all of the states in which they speak to members. For some, this is 50 states. For me, it is 16 states. Aetna management has made it clear that we are NOT to apply, be fingerprinted, complete CE’s and take whatever exam is required on Aetna’s time. We were told that it is now a job requirement and we must complete this on our personal time by June 1, 2018. This is not right and the nurses morale is as low as I have ever seen it. Many nurses are resigning or actively looking for other opportunities."
bad,take calls back to back and there is no allotted time to assist with harder issues for solving member issues unless you work overtime on top of the already mandated overtime of 3hrs a week. I have health insurance but there is no time to go and actually see a doctor for myself or my child unless I take off
bad,I have been with the company 20 plus years and all of the benefits that I started with have been taken away.  if you call in sick you need to take a vacation day then they mark it against you and it takes a year to get off of your record.  This can effect you if you are looking for another position within the company.
bad,This very high profile and historic company has a very dysfunctional culture.  You are expected to be on-line after normal business hours.  The managers I work with were ethically challenged.
bad,"Mergers and layoffs, political climate. Overlap in roles where others protect their own job, failure of management to lead and build teams. They dislike any new hire because they see them as their competition, as a result no leadership or support from management; unethical, not true to their code of conduct, lack integrity."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is managing and cultivating relationships. However, too many times am saddled with seemingly unqualified supervision who impeded efforts and yet seek to claim credit for accomplishments. Very difficult to climb the ladder -- no mentoring or assistance from front-line management (i.e. supervisors)  who, more times than not, are less qualified and/or degreed than subordinates."
bad,"At first I thought getting a job at Aetna was such a big deal but there was a constant pressure to stay seated for hours straight to make your quota. Seating for hours made my health decline rapidly. This sedentary work life affected my home life. I do not recommend the ""Office Space"" work place. I don't believe making Aetna richer and your health/happiness poorer is worth it at all."
bad,It is almost impossible to move up unless you have a college degree or are friends with upper managent. Employees come and go here quickly because most people feel ill used.
bad,This job was very rigid. Your co-workers were just as stressed as you were. You were under a microscope. Management was very unprofessional at times. Would not work here again.
bad,Overall the work experience at Aetna was stressful at times. There was not many advancement opportunities and there was a lot of favoritism. Opportunities for bonuses was nearly impossible.
bad,"Management hands are tied and have to do things even if it does not benefit the company, division or employees as a whole.  Changes are being made to prepare for a merger that may not happen.  Individuals are being let go as they are consolidating departments."
bad,"Stagnant, lacks fashion-forward and progressive approach to attracting new minds, talent, innovation, and creativity."
bad,"Look elsewhere is all I can say. I worked for Coventry (now part of Aetna) for 8 years. Before the Aetna takeover, Coventry was a good company to work for. Since the merge with Aetna, it is terrible.  Pay is average,  the health benefits are terrible (surprising since this is a health insurance company).  As stated I worked for this company (Coventry/Aetna) for  8 years.  Never had more than 3 occurances during any 12 month period, always arrived on time and  gave 100% to my job.  My performance evaluations were always outstanding. Due to the climate, (company plays favorites, lies to their employees,etc) I left the company to work for a different company.  I gave the required 2 weeks notice. I notified my supervisors and manager via email (accepted form) and during my last 2 weeks, my manger (1) never acknowledged the email I sent (2) never said a word to me during my last weeks. This type of unprofessional behavior is condoned by upper management.   I had mixed feelings about leaving , however, this behavior helped me to see that I made the correct decision in leaving this pathetic company.   Do not work for this company. Look elsewhere."
bad,This was a company that placed too many demands on their employees.  Management played favorites and was catty to anyone they did not like
bad,"I generally follow a routine every morning and every afternoon before leaving for the day.  Once I am organized, I am able to handle the unplanned, spur of the moment tasks thrown at me."
bad,Start the day with a work load for two people.  I learned to listen to the employees and their needs to do their job correctly.
bad,"Was a difficult time working there over last year. Change is something that is always consistent at Aetna.  There were things and people that I truly enjoyed but over the last year was probably the worst year of my life.  I was bullied, harassed, embarrassed and asked to do things that I felt were morally wrong.  The sad thing is there is a non existent human resources department and the one we do have does not ever support the employee especially if that person is a team leader or a manager.  I asked for their help and feel they truly failed me.  Aetna used to be a great place to work but they stopped listening to their employees and things went real bad!  BAD!  Bullying and name calling is NOT OK!  Seriously.  I do applaud CEO increasing the minimum wage and changed limit of income for insurance!  I just ask that they start listening to their employees for once!  Why waste all that money year after year after year on the employee survey if you are not willing to listen."
bad,"PTO benefits are good but insurance plans are expensive. One flunky manager after another. Management overall is nothing but crooked. It's like amateur hour there. Very unprofessional and favoritism runs amok. You are responsible for everyone else's mistakes and no matter what you do, it's never enough for them. Most coworkers in my department are looking to get out. Management doesn't care."
bad,The senior management team is not consistent and is not knowledgeable of the Corporate issued policies.
bad,"I took this job with high expectations but have recieved little to no training. Communication with managment is poor and enables an untrusting envirnment. There is little team cooperation or work envirnment. "
bad,"Very stressful work environment,the call volume is extremely high most of the time."
bad,Inbound call center handled customer service inquiries regarding disability claims
bad,"Co-workers in Core Underwriting unit, where I currently work, are dedicated but wonderfully kind people."
bad,"it was a good experience, i liked  the flexibility and i truly loved my supervisor, very eager to help, always understanding and kind , i really liked my time with company"
bad,I can’t really say too much about what I have seen this far except people here are clueless to what their roles snd true responsibilities are. Management doesn’t seem to care very much about moving employees forward in the company  everyone seems to be out for themselves which I find extremely disappointing
bad,This company does not advance from within. Do not apply if you wish for a career. This is a good stop if you plan to stay in a job for a long time and go nowhere.
bad,"Intended purpose of goal and achievement was eliminated after upper management decision on specified government program. There wasn't any purpose afterwards, and didn't feel like to be micromanaged."
bad,I do not recommend working at this company since the merger of CVS there are a lot of changes. There are changes do to merger. There is not overtime allowed.
bad,"too much work for each person, with no sound processes in place, and, no support for completing the processes.  Seriously lacks managed daily routine and sufficiently staffed support.  what support there is, changed continuously and the work was lost."
bad,"Insurance is difficult enough to understand but it sometimes feels like everyone at Aetna has a different way to handle a complicated situation and everyone disagrees with it. If you like a straightforward solution to every problem at work, working at Aetna is not the place for you."
bad,Temp assignment ... enjoyed the job. enjoyed the people.  Ended to soon. Looking for that line of work. Aetna s great company to work for. Alot to offer.
bad,"When I started at Aetna it was a very enjoyable place to work. It has been many years since I worked at this company, so I can not say as to the current culture it has. I left due to downsizing."
bad,I have never been at a job and completely lost as to what to do and how to perform my duties. I had an expectation of such a large company to have great systems and training and  they have the exact opposite. The kitchen there is filthy and sink constantly clogged. It's always bickering and fighting going on amongst co workers. Management is just as lost on procedures as the rest of us. What's going on Aetna.? I'm really disappointed and will leave once I have another job.
bad,There was little to no training while I worked at Aetna. We had no management support within my location so I have to go to other offices around the country to learn about Aetna.
bad,"Don't work at Aetna if you want to ever feel like you're making a positive difference in the world."
bad,"Day to day aspects of the job is CSR, customer service. You are ranked and judged based on performance and punished for doing your job properly. Not a fun place to work."
bad,"For someone who does not want autonomy, who functions as a ""sheeple"" - never having a thought of their own, this is a great place to work. However, if you value individuality this is not the place for you - part of that is just the nature of the beast with the type of business it is, the other...well that's something totally different."
bad,the company is ok to work with you work alot and you are not paid the same so for those who like it then they can work there. always keep going to school s that you can better yourself
bad,"The pay working for the company wasnt great at all, was their 3 years, Advancement was good, but you didnt get paid for moving up, its like you were working for free."
bad,its all bad lousy management too much work for the people to do short staff most of the time ***** supplies and equipment and i dont care about your inappropriate language complaint
bad,"Aetna does not care for the everyday employee, they will not work with ill or pregnant women and they're  3rd party for FMLA, and disability misunderstand the physicians often."
bad,"When I first started working at Aetna, I was very excited about the changes and impact the company was making. Then after the second year or so Aetna started under going through major changes, which allowed new management to come aboard and it wasn't for the better. As a results many good people were job eliminated."
bad,"The company does not have a good management team in place for the campaign I worked under. Its frustrating to do your job if there is no leadership, policies or procedures in place."
bad,the company reorganizes every year and it leads to numerous layoffs.  Also the company does not give much attention to the employee culture.  Poor employee culture often leads to losing good employees
bad,"Aetna was the worst place to work.  The management was very unprofessional.  Management was no help to the employees, more considered with gossiping about fellow employees instead being help to the team.  The only way to make a decent salary was to work everyday and weekend for overtime."
bad,"Working from home no support from management expect you to produce a Great number of patients. Very critical of work. Management expects you to know job yet it changes daily. Preceptor not picks work, no time for lunch or breaks. Expect you to work overtime and not get compensation. Manager had nothing good to say about my work yet I have always got above average reviews at other jobs!!"
bad,"There is a lot of favortism and other *""isms"" at this company. They work you extremely hard and dont pay well. I wouldnt reccommed working for this compamy if you dont want to be stressed beyond capacity."
bad,"Very stressful- unprofessional supervisor"
bad,"I was in search of a work life balance after being in retail management for several years. The job description appeared to be perfect. I knew that I was stepping down from my management career for balance and was really looking for that 9-5 where I could come in, do a great job at work and then leave it behind for the evening and enjoy my family. A new model was being created and I was excited to be in on the ground floor. What I got in return was A ""trainer"" that was not a trainer, just a veteran employee that had no business being responsible for the growth of this new model. Not only was she not patient with most of the classes learning but most of the time condescending. I was one of the lucky ones that she seemed to like, but while observing her behavior, I took note of how upper management really liked this person. In weeks to come the ""perfect"" job description kept changing. Job descriptions were ever changing. work hours were changing. Expectations were becoming more and more unrealistic. By the 20th week we had what was called ""cultural training"" That is when I felt the most insulted. In colorful language meant to mask the true agenda is when I realized how little this company really cared about it's employees. While meaning to come across as a company that cared for the well being of it's staff, it proved the opposite. They went on to talk about how only a certain % of the company earned wages under a certain amount. I realized that even with this new model that was being promoted as the elite in customer service, a one stop shop if you will with a new job description"
bad,"The only thing great is the pay 16/hr. The insurance are all high deductible plans so if you are allowed to go to your doctors appt then you wil have a huge bill. The only breaks you have are schedule which changes so you might want to use the restroom, otherwise you only get 2 mins. You have to come to work sick, if you call in you receive what is called an occurrence. They have lost a lot of great workers because of their bullying"
bad,Working  at Aetna is very stressful. Employees are required to assist in many different areas and are truly underpaid for all that they are required to do. The call volume is excessive and the resources are difficult to use because answers can require a lot of research which leads to members being upset and irate.
bad,"Several of the managers were not supportive or respectful. I worked in th underwriting department. During Open Enrollment, there was ""NO"" Life/Work balance."
bad,This was not a very good position I wish I could say better things about this place the jobs training was not up to pace people never knew what they were doing and they tried to force people to join which should be a choice customer should decide not be forced into an Insurance they don't want.
bad,"Workplace culture is not collaborative but more of a you do your work and stay out of my business type of environment.  No sharing of best practices or historical information / data, lack of communication and no transparency."
bad,"Job required cases to be completed by compliance deadlines.  Too many cases to manage correctly. Cases are been rushed to be entered timely, with no time tor follow-up.  Too stressful because we were overworked, no time to balance your home and work life."
bad,"I was only a temporary here working on a special project, but that company has closed.   I helped training other temporaries, set up spreadsheets and helped manager with special projects."
bad,Management was very poor and incompetent. Salary was lower than any where in the industry. Save yourself the trouble and work for a company that appreciates you.
bad,"Not willing to listen - Cutting cost by loosing down stream affects to customers. Taking away work at home was a disadvantage."
bad,"The Pay is decent, but the training and work environment is not.  The training I recieved was minimal, and the support that you recieve from your supervisors is terrible."
bad,I worked in the Aetna tax department as a temporary assignment. The work was interesting but the stress level in the department was very high for the permanent staff. This was due the reduction in the tax department staff from approximately 60 to 40 personnel.
bad,"Listened to calls either recorded live or side-by-side while communicating feedback"
bad,"position was fast paced and high stress with the modification of task on a daily, however this position was a challenge that kept each employee on their toes. We worked as a team and the support of our peers made all the difference of our extreme talent and success."
bad,I processed claims for the insurance company. Work well with others and great team work. Had to move on for being offered a better job. Overall great place to work.
bad,"Quiet environment, nice place to work, professional. Practice good work ethics, coaching sesaions implemented and addressed. Support core is good, caters all questions and answered in timely manner"
bad,"Aetna environment as a whole is manageable. Avoid working in a certain department in which there has been several changes as a result of employees speaking out. Hopefully, it will get back on track. Bonuses are given but not equivalent to the actual work put out."
bad,Good place to work and great benefits.  Helped me with my health and weight loss motivation - they have great supervision team and great traning for customer service reps
bad,"Was rude and to controlling"
bad,A typical work day is more than 8hrs. Management are not receptive to new ideas. The job is stressful with lots of deadlines to meet. I love most of my co workers
bad,At the time I was employed the company was going through organizational re-structuring and was very chaotic and was not suited well for me. I eventually returned back to my previous employer.
bad,"Decent place to work, if you are in need of work. Various responsibilities related to the job that you are required to fulfill on a daily basis"
bad,It was a wonderful company to work for until the Aetna merger then the department was made to feel like a prison such as being told when we would use the bathroom or if we spelled something wrong we would get written up and not given adequate time to correct our errors.  I love working as a pharmacy technician and enjoyed what I did when I worked for a supervisor who was willing to help me reach my potential and not scold me like a child.
bad,Good work culture in the Portland office but very poor compensation and benefits. I would not like to work there again. The company expectations do not match the compensation. Experienced several issues with my benefits. Employees can't afford the health insurance the same company provides.
bad,"Never felt comfortable at my job, always stressed, not alot of recognition from upper managment when a job was done well. Never felt like a person only a number."
bad,"No growth. Leadership didn't lead. Fairness. Maybe its the department, I been working there for 10 years, the growth is just lasting due to freezes, but it's always just the call center. I'm looking for a personal change. No growth"
bad,The company has a culture of finger pointing from the top down. It was a good learning experience but not good place to have a career.
bad,It is mandatory to answer a specific number of phone calls per day. You were written up if you did not make you numbers. Some people on the other end were nasty callers.
bad,"Not much opportunity for job advancement or career development"
bad,"Watching your back to make sure that Portfolio Manager is up to speed and not clueless, as usual. Mine barely remembers meeting or if PM does - at least 10-15 minutes late. The Boss, the department VP, needs to put PM in charge of one section. The PM needs to focus on the PM's first love - Medicaid and let the other section get a new PM."
bad,"great place to work, flexible, weekends not required to worrk, no room for growth,work balance, very routine work , always learning something new everyday, would recommend other to work for Aetna but not much room for growth at all"
bad,Ok place to work.  Its great if you want to learn about specialty pharmacy.
bad,"Never felt respected or valued as an employee."
bad,"Working for Active Health Management, a subsidiary of Aetna healthcare, was the worst employer I've ever worked for.  Aetna was far removed from management, the orientation process and the way management responded to their employee's."
bad,"Baby sitting a legacy platform that was in desperate need of an overhaul.  Micro-managed by my Team lead on her day off, while my colleague was sleeping at his desk."
bad,"I am able to set my own schedule within specific parameters."
bad,"If you need a first time job, then ACS is a great place for you. If you lost your job and don't care what you do then work here as a stepping stone for better employment"
bad,"I worked for Aetna for six years. The compensation was decent but the benefits lacked in substance. The health insurance was more of a discount than a plan. Management has expectations set too high, almost on purpose to be able to have job security in coaching you. "
bad,"Friendly co-workers, Repeative calls & regular proformance reviews."
bad,There are too many levels of management. The company has little concern for you. There is little professional development offered to those on the lower rungs of the ladder even though there could be advanced degrees.
bad,"Any room for advancement was decided by who you knew not by what you knew! If you were customer oriented and did your job, on time, and didn't sick out alot you were not hassled."
bad,"nice place to work, management team great, remote work, great co-workers, helping member stay healthy"
bad,"This was a secure position, however, layoffs occur out of the blue.  Always have a back up plan.  This is for every job.  Otherwise, this company provided me with eight great years of experience on managing a home office. Work life balance was not the best, worked long hours nightly."
bad,"they have policies in place that can potentially get you fired even though you follow company guidelines. You have to meet metrics which are fine however certain metrics are not based on "" if you did your job correct"" its whether the person you spoke to liked you or not."
bad,"You are overworked for he little pay that offer. You are not rewarded for your skills and experience.  In addition to that the hours change every other month, no good work life balance! Good people and help is always available."
bad,"Turnover is very high and company needs a better vision for the long term. Goals are set without a full understanding of the work involved or data collected."
bad,Very heavy case load with minimal pay.  Too many expectations but not enough hours in the day to get the work done.  Surveys are taken by staff but nothing every gets done.
bad,It take an adjustment for being on the phones all day taking calls all day.  Their training is really good and get you prepared for taking the phone calls.  They will also have people set up with you for the questions you may come accross.
bad,"If you want to work for a big company where you want to feel invisible to Management and be like a worker ant in a big ant colony, this is the company to work for. There is very poor recognition of individual contributions and in the end, if Management wants to make cuts in the workforce, there is no recognition of your individual contributions no matter how hard you work."
bad,The seasoned employees are over worked and unenthused to assist new hires.  Management does little work throughout the day which is how the find plenty of time to micromanage. The cafe has gotten a few employees sick with the lack of hygenic practices. The systems are outdated and a lot of the time it is the reason for errors. This company may have had a great run in the past but it seems to be going downhill.
bad,Poorly run company.  Right hand has no idea what left hand is doing.  Hampster on a wheel environment:( Very nice coworkers and work from home we’re the ONLY 2 positives with Aetna.
bad,Don't work here if you have a heart. The stuff that is not right that you see being done to patients. You will cry everyday if you have a heart. You get talked to like you are dirt
bad,"Hardest work for lowest pay, training was horrible! The office culture is extremely cliquey in nature, and management plays favorites in such a way that it could take years to advance, while other less competent people get big bonuses and move up quickly."
bad,I was a consultant here for 3 years and was allowed to bill only 40 hours a week for 65-70 hours work week. Was told privately if I exceeded hours worked would be terminated. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"Medical directors are terrible. Nurses are more knowledgable of processes, guideline criteria, CMS/OAC/NCQA requirements, and compliance. Upper management sides with medical directors at all times."
bad,"First off, the customer service is awful. The members call in and get bounced around then cuss you out because no one wants to help them or knows what they are doing. Aetna is a billion dollar company with billions in revenue, therefore upgrade your system.... why are they using 5 year old Internet that takes minutes to load one web page... !?!?!??????????? Also, we get docked points for not going on our breaks and lunch’s at the EXACT time... what am I suppose to do, say “Sorry, Ma’am, I have to go on break/lunch now so I can’t assist you or I could  lose my job.” They promise you all these bonus’ and promotions, yet when you ask about it, they say that it only goes to the seniority reps. Now they are talking about freezing our pay with CVS... no, not a good company or environment. They force you to work overtime and if you don’t they hold that against you and say, well we will not promote you because you won’t work overtime. Sorry but for people who have multiple jobs trying to make a living, I can’t give you 2 extra hours a day plus 8-10 hours on saturdays.... The ONLY thing I love is the people, they are really nice. The work environment with your coworkers is basically like a family."
bad,In my two decades with the company; after a certain time frame it would appear the company looks for reasons to let go of tenure. In addition the cost of health care was extremely high for employees.
bad,"I have been at Aetna for a little over a year. Typical day, you pick up the headset and log in to your phone. Calls come in automatically so be sure to stay ready for a call at any moment. "
bad,"A typical day is started with assisting members on the phone but more than not basic systems do not work.  I have however learned a little more patience in the everyday work and member interaction. Management at times display and demands actions that are not in the contract.  I have been trained in all of the areas of insurance and have not once been compensated for my knowledge and skill.  We were told that there is no money and if we did not like it than we should find another job. The building is filthy and has not been cleaned since n the 4 years I have been there."
bad,"Stressful, no sick days, poor management, High turn over rates. They paid nice but sometimes the money isn't worth the stress. I'd recommend them only for another position but def not for the Call center . They care nothing about you as a person only the amount of calls you take."
bad,"- tons of work load."
bad,I have heard that a lot has changed since I left. hopefully for the better. Aetna isn't a terrible company to work for but the environment was very poor.
bad,"poor communication between departments.  no continuity.   Difficult to get answers, on problems and issues.   Calls are typically transferred repeatedly, which makes for extreme stress.  no solutions to problems without a lot of drama"
bad,"There are too many cases of favoritism and cliques in the company. Advancement is not based on merit but ""who you know"" and even though the company is huge it is a very small world. Because of the favoritism, unqualified managers are in place with hurts employees. Every few years they clean house with a layoff which includes forced early retirement."
bad,"The mission of the company is empowering and motivates employees to come to work, but advancement opportunities aren't always present and open to everyone. Often work more than 40-45 hours per week and pay increases are incremental and often not reflective of the work being put in."
bad,"No growth, mindless tasks, no opportunity for growth, paid below market. "
bad,"Extremely stressful high demand and unrealistic deadlines"
bad,A lot of back biting and no f/u on issues in the workplace.  There is no universal quality assurance guidelines for the Coventry department.
bad,"Big company with a lot of benefits but a lot of waste on programs used by only a few.  Work life balance in my area was mostly work and the managers had unhealthy lifestyles so oblivious of others who wanted to be healthy and reduce stress."
bad,The work load was manageable if you new the work.  To get training was hard.  Some of the management were tuff to work with.  Some treated you like you were nothing and others were great.
bad,"The Aetna Medicaid programs are new and there is a great deal of transition and instability. Unfortunately, this has lead to high employee turnover."
bad,Aetna Rx Home Delivery has a fog of depression around it and most of the employees there are on antidepressants.  There were some very kind employees while I was there. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for some of the management there.
bad,"A typical work day includes visiting Providers offices, responding to email and voice mail inquiries."
bad,Minorities beware there's a target on your back. Mundane work with mundane people.
bad,My previous department was aligned under a different VP every year of my 4 years there.
bad,Very busy from the start of the day to the end of the day..
bad,"Toxic work environment. You literally never knew when you were going to be able to leave to go home (telephonic insurance CM not a patient care environment). Management picked on a different person every week,upper management and HR were aware and did nothing. Pay was great, but if your broke down the hours worked, probably less than average RN salary. They are always hiring, and that is because they have such a high turnover rate. This is not the Aetna people worked for and retired from years ago, which is very sad. I left and am not a disgruntled employee who was fired, of which there are many."
bad,Traffic is horrible to and from. Nice clean secure building. Poor management and average training. Elevator is super slow but stairs are available. Clean restrooms.
bad,"Aetna has the lowest paying claims position in AZ, which is why the turnover rate is so high. I’d say use as a stepping stone especially if you’re just getting in to the claims industry. No experienced processor will work for this low wage. Also if you don’t already know how to process, don’t even bother the training is horrible as well."
bad,The first few years were great then everything changed with very lengthy documentation requirements. Also implemented a minimum patient load with these new documentations leading to many hours of overtime often extending into weekend hours.
bad,"Not a place in which there is room to move around. Too much favoritism, training was horrible, each claim is different so if you have a question your supervisor aren't the ones to ask they don't know."
bad,"I feel helpless at work most of the days. Too many unanswered questions, careless managers and mentors. I also feel bad for the customer when the management system is in our way of helping our customer. If you want good performance, you can’t really help the customers in the way they need. Very discouraging performance measurement structure. You also can’t use restroom when you need to go, it hurts your performance. Unexpected sick day will force you to cancel your scheduled vacation due to accruals. Office culture is poor. Management and policies are closed doors and are not transparent to employees. The only good thing I can think of is the 4 months of onboard training."
bad,"n/a•Analyzes and approves routine claims that cannot be auto adjudicated."
bad,"If you have a child or children with any medical illness or if you get sick expect to receive a occurrence for it, with or without medical note. Micro management, no sense of empathy or compassion."
bad,Archaic computer systems and impossible workload. Too many meetings. Too many emails. And now nurses are on productivity. You're still responsible for your weekly productivity even when you're out sick. No lateral moves. Too much competition for other job opportunities. Would advise RNs to stay away.
bad,No advancement opportunities for certain positions. Doing the job fast not correct is strongly encouraged. Metrics are everything members are not. Poor communication from the top on down. Business and medical do not mix well. If you are looking for a job where you can make a difference and are a nurse Look in to help people do not apply.
bad,If you choose to work there u better get in good with the supervisors otherwise you will be stuck in your entry level position. Get ready to be yelled at call after call after call for 8 hrs + a day
bad,"I was there 3 years and we went thru 2 CEO's 3 supervisors, 3 Managers and 2 Directors...  The only positive thing about Aetna was there were a few nice people that actually cared about you as a person."
bad,"Management tends to show a lot of favortism, does not work well with work/life balance, as a company they tend to screw memfbers on receiving benefits.  Phone calls reviewed must score at least a 97.6% which is impossible on their scale no ever receives a bonus."
bad,"while employed here, i constantly found myself stressing out about this job. the training seems good because its long and thorough, however when you get on the floor you realize they only teach you about 40% of the things you do on a daily basis. when you need help you need to use a group IM which takes way too long and makes your customers even more upset. I would never work here again even if they paid 25 an hour."
bad,Very stressful work environment. The hardest part of the job was trying to get someone to assist with the new intranet upgrade and setting up the department sites. Manager not wanting to be involved.
bad,"Aetna needs to focus more employee benefits, recognition and overall morale. It has been caught in the old bureaucratic ways of running a company and will be out of touch with the newer generation."
bad,"Typical day is very stressful. Middle management is disorganized which makes it hard to perform your job properly.  New program roll outs are not well planned.  Benefits are very good."
bad,"Aetna was chronically understaffed. The clinical staff was expected to complete daily assignments that were completely unreasonable and when questioned, management just reiterated the expectation to complete the assignment by the end of the day."
bad,"Great, friendly team members with knowledge sharing for very complex data warehouse system. Very little managerial push back on  ever increasing business requests/work orders and unrealistic due dates."
bad,"Great pay, benefits are okay.  No life/work balance.  Going home to work takes a lot of time to happen.  Late evenings working if you are not careful."
bad,"my career was liberating , I have found that I committed 16.5 years of my life and still was virtually at the end I was only a number .  It felt great to give my all but doesn't feel great to be shoved away!"
bad,"Management is terrible at the Southfield,MI location. In adequate training. No room for growth or career advancement. Everyone typically does their own thing. Very unfriendly and unhelpful. A lot of favoritism is shown at this location. The pay is great, but it's a stressful job at times."
bad,"Good company to work for as far as pay, horrible management in the New Albany office. They're currently outsourcing all of the work to other countries. They promise employee's there will be no job lay off's then months later laying off numerous employee's in each area including management."
bad,"Nice Place to work , close to home and transportation is near . Learning a lot of Dental duties first time in Dental dept.  A lot of co-workers"
bad,"Insurance professional with over 15 years of experience in the healthcare industry & medical"
bad,Medical insurance high deductible. Not enough help. Case load high and have to cover others who work slow . No breaks no life work balance a 5 day work is suppose to be 40 hrs a week but ends up being 50 with no extra pay. Terrible on your Cody sitting all those hours with no breaks. Blue collar slavery
bad,"Management Is poor, hire friends instead of professional people. Management are very unprofessional with staff. No diversity, they treat you different if you not from their same color,"
bad,"If your looking for a deadend job, then apply for Aetna leave and disability in Platation, FL. To get ahead, ou must be a brown noser. Its not what you know, its who you know."
bad,"Great place to work and good benefits, the hardest part of the job was working on production. I learned dental insurance very well. My co-workers were not very helpful. A typical day was working very hard to make production. Management was not very helpful as well."
bad,Aetna was a shifted company. The work load varied from day to day. It was an easy job to learn. The company provided lunch throughout the rough and busy weeks.
bad,maintain a disciplined schedule to meet high call volume and meet or exceed sales goals. Insure conversations were professional in nature while always steering customer to close the sale in a monitored time frame.
bad,"The company culture does not support its values.  However, the company improve on this issue."
bad,It was very challenging to work in the fast pace environment. I enjoyed learning about the whole process of analyzing criteria for coverage. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with authorization request in a timely manner. I did not enjoy the politics!
bad,It's a decent place to work all depending on the department you work for. Stay away from members services or broker services or any care coordinator positions.
bad,Its all about production. Morale is very low in the office. Trainings are rushed with no structure. Expectations are high very soon into position.  Cafeteria sucks
bad,"The personnel in middle leadership at Aetna was superficial and petty.   It was like you were working for individuals in middle management that treated you like children,  yelling and talking down to the staff."
bad,"I personally have had a bad experience working for Aetna, but I have seen others move right on up the ladder. It's definitely a secure job and everyone's experience is different. It truly depends on the area you get hired for and the Supervisors/Managers you report too on how your life will be working here. The door into Aetna is most likely going to be by way of being a call rep. If you don't want to work in a call center, then i would say not to apply."
bad,Management was ineffective. Their leadership skills were poor. The directions that were given to employees changed daily. This lead to confusion and little progress towards any goal. As a result of this management believed that the people they supervised were not doing any work. I can not put all the blame on the immediate supervisors. The managers above them were the people making most of the decisions. I think as the new management is orientated to their own positions the culture will improve. But as of now I would not recommend working at Aetna. Although they have great benefits.
bad,Flexible schedule made getting to work great. Training class was long but not effective on the floor. The hardest part of working there was not having the tools to do my job to the best of my potential.
bad,The workplace culture  became very impersonal and managers became like robots. The management seemed to be in fear of  the upper management that they became unhuman and appeared very cold. Became an unpleasant place to work.
bad,What me and my girlfriend who works their also! Had aa problem with other employees not doing there job while the supervisor knew about it many times but did nothing about putting all the work on the working employees! We expressed this alot to many people but nothing ever happened!
bad,i rather not say anything bad about any company. just see it for yourself. it is a very stressful call center Insurance benefit are great and paid holidays.
bad,"I enjoyed my job but things changed on a daily basis, Supervisors were helpful, the supervisors tried to make things fun we had lot of things going on all the time. Job was stressful because you were on the phone all day, and calls were always back to back. I learned to just take one call at a time. It would have been nice to always have a tech available to ask questions to but that was not always the case"
bad,"Stressful work environment and little pay, they micro managed you, the work load is strenuous and you are forever working around the clock. Its the worst company to every work for"
bad,"Management stays together despite whatever the case, you are and will be judged unfairly.  Need to hire workers instead of trying to force you into the role and if you do not accept additional role yo will be placed on performance improvement plans and your performance evaluations by your supervisor will be rated below 3  making it difficult for you to continue your career with them."
bad,"Aetna is a very customer centric. This is opposed to Employee centric.  They come first  Not you.  "
bad,"The health concierge program was a tedious and stressful job. The position was under staffed, under paid, and downright made me miserable. Between the nonstop calls and the lack of time off of the phones to actually do research for clients it was hard to do the job successfully. Also, the pilot changed often which added another stressor. The environment is nice, however the job sucked, for me at least."
bad,"Answer customer questions regarding to the Aetna medical coverage , Also getting graded on every phone call regardless how to control customer frustration."
bad,I was able to work from home and enjoyed a positive work-life balance. The management at Aetna was very flexible. I enjoyed managing a small team in their Learning and Development area.
bad,Enjoyed the people I worked with. Felt I did not have enough guidance in position. Loved working from home. Did not enjoy commute to office. Good benefits.
bad,"Good pay and benefits."
bad,Aetna was a fairly decent company to work for but after almost 11 years of dedicated service my position was eliminated without any notice. Aetna has left me heartbroken.
bad,Management and leadership need to listen to the people doing the work.  Very disorganized.  Too many leaders and not enough followers.  Great work at home positions.
bad,"Some people that I worked with at the same level as me, worked 65 plus hours weekly just to try to keep up with job duties. This is across the company, not just in any one location.  Aetna always states about the culture- and Jobwork/Life Balance-- as long as your life is Aetna, you can do this."
bad,"The pay is decent - about the same there as any other company in the same line of work. They offer paid time off. However, they have employees answering calls for several different departments , yet the direct supervisor I had, was only trained for behavioral health so if I had someone requesting a medical supervisor, I got the run a round from all of them. I personally, more than once, was asked to send an email to one of the supervisors or transfer the caller to their voicemail. I was also reprimanded for taking myself off of the phone to send these emails - why? I should not have to make the other person waste their time while I do that. At one point I was also trained to review benefits with the member, although that was no longer my job description, I would get reprimanded for telling them their benefits & coverage details rather than transferring them again. One the Aetna goals was ""one call resolution"" How did reprimanding me for giving a member their benefit details support that goal? If I did not know the benefits in question, yes, I would transfer to the correct department or provide them the correct phone number. I also had an incident with a supervisor, while my direct supervisor was out of the office - both the supervisor as well as myself said things we should not have but only myself got reprimanded - the supervisor did not. Everyone is concerned about bullying in schools with children - what about bullying in the work place by our higher ups? Do they think thay have that much power over us just because of their title? The one that was my direct supervisor needs"
bad,"I thought I was going to work for Aetna for the rest of my life.  What a mistake.  Not sure why they let me go - twice.  Even at present, I hear most employees do not know when they are going to get the pink slip."
bad,"misrepresented. when i interviewed i was misled by the hours.  i interviewed for an 8-4:30 position. they however try to trick you by asking if you can work any evenings. so that later on when they tell you your shift may change monthly and you say you cant work that shift for an entire month they say but you said you could. yes meaning once in a while but not for a perm shift. thats why i went for the 8-4:30. it doesnt work well for someone with kids and busy sports schedules or for a single mom wit no childcare help, especially because you cannot log off until the time your scheduled for. so if a minute before you log out a call comes in and turns into an hour call, you're stuck. i know women who left because they couldnt get to their daycare in time to pick up their kids. they also dont tell you that you have to meet stats in order to get the schedule you want."
bad,"Great food exercise room nice place, miserable people and management and super micro and macro management choose your battles carefully high turnover."
bad,"Benefits aren’t great. Pay isn’t good enough. No advancement opportunities. Management is great with feedback, help and training is very accessible. Would only recommend as a second job due to pay and lack of advancement opportunity."
bad,"Too many meetings leaving little time for getting the work done.Leaders are not given the chance to lead their teams and instead are doing the tasks.This leads to multi-tasking on calls which is not a productive use of staff. Aetna does offer ESAT programs, lots of Employee Groups for special interests and in the home office (Hartford, CT) lots of benefits including on-site physicians with low copay for services, full service pharmacy, gym, squash courts, dry cleaning services and a company store."
bad,The company has all the perks of large corporations and the leader with great vision but my location was far removed from the big picture. I worked with government contracts and they are a different animal. The work hours are long and the expectations where unrealistic too many barriers in the social realm to remove on behalf of healthcare for one company.
bad,"The company offers decent insurance benefits but other regular companies offer better. They offer great additional benefits (college reimbusement, $200 yearly wellness benefit as well as earning for healthy decisions, mindful training, etc.). The main issue is the majority of management will not listen to the people doing the work. Even if you can back what you are stating or suggesting, it falls on deaf ears. The company had it's issue prior to the acquistion on Coventry. Since buying Coventry, they allowed several of their managers to take over for Aetna management and things have taken a severe downward spiral. They act like a high school click. They want everything ran the way they did it but that doesn't work in all aspects of the work we are doing. Our department used to run like a well oiled machine. We now are the Titantic and going down fast."
bad,"I would perform prior authorization requests for DME equipment, surgeries, wheelchairs, home health care services, therapy requests, medications, etc. You had criteria to match with clinical and information the provider sent in. You worked closely with a medical director and other nurses."
bad,The company is not a place i would ever refer anyone for employment. There is no autonomy in the job i do anymore and we are  horribly micromanaged. I was so happy in my job until Aetna bought us..
bad,"Inefficient, to much overhead, more concern with appearance than reality.  Forces processes and procedures on work that doesn't apply making it frustrating and irritating."
bad,It was a good place to work. Very busy phones. Asked for lots of ot. Supervisors work with you. Hard to post out to different positions. Rotating shifts till 6:00pm.
bad,Location is great!  But that is about all.  I liked that they tried but the dept I worked was not that great.  The management was not good at all.  Don't look for any flexibility.
bad,"Difficult as a clinician b/c of the expectations associated with being in a call center.  Call after call with little understanding of the need to take a mental break.  Sometimes can't even go to the bathroom.  Culture is very corporate and questions/opinions are not welcome. Turnover is high, for good reason.  Pay is good, as are benefits but not enough after awhile."
bad,There is very little corporate stability. Two of my directors quit within 3 months of employment. A remote company where everything happens in Hartford.
bad,No one knows what the other person or team is doing. Pay was great but pay isn't what its all about. You have to love your job to be happy in it . I hated this job I felt like I was never given feedback except when something bad happened . We are suppose to get 1on1 every month. As of January 2016 I went 8 months without a 1on1 with my sup . Now with in that time of me being hired we had 3 supervisors when I left we were down to 1 and the manager over those 3 sups left the company abut 3 months after I was hired.
bad,"A typical day at work was coming in, sitting at your desk and taking incoming phone calls. The training program at the time was lacking therefore we didn't learn a lot. We were told to read a lot of material but not to worry about remembering any of it because A. we probably would never use it or B. you won't remember it until you get out on the floor taking calls. We had a help line that we could call, for the new people, but if the phones were busy she had to be on the phones so we had no place to really go except a supervisor and we may have to wait for 6-7 minutes and that is just not acceptable to me as a customer service agent. The people I worked with were wonderful. The hardest part was not being able to help the customer like they deserved to be helped. The best part was when I could help an upset or angry customer."
bad,"I enjoy my job of the challenge to resolve issues and find a solution  to  a business process challenge. "
bad,I disliked that my supervisor was in California.  There was no onsite help and the communication through email and text did not help at all. Everything was prolonged but you are on a metrics system
bad,"handled over 40 calls per day"
bad,To advance in the company is based on who you know not your job experience. I worked from home and lost all face to face contacts which limited my chances to advance.
bad,Training provided; however this particular department was not flexible in allowing remote training when the trainer and other trainees were working remotely.
bad,Aetna health care company has changed over the years. There is new leadership as well as a higher pay than the last 3 years. The company also offers benefits and perks not normally offered by your typical fortune 500 company
bad,"Great company but the program they are using for the Aetna Community Cares is not a good program, Slow, outdated and with a caseload of 150 plus members to monitor and chart on is not manageable.  Audit your charts, monitor your calls, always feel like your in a prison form of punishment daily.   If they would listen to the employees/ the RN’s that are doing this daily iit would be a great place to work, turnover of staff is high. Upper Management micromanages staff.  Think twice about taking a position with Aetna/CVS Health. Pay is great, bonuses are great but stressful and not rewarding and be ready to be a telemarketer. Care of members is secondary to telemarketing."
bad,"Productivity is number one, more, more, more, faster, faster, faster. Impossible metrics. Documentation system nightmare: complicated, duplicate requirement and sometimes triplicate. Unnecessarily complicated and stressful. Unrealistic expectation, unsympathetic and nonemphatic leaders who have the yes can do motto coming out of their ears so they cannot hear the cries of staff and they are immune to complaints. No Mercy!!!"
bad,"Great place to work for benefits. Advancement & new opportunities depend on management. When first hired I had a fantastic manager. When I took upon a new role, I ended up with a poor manager. I basically got told I was not learning my job & that no futher training would be provided. I was devastated when I was faced to leave the company due to lack of supoort from my direct supervisor or the director."
bad,Aetna is a good company to work for.  Uses the most up to date development practices and provides reasonable support for their employees.  I have nothing bad to say.
bad,"I worked at this company 13 yrs ago, im sure they improved since than so I don't want to say anything negatively towards a company I no longer work for."
bad,Aetna is a large corporation bound by that definition at this point in time. They have their strengths and weaknesses like any large corporation and I have worked there for 8 years.
bad,"The biggest downfall to this company is the management. They just don't know what they are doing. Everything else about Aetna is awesome. I would recommend asking more information about what your management team ACTUALLY knows. Most of the management group is full of Nurses who are great at nursing, but can't manage a team of people to save their life. Benefits are good, pay is low, unless you are a nurse. Nursing degree is required for some positions but nursing knowledge is not used, and not needed for any position in the office. Management teams are not consistent in standards and do not hold to the standards themselves. My office is a complete mess, though other offices in my state are excellent. The company atmosphere is one that really cares with a great education system in place to teach employees their general job responsibilities. Management teams mess that up by changing everything you learned and constantly arguing with employees and questioning integrity. Should be a teleworker job, however, management can change your location as they like based on numbers they make up but change per person. No set standards of productivity that make sense. 140% case load is standard, way above the state allowed average. Travel is reimbursed but you will travel 3 to 5 days a week processing more visits and assessments than any other district or MCO in our state. There are no clear guidelines in our office for what the actual model of work flow is. People do different things and work is typically incomplete. Case loads are changed monthly and switched to award everyone not working"
bad,"While working at Aetna I feel as though I was not paid fairly for the job responsibilities that I took on.  I was hired for one particular position, but once hired I was required to train and work in several different departments."
bad,Worked mandatory overtime for 3 years straight always putting out fires and never addressing the root cause to correct the underlying problems. Not interested in feedback from employees.
bad,"Company is a decent place to work; they are trying to improve their image among members by introducing a new brand and tag line.  Depending on  job function, work can be cumbersome but manageable.  "
bad,"This was AetnaFinancial which became ING when it was purchased. . so this entity no longer exists. "
bad,"Pros: Good pay for a customer service position. Desirable working hours: Mon-Fri, option to work 8 hour shift anywhere in between 8am and 6pm. They do provide you with a lot of paid time off. "
bad,Been here 3 years and my department management is horrible. If your not a favorite of the managers forget about raises and help all together.  Cases are piled on you and then when you fail qa it is all your fault. Complaining to HR is useless.  Mangamemt will throw ypu under the bus to save themselves.  Health benefits are a joke. High deductible and premiums. Only perk is they offer work from home
bad,"A typical day I was responsible for the cleanliness, and functionality of three different rest rooms that were used at a manufacturing company.  I worked on my own timeline to ensure that all these restrooms was ready for each section of the companies break times."
bad,"Aetna is not the company it was when I began working there in 1972. At one time you would proudly say you worked for Aetna; however, that is no longer the case.The last few years at this company overshadowed the previous 25 good years leaving me with a negative view of the company."
bad,"A lot of training (12 wks ) , unnecessary classes, difficult to get days off. Need to condense the area of precert with states ( 50 is to many to handle ) ."
bad,"A relaxed work environment. Top performers can advance within their own department but the company takes a long time to make decisions and move people. Advancement outside of your department into a new department is almost impossible.  The company has a learn on the job program to help employees work toward their career goals, however; the program has very little structure.  Several top performing employees in the program were told that they would be moved into advanced positions but the company makes many promises that they don't intend to keep.  None of the employees advanced after a almost 2 years in the program and some of the employees within this group left the company altogether."
bad,"A typical day at work included, logging into the companies AVA telephone system, responding to high volumes of inbound calls regarding medical health benefits, assisting them with all necessary means of utilizing their benefits and coverage, plan liasion between customers and providers, billing, facilites, pre-cert."
bad,Communication from leadership is limited. Lack of learning opportunities. Worst cafeteria and employee kitchen and break room possible.
bad,A friendly environment. A typical day was members calling in and requesting benefit information.
bad,Finance Medicaid department hires managers that lack supervisory skills and some with no english communication skills. Dallas office in general is a poor work environment. Employees are forced to share 1 cube with 4 individuals. Employees are cramed together like snells. Do not recommend working in the Finance Medicaid department because if you have a problem with supervisor there is no one to go to. No support at all.
bad,"Aetna promotes non qualified employees to positions. Customer Service agents positions are the lowest paying position, and has the highest demand for that position."
bad,Fulfiling job duties team organization time raised hourly wage commited to help other get there life duties handled love helping others willing to learn skills and school attending
bad,"My typical day as a Claims Benefits Specialist is worrying will I have a job after my shift is complete. You have a certain amount of claims to process daily if you don't meet that you may be wrote up. How can you process a claim with little to no training? There isn't anyone to ask. Ok just throw us to the dogs,  they watch your every move. Don't listen to music they'll say you're on your phone. A class was just trained back in August if you ask half of them they're looking for jobs elsewhere already. If you want a stable job please look elsewhere not worth being stress out."
bad,"It's too bad, Aetna's culture is great, it's just the middle management that is awful.  The people you work with are fantastic.  It's a shame they can't get competent people who KNOW how to manage."
bad,"I did enjoy my coworkers but I do not do well in a cubicle setting. I did not like that someone dictated my breaks and lunch. Overall, work is okay but just wanted a bit more freedom."
bad,"What I learned at Aetna: "
bad,"A work day was monitored five different buildings."
bad,"customer service, loved having the ability to solve member problems with there claims"
bad,Atena had great benefits also.  They close the office in our area.
bad,"large case loads, work often beyond hours scheduled to get work done, all about meeting quotas   supervisors unprofessional,  unrealistic expectations, work life balance poor, pay is   okay, worked at home  can adversely affect socializing with others  coworkers just a telephone call away"
bad,Fun place to work despite the pay. The work is over barring and you are not paid enough for it. The breaks are short for lunch. Also competition for days off.
good,Temp to hire. But they aren't hiring so you won't get benefits or raises. And disability law doesnt apply to them they said if you are a temp so I missed doctors appointments
good,"Very sad what Life and LTC did to abuse female employees of a certain age group and salary level. They would find ways to get rid of them to hire younger and less expensive employees. "
good,Not enough time off. High in nepotism.  Management not professional as organizational. Unable to communicate with Human Resources. No employee repersentative or support. Employees don't have a grievance process or instructions on what their rebuttal rights or who to contact for appeals or support. Employees not treated with dignity.
good,They expect you to make your metrix but don’t try to accommodate you for staying on a call late or doing further research for their members. This job does not prepare you for the verbal abuse you endure while speaking to their members.
good,"clock in first,,"
good,The company itself is good but the segregation between management and low level employees is bad. The manager of the call center treats people as if they’re not people at all more like like dirt. In six weeks more than seven people in immediate area left only because of management specifically one manager.
good,The atmosphere at my site wasn’t the greatest all the time. But my current supervisor has done so much to improve morale. They have implemented daily huddles to go over stats and ways to fix issues we encounter. So that’s good.
good,Aetna seems like it would be a great company to work for but there are many hidden agendas. Metrics have to be met if not it’s a big problem. Manangement is poor. They pay depends on what department or title you have. Most start at 16.(could receive bonuses every 3 months) It’s a lot to learn during the training process so it’s imperative that you don’t miss any days... also the hiring process is crazy ridiculous. Intense job verification and criminal check. Must have past jobs W2s for ALL years that you worked for company if not it slows up the process.
good,"It was very easy to get burnt out at Aetna. No free snacks. Management did not want to be there because low pay and unfulfilling work. The work done was very much busy work. The motto was was try hard, job security is more important."
good,Intense environment with a tremendous amount of unproductive swirl that is supported by senior management.  Back stabbing environment. Knee jerk reactions resulting in constant re-work.
good,"Work is extremely easy; almost too easy. There is no emphasis on the work-life balance; even for doctor appointments. "
good,You are on the phone all day with members . Time off is hard to get given the size of the department. Required E-Learning with no down time to get it done. Benefits are some of the worst in the industry. 3200 deductible and then 5200 out of pocket before the plan starts to pay at 100 percent. Stay away if you have a life or kids that you want to see.
good,"A typical work day is busy but challenging. I've learned to prioritize, communicate effectively and respectfully. The hardest part of the job is to get management to consider your challenges to get the work done. I enjoy educating providers and coworkers and their response are happy responses that shows that they understand."
good,"I worked at Aetna for 10 years and just 1 month ago left for a new job, due to stress. While at Aetna eaxh week there was a new change from my supervisor and she couldn't articulate the changes well to us and would say instead to just do it or lose your job. I felt everyday my job was on the line. The supervisors also gossip to much. I would tell my supervisor something private like I was pregnant and within minutes EVERYONE in the call center knew your business. Managent is very unprofessional and just rude."
good,It was a fast paced place to work. We lost a big contract and work came to a crashing halt. They didn't give out a raise this year and that was disappointing.
good,I was originally hired as a prudential employee during a mass hiring in 1996.  There was a substantial amount of restructuring during this time.  Aetna purchased Prudential and there was more restructuring.  The one thing constant while working for Aetna was change.
good,"Was hired as a temporary agent, very good work experience. Helped me learn a lot about the insurance industry. However our contract was short, and the management was messy."
good,"The business unit I worked in is a small part of Aetna. The senior management team is not managed by superiors, which leads to culture deterioration. The job I was hired for was great, then  an additional department and 5 processes were added. Reports and audits were also added as well as evenings and weekends, There was no work life balance, all work."
good,Aetna provides the tools needed to perform your job functions. The company allows work from home. Which was great and more companies should offer it. Working at Aetna was great because it allowed me to work from home
good,Communication and transparency were in dire straights at this company. I always felt that I was not given a fair shake and was never really listened to.
good,Management hierarchy put all accountability on the employees lower on the food chain. Cliques and social engineering was rampant; favoritism was played by managers.
good,"A typical day is non stop calls and complaints about claims . The hardest part is dealing with the high stressful calls . They do not update their provider listings , the members always complain."
good,ok pros and cons work life balance was ok. Hard to meet production goals with all the info. Constant changes. Didn't agree with production process/productivity goals for trainees as senior mentors had to review audits. Also had their own work on top of other mentees which was very unfair.
good,"A typical work day is a marathon from start to finish. There is always extra work assigned with aggressive deadline dates on top of other deadline dates for regular work. Many long working hours are required all the time."
good,"claim log"
good,It was a great place to work but management isn't where I would like and the compensation for the work we do is insurmountable. Benefits are pretty good.
good,"Supervisor are not friendly, you usually hear them talking down to employees"
good,"I learned a lot at Aetna and for the most part enjoyed my positon. In my 4 yrs at Aetna, there were definite undertones of racism. On several occasions management were dishonest in dealings with employees.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who were not able to receive services due to Aetna's lack of ability. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist others and effect change in members lives."
good,"Personal experience with this company took my self esteem from a 10 to a 1. Lots of smiling faces that are a mask for their true personalities.  It was like being in grade school.  If you aren't part of the ""click"" you have no chance of advancement."
good,the only thing that was good here was the food. this place has lack of leadership and its ghetto. this is not a place where you are able to grow in.
good,No comment.  I have nothing to add.  The environment was somewhat hostile and not collaborative.  Very little training and required to work many hours.
good,Too many lay offs and too many employees out on FMLA for mental health reasons.
good,"I would advise anyone looking for a career not to go to this company. They advise that their is room for grown, however, there is not. The abuse that you deal with both on and off the phone is mental and emotional draining. I have never been at a job were people want to get fired"
good,"The management is easily influenced the  importance of work ethics is not measured by quantity, efficiency it's done bye the lake of and who complains the loadess."
good,"less micromanagement and more open mindedness and flexibility on work from home .  when it is slow and not much to do, management should be more open to allowing their team to work from home. also there should be less micromanagement and concentration on menial issues when there are bigger issues to consider. more understanding."
good,"The summary speaks for itself. However with the acquisition of Aetna by CVS, the IT aspect of the business will take a significant downgrade. Aetna was on the ""bleeding edge"", exploiting Tech for the betterment of Healthcare. This acquisition will stagnate that growth."
good,Upper Management In the Richmond office has no idea what they are doing and they do not listen to their employees regarding unhappiness and being over worked they  tend to scew numbers to DMAS  for LTSS  and are not open to new ideas. Most Managers throughout the state have no experience and not trained properly nor do they have any management experience
good,"Before CVS acquired Aetna and before some management changes 3 years ago, Aetna was a nice place to work for."
good,The health concierge position comes with like 5 months of extensive training. You are not allowed any days off or tardiness without receiving occurrences. NO grace period! They fire easily and have a high turnover rate.
good,"Good office environment. although, due to Aetna moving work overseas there is a lack of work here in the US. IT is also based overseas and IT is hard to access and and or utilize due to the language and time differences."
good,"Terrible management team for they play the blame game when something is wrong or not accounted for. Some managers don't speak, some managers are terrible handling stress, Managers tell people about there personal life all day and there is no time for the restroom, if you are in the restroom during a meeting you can be fired. You can not say anything and be considered to have behaivior problems which can lead to termination."
good,"Layoff of nurses is common, especially the last couple of years but never ever publicized.  They seem to go for the one's who've been with the company > 3 years and have done a good job and are now earning too much through performance based raises and bonuses.  Company brought in some woman out of Arizona who does the hatchet job on the rest of the nurses for Aetna.  She has you train your replacements first, sweet talking you all the while and praising you as such a good worker so you'll be willing to train others.  Once you've got you replacement all trained and ready to go, off with your head.  Sorry, I can't say anything good about management but who could say anything good about a person capable of wrecking lives like this for her own personal and corporate ladder gain?  Its creepy how its handled.  Its just creepy."
good,"I was brought in to work in one of the most heavily trafficked area in Atlanta. Being late was inevitable weekly due to accidents, volume etc. all of the people in my current position had already been allowed to telecommute a couple years prior because no one could get to work on time. They hire us and make it mandatory that we come into the office. By the time I was fired for being late (mind u I was two weeks away from fulfilling my 4 month probationary period) and the train broke down and I was terminated. I was a proven excellent employee but that had no bearing."
good,I worked as a nurse and lead on a aetna call center. Job was great the begining but when management changed it really went downhill. Job got to be very goal oriented at the expense of the employees causing high turn out on nurses and care coordinators.
good,Work Life balance does not exist. While I was employed with him we worked mandatory overtime for five months straight. They did not provide any type of balance for accommodation when requesting time for personal needs.
good,"Overworked, lack of training."
good,I was the only one in my department doing the job of 5 people. Poor management and unrealistic expectations lead to me leaving the company. The management is ill-equipped to handle the flow of new members and lacks the ability to lead their team to productivity in a realistic manner.
good,"did not like work for Aetna and don't know why I work for them 18 years. always did my job if I was in a good mood bs hit the fan, and if I was in a bad mood they try to cheer me up so I would be in a bad mood did not like work like this. so I left"
good,"We lost the contract though we were the largest and best Medicaid product in the state.  The company bought our previous employer and they treated us differently than those who were legacy Aetna employees.  That was difficult as benefits and pay were less for our staff.  After several years, this pay package was going to be changed but instead the company closed.  We were sad to leave. Their RFP team was not good.  They lost several state contracts for Medicaid."
good,"Atypical day at work is dealing with customer not submitted their prescriptions on time. I learned to consistency, focus, responsibility and efficiency. Management was good at most part."
good,"Typical day at work answer calls for members and prescribers. You had to take on average 30 calls minimum every day. Calls could not exceed 9 minutes. Management was poor, hardly ever in the office. Training was very intense, and we did not receive adequate training. Trainer was out of town so they assigned us different supervisors and senior technicians to train us. Overall if you can get through training and stay off the NTR report (no errors) then it has the potential to be a nice place to work."
good,When I first started I seemed to be an nice place to work.  After training was over which more training was needed it was like you are on your own figure it out.  Bare minimum help from management to do the job correctly and in a timely manner.  A lot of favoritism with the ones they management selected.  Pay was ok could've been better.  A lot of childish things went on .  They only focused on what you did wrong instead of making sure you understand exactly what you were doing.  Management didn't know how to help the employees with the work at all the only thing they worried about was the numbers.
good,"At first I was really excited to get have the opportunity to work for an established company like Aetna but per usual my excitement turned in to disgust. The management aka supervisor was horrid, favoritism is all too common and the morale at least for me is extremely low. Rules change everyday and no type of flexibility at all unless your a boot licker. Do yourself a favor and take your chances somewhere else. Not worth headache or stress."
good,"I worked for Aetna for almost 7 years, 5 at home.  It was bearable, especially because I was at home, until they secured a large, 800,000 employee account in January 2015. Our tiny dept could have used 5-6 new people. Instead we got 1 who was not approved until 6 mos later. Went from an average of 55-60 cases and 9 new cases a week to 80 cases and 12-19 new cases a week. Several coworkers had physical illnesses from the stress. The new account is the most dysfunctional companies I've ever seen. Things have only gotten worse. The stuff is rolling downhill so that the employees are being micro-managed, bullied and intimidated. As things got worse, the ONLY reason I stayed was to work at home. Even the money was not worth it after awhile."
good,"I don't have nothing Good or Bad to say about Aetna only the truth. Aetna management  doesn't  back their employees, Aetna doesn't show appreciations to their employees."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy. I've learned to be a team player no matter what your job description is (Team work makes the dream work). Management is ok. "
good,The job was  interesting it gave me more of an understanding of the customer service business and the management could be and have done a better job picking candidates for supervisers and managers also this is a high turnover job witch provides nop stability
good,Translation of complex program structures into easily readable Visio diagrams. Combination of unique structural elements into workable modules to enable end-to-end visualization of planned systems.
good,The best part about working here was the people. I met some good people at Aetna. The work schedule was good because I was able to choose my own work schedule. The down side was the management. Managers were not on the same page and it made it hard to communicate with them. The job in disability was stressful hearing peoples problems all day and we did not actually have the ability to really help. For the most part we could only transfer callers to case managers who were not always eager to help and the customer was sent to voice mail most of the time. I was able to learn a lot disability and how it works and how people can be impacted.
good,"it is not a fun job, but it gives you a chance to meet some nice people.i have nine bathrooms to clean. i can't say it is fun because no one likes to clean bathrooms."
good,"the training was okay, they did not have everything for the trainer so he could only train us what they sent him. not good."
good,Not a bad job depending on how you define yourself in life. Those people define themselves by what they do. Those of us who don't are the odd person out of the circle.
good,"My previous company was migrated with Aetna. I enjoy all of Aetna's benefits they offer. I am still transitioning into the Aetna way, and so is my previous company Coventry Healthcare."
good,"I sat in a cubical all day answering in-coming call for medical review and only used clinical outline criteria for approval or denial, Poor compensation and management was only concerned with numbers not quality of care"
good,Micro-managed company with limited opportunties for career change
good,"Not a hard job, must be able to manage your own time well, must be able to work alone, must be apt to learn by reading, documents on your own, must be flexible and adjust to change."
good,"Aetna was a good experience, I worked at home full time and it allowed me to be flexible as I had two young children. Once my children were older and in school together, I decided to pursue a position outside the home. Pros- flexibility. Cons- work/life balance."
good,"Working in eligibility allowed me to be able to help people and gave me a sense of purpose.  "
good,"Decent place to work, easy once you get the hang of it. There is Not much room for advancement, hard work goes unnoticed at times. The pay is pretty good but the benefit packages are definitely lacking, especially for a health insurance company."
good,Aetna was an ok place to work. But it did seem like as soon as you got passed the first 3 months people where not as nice and caring toward you. You begin to feel like just a number at your job and not an actual person.
good,I loved working here and I loved my coworkers but the attendance policy was unfair. 2 minutes for being late and they'll get rid of you even if you don't have CTMs or complaints from members.
good,Management needs training on how to speak to employees. They're constantly hiring their friends only to advance them over current employees. They will not hire additional staff to compensate for the amount of clients we have. There is no room for advancement. Management will ask questions not for feedback but to berate and be condescending to their employees. Not a good work culture at all.
good,"The other employees are great, willing to help with Medicare insurance questions, what I do not like about to company is that upper management ( off site ) do not communicate with  on site management, go by two different set of rules. Like having two different bosses."
good,"Stressful and difficult work environment due to daily requirements that were unreasonable to meet.  Benefit of job was being able to work from home, however management monitoring of calls, documentation such as number o keystrokes made, monitoring of mouse movements and logging into my computer to see how and what was being done on a daily basis made it difficult to work efficiently and effectively."
good,It was very interesting place to work. Also very versatile atmosphere. The hours of working was what i liked the most. Very welcoming company and open to employment.
good,Good benefits.  Not great salary.  No room for advancement.  Not many employee activities.  No flexibility.  It served the purpose as a job not a career.
good,"The company  minimized management prior to the CVS acquisition. To present as a streamline operation. Thus the AETNA management team delegated many responsibilities onto the case management team and auxiliary staff intended to support case managers,  making the job load , productivity standards member services and work-life balance unrealistic. The measurable goals within a 40-50 hour work week was time studied with actual factual numbers and for a quality score a RN CM would have to work a minimum of 70 + hours to meet the baseline qualificatiions.  Thus AETNA MICHIGAN MEDICAID CASE MANAGEMENT is an undesirable career position with the organization. With an honest eye and due respect and consideration AETNA has a wonderful upper management and seemingly an overall wonderful atmosphere and working ecosystem."
good,The company had mandatory overtime.  There was between 40 to 90 Mandatory hours of overtime  per month plus every other weekend.  The company did offer good benefits.
good,"It was a good experience and opportunity to learn skills. I would not recommend internal advancement, as they do not pay fairly vs someone coming on board externally."
good,this place does not follow their own mission statement. they rob us for our healthcare benefits. there is no work life balance. not much opporutnity for growth.
good,"I enjoyed the opportunity to build a career during my tenure, built lasting relationships across various areas and learned strong work ethics and felt proud of my contribution to support the company's mission statement in competitive markets."
good,money is great supervisors and leads are not they look for reasons to put you on plans instead of coming up with ways to help serve better.  money is good but the stress is to much
good,"Aetna is one of the oldest health insurance companies. The company is respected and has employed many. Although I do not have many comments about the company,  I am happy to have the opportunity to be an employee with Aetna."
good,The amount of favoritism at aetna is outrageous people not knowing how to do their jobs getting commended because the supervisors like them better. You cant opt out to a different department until you've been out of training for a year. Work at homes are no longer an option. Good people are fired because of supervisors mistakes. No one takes accountability for their actions and you can rely on no one but yourself.
good,Aenta as a company is ok to work for but depending on the dept and how is is run have to be careful. They are flexible and are understanding of life issues. I got to learn the process companies have to go thru to get their employees insurance at a reasonable rate for them and the employees.
good,"aetna is a fairly good company to work for and it has a good VP and Director.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that they let you work from home, after a period of 6 months training or so, depending on the job.  There were too many meetings that waste time. They can often do their meetings by Skype, but instead, make the nurses drive into the office.  They keep adding more and more work on all of the CM nurses every day; and now they do everything for the MCA/MCP members, to include CM, DM and BH management, along with added HV and many assessments.   It used to be a fun job and very fair.  They promoted a person that has no leadership skills and she made it a habit to hire her friends and then promoted them over nurses that have been there longer.  I feel that this is very unfair employment practices.  Culture revealed too much favoritism in the Medical Management workplace area of MCA/MCP.  Many of the CM's were offered a severance, so five or six of us took it. We all wanted an exit interview that did not happen.  Obviously, the new manager did not want any of us to have the exit interview I am sorry to say.  I have learned that members are the most important reason we are here, and this is to care for the underserved in America."
good,"Very cut and dry. You show up at the time expected, not a minute late or you loose your job. Your there to do your job and that is it. No employee gratification."
good,learning about cleaning material was awesome.my co-workers were great.the most enjoyable part was being able to look out at jacksonville.Management was great.
good,"It was great working here, felt I had a lot of autonomy. I would recommend people to work here, but expect politics like in every big corporation. There was enough support but restructuring occurs quite a bit"
good,"the managment was horrible, team morale didn't exist, there was constant stress gossip and nonsense among the employees, i really enjoyed the job itself, it was the people and management that made the job almost impossible to enjoy"
good,"work on reports, balance monthly reports, posting payments and all collections. Occasionally call patients to verify information with them. Work closely with management."
good,"Pay is low "
good,long extensive training and company micro managed everyone. Will not work for this company in the call center again. I did gain a lot of knowledge which lead me to my other jobs.
good,"I worked for Coventry Cares for a year before the merger with Aetna Better Health (Medicaid Line of Business). The first year after the merger (honeymoon period) everyone (management) was one there best behavior. "
good,"salary employee ending job 10-12 hours/day X5 days/week,  Poor life balance. Not even enough time to exercise, though they advocate this. Since new manager took over in Spring she has not talked with staff, only my direct boss has team meetings weekly. Alot of required meetings are a BIG waste of time, new programs started prior to being tried on smaller scale, protocols in place and questions answered."
good,They dont take what you think into consideration. Nasty work environment. Gossiping and just all around not a friendly environment. (taylor&mathis)
good,I do not wish to review this company at this time. They are a well established health care company.  I enjoyed the work I performed while with Aetna. Thank you
good,"In my opinion, the work environment leaves something to be desired. The pay and paid time off are okay. However, the benefits offered by this company are TERRIBLE. For working for a health insurance company, you are not being set up for success in this area. Management is NOT helpful whatsoever in helping you to obtain goals and further develop in your career path. Most of the people are disrespectful and this behavior is often rewarded. The management staff often participate in inappropriate behavior and have been reported to HR on numerous occasions with no resolve.You are looked down upon for asking questions and humiliated on a regular basis. Despite the values that they claim to possess, Aetna is a terrible company. If you are seeking an opportunity that allows for growth, personal development, and a tolerable environment- this is most definitely NOT the place for you."
good,I have a very long commute and deal with a lot of drama. The severe lack of work/life balance in my department makes the job very stressful.  I want to stress this is in my specific department.  I have been in other departments with Aetna that have been wonderful
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is helping other people learn new things daily.  It gives me great satisfaction to teach others on daily activities or even on how to improve a current process to enable them to do a better job.
good,Good place to get started in your management career. Great place to build on your network.
good,To unbalance schedule. Member are great people to work with if you love customer service. I missed the member.
good,Management was horrible. But still a great relaxed place to work. Up to date software and systems. Never a hassle to do your job or three steps to get to one goal
good,"Those on the front line, call reps, lack support from management when they’re unable to resolve an issue.. poor business practices the past two years have lead to unnecessary anxiety for employees, agents and customers."
good,Aetna was a temp assignment.  The company offers decent benefits need to improve income offers. Needs to work o on environment culture.  And offer more opportunity for the long term temps.
good,"Beyond strict attendance policy.  Management does not care.  "
good,Working for Aetna at the beginning was very good. Overtime the job was getting alittle hard because they were putting too much work on your plate and they expected us to get done by a certain time. And the supervisors were doing a lot of micromanaging something that they said they wouldn't do.
good,"Disclaimer: The comments listed below do not apply to Aetna as a whole, but it does apply to the operations of the building that I happen to work in."
good,I cannot speak for other lines of service but ours gets more stressful with additional mandates and monitoring.  Staff and middle management not considered in constant policy changes.
good,"This is the company that offers great  training and its up with technology."
good,"Not a bad place to work for some people, it all depends on your department and management. Having to make production and Quality numbers every month trying to figure out how management came to those numbers can be frustrating. They need a better way to compensate everyone not just your favorite ones"
good,"At first I was so extremely excited to work in their new model, all through training we were told that mentors would be available,  coaching, and that we would have more input in member issues. My trainer was AMAZING, but nothing like it's built up to be. They want impossible results 100% across the board all of the time. Upgraded computer System on a few computers in October and still do not have access to all of the applications that are required to do my job, but still punished for it. Supervisor constantly say to reach out for help but completely ignore when you do or tell you that you should know it. They say they'll help you with things if you haven't done them, but you end up doing it on your own and then you again get punished if things aren't 100%."
good,If you get stuck with a bad manager you will hate your job.   Upper management is also making it hard for the employees on the front line to succeed.  There are some jobs at Aetna that are just fine. Operations is not one area I would recommend.
good,"The training is very good, you can come in with no medical insurance experience and learn a great deal. The management was fair. I didn’t like how they make you change your schedule every single month. Work life balance is lacking"
good,"Being bought out multiple times has taken it's tole. This company is not as dependable as it seemed. The more and more the days go , the more and more it comes to the realization that a move is what is needed. "
good,"Training is on-line only, most of it videos some of it online classes.  A typical day was spent on the phone and computer.  Communication with management and co-workers was through application on computer.  Basically I didin't like feeling tethered to my desk and sitting all day.  I did, however, enjoy my coworkers and the camaraderie."
good,Aetna has a ton of opportunities. The pay of good for when you first start but doesn't remain competitive throughout your growth. The management is hit or miss.
good,"Aetna was good place to work for a time. The pay was average. Ineffective processes may the workload unnecessarily heavy.  Many Nurses expressed this, but to no avail."
good,Is heartbreaking that I am even looking for another job now but the company is not what it used to be anymore. Lots of perks are now being taken away from us and work/life balance is not possible anymore either. Very very sad
good,organization did not allow me to utilize my appropriate methods and flexible interpersonal style. Not happy with organization due to no professional growth or advancement.
good,"A typical work day would be to pull your Implementation sheets from the mailboxes that were assigned.  I learned many skills that lead me to become the SME of the applications I was responsible for.  The management changed when were acquired.  The culture is a mixture and everyone gets along very well.  The hardest part of my job was training other to take my position away from me.  The most enjoyable part of my job was helping troubleshooting, creating new process improvements, and helping other resolve pricing issues."
good,Work/life balance was satisfactory at the time.  It may have changed due to continued job eliminations.  The pay and opportunity for advancement were not satisfactory.
good,"repetitive work, quiet"
good,"Aetna was ok, the best thing about it was wearing Jeans everyday. The environment was kinda of depressing and management did not engage with employees."
good,"When you first come onboard to their new A1A program they paint a great picture, only later do they tell you it is a 24/7 365 days a year operation making it manditory for someone to always be there.  They will preach that they care about your work/life balance however when placed on a shift not adequate for daycare and other family needs they will not work with you to make any changes."
good,"most enjoyable part of work was my co-workers"
good,"Aetna is great when it comes to pay and bonuses. However, if you are looking for a supervisory/management position within the  company, you have a better opportunity working your way up at another company then applying for aetna once you have your job title. There are employees that have been with the company 10+ years and when they apply for a supervisory position, aetna hires someone from the outside who held that position elsewhere."
good,"If you are just entering a workforce, have little or no education this is the place for you.  They offer a lot of online courses that you can take.  It is really difficult to fire anyone - especially if you achieve bare minimum standards.  That was the incredibly frustrating part.  There was no real incentive for achievement"
good,"This was a great place to work for when I started at Aetna almost 20 years ago. It was enjoyable and the atmosphere was great. They would show their appreciation of your hard, dedicated work by having events, contests, awards, and rewards. They would boost your moral by having little festivals and games. That lasted for a long time until management changed. Now employees are rarely appreciated for their hard work. Instead of the company being as one, it is divided so every department has their own way of doing things. Certain things only apply to one department. It is also mismanaged."
good,This was a low paying maintenance job that there really isn't any room for advancement unless you were to become the manager.  The hours were fine.  The work was fine.
good,"I worked at Aetna full-time"
good,Enjoyed my coworkers who helped make the phone calls less stressful. Management would lie to workers and not helpful at all.  Most did not even know the job that supervising.
good,"Wonderful pay in exchange for your soul,+pound of flesh/heart's blood.  Helping members understand what health insurance is and what happens when they get billed for non covered services wears on you like no tomorrow.  People have been scarred for life working. here."
good,"Pay is excellent however Management is poor along with training.  A lot of micromanagement.  Low moral among employees, non-clinical personnel managing clinical staff, no guildence."
good,"I am currently working at Aetna Insurance Company as an Utilization Management nurse. I love that I get to work from home full time. I, however, do not like the fact that we are now suppose to help out on weekends, holidays and work a late shift."
good,I have respect for the honest managers. I learned valuable transferrable information that can be used in future endeavors. There were motivational incentives as far as one's health.
good,Pressure is high and resources are scarce to get the job done. Unrealistic expectations to to maintain progress operational effectiveness as well as innovate..
good,"working there I •	Lead review meetings to discuss the trends and quality coaching sessions to assists managers and leads in improvement suggestions"
good,Typical large company. Work life balance is good however career growth is limited. There is an abnormal amount of internally generated work versus external or customer facing effort.
good,Aetna has a long way to go to innovate their people culture. No room for advancement internally. Pay is average to low. Big focus on wellness.
good,"always enjoyed helping senior citizens. I did phone and public Medicare sales presentations."
good,"Aetna used to be a great place to work for career advancement."
good,It's an okay place to work. I have learned how to be a better teammate to my workers than what I was before. It was close to where I lived which I consider a plus.
good,"Fast work pace,  better salary for social workers than other community health centers or some private sector; the hardest part of the job is the amount of time you need to put to complete your job as a salary employee; most enjoyable part of the job great people-coworkers and my paycheck."
good,Good compensation.  Multiple management changes.  High pay means higher benefit cost.  Difficult to move up and be acknowledged.  Hourly demands are great and leaves little time for family without scheduling vacation time.
good,"Being on a inbound phone call center is sometimes challenging, and I will take anywhere between 80 to 120 calls a day depending on how busy we are. Every day is different. I learned a lot about insurance plans, where they can have services done, where they cannot if they have an HMO plan. I learned how to provide the providers that called in for these services with great customer service to the best of my ability."
good,"Don't plan on advancing your career here--the management is comprised of deadwood, and they'll make a lot of promises they'll never keep.  So long as you keep your head down and have no expectations, you'll be able to skate along fine."
good,Employees of acquisitions treated poorly.  Laid off as soon as they could without opportunity to integrate.  Disengaged leadership.  Would not recommend.
good,"Aetna has great benefits and it is a great place to work. However, it is challenging getting to the necessary answers to complete my daily work tasks."
good,"I work 80 hrs per week in order to keep up with my job responsibilities.  We were severely understaffed at the start of the contract and it has been almost impossible to hire new staff.  It took months to obtain approval to hire new staff and it takes months to get new staff hired.  Communication between leadership and other departments is sorely lacking.  Despite numerous requests for direction and higher level decision making needs, My department and I have been unable to solve even the most basic problems.  Our clinical data systems are unable to function at their capacity, ie, enrollment information is often incorrect.  It is extremely difficult to run a managed care complany if you don't know if the person is enrolled or what benefits they have.  We cannot even determine with accuracy which provider the members are assigned to and we have to rely on the information the hospital gives us which can lead to HIPAA violations.  The best part of my job is my team.  They work independently for the most part and manage to do the best job they can do in spite of the poor quality of the data systems that we use."
good,"A typical day would consist of field work and inputting information in the system.  "
good,"Being a long standing employee is something I pride myself on as I have seen so much change and indeed undergone a lot of change with the company. I find myself learning every day"
good,Company reorganized and positions were eliminated. Other than that it was a good job just doesn't have job security.
good,Hired to work at Aetna with SAS BI Enterprise Suite of products.  Aetna never implemented new products.  Created web based reporting tool for clients utilizing SAS Intrnet.  Reason for leaving:  position eliminated in recent downsizing.
good,"Was very good working place, would say best, However since 2007 with new management in MUD everything changed to negative direction, except employee.  "
good,I had responsibility for training and assuring employees working in A-frame unit of use and control room were following the documented process.
good,"Interacting with the customers is enjoyable. However, there have been a variety of cultural changes that have made it challenging to receive accurate information from various departments to service clients. Employee morale has decreased due to the cultural changes and the lack of accountability that employees feel or take ownership for. The position is a challenge due to the fact that the employees/customers do not appreciate your hard work."
good,Aetna Rx Home Delivery has changed drastically. At one time the Florida mail order pharmacy offered equally opportunity became all about favortism and unfair business practice.
good,overall a fairly good experience. management very busy. difficult to get help whne needed
good,The organization is not very understanding of employees needs and work ethics.
good,Great core group of employees.
good,"Promise you everything but give you lillte. Managers in their jobs based on letters after their names, or, promoted because they are in the right place at the right time. Definitely not because they have any ability to manage and work with their employees"
good,"My experience with Aetna was fair.  They offer great compensation however benefits and inclusion are lacking.  "
good,"The precertification department in Blue Bell, Pa was ""factory oriented"".  More emphasis on numbers and not quality.  Training was on skpe from Malaysia.  Supervisor and Call Coach were in another state.  Micromanagement from afar."
good,"This is a good company, they work on the point system. You will get to work on computers and interact with people on the phone so if you don't like talking to people this is not the job for you."
good,"There is a production and quality standard that must be meet everyday."
good,It was an okay company to work for  I didn’t as appreciated as I felt I needed to be    My job did not feel secure anymore so venturing out to find something better with better benefits
good,I would prefer not to leave a review about working for aetna i believe everyone's experience is different. I would recommend anyone who enjoys insurance work to apply for the company.
good,"This can be a great place to work unless you are directly under the Director of commercial plans. If she doesn't like you you will never advance regardless of how well you perform. She will advance her favorites and disqualify candidates due to personal preference. I saw it happen multiple times. I leaned it doesn't pay to excel and do a good job here. It makes you a target. The hardest part of the job is the lack of consistency within the company and lack of accountability. The most enjoyable part was coworkers. Overall, I wouldn't recommend working in the commercial department or any department this individual is the director of."
good,Increasingly poor management over the last few years with failed strategies.  Fellow employees and immediate supervisor were awesome to work with.  Technology needs updated.
good,"It is a great place to start off, but it then becomes a numbers game and hard to manage and meet their goals. They are mostly good people,  but their expectations are not very realistic."
good,Aetna is good for people right out of college to vuild your resume but is not good for the long term.  If you stick it out for a few years then you can get a much better paying job with another carrier that both pays more and has better benefits.  With the CVS takeover things are getting a lot worse on teh benefits side as well.
good,It was an ok company to work for but over the years the company went through a lot of changes and to me it was not really in the best interest of the employees or patients.
good,I Would not recommended this company to friend or family member. Management does not appreciate the effort that employees put day in and out at least the department I work in. They want so much out of you with little resources..
good,"Aetna has a history of putting people with no claims experience on the phone to assist members with questions about coverage, plan details, claim handling, etc. It's no wonder members become so frustrated."
good,"Started as a CSR on the phones, moved up 3 times and became a Call Center Supervisor within 2.5 years.  Started a Veteran's committee and began numerous volunteer programs.  Now that CVS just bought out Aetna, I was terminated due to leaving on bad terms with CVS.  Not fair but rules are rules."
good,Working with other team members and working as a team.  I prefer to work for an executive and the team as I like to keep super busy.  I have many skills per my resume attached.
good,"The position I held at Aetna was within a subsidiary of Aetna, which was acquired via an acquisition and was in the process of being dissolved.  "
good,"every day is very busy at aetna. There is a lot of room to grow, but so many people have been there for many years so you need to know how to play your politics"
good,"I enjoyed working at Aetna, the people are friendly and the management is nice.  There is a nice break area to sit in for lunch time, and several vending machines to purchase food from."
good,"I worked for this company for 7 years and the company mission and benefits are very nice. The ability to advance is minimal; however you can make lateral moves if you jump through all the hoops.(they clain no favoritiam; however there is) If you work in a call center for Aetna, their metrics are ridiculous and they expect you to spend 40 hours a week providing services and then you will end up staying late to get documentation caught up. You are not allowed to get out of the queue at a reasonable time to catch up your documentation so if the clock says 4:59 and you are scheduled off at 5, if you get a call, you are expected to take it to completion. which means another hour at work minimal. Their call center is busy 24/7 and you will get back to back calls with little or no downtime between calls.This job will grind you down and burn you out quickly. It is an excellent place to get experience; however I would not recommend staying for more than 2-3 years tops or the corporate environment will suck the life right out of you."
good,"They do train you.  They invest in you.  They pay for 3 months of training.  But you work in almost sweat shop conditions and they only pay you $ 16 an hour to take on complex problems like getting  disabled semi-homeless man his prescription drugs, getting nonemergency transportation to an 84 year old stroke victim, talking to a suicidal member help, these people deserve better.  But for some at Aetna, its just a job."
good,"Productive and busy. Each day was a new day with new challenges. I would begin the day running daily reports and setting network numbers in order to meet the metric. I would then review time sheets and employee's PTO balances. I would then greet the team as they arrived every day and do walk arounds throughout the day to check on them. I would help with benefits, coach on call error's and handle escalated calls. The workplace culture became more of young people entering the workforce for the first time and having to understand they could not be on their cell phones while performing their job duties.  The hardest part of the job was getting some individuals to believe in theirselves and knowing they can do the job if they put thier mind to it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job itself and getting to know each team member individually."
good,"Supervisor was poor but job is rewarding. "
good,No training at all. Manager was very understanding and didnt apply pressure. I didnt understand my role. Co-workers were very unhappy which i didnt understand.
good,"Work at home opportunities for most positions. Decent pay. Below average yearly pay increases. QA focuses on finding mistakes instead of ever recognizing good work. Policies change regularly. Upper management rarely communicates with reps but require subordinates to micromanage. No sick or personal leave, just PTO. Regardless of why you’re using it."
good,"Repetitive tasks, working from home. Wonderful experience but change in policies and management happen too often. Pros:  Flexible schedule. Cons: management and compensation."
good,FUN FREINDLY PLACE TO WORK I feel like they need a shift that start at 6:00am for those single parents that need to drop children off at daycare and pick up. Also they did do a company wide lay off at the end of the year if your not meeting company standards. They out sourced alot of the jobs
good,"Call center environment. Dealing with employees from large corporations. My co-worlkers worked well with each in solving billing and coverage issues with customers.  Immediately Lead was awesome, but managment as whole only cared about numbers. Meeting and exceeding requirements was the stressful part of job.  Interaction with customers and the companies they worked for was fun and the companies would come in periodically with food and gifts to thank us."
good,"Had there not been instances where the  Director was undermining the department with her personal friends and the Supervisors work load was increased to handling G/A without regard to the additional work already assigned i.e. CR, would probably still be there"
good,Overall work exp. with Aetna as a client  is good. Work/Life balance is not at all good but I had a very good learning curve. Which helped me face complex problems in the years followed.
good,"Overall, working for this company it seems to be hard to move up within the company. I've been working with my manager on my development plan to be promoted within my department and not much success. I am looking for a company that will allow me to utilize me educational background to enhance my skills and it is time for a change."
good,"You can literally come to work everyday and then one day without notice, you job function can change and you are dropped into doing something you did not sign on to do. Yes there is going to be change, but at least tell me. Also, if the function is way different  than what you where previously doing to the point where training was required, I feel like a pay incentive would have been a nice gesture."
good,"I found the office growing very painfully at the time."
good,"Management is not efficient.  Policies change almost daily.  There is definite favoritism toward millennials, and it is not discrete.  The company is frequently promoting programs targeted to millennials and stating that these are the individuals that they would like to bring onboard.  Management is masking practices from executive management.  The company has a good CEO, but he may be blindsided by practices including those in violation of federal law."
good,"I was under contract with Aetna. Only there for a limited time. The daily activities were routine."
good,Management does not care about employees. They are not understanding nor flexible with hours. They are very cliquish. It is not what you know it is who you know are far as job security or advancement.
good,"On site gym, café and wellness center with physicans and laboratory work can be completed. Flexible hours of operation, allowing you to go into work at 5AM."
good,"I really enjoyed working here and liked the work I did. They lost a big contract and had to eliminate more than half their employees. "
good,"Aetna is a good employer to work for. Being a Grievance Coordinator is great. But, I would like more job advancement. I like working with our Medicare members to make life more easier."
good,"I learned all about claims and what to look for.  The management wants you to be successfully so they tailor an training program and provided monthly updates,"
good,Aetna is not a bad place to work but it’s not the best either. It really just depends on who your manager is. The systems are VERY outdated feels like a bunch of busy unnecessary work.
good,Company going through significant changes and not the most stable job security currently.  Compensation is above average in the industry.  Very siloed company and goals/objectives between segments/departments are not always aligned.
good,"You are a number. You will have more work than is possible to complete in 8 hours. No acknowledgment for what you did or gave beyond. If you don't work long hours, your review will not be positive or neutral. Upper management touts work life balance as if people who work there have it. Perhapse  upper management does?"
good,"Your always on the phone back to back with average of taking 75-90 calls a day or more."
good,When I started this was a great company. Over the years things changed.  The management no longer walked the talk. Members attitudes changed greatly and callers were very abusive at time. There was little consideration for employees need for days off and schedules changed with no regard to the employees plans.
good,I feel the company is moving in the wrong direction. The recent merger does not make me feel secure within my job. My manager has been working from home on FMLA and is not providing the necessary guidance for us to be successful as a team.
good,"I was hired on for seasonal work. Their training was fine. The pay was not great, the base pay was less than what i was making at my previous job with incentive based bonuses for high enrollments. They hired me as a temp and worked mostly part time so i was making less than the prior job but they hired me telling me that most people were averaging nearly double what i was getting paid. In the end they let me go with the invitation to return the next season for enrollment."
good,"Stressful, work load. Not evenly distributed. No work life balance. Management only cares about productivity. Can’t give quality work with such high caseload."
good,"It is a nice place to work, The training is very good and the management works with you ,if you have any problems .They have a very relaxed atmosphere"
good,My position has not allowed work life balance. The managers are not trustworthy. I was promoted but after four months have yet to receive training for the  new position. My managers lied to me. Offered me a salary 10K less than everyone else on my team.
good,Most managers are hired from outside the company.  There is a sense of stagnation for many but the pay is fair.  the days off and vacation time are not bad.
good,"Call center environment, great benefits and incentives, pay is not that great, no room for growth. Expect to learn nothing in training and everything when you hit the floor."
good,"Poor management but decent pay. I have never had worse managers, but the pay and benefits are decent. Depends on what kind of workplace you want to work in."
good,"While Aetna proclaims that it puts customers at ""the center of everything"" they do, I see the same old, tired corporate culture that big insurance suffers from.  Job security is nonexistent, and despite being a healthcare insurer, the healthcare benefits offered to employees are abysmal.  "
good,"When I began my career with Aetna, the culture was open, with emphasis on work-life balance and especially ethics."
good,"Fast paced. Typically Monday through Friday. Occasional weekend and holidays. Hours 8am-5pm, or until 8pm EST. Friendly place to work. Flexible with your personal life."
good,There was little organization when starting with the company and while working for the company. There was a lack of structure and communication in management.
good,Management has lost direction and conviction.  Many of the leaders acquired in the last merger do not have the necessary skill set for their positions.  The culture which has brought Aetna from near bankruptcy 15 tears ago to its current value has been lost.
good,Poor training and advancement opportunities. Management is not interested in helping to resolve issues between employees. Nepotism is a very real problem.
good,Alot of things to work out to better treat their employees to keep them even if you keep up with the required metrics you still do not progress into a permanent position as promised by management
good,"As a person in Leadership, my day starts off with meetings, then engaging staff, and handling department task.  I learned how to run a department and create policies plus procedures.  The management staff was too laid back and nonchalant.  At times, management would even conspire against those they did not like.  I seen this on various occasions. The toughest part about the job is having a hands off manager who delegated all their task to subordinates.  In addition, would claim their subordinates work was there's with the exception of when something was wrong.  The most enjoyable part about the job were the friendly employees and the effort that was made to boost morale within the work place."
good,"No room for growth, if you haven't been there for 25 years you will make very little money,  Workplace culture is strongly based on age,  reverse age discrimination is a large problem here."
good,Aetna was unable to purchase a more efficient Encounter Maintence System which caused sanctions on pended Ahcccs pended encounters. This caused pended encounters to go passed the 120 days period with Ahcccs. Staff was unable to adjust claims accordingly.
good,I worked at a small software as a service company called Pihms for 18 months before we were acquired by Aetna.  Following the purchase I was Aetna for another 4 years.
good,Start computer and begin to pull work from the queue.  The work pulled from the queue is worked on by making sure the information was correct.  Also created quotes for brokers.
good,"Dental Claims Processor"
good,i work and did more task that was not in my job description bu t was the least paid employee there. I truly did not feel like i was a valued employee no matter how well i did
good,"Typical, older corporate culture. Recognized that median age was older with a lot of lifers. Tried to bring in younger talent, but still a work in progress. There was a period where working remote was somewhat acceptable, however leadership currently wants staff in office. This is creates an environment in which advancement is tough for remote workers. While I was there, up to mid-level employees still could enjoy somewhat of work-life balance (I believe it was due to lifers and older culture). Leadership seems to have some vision in terms of market strategy. Technology is still struggling with next gen systems. Re-org/re-sizing will probably change to working longer and harder culture."
good,prefer not to be negative great place to work if youre lucky to be in a good organization. last management team was disconnected worried only about numbers not interested in feedback or improvement suggestions.
good,"Aetna is a good company to start out a career in. It is a small, family owned company, however room for advancement is narrow and opportunities do not arise as quickly as one would expect. The typical day to day is a fast moving environment that includes quick problem solving, on the spot customer relations, and high attention to detail. Co-workers are wonderful, and everyone is willing to jump in to lend a helping hand. Management is supportive and always available to work with and talk to when/should a problem or need for help is called upon. The hardest part of the job is time management due to the ever changing day to day responsibilities. I enjoyed the daily grind and electrical side of my duties."
good,"Aetna Better Health of NJ is a new Medicaid management firm.  As such there are issues being worked on.   As a customer service representative I encountered problems daily with availability of providers, members getting their id cards, and providers having problems with claims.  When forwarding requests for assistance I did not feel as though these requests were being acted on.  I did not  receive feedback to respond to members and providers with information they requested.  I enjoyed my co-workers but felt management did not adequately support its employees.  The CEO started the week before I left, and I thought he would bring positive changes to the company."
good,"When I took the position I was excited in the advancement opportunity I was told about, however, as time has gone one, because of department structure and the high turnover rate it is not possible to advance in the company as I expected. I have goals for my career and am not complacent at an entry level position for long term, so that is why I'm looking for other options to pursue my career."
good,"Company will work you to the bone with volume that is completely unmanageable with expectations that you will meet deadlines.  No lunch breaks.  No compensation for overtime worked.  Upper management very slow to approve positions, even though employees are burning out from work stress."
good,"It is not a bad place to work , it is very fast paced and they Exspect you to meet numbers , the a ation time is good and so is the pay."
good,"Work life balance is well established.  "
good,The employees at Aetna are simply awesome to work with.  Management is stoic and does not adhere to their own code of conduct.
good,"Due to the many layers of management it can be a difficult place to work.  Decision making on obvious items takes significant buy-in to acheive. At times, too much busy work on very low priority items."
good,"logged into phone queue to received inbound calls from Medicare sales agents.  Supported Agents with all needs, getting set up to sell Medicare Advantage, all rules and regulations how to sell, market enroll in plans. Corrected any commission issues.  Main contact with Outside Sales and Aetna"
good,"Aetna pays very well, but has very poor employee medical benefits. Very stressful jobs but they try to make the environment fun when time allows. Difficult to advance. Great employees."
good,Work from home was great for family/work balance.  Co-workers supportive.  Management overbearing and micro-managing at times. Hardest part of the job was trying to do the job as a patient advocate but also making the customers happy at the same time.  Best part of the job was being able to set my own schedule for the most part and work from home.
good,"Little to no opportunity for advancement."
good,"Either process Medicare claims or take customer service calls depending on schedule and demand.  Flexible work schedule if you are processing claims, set schedule with customer service calls.  Co-workers and management are all nice and helpful."
good,Good place to work. Good team dynamics. Challenging IT environment with bureacratic approach to prioritization and co-sourcing with third party resourcers.
good,"answer in coming calls."
good,"Company taking away different benefits of the past each year. "
good,"Eight hours of setting at cubicle with headset and computer"
good,"wonderful co-workers, great supervisor, top heavy, lack of clinical understanding by upper management. wonderful working with MBRs and helping to structure tough health situations"
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"Have broaden my horizons in the Medicaid and Medicare business. Taking courses to help be more efficient in my current position. Always learning new ways to be more productive on the job. Currently, pursuing a Bachelors of Science degree to expand more experience in the medical field. Was looking forward to working at home from management however, department was mislead."
good,learnt a lot of insurance related skills. it is quite fast paced and intense work place but colleagues are very helpful and supportive. the job is also rather demanding due to the nature of it.
good,"I've been here 20 years and work from home which I love. Three months ago they forced us from provider appeals into member appeals which is awful and so boring.  I know a bunch of employees looking for other jobs. I thought I'd retire from Aetna, but not anymore. I don't appreciate being forced into another job after all of my years of service. I understand business needs come first, but life is too short to be in a job you hate. So bye bye Aetna."
good,"its a job, not a career   I will  recommend for people to get experience but not a great place to work. Not understanding  not about the employees  you just have to learn as you go"
good,Not very work-life friendly at all. Pretty much their only downfall. Management doesn't care about anything going on in you life. You could get in a serious car accident and be hospitalized and they would not care. They only care about their brand. I'd rather be somewhere that I feel wanted.
good,Manager needs to be schooled in managing. Very excited to start but never trained to do my job. After two years I was getting yelled at for things I had been doing.
good,"I was contracted through DPV Transportation to work for Aetna. Unfortunately, there were no perks working for them. Everyone was nervous coming to work. The manager did not communicate unless he had something to vent about, and take it out on you. If he found something, you were either terminated or sent to another company. There was no training within this company. Although, the manager did have his favorites. He has 99% spanish/male working for him. It was unfortunate because I had a great working relationship with all the Aetna employees."
good,"Front line Staff and Managers worked uncompensated overtime based on the EXEMPT job description. Thus, no work-life balance. over all rating is low based on unrealistic expectations of the volume of work needing to be completed within federally regulated time frames."
good,I worked in the call center and the call volume was typically high.  They provided you with the tools and guidance to perform your job.  The training was also adequate for job functions.
good,It was a fairly comfortable work environment. The downside was that there were no set procedures and management seemed to change work procedures quite often. It was difficult to be set on one way of doing things.
good,"My experience here was ok at first, the culture of the job is what I dislike. I love helping members but the experience from the employees here is why there will be a forever revolving door with employment."
good,This job is NOT for an experienced professional or is very ambitious. Great for someone just starting out to get the experience. It will teach you a lot information.
good,"I was very excited to start. Training lasted 12 weeks, some groups received less training. High school environment, expect a lot of complaining & unprofessionalism. Hours available aren't flexible, but schedules will be made to work around school schedules. Management staff & team lead positions are based solely on favoritism.  Pay range from $11-12.50. New agents usually make more money then veteran agents. It's a mess, but it's a job. Come to handle your business, serve the cistomers, and go home. Don't get caught up in the typical day to day drama and you will be just fine until a better opportunity presents itself."
good,Temporary job for about 2 years . Very difficult to have permanent job at that time. I would continue applying for future position with Aetna . Good experience and I had good flexibility time
good,"Can be a fun place to work but depends on Manager's personality. Favoritism is always a concern for promotion and pay increases. Not the worst place to work but not the best either. Difficult to voice concerns other than via annual  external review. Senior leadership is NEVER visible.... makes one wonders if they even care about the welfare of employees. Also, it is quite evident that the company is ""a business"" - the goal is the ""bottomline"" - NOT ""putting the patient in the center"" - the caring/listenting and understanding is missing"
good,Workplace is not that friendly - lack of computer stations; over staffing; fast turn over of staffs that often goes on AWOL; no available parking spaces allotted for employees; they pay over time work with GCs and not actual cash.
good,Team Environment was not positive. Caseloads are too high to provide quality care. Parts of the job responsibilities were redundant and too rigid. Management was supportive.
good,Lots of responsibilities.  Always looking to promote from within. Lots of opportunity for advancement.  Salaries to low.  All positions not meeting the median for the area.  Pay needs to be more competitive.
good,Former employee.  Worked here for several years. Average company with pay and benefits. Some flexibility in work schedule.  Too many favorites with Supervisors and Managers and recognition isn't given to employees that deserve it.  Overall is a good company to work for.
good,"good work atmosphere. The positive workplace does exist, however, and usually consists of employees who are fully engaged and willing to lend a hand to a coworker. A positive workplace also means both employees and their employer openly recognize the talents and contributions each team member brings to the work environment.There was a lack of mentor ship."
good,Great place to work until the economy goes bad.  Employees are merely a commodity to be disposed of when the demographics don't match up.  Very few people retire in their 60s - they've been disposed of by then.
good,The management at aetna in the Medicare department is great. They make sure that I am well taken care of as far as new working tasks come about.  They are very good about giving thorough instructions on new projects.
good,"Working at Aetna was like working with people that were close to you, you became like family, due to many co workers cheering you up when you're having a rough day. Everyone worked together, if you needed help, ran into a problem, you could count on someone to be there to assist you."
good,"great medical vision and dental benefits, 401k matching, fully vested in 3 years, 16 weeks of bonding and fmla,  but lacks work life balance. company is too large, a lot of competition for promotion and transfers."
good,"Favoritism is astounding.  Company is well known for promoting people who cannot handle being on the phone as well as internal advancement is a joke unless you know someone else in another department.  They promise you advancement and good benefits.  The only real good benefits are the hours of PTO you get monthly.  Health benefits are garbage even though you work for an insurance company.  Luckily have a supervisor who is really nice and easy to work with last supervisor could have cared less unless you were a favorite which is throughout the department.  No one is ever held responsible if they do something wrong.  People are written off work for months at a time to take an unpaid leave yet are welcomed back with no problems but if upper management doesn't like you they just make you quit.  You are expected to do appeals, as well as handle payments, grievances, enrollment and do more than what you are paid for."
good,"Working from home is the best benefit, no paid OT which sucks. We have once a week meetings to update you. Management is great but I cannot say that I feel valued"
good,I did not like how things changed from one minute to the next and the managers were not very informed about things. I have worked in call centers more than I like to admit but it seems that is the only job I seem to qualify for that pays good. I have some college education and would prefer something else.
good,"I start my shift with a team huddle with my team leader to hype us up for work. The start of my shift is from 11 pm till 7 am in the morning which means there is a lot of queues to answer. I normally take 60 calls in a day and after my shift, the workforce will ask us to extend for 2 more hours just to finish the queue."
good,"Although the policy is to promote from within, they don't do that.  I enjoyed working with and learned a lot from peers and immediate supervisors.  However overall they follow the ""do as I say, not as I do"" philosophy."
good,"911 Ambulance servicing the areas of Hartford, Wethersfield and Rocky Hill. Providing care or transport for patients with medical, traumatic or emotional emergencies."
good,"The management there was never on the same page. I was bullied and had to contact HR on multiple occasions. When they don't like you they don't like you. Period, point, blank."
good,There is very little opportunity for advancement.  The building I work in is half empty.  No onsite supervision.  Supervisors are allowed to work from home but my department is not.
good,Staff and associates are wonderful and up until a year ago management was much more open and collaborative ... not the case now as far as I can see and have experienced . Too far removed and don't pay attention to the people in the trenches or value their opinion
good,I really enjoyed working at Aetna. The employees are very friendly and Aetna was very thorogh in training their employees. I was thankfull to work from home on some occasion.Overall it was a rewingarding experience.
good,"This company offered a lot of good benefits, i.e. flex hours, insurance, etc.  However, the compensation was low and expectations were high.  Good entry-level job."
good,Would rather not say since my job position is being eliminated.  We were told by the CEO of the company the merger with CVS would not affect us and a month later I was told my job was being eliminated
good,"Mandatory overtime and hard to achieve work/life balance you may be looking for. Can be easily promoted if you're friends with people in high places. You're working on behalf of people who need government assistance, so it's a good cause. Most enjoyable part of the job was going home due to heavy workload. Team accountability was minimal with the team I managed."
good,"Came to work and went over what was most cases were most importantly pending. "
good,"Aetna is a decent place to work, the pay can be considered great depending on your performance-based increases, office culture was pretty laid back but professionalism is the standard. Never know when corporate or the state would be in the building observing. Management/leadership definitely needs improvement. A team is only as strong as its coach and the 'coaches' I worked under weren't shining examples to, for or with the staff. Definitely would've stayed at the company longer if there was some leadership improvement or if consideration for advancement was based on seniority/merit vs kissing the right butts. No thank you."
good,"you get a full 40 a week with overtime options, work environment changes quite often so on day you are on one team, the next you could be in another part.  They have high production standards with small return"
good,I like that I can work from home.  I wish there was more management communication.  There is no official training program for my current department.  I fear that my job will be eliminated.
good,It was okay for an intern position. Full time employees got better options. But the intern trip taken in mid summer to headquarters in CT was alot fun.
good,"The  3 of the Team Leads/Supervisors I worked for were excellent, the others, not so much."
good,We were part of an acquisition.  Aetna staff  kept us separate from Aetna employees.  There were a lot of lay offs after we successfully assisted them with converting our information onto their system.
good,"AETNA for a mature Payor IT PMO, I found the methodologies to be conflicting and inefficient. "
good,The work was overload staff was not fully invested due to upper management not being transparent about the future of department or company overall. Even though at times I felt disconnected from co-workers I enjoyed working from home.
good,"Many people there are great. Management, not so much. The Dallas office is extremely understaffed. Many employees feel overworked and underpaid as upper management refuses to fill vacant positions."
good,"The job has good hours, no holidays or weekends, which is great for family life. Salary is decent. Very little opportunity for advancement or learning."
good,Driven by numbers. Fast paced phone calls come in one after the other usually don’t last longer than a few mins. Very repetitive . Most shifts are later in the day.
good,"It's most of the processes are not standard."
good,"In customer service, Aetna is a fast paced and restricted.  Being sick is frowned upon. There is no sympathy for illness or injury.  When I worked, the building was near a railroad track and the trains would stop on the tracks often.  Being late because of the train was not forgiven."
good,I worked in a new program for Aetna Medicaid. It was disorganized and falling apart at the seams. The insurance coverage was not what I expected considering I actually worked for Aetna
good,Aetna was a good place to work up until the last several years.  Aetna is not a employer that I would seek out for employment again. The fit was not right for me but it could be right for someone else.
good,"This is a great company but it can be really stressful. The every day pressure can be extremely over whelming. However, there are great benefits and opportunities if you work in a department where the manager believe in success and helping their employees."
good,"At the pharmacy there is no enforcement for all staff to do the same thing.  So in other words it is left for the people who do things right to take care of the issues.  This means some staff are doing more work than other staff for the same pay, which get very frustrating knowing you are doing all that should be done but the person next you is not."
good,There are continuous changes based on the uncertainty of funding sources. Jobs are not secure. The future of the company is not secure. It's a stressful time to work there.
good,Aetna is a good job.  I enjoyed working from home.  This helped because I don't care mush for driving in bad weather.  I did enjoy working with my coworkers.
good,You would need to work there for yourself in order to know what it is like. I have no thoughts on how it is. I feel if you want to know it is best that you apply and try and get the job.
good,I like the company as a whole.  However the insane back and forth and numerous changes with no time in the day to possibly complete can make for a very stressful time.
good,My day at work was good worked very hard everyday.  Was never called out sick in the last 10 years.  I was a very dedicated team member.  The workplace culture was very nice.  Got along with alot of people.  I am a people person and a hard worker.
good,"I really don't have anything to say about working for Aetna. I thought this site was to assist me with locating a job, not discuss another company. I have been with the company for 12 years and no room for advancement."
good,Major lack of professionalism coming from those in management. Micro-management is a normal part of your day. The turnover rate seems much higher than I have experienced at other large companies. Get the experience and get out.
good,"my supervisor I worked under was awesome, other supervisors and directors outside of one more were bitter and rude. Two supervisors out of the provider services side was amazing, the rest and also the site director were shady and would do anything to get you terminated. Calls were stressful most callers were very rude, a small portion of callers were sweet and understanding. Training curriculum is horrible, but they have good trainers that do anything to help you succeed. job is not consistent at all, you cannot learn this job and be confident in what you do because things change so often. communication skills are at a all time low from management."
good,In my 3 years of working I had 4 different bosses. Not to mention every supervisor never handled just their own team. I was constantly having to fight with management and explain myself because they couldn't or wouldn't communicate.
good,"I liked the company and being willing to work at home. The work environment was hostile and was singled out. The work environment is constantly changing.  I was not on the phone other than conference calls. Each claim is different and each member is different, so there is not polices and procedures that are black and white and can be a lot of guessing and asking other co workers."
good,"The company has its moments when they actually care about their employees; most often it is about numbers, not the customer or the people who work there,"
good,"Great place to work, okay people. The supervisors play favoritism in the Medicare department (Blue Bell), so as long as you are a puppet for them you'll get a nice bonus. This place also has horrible insurance for the employees the cheapest deductible is $1,350.00 crazy right?! But apply for this job if you need something quick. They hire anyone qualified and unqualified, literally."
good,The way that Aetna does things is difficult for me to understand. in the position that I am has a 3 year learning curve but we are held at the same standards as everyone how has  been there longer
good,They alright to work for just need job security . Location is fine. employees are fun to work around. Management is good when they are there. Benefits are good as well.
good,"The job was very overwhelming and stressful. Pay and benefits were decent but not worth the stress it put o people. I feel its a great company to start off a career, but nothing long-term."
good,"A typical day is making 20 to 30 calls to members health care providers.  The tasks are varied deepening on the assignment received for the day.  Multiple priority changes throughout the day.  Turnaround times must be met.  A lot of the work is meaningless and futile, which can be disheartening to those of us who really do care about people. "
good,"Aetna has a fairly typical corporate atmosphere. Job security is limited in the current environment economically, and Aetna is no exception. Always-- ALWAYS-- have a backup plan."
good,"Nice place to work. Enjoyed working remotely, however the amount of work was ridiculous. Benefits were awful and one would think they would be great, especially working for insurance company."
good,"I work in a specialty department, so this is not typical of all of all departments. I like it because I am providing services to members to better manage their health."
good,"The focus as an Aetna nurse has changed from patient centered to meeting requirements for tasks ensuring a higher star rating ."
good,Poor management youvare not informed about important changes untill after they have take effect the company is very reactive and not proactive  job is very hectic however the pay is decent
good,"Doing what is required of you within your job. One must realize that any job involving customer service includes meeting the required performance of the job.The workplace can be somewhat overbearing at times but it is manageable,"
good,"I love the people and it was great place to work at for many years. However, due to recent decisions and reorganizations I have decided to take my career in a different direction. This position helped me to learn a great deal about working and managing an IT organization."
good,"Aetna is a solid company, but with somewhat antiquated processes for hiring which take longer than necessary.  The workday in some departments is longer than should be, which is a detriment to a balanced life, especially if you have a family.  The people are nice, but there is a lot that can be improved to make it a great place to work."
good,Talk with members on the phone about benefits. Members can get very upset if medical issues were not covered. Stressful from time to time. Professional work environment.
good,"I worked for Aetna at the time it merged with Prudential."
good,There is nothing to tell but at work i was given the opportunity to grow. It is a great company to work for Even though i had to leave Aetna treated me and my coworkers fairly.
good,Utilizing my strong and varied career base to support a strong team in a collaborative environment.  Mutual respect and good communication are important components for me in a work environment.  Work independently and with teams.
good,"Aetna was an adventure.  I knew very little about the health insurance business but in 22 years I learned everything about the industry,  It was often rewarding, but very challenging and demanding."
good,"A typical day at work was never went the same way. It was always either productive with calls coming in at a rapid speed or calls would be dragging so slow and you become bored. I learn how to respect other customer representatives that take my call, because I now know what it's like to be on the other side of the phone and how a professional phone call can be handle no matter the situation. I liked my co-workers. The hardest part about this job was know what department is the call about. I handled benefits, billing, claims and enrollment and I had to listen to  what the call was about and determine what department the call is about. I think if I more time of learning the department as well as the quality and how I would be graded, I think I would enjoyed my time there even more. I enjoyed listening to the members and understanding their troubles with the company and I would always tried to try my hardest to give the best information for the members."
good,Flexible hours and work days at the time was convenient.  Management changed frequently and there was not much room for advancement.  Eventually most of the departments responsibilities were sent overseas.
good,"unfairness in assigning claims, favoritism blatant, non medical personnel directing medical staff in medical issues."
good,I have a great paying job with great hours.  The management does not want to better themselves and thinking outside of the box is really not what is needed from front line employees.
good,"Answering a high volume of calls from providers regarding benefits, claims, billing, appeals and overpayments take backs."
good,Aetna was very busy. Sometimes we needed overtime to get al lthe work done. I was there for 10 + years. Our work was sent elsewhere.
good,At this job I mainly answer the phones and speak with providers about claims for patients as well as insurance verification.  I also speak to patients and members of our insurance program about changes going on with their coverage.
good,"I started as a receptionist and I was transferred to Billing Dept."
good,"People would rather work with broken computers than deal with their abysmal overseas tier 1 ""tech support"", so they either didn't report problems, or they came straight to me as the on site IT person.  Therefore, there weren't enough IT problems to justify having on-site IT staff according to upper management."
good,It is hard to buy into working for a company that provides its own employees the worst available level of product they offer. The insurance they give employees is the equivalent of Coca Cola only allowing their employees to drink New Coke.
good,"As a Customer Service Supervisor the hardest part of the job is to find time to provide feedback to team members. Service expectations can be a little difficult to achieve but not impossible as long as you consistently monitor your team's performance and provide timely feedback. "
good,New management gives the company a bad name. The benefits are good could use better training. Went through 16 weeks of training and 85% of people in my class came out knowing nothing about their job description. After training 5 people quit already. No manager on site and the supervisor lacks knowledge in handling difficult situations.
good,my company was good but i am no stisfied with the I have learned so much things over there.
good,"Worked on niche product with large growth over the past 3 years.  Management has no direction on how to further grow the business, and refuses to add resources to an ever increasing workload."
good,"Meetings galore w/o a clear business objective. "
good,"Back to back calls, a lot of research and problem solving. Mandatory required overtime at last minute notice."
good,"It was very nice to work their, i almost worked for 4 years. Having good Colleague and good relationship with the management. The only reason i left the company is working night shifts."
good,"Researched daily payments as part of managing a $5M book of business making sure funds were allocated correctly."
good,the trainers and employees were nice and very easy to work with. trainers were knowledgeable which made my job a lot easier. It was a peace of mind knowing that I had the guidance I needed to suceed
good,"During the merger with US Healthcare, life at the office was in a complete disarray!  Everyone had to reapply for their own position.  Benefits were taken away, sales tactics were unethical, to say the least. However, the strong arm tactics worked, and sales topped the charts during that time. Employees did what they were told, made their quotas or else they lost their jobs.  No middle ground."
good,Hectic work environment with micro management. Culture very tense.
good,"Making calls all day, haven't learned a thing. Management doesn't have all the answers, co-workers are great. Hardest part of the job is the repetitiveness of the job. Most enjoyable part is that I receive a nice paycheck and decent benefits."
good,"A typical day is writing contracts, amending contracts. Working with suppliers building relationships"
good,"Benefits and compensation are very good and the opportunity for advancement is also present, if you don't mind being a number. The work is mentally taxing and goals for bonus are nearly unattainable. Be good at your job, but only within in the specified rules and time restrictions. A great place for some people, was not for me."
good,The job is easy. They do well with making it a comfortable environment. In my department you come as you are. The challenges here is sales. The downfall is the leadership.
good,"Great co-workers can use as a resource. A typical day at work is to sign in, take calls, use all available resources to handle calls in a timely manner. The culture is mostly laid back. The hardest part of the job is not being able to tell elderly they are approved."
good,"I was hired to provide information on prescription drugs. Halfway through training, that changed to doing Parts A-B & D (found out later at least 2 classes ahead of me went through the same thing)."
good,"Overall very productive. Nice cafeteria with perks for employees, benefits, company 401 k match. Mostly lots of tasks needed to be done including answering 30+ calls. high volume."
good,"High stress, base pay insufficient for the amount of work needed to be done in this role, large company but the call center setting is micro managed, lots of on the job trainings"
good,It was a learning experience working for Aetna I learned a lot from there and I took a lot with me and it has help in my journey with other things and working with people
good,"Professional, clean organized work environment that promoted strong team an leadership goals high energy diverse work force that consisted of various people.  However, complaints and appeals department offers less opportunities with no incentive to move forward."
good,It’s a good company but needs to train it’s employees better. The training they have now is ineffective and does not lead to success. And the pay does not make up for the stress that the job creates.
good,Aetna is always looking for the next best thing. Mergers with this company or another. It is  great place to work with so many great employees but I think they need to value the employees more.
good,"HR policies are restrictive towards advancement. In order to advance and keep up with current pay scale across the industry, you will need to leave Aetna. They cap the pay range you are allowed to advance within regardless of qualifications."
good,I was on a contract and was told I may have a permanent position only to be told my assignment is ending in a couple days. They keep temps on for months with empty promises of becoming permanent.
good,"Required Mulit-state Licensure, work at home position enabled great work-life family balance. Most enjoyable part of the job being able to connect with members nation wide."
good,"Things changed, more and more work was outsourced offshore.  Felt less and less valued as time went on.  A lot of pressure on management, which of course trickles down."
good,"American Health Holding a subsidiary of Aetna is a 3rd party Medical Precertification Company.  Call center atmosphere, mostly filled with unprofessional people who would not find a higher paying role elsewhere.  My specific manager was great but upper management does not hold people accountable and the inmates for the most part run the asylum.  Heavy turnover rates, so they are afraid to say anything about poor performance and attitudes of employees for fear of them leaving.  Unable to tolerate the unprofessional atmosphere so I gave notice and left the company.  You are punished for calling in sick because of the type of people that work there call off whenever they choose, so you are punished for genuinely being ill or if you have a family emergency.  "
good,Aetna can be a great place to work depending on the department.  There are a lot of really wonderful people who work there.  It feels like a very different company post-Cvs acquisition.
good,"friendly environment, friendly staff. It’s a job with great pay, just feels real “dead end”. Repetitive . Not much assistance from managers . No one on one meetings."
good,"If you are looking for a great starting place to establish a career then, Aetna is the place. This is where the company excels. You are provided with excellent training to assist with your discipline and communication skills. After 4-5 years you will most likely have to move on."
good,it was ok. management is all for self. Aetna would be great if they had better managers. They have great people working for them. if you treat your workers better.
good,"Fun place to work, there is a lot of activities to get involved with, to keep it exciting, The company has good training provided, and a good workplace environment."
good,"They need to hire qualified, experienced managers. not people with no backround or experience managing people in the dept. Its all in who you know there .Mgt never appreciated the hard work of their employees"
good,"Its an okay company to work for, if you are looking for complacency. Not much opportunity for growth. Pay is decent, not many raises given and when given are small."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working Aetna. I liked being able to come in at 6:30 and leaving at 3:00 daily. I also liked the fact that the work was self proclaiming."
good,job was good but just stressful and i was 45 minutes to an hpur away from my child where i didnt have the help i needed it. the times to work was not flexable at all.
good,Management structure is complex and not great. Coworkers are nice and supportive. Tasks are very repetitive and not much room for advancement in career.
good,"worked extra hours so I could reach production goals.  Unit poorly managed.  Overall, Aetna is a good place to work as salary is fair, benefits could be better and good personal time off policy."
good,"Great place to work. Advancement is hard to achieve. Promotions are with dealt with who you know, not what you know. Benefits are great. Overall, Great place to start."
good,Environment is great...great supervisor  and manager but training and daily workflow need help...long hours due to documentation and requirements ...........................................
good,fast-paced work environment; one needs to be results oriented; laid-back relaxed atmosphere; little or no chance of moving up the ladder; poor management;
good,I choose not to participate in the online surveys. I feel that it is not needed to provide your actual thought on a previous employer to actually submit an application.
good,Great manager and support team but over worked for compensation paid. Case loads are very high and are unmanageable. Great environment and great group of people to work with.
good,"Management is terrible, job security is nil, but while you're here the benefits and salary is great and the work life balance is great as well. People tend to come and go with constant restructures and redundancies."
good,"There are a lot of things that every company has to work on in order to continue to grow. This company is a great place to start, learn, & grow. I’m not sure of the ability to grow within the company but at minimum you will learn new skills"
good,It is a great company but doesn't recognize great employees. I love working their work is great management is great. The promotion process is not all that great
good,"This job was quick paced and there was always work to be done. The employees are friendly and it is a good environment. Overall, it was very disorganized and understaffed."
good,"Not a united company at all, not enough employee recognition and appreciation, hiring process is very lengthy and very minimum job security. Good stars to get you where you headed within your career in the medical Insurance business"
good,I worked with two great techs and the customers were really nice. My only complaint that Insight Global's manager's were not supportive or backed the techs at all.
good,long and stressful I would not recommend working here.  You will be promised opportunity for advancement and meet all of your goals just to be consistently stuck on the phones taking calls.
good,"Management needed a lot of help but did not get help from their leadership. During the acquisitions, there was a major lack of communication that filtered down to the front line staff. The covered parking was nice."
good,"usually do the same thing everyday typical routine"
good,"They are trying to accommodate more so than other places, however they still have a long way to go. I work for a subsidiary of Aetna. The base pay is better than most places I have worked in sales. However, the management is what is driving people away. More than anything the training is so unorganized and informal. The company is in its third year and things are still chaotic. You are allowed to bring your kids to work with you on occasion and for emergencies. They try to balance work and life, but while you are at work its stressful and micromanaged quite a bit."
good,"Basically a typical day in the IT field at Aetna, you will learn something new everyday. It has a flexible WAH schedule which was very convenient for parents."
good,No one seemed to know what was going on. No direction. Inconsistent treatment among staff. No one in the office ever smiled. My team itself was good to work with but some had zero oversight and took advantage of that. Poor leadership from the top down.
good,Need more job security I have learned a lot since I have been there for the past 2 years. It’s jist with all of the changes that have happened since September of 2017 you just never know when you or your department will have cuts.
good,"I liked working at Aetna and my supervisor was the best she was always there to help me when I needed help with any claims that I needed to know about. I loved the people that worked with but at Aetna, it was a Big turn around with people leaving the company and them trying to keep people there to work because of their attendance policies."
good,"My main assignment was to assist, coordinate, create/develop applications directly associated with Investment Management.  Ultimately was advanced to Manager responsible for 2 teams of programmers supporting Investments and Pensions Departments at Aetna."
good,"I love the job when I first started but I got easily bored maybe it was due to the repetitive nature of the job or because it was a work from home position. Overall, it is a good place to be in."
good,Things are changing drastically in the company and not for the better in my opinion.  Advancement opportunities are available to selected individuals who keep themselves in the spotlight. Felt my talents were underutilized.
good,"The highest levels of management in CT are top notch.The company is an industry leader and is well respected. The culture is one of change, be ready for constant change. The opportunity of working from home is a great benefit."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job were wonderful colleagues to work with
good,"Workforce was very positive, very high speed type of job, learned good communication skills along with good customer service, had varied shifts to cover multiple time frames"
good,"Lots of perks and options for improving your health, however, all was to be done on your own time.  Company time strictly for working, which involved a lot of sitting, working on the computer, and managing tiny details.  The opposite of what a wellness coach preaches to their clients."
good,Enjoyed the peering and staff relationships.  Work was excellent and load was as expected for the level of the position. Recommended workplace for those in independent contributor level.
good,"Autonomy and ability to work long hours required.  Must be able to meet timelines and redirect at a minutes notice."
good,"I work with the Medicaid population of WV, VA and MD.  Aetna is a MCO for the state of WV.  MCO stands for Managed Care Organization.  We manage the daily care of the Medicaid population."
good,Management is difference from one service line to another.  High turnover creates difficult working conditions with constant new hires and training while picking up the slack for others.
good,"Nice environment, always new things to learn just not enough notice on changes and the communication between management and staff was lacking. But I loved my co-workers we worked well together and we got the job done."
good,Aetna was a good place to work.  There was so much change during my time there the company at the time didn't seem to have any direction.  That seems to have changed.
good,A typical day at Aetna begins with providing the excellent customer service to our members. I have learned the basics for ensuring we provide excellent service to career advancements with helping run a department in the organization.
good,Required overtime is hard to manage when my schedule changes on a monthly basis...so the worth like balance is my biggest concern at this time when it comes to aetna
good,"Aetna was a fun, stressful, educational place to work.  Aetna was always growing and changing which made the job exciting.  Management was fair.  Although working at home was great it was hard answering call after call with no breaks in between calls and being monitored."
good,I am currently an Trainer for the company. The management team that I work for is great. The job I do is rewarding but their are not enough advancement opportunities.
good,"My experience at Aetna was diverse and challenging, which allowed me to expand my experience and confidence rapidly."
good,I had an opportunity to explore the APAC region Health Insurance scene. The hardest part of the job was dealing with resistant to change but the rewards came from stakeholders who are open to support and cooperate for enhancement activities to address the gaps.
good,"Due to missed documentation and audits, as well as their processes, the team I worked with was not compliant with State and Federal law. There was a lot of catch up work to be done"
good,"Nice place to work.  The teams are easy to work with.  I enjoy my work, no day is ever the same.  I have a great team and boss. I find people to be very friendly. We are busy so stress levels can be high at times."
good,"fast paced culture"
good,After training we were still kind of lost and was just sent on our own. Everyday going into work I had no idea what I was doing and felt as if I was not processing claims correctly.
good,Aetna was a very fast paced place to work with answering calls and paying claims at the same time. It was very rewarding to hear the customer at the end of the call thank you for the help you had provided.
good,"Stressful , understaffed in certain depts. Has been this way since I started and don't see it getting any better. They also stopped the WAH program which deferred a lot of new hires from coming."
good,"As the biggest private managed health care company in the US and the world, it rang a bell and was easier to convince corporate clients to be served by Aetna Philippines. Unfortunately, the company folded after about 3 years of operation allegedly due to losses allegedly due to poor persistency of the life insurance part. It was sold by the mother company to ING, which eventually sold the HMO to Philamcare."
good,"not a bad place to work. you are on the front line of calls. some are easier than others. when problems arise, one cannot even do simple things to correct them"
good,"Led efforts to Identify hundreds of Aetna members’ specific healthcare service issues, found solutions and implemented resolution while working with other departments. Collaborated with account managers team and acted as liaison between management and new clients to answer questions or concerns regarding company healthcare policies for international clients who are traveling abroad"
good,Case management is a rewarding career although you never meet the members face to face. Helping people find resources to make their lives and health better is a wonderful feeling. I learned how to listen to what people say and not just their vital signs. The hardest part is when you build a relationship with a member and family and they pass away.
good,"As with many corporations, the staff were amazing to work with but the senior management is out of touch and does not support a work/life balance. You're expected to kill yourself without much recognition."
good,"The segment of the company you are in determines work life balance, pay, and job satisfaction. Management plays a huge part in your progression in the company. If you work for good management, you will love your job and afforded all the great opportunities Aetna has. If you get the wrong management, you could get stuff under their old school politics and not be allowed to participate in company benefits."
good,"Aetna has great compensation"
good,"overall good company to work for, Customer Service, High Volume call center. answering a lot of questions about claims. Benefits were not the best, not that cheap and high deductibles."
good,"There is not a lot to say. Has been a good job, I just need a change. Coventry was bought by Aetna, making it a very large company. This can be good or bad. I miss the smaller company that felt like family."
good,Management was very careless .training newcomers was the worst . its not face 2 face its over a speaker phone. It was always an overload of incorrect information
good,Aetna offered decent pay and a unique working environment for their employees. It was difficult to schedule doctor appointments when needed due to scheduling conflicts.
good,"In the beginning things were good, then management started leaving, supervisors left and were not replaced, at times we felt alone. But through team work and working together we managed to get through open enrollment."
good,"the latest trend with Aetna is hiring friends or relatives by the management. Some professionalism is lost in the process.Benefits are mediocre, no coffee/tea at all."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is speaking to members/providers and being able to resolve their issues that they may have.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to resolve the said issue and feeling helpless.
good,The Inbound Queue Representative position is very demanding and stressful.  Working from home meant freedom and flexibility and was the best part of the job.
good,"Good place to start to obtain experience in the pharmacy field, especially in the Specialty Pharmacy field. Personal opinion that the office in Orlando Florida needs a stronger middle management group."
good,"Too demanding with little support from upper management. Compensation is nice, but not worth it. Nice building, nice location, benefits are just ok."
good,"Case loads are high, job is salaried so no overtime paid. Work many hours past regular worktime. Great supervisor but upper management does not communicate changes until last minute. Not given a chance for any input as to workflow."
good,Answer calls from employers groups regarding enrollment and billing issues. Co-workers were nice  the hardest part of job was constant changing of policies most enjoyable part of the job was schedule flexibility.
good,"a typical day is taking calls in a call center setting, resolving cellular issues, activating pagers and long distance inquires and billing issues. The manage was a nice person and very professional.  It was 5 of us in the call and we all worked very good with each other.  There was no hard part to the job, very easy.  The most enjoyable part was learning."
good,"Enjoyed working with providers and some co workers. Co workers who have been there for years to comfortable, lazy and not productive. Hardest part of the job working with know it all nurses who are lazy and don't want to do their jobs. Most enjoyable part of the job is incentives and being able to work from home."
good,"Start my work day as soon as my children leave to school (730AM). I have my work space with a desk and work lap top. I make a few calls a day to vendors, Aetna office or broker to coordinate health events or resolve any issue.  My manager is a little bit hard to work with but due to my calm personality we get along. Most of my co-workers are like friends since I have been in this company for over 16 years. Hardest part of my job is ... nothing really since I love what I do. I do not see myself doing something different, but sometimes change is good."
good,"A typical day at work I will take various calls from refill requests to members needing clarification of their plans of their pharmacy benefits. I've learned how to use all of my abilities to help the customers to the fullest of my knowledge utilizing systems like ASD, PeopleSafe, and Caresource. I enjoy my management, I feel like I've had a pretty good relationship with all of my supervisors as they seem to always try and help to their fullest extent. I love my co- workers. It really is like a big family, It's nice to have a close relationship with coworkers too to be able to cheer on their success in the company! The hardest part of the job is when members need a lifesaving medication that they can either not afford or isn't covered under their plan. Not necessarily because it's hard to relay that information but because being a person myself I realize that things do come up unexpectedly and that it can sometimes be difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I am able to full resolve a members reason for calling, especially if it's something that they have been dealing with for a while now."
good,"I worked second shift with people who were in a similar life situation.  We were all mothers with young children who wanted to keep our children out of a daycare environment.   Benefits were fantastic, pay was okay."
good,A typical day at work consist of answer calls within a very high call volume. The company gives you a script and training in how to handle customers via telephone. Management is generally professional with some exceptions. The hardest part is the mental stamina to answer potentially hundreds of calls per day. The most enjoyable part of the day is getting a call from an earnest customer seeking help and the satisfaction of knowing you could resolve an issue.
good,The company is great but I am not ready to spend the rest of my life attatched to a headset.
good,"Aetna is a fast paced working enviroment, on a typical day you are -expected to handled between 70-80 calls during the busiest season, most of the day is spent on the phones, except for breaks and lunches, calls come in one right after the other and they are a mix of benefit and claim inquiries."
good,"I work from home. Day starts at 8 am:"
good,I worked at Aetna for a short period only due to a family issue. But the time I was there I enjoyed learning opportunity to learn healthcare in the insurance industry.  It was full time M-F no weekends.
good,"As a Sr. Account Service Rep, I was the Single Point of Contact for over 150 Corporate accounts. "
good,Members call to under there benefit and I provide the understanding they expect by breaking down how their courage works
good,"Process medical claims  for BP, average 10 medical claims per hour."
good,"I had a manager that was amazing, caring, organized, actively participated in my growth with the company and in general made working more fun than work, at least it felt that way.  All was great until a reduction of the company reached our department, the person responsible for this reduction had her facts incorrect despite my managers attempt to educate and correct her in many meetings and other communications.  The various levels and degree of mistakes throughout a course of the year ended up painfully postponing the transition of the work to a vendor in addition to costing the company I am sure a large sum of money and several jobs that could have been held by established staff (12 years and/or more) that were supposed to be transitioned within the organization.  "
good,"Aetna was a good company to work for because of the co-workers.  Upper management was clueless many times on the workings of the call center.  "
good,There isn't a typicle day at Aetna.
good,I was in this department for only a yr as a temp employee. I enjoyed the position because it thought me responsibility and it gave me a feel for the working enviroment in an office enviroment setting.
good,I worked in this department for 10 yrs and I enjoyed working for them. I enjoyed working with the people in my department. I made some good friends and the job also taught me a lot of responsibility. The last yr and a half was difficult because of management changes and the hiring of management that did not understand the job. It became difficult to work in that enviroment.
good,"Struggling to compete like all managed care companies, great people, tough to advance; pretty traditional"
good,"Typical day would include the management of multiple assessments which are to provide confirmation of project scope, IT impacts and ROM estimates. Each project assessment involves facilitating sessions with all business SME to drill down on and clarify business needs. Conduct review of project needs with IT partners to identify IT impact and provide high level project costs. Presentation to Sr Mgt of overall expected project cost and impact to be used for budgeting, forecasting."
good,"Designing products for the small group (employers with 1 to 50 employees). Reviewing regulations, developing competitive products and working with pricing to ensure price points are profitable."
good,"Good team to work with as customer service reps ,Handling inbound calls from members"
good,"Aetna Contracted ACS to provide Tech-support for Aetna Insurance holders, or for Wellness programs. Most of the employees were undisciplined didn't really no what good customer service was. But things roll down hill, a couple of good employees, management doesn't guide the ship with balance."
good,I have had the opportunity to go to India twice and train reps in claims and rework. I have also had the opportunity to train stateside and hold classes for review of claims.
good,The company is good for pay as and benefits but the management leaves much to be desired. New management did not know how to help you and understand the concept of the financial and statistical errors.
good,I did have the opportunity to work from home immediately but I had a virtual Case manager to work with me and guide me through training. This was not a very pleasant experience
good,Aetna is a good company that is currently going through a transition after being purchased by CVS Health. Upward or even lateral mobility is still up in the air.
good,I enjoy working with the staff  at Aetna the environment is low key and satisfactory and fast paced some days. Otherwise productive and every day is a learning experience
good,"Work life balance, telecommuting out of an office at home to members all over the contry, must have quiet work spacewith high speed internet with ethernet"
good,"Aetna/CVS is not an ethical company. They are greedy as most insurance are and treat Medicare customers horribly. Sales team lies.to get people on Medicare. It broke my heart "
good,"Aetna is a wonderful company to work for, if you have a competent manager.  The work/life balance allows for work at home. Several department had layoffs once the Disability Division merged with a different company, CVS bought the Health Division."
good,"Provided excellent customer service by answering customer questions about disability and leave"
good,40 hour work week with benefits. Management not great and inconsistent culture in Specialty division compared to Mother Aetna. Reccomnend change in leadership .
good,"Good company but merger changed things for the worst.  Good support from management.  Benefits were good.  Aetna helps you try to have a better life, health, and career."
good,I have learned a lot about insurance as well as customer service.  This is a great place to enter into the workforce if you are transitioning careers into an office environment.
good,"Great place to work but if you seek advancement opportunities  and want to grow within the company. I would probably seek employment elsewhere. I enjoyed my interactions with every single employee that I spoke with at Aetna and all staff as well. There are some really great people there. The environment was fun but professional and I felt everyone was on the same page and there to a great job and work hard for the company as well as management. "
good,I was a pleasant place to work. I would recommend it as stepping stone to enter the Health Insurance environment. The training was excellent. The training assisted me getting other jobs in the field.
good,I am not interested in completing this survey regarding my previous employer. I do not think it a good idea to have reviews of your previous employers
good,"The environment can get kind of gossipy at times but it gets a whole lot better if you're able to met your metrics, have a good supervisor and get the ability to work remotely from home."
good,"The pay and benefits provided by this company are phenomenal, however, the poor work environment and lack of effective management make it a less than favorable place to work."
good,"I worked for Voluntary under the Aetna umbrella. There was no organization with job roles, expectations, how it was being ran. Ask a question- get 20 answers and the manager says ""technically each are correct"". Constant changes to how things are to be done with no communication."
good,"Been with this company for 12 years, learned a lot about health care guidelines and given the opportunity to promote first call resolution to the customers."
good,I dint really have anything to say especially not 150 characters worth.I am just writing in here so I can submit this and move on to looking for new jobs
good,"Aetna does treat it's employees well. Good management, good benefits, fairly stable and long-term stability. However, lacks in innovation or creativity. A bit monotonous."
good,Management communication nit as effective as needed for the employees on the front lines. Constant change with minimal support. Good team support. Goals for employees set but not always acheived.
good,I don't want to answer the questions. Please let me continue on with out any answer to this question.   No response No response No respons No response
good,"It was a normal place to work.  People were good to work with.  Area was dangerous to drive in and area was very dirty and polluted.  The job itself was satisfactory, but the contracting company I worked for took to much for themselves and made it hard to survive in such an expensive place to live."
good,Required a lot of extra hours. Required more and more cases per day to be completed.  Offered work from home positions.  Co-workers supported each other.  They provide a break room.
good,Management needs help. They were never around and didn't seem to understand the duals for Medicaid and Medicare program. Then they hired people with no medical background that also didn't understand how to talk to patients about their healthcare.
good,Hard to work there if you have a heart very stressful yelled at all the time. No accountability. Everyone passes the buck. Systems shut down a lot. Claims are s joke
good,Not for the faint at heart. Helps if you have prior knowledge in healthcare but not required. Great people to work with but it does require a lot perseverance phone call after phone call. Learned a lot from the workplace.
good,"Good place in overall, work culture was good, benefits good. Merged with CVS now. Learned a lot, good people, ready to help and take you to next level, will be great."
good,"It was my first civilian job and it was my first time out of a uniform. I loved each day problem solving. They took a chance on me and with the Learning Center I was able to take courses relates to AGILE, SIX SIGMA, DMS, SOP's, bill look ups, AdHoc reporting, CORE IBM and ETQ."
good,Relaxed work environment. The dress code was really great. Very casual. Managers were very friendly and there was a real sense of being on a team. Could improve training though.
good,"Great place to learn about healthcare - lots of opportunities to have an impact"
good,"AETNA would be a great place to work if there were more communication between the manager and the employee. The managers half the time were not told about changes till the last minute. Policy and procedure were changed and updated constantly. Depending on what supervisor you had, was the the way the information was presented. There was no break to review policy and learn the procedure. You were monitored all the time and half the time the monitors did not know new rules and procedures. You were counted on everything. If you had a call drop it was a ding against you. You were always worried about whether you were going to get wrote up. There was no job security. No advancement opportunities either unless you were hired as a manager."
good,The productive and fun work environment. Everyone was friendly and helpful and Teamwork. I would love to work there again if my project did not end...
good,Very stressful environment not paid enough for all the work you do. Supervisors and Managers are all about self it’s ok for them to be sick or their family but when it comes to yours they don’t care expect you to show empathy to their Medicare members but they don’t show any empathy to you
good,fun to work there and is little challenging. They have lots of great incentives to help push and drive the agent to give the best performance they can give.
good,"remote work was very convenient, the cost cutting as a result of the acquistion by cvs was unfortunate for people like me, hopefully too much more cost cutting on the aetna side does not occur.  overall was a decent experience."
good,the training can be intense as long as you write it down and are listening in class you should be good. when you are out on the phones is a lot less stressful.
good,"I was only a customer service representative, and if you have no aspirations to do anything more, it's not a bad job. When I left Aetna was in a continuous state of merging with other companies, new policies were dropped on us all the time without any care for implementation. It was stressful, and they put tons of work on you the longer you're there without any additional compensation. If you plan to move up, it's not terrible, but don't stay in the same position too long or you will find yourself doing substantially more work than your coworkers for not much more pay."
good,It was ok. Jug ohh and I just feel like bam if you can’t go to Bella Niches then where the heck can you go! If you was beefing at the wedding then you should I bring ahaha
good,"This is a place where you can get your foot in the door. They love to hire young people. The job as a call rep can be very demanding and sometimes hard to do, but the staff try to make it better by providing events and activities."
good,You must be able to keep up with productivity and quality.  Their system is very quirky so get all the help you can and try to keep errors to a minimum or you will get let go.
good,I love the members and the work that I do but feel that employees are sometimes not fairly given opportunities based on their performance so that needs improvement.
good,"work from home was convenient. Student Health division very competitive, sales were tough because Aetna's pricing was high making rentention tough.  Helped to establish an implementation process and training for Sales and Client Services."
good,Aetna health care company has changed over the years.  The company also offers benefits and perks which is pretty good. I wish there was an easier way to advance within the company.
good,management was terrible     all they would do is write up people   could never take time off   training was 4 weeks which was definitely needed      changed locations 3 times
good,Great vacation time. Many work at home options. Great people. Not the most qualified supervisors. Nice offices. Very in depth on the job training classes.
good,"I was excited to work for Aetna, however I worked for an outside agency, and feel my experience was limited.  I was hired under a job title that was literally irrelevant to the work I was being trained for.  I  feel they embellished the title, in order to attract more applicants, and I found it to be deceptive.  Most of the regulars worked from home, and for the most part, seemed to be pretty satisfied with their jobs.  I would recommend working for them directly, and not through an agency."
good,"When I first started working at Aetna, I enjoyed it. I had great colleagues and a great supervisor. However, as the years went on company policies and demands changed the dynamic of the company and things started to go down hill. The quality of service provided to our members plummeted. The turn over rate with new employees were high, because frankly our job responsibilities and metrics compared to our pay compensation was unfair. I would walk out stressed almost everyday due to taking back to back calls of irate members who were unhappy with there policies and some of the features that we offered, which most of the time were not helpful. I'm great at problem solving but when you have to deal with over 50% of calls this way, everyday it can be a bit much. Over-all Aetna is a great company but the call center needs much improvement."
good,Great place to work but ever changing which is normal but they should stop making changes that work to something that dies not work in hindsite for the members!!!!
good,I learned a great deal about Medicare and about coding.  Good co-workers.  Bonuses were given for exceeding the minimum work requirement.  Recognition given for error-free work.
good,"It is a good company to work, I learned very good information regarding medical field. The benefits claim processing and regulations. There was a good culture when I was employed currently I cant say the same especially the recruiting department."
good,"ok  place to work, i worked a home. i was resaposibse for having my coiuputer fixed if anything wdenty  wrong.  Miy manager was a horrible witvh iw nevre want again"
good,"Handling back to back calls"
good,"I did the mail, the research for management for difficult accounts needing back ground. I took on additional job duties to learn all the possibilities of knowledge I could obtain."
good,"I worked from home, so I'm not sure of how things worked in the office.  I like working for the company. I like being able to work from home and make my own schedule."
good,I worked for Aetna as a Temp. and was there less than 8 months. But it seemed like a good company to work for and I liked the Supervisor. I would have stayed if I did not receive a full time job offer for another company.
good,Co-Workers made the job very enjoyable and doable. Our team worked in modules of six and each module worked together as a unit to help and support each other complete their work sufficiently.
good,"I liked working there. It was a big company and lots of room to grow. But being that I have a kid and would occasionally have to leave work because I’m a single mom, it threatened my job."
good,Day to day varies every call has a different situation.  Learning new methods on each call.  Maintaining customer service warm transfers and giving as much information to members as possible.
good,"They understand that people have lives outside of work, and that these lives might sometimes impinge on (or even take over) their time and attention. They realize that allowing for some work-life give and take means not only that they won’t waste time and money on unnecessary turnover, but that they’ll build loyalty and commitment. They know it’s give and take, not give or take."
good,"take phone calls from providers, insurance companies and patients for specialty medications. Obtain authorizations for specialty medications, get them ready to be shipped out to patients or providers."
good,"I left due to better pay, job was stressful and management was inconsistent, preached continuously on quality but calls were timed which in some cases was not the best practice for customers and employees."
good,"In any job there are pros and cons. I didn't really care for the position I was in because I felt the training was weak and there was a lot of favoritism which is poor in the work area. Although there are not a lot of practical examples and role playing the training could be longer and interchangeable with on the floor experience with a permanent employee while working with the training group. "
good,No comments about company at this time. Too much change since I started. I went from Coventry to Aetna to now CVS. Each company drives the business different. Change is not always good
good,"While the compensation and benefits package are pretty good, the onboarding process was lacking. Was told 12 weeks orientation, but was on my own after week 3. Its called the 'ramp up"" period where they rapidly increase your workload to see if you can handle it."
good,This was a consulting contract. Transition was occurring and I was responsible for creating the process and structure for more efficient work flow. There were 8 work groups that needed to be reorganized.
good,"As contract work there is little chance you have option to move to full time permanent worker. The supervisor's are not engaged in working with teams, there is a need for more options for movement into another position.  There is no real professional support to help you learn your job."
good,"It was difficult at times to work within the large corporation and their decision to downsize on quick notice. However, I did enjoy the work and choose to related out of the state of ND."
good,Aetna is a great company or at least they have the intentions to be. Their problem is promoting people who do not have management skills. Yes someone who has put in years into a company deserves something but management is a big job and not everyone deserves that. When you have managers that do not understand the skills it takes to lead you create a mess. Their training isn't too well in some positions I have been in with them. I moved to different departments to see if I could get that real life values they say they hold and all were a no go. I made it a goal to get into Aetna at one point in my life due to their values but it was a dream.
good,"Very pleased with the company and the opportunities available. Enjoyable, hard work but very filling. Billing for Medicare Supplement policyholders. Adhere to HIPPA and federal regulations."
good,"It is a good company. Working here is ok . It is not that great. Mostly management has to change rather technical. Lots of racism."
good,"Good place to work, good sense of cultural diversity and inclusion. Team oriented and allows opinions to be considered. Good company to grow a solid career with."
good,"Very stressful place to work was always worried every year, twice a year that they did layoffs that you were going to be one of the ones that were going to be cut. The only thing good was being able to work from home."
good,"Initially there was an on-site manager for the workgroup but there was approximately three months with no manager at all. Once this omission was discovered, the only managers were off-site. The entire structure has changed since I left the company so my information and experience is quite outdated."
good,I was only employed there for a short time on a temporary assignment but it was a great experience and i was looking forward to growing with the company
good,"Fast paced and somewhat stressful.  The location was too far from my home. Over an hour commute."
good,Upper management is not good at this company.  They allow favoritism and is racist. This company conducts surveys and don't listen to the feed back. The survey is a waste of time.
good,"Aetna supports professional development and offers a good work/life balance. My area involves meeting a lot of deadlines, and most of the time people are understanding and easy to work with given that reality."
good,Overall OK - The company has good brand recognition and strong leadership but difficult to advance career across different areas.  Work/life balance is a struggle.
good,Answered customer calls resolved issues for customers.  Do not take what customers can sometimes say when they are upset personally.  Management was knowledgeable.  Could be stressful.  The most difficult part of the job is when I had to tell insured's the services they needed were not covered.  Providing the results that the insured's were looking for was the most rewarding part of the job.
good,Great company to work for with many opportunities to advance. Flexible scheduling as well as swing shifts. Competitve salary and benefits packages offered.
good,Aetna has a relaxed but professional work style.  I learned a lot about the healthcare field while working with it's providers with contract compliance.
good,Sedentary work...would reccomend getting a gym membership.  Overall I like the people I worked with.  Some of the managers and Doctors were difficult to work with..but most were pleasant..
good,"A whirlwind environment during benefit season (Sept - Nov).  I joined the organization not long after Aetna acquired US Healthcare and there were significant obstacles to deal with as a result.  The job demanded extra hours, significantly so during benefit renewal season but the extra hours proved rewarding come bonus time."
good,"Did not listen to our concerns, horrible benefits for employees. No sickleave, had to use your vacation and you were given points against your record if you did have to call in"
good,"Learned many things over the years, better collaboration, great team work, some data analysis."
good,Work started 7am daily. I would work my regular queue unless work was low. I was cross trained so I knew multiple queues including mail room work. If there was something I needed help with there was someone there to assist me. My manager wasn't the best but I had a great supervisor that balanced the ship. My was filled with all different types people but we all got along well. There was a quota that we needed to so we would have little competitions.
good,Aetna is not a bad company to work for. I do wish the benefit packages were better for employees. Also their is limited career advancement opportunities
good,"The majority of staff are nurses, doctors and support clerks; most all of them enjoy helping members stay or get healthy. Management gets too busy reorganizing frequently - they forget to connect with the people who know the customer."
good,"Overall, the atmosphere was stressful, but they had great benefits! My co workers were awesome, but management was not helpful at all. At times I felt like they only had the title and never lived up to their position within the company."
good,great company to work for over all. they really take care of there employees. this company also gets involved in the community so there are opportunities to volunteer as well.
good,Good place to work if you are interested in call center work. Good opportunities to advance or transfer after being there a year. Quality managers or supervisors were far few and in between. Some senior concierge's knew more than most managers.
good,Benefits include being able to telecommute. Good work-life balance. Management style differs by department but mostly consistent and transparent style of management.
good,Old male-dominated company steeped in mysogeny. Not my style. Still a lot of great people working there at various levels. I really do not want to say more.
good,"The work was tedious but i was paid decently.  I enjoyed the environment i worked in, the people i worked around and my supervisor. I left the company for a better opportunity"
good,The work i did was very tedious but i was paid decently.  I enjoyed my work environment.  I would have remained at the company if I did not find a better opportunity.
good,"Honestly, it's ok i wished things were better. Such as experienced floor reps with the supervisor position so they can relate to their constitutes.Moral boosters should be implemented as well. The back to back calls all day can be stressful at times"
good,"Great place to work save a few buts, but these exist in most places. would refer friends to work here to get in depth knowledge of a complex domain like healthcare while simultaneously making meaningful contributions to the organization."
good,"Aetna is a very large employer. 30,000 or so are employed.  Given the fact they are a large employer you are very much looked at as a number."
good,"the company is great to work for. very flexiable. work from home options. Good benefits. fun work place, but busy. Employee Events, Holiday Parties. PTO."
good,Decline to provide any information about a former employer. This is not ethical. This should not be included or pursued by any job site platform or company.
good,"The company is okay to work with, not much room for advancement or overtime. The starting pay is 16 hr, but you do more then just customer service, they should change the title and pay more."
good,People who work there must be comfortable with sitting at a desk and answering phone calls. If that is not your style than I would suggest searching else where for a position.
good,Long hard work with a stressful team. Needs times work sheet had to be perfect for audit to be high. No two teams completed the work the same so you would get different managers who ran things different. No consistency daily.
good,Good experience while i was there. Made friends and understood the job . Easiest part was the work. Hardest part was to handle the clients. Great Boss and upper management
good,the position at Aetna was a temporary position. I wish I could have stayed an advanced my career. Things in my personal life had gone on so I could not continue my employment there.
good,The best part about working at Aetna is the people. I worked at Aetna for over 30 years and was able to work in a variety in job functions. I left because there was no opportunities to advance in areas that I was interested in.
good,Stressful place to work. Constant changes which there was not alot of training for.  Not always fair when being audited.  Travel there was also not very easy
good,"Great team working on a new product for organization which required employees to learn as they go. My day consisted of being a member of a newly formed team of management who was tasked with promoting the development of the newly employed team consisting of nurses, social workers, and other supportive staff who worked with the Medicaid population in the state of Virginia."
good,Depending on your position at Aetna will determine a typical day of work. I have had stressful experiences but I have also enjoyed several different positions at Aetna.
good,The company was all about learning and advancement. There were numerous training classes and people willing to learn. The hardest part was leaving every day and not knowing if all of the knowledge was absorbed that needed to be learned.
good,handled a case load of aenta members benefits ensured flow of information to appropriate hands read all medical claims process in system also did a lot
good,"I love my members, Love them!  The company is a little more difficult, however, I'm not one to post my opinions in this format.  They simply do not offer part time positions and that is for what I'm looking."
good,Temporary staffed job. The time i spent working at this office was very friendly. They are a much larger office so there wasn't a lot of one on one personal relationships among co workers.
good,Aetna was a progressive place to work at. I was there for ten years and did not mind it. I had to leave due to conflicting hours with family life. Good people there.
good,"It was great working at Aetna. Enjoyed working from home for 5 years, great team, great managers and directors,  flexible hours, easy and complex work days."
good,"The company's recent culture changes includes standardizing jobs to move resources off-shore.  It is no longer a place that rewards hard work and loyalty."
good,"At Aetna i answered calls for medical claims and benefits.  This was a call center job with scheduled breaks and lunches. I was answering call as Coventry, insurance company bought out by Aetna. During my time there, management was constantly change."
good,"This is a high volume call center where you are expected to adhere to metrics and average talk time, all while solving claims issues related to overpayment/underpayment, and give benefits."
good,"My experience at Aetna was great, the training was sufficient . Management was always available. The hardest part of the job was when people called out more work was put on the employees that were there. Most enjoyable part was the family atmosphere."
good,Its ok if call center life is for you. I am looking at different avenues. The workers are great some management can use some work but we all can. overall its a decent place to work.
good,"The people was nice"
good,Very large company that has multiple locations with various departments. Communication between departments is poor which makes harder to perform your job. The intermediate supervisors are fair. Poor benefits. Loved the availability of unpaid time off.
good,"Great downtown location, accessible to public transportation plenty of places to eat for lunch. The office is very relaxed and laid back environment. Just keep to yourself and do your work."
good,A busy day. I worked remotely. Things were always changing.The changes were confusing. No one could give you a straight answer. For an insurance company the health care benefits were awful
good,"Too long ago to really judge. I recall management being helpful, upper management quite helpful and had a solid picture for the vision of the company."
good,Not a lot of training once you're on the floor.  I left when they were going through changes and it seemed quite unorganized.  Enjoyed flexible schedule but that eventually was taken away.
good,"Helpful co-workers.  Overall respectful of each other's talents. Plenty of hard work to do.  Proud of my accomplishments, and able to look back with a sense of pride."
good,A bad manager can ruin a good job. A lot of promotions were based off of friends promoting friends. The training is initially great then becomes subpar. Massive pointless emails and constant changing and unrealistic performance expectations used to deny compensation advancement.
good,"If a customer service representative, you take back to back phone calls all day.  You are always being micro-managed in everything you do, including your breaks.  I had the opportunity to advance, but I turned it down because I telecommuted and the increase in pay wasn't enough to cover my gas to drive to the office.  I have learned many things working at Aetna.  I have also met very many wonderful people that also work there."
good,I learned a lot about the computer and different programs; it helped me in the job that I acquired afterwards. I became the computer educator in the next roll.
good,Was a little stressful processing claims and taking calls and making outbound calls to providers for questions about claims that provider was submitted
good,"Aetna give its employees the option to telecommute which is great for work/life balance.  The management of the company is lacking.  "
good,"Aetna is a nice place to work. The workplace culture is by far the best I have experienced; however, training or the lack thereof is an issue. I would recommend friends to the Aetna."
good,A highly respected competitor in the health insurance industry. Flexibility and a positive attitude as well as a commitment to excellence are highly valued in employees.
good,"Indeed overall has a great culture and policies - work from home/remotely, flexible work hours,awareness for why we need to have tough conversations around inclusion and diversity is in its infancy, we need more structure and training around unconscious bias, ally skills training, etc."
good,jobs that are available at the Aetna call center can vary drastically. anything from processing claims to customer service calls can be applied for and the experience of Aetna's culture differs between positions.
good,Very difficult to perform job properly when did not have enough providers for members in order to provide proper care for the members and their families.  Worked in a Medicaid dept. and it was mainly children and they were suffering due to no providers in area.
good,"Good stable company where it is hard to learn new things. You become stagnant and hard to move up. Daily tasks become repetitive. Managers start micromanaging,and there isn't much you can learn."
good,"not staffed to complete all expected outcome "
good,"A typical day at work involved quick decision-making and the power to make the right call at the right time. "
good,"Strives for work-life balance, commitment to the community and it's members. Fast paced environment. Committed to patient safety and quality. Great opportunities to develop and advance."
good,Half the work was related to customer maintenance while the other half I would say was putting out fires for angry customers. Aetna U.S. Healthcare was as many insurance companies was a bottom line cash related business. This was related to the customers as well as the workers. It always felt like a good second job supplementary income for a family but not a primary income.
good,"The work was very tedious, and you had to constantly deal with upset clients about ever-rising insurance premiums each and every year. The company as a whole is immensely profitable but it didn't necessarily translate into better pay and better benefits for the employees."
good,"Productive and great place to work, encourage employee participation in work and home life great hours. Work place culture was very good and all employees worked and communicated with each other."
good,it was a nice place to work.  my supervisor was terrible.  I enjoyed working from home.  I'm searching for other work from home positions right now.  thx
good,it was at west which now it is alorica idk if they still have it there but when I was there it was there and it was pretty fun environment. not too much bad to say about it
good,"You have production goals to meet, you get audited on your work, does not work with you on needing time off for appts or family issues, I definitely learned from this job, very educational. Don't really have an enjoyable part of the job other than working with good people."
good,It was stressful and sometimes felt unorganized. The supervisors had little time for the employees. At the time I left however the division I worked for was transitioning to a new work system and this led to the stressful situation.
good,"Its a nice place to work. If you are scheduled until 6 you never get time to go to appointments. Nice to have weekends off. All in all great place to work. Stressful. "
good,"Greet team, morning meeting about inventory and plan of action for the day. Review what went well day before and what opportunities we missed. Meet with health plan and go over metrics."
good,Very high stress with little recognition. Supervisors never recognize hard quality work however are quick to point out every negative flaw and mistake made. No work/life balance as employees are expected to work until the job is done. Great PTO benefits however in order to take a day off you must work harder the other days and ensure that nothing is on your list for your day off. Upper management is removed from day to day job and supervisors are stressed out and overworked as well. Great pay and benefits but hard to balance a life outside of work.
good,"I joined the Aetna Medicaid team initially for their more than attractive benefits package that also included a sign-on bonus.  Through my first days of orientation we learned about the company's core values comprised of Integrity, Inspiration, Caring & Excellence.  ""Our values carry through our thoughts and actions every day, inspire innovation in our products and services, and drive our commitment to excellence in all we do.""  "
good,okay place to work for a check. mon -fri paid every two weeks but have high turn  over.30 min lunch the bonus you can earn is not much at all good luck
good,"This job has a high volume of work and requires high quality standards in production and process.  If you like the challenge in an ever changing atmosphere,  with tons of overtime at certain parts of the year then it is your perfect job."
good,"My advise, is get your foot in the door and try to find a better position after one year.  Huge company, opportunities are endless, lots of long time employees."
good,"The position in MLTSS is wonderful, and I get to directly serve members of my home community. Compensation and work/life balance are good, but the health insurance, especially for a health insurance provider, is insulting and, frankly, negligent."
good,"Workloads are typical for case managers, however staff is micromanaged. There isn't very much autonomy in your role. Management has a high turnover rate."
good,"Provide information as it relates to the ever changing business in healthcare in a timely manner. "
good,"It's a good Comany but you will be overworked and if you do better than other employees, you still get around the same raise as them. Bonus potential is good though"
good,Answering calls from members and pharmacies  on coverage and benefits. Handled reordering mail order requests from members. Very micromanaged calls and call handling timeframes. Very unrealistic. Pay was not in line with duties.
good,"Stressful atmosphere, high case load, lots of unpaid overtime required to complete job responsibilities. They have a hard time keeping care managers because of these circumstances."
good,The company itself is great to work for and provides you with some great benefits. The real issue is that half of the people that work there are incredibly rude or do just the bare minimum to get by leaving the ones who work hard with most of the work.
good,There was almost no room for professional advancement. Worked for 15+ years (through mergers and acquisitions) and spent last 9 years in same job without being offered opportunity to move within company.
good,"Mostly average.  Benefits pretty good.  Very good vision coverage.  Flex hours, some work from home jobs.    Professional people and great nurses.  PTO time and 401K plan."
good,"Near the end of my tenure, you were treated as an Employee number.  More concerned with metrics than quality although the company claimed that all of the downsizing was in part to improve quality."
good,"Very good employer. Has good work life balance, and very good benefits. 401K Plan is available, as well as stock purchase plan. The management team understands the future of the health care industry"
good,"Overall it's a pretty good place to work for in an IT organization.  The tough part is being able to stay there as the company has frequent layoffs. Some managers are ok to work for as there is a lot of micro-managing but every so often there is one of those managers that will do all they can to fight for you to stay...all the way up to the point of just not giving up their job. The people in the lowest rung of the organizations are the best part of working there; professional, diverse, creative, willing to help others grow by helping people up verses tearing people down or stepping on people to promote themselves. Some areas of IT are almost at skeleton crew levels with a ""do more for less"" mentality due to the fear of being on the next round of lay offs list.  It is difficult also to make a move from within IT and near impossible if you want to move out of IT and into the Business side of the company. "
good,"training was intense, it was like school, quizzes every wednesday and test every friday. we were thrown on the phones before we were confident. There were people whose job was to walk round and help people with their calls but they were more interested in their conversations and gave attitude when people asked for help or simply ignored them all together."
good,"Researching "
good,Answering 85 to 100 calls per day. I learned the benefits of medical insurance. I learned to manage my time. The hardest part of job was informing the patients they had no medical coverage and the enjoyable part was meeting my goals.
good,"My early years at Aetna were enjoyable,  I loved the people I worked with and for and felt secure in my job.  After multiple realignments and more changes than I could even begin to keep up with, it honestly became a miserable place to work.  I had some great relationships there, but my job became less and less personable with every change.  It became too much to take."
good,Little to no advancement opportunity.Lots of company politics and the pay was not that great. Switching to another healthcare provider I have advanced 5 times in the last 7 years.
good,It was more like a family. Knew a lot of the providers and vendors. Had a great rapport with members as well as upper management. I learned so much about HMO's and PPO's the culture of this type of healthcare.
good,"management was out of touch with culture."
good,I have would answer several phone lines in a professional and timely manner to assist patients that may need a precert for certain procedures based upon their insurance plan they have chosen
good,Fast paced. Learned to multi-task. Handling constant change. Management provided minimal training for new projects. Nursing staff not being used in the most productive ways. Working with members with complex needs.
good,"good, relaxed environment worked at home flexable ,good job, good coworkers, team workers, good managers. good pay, good experience, hours were great, good motivation"
good,"Aetna has a strong brand identity which corresponds to a strong sense of organizational self.  It is well run, with consistent messaging throughout the organization.  Compensation, mid-level management, culture and HQ facilities are all very good."
good,"Like many companies, Aetna is striving to be more consumer focused, as more people purchase health insurance as individuals. Tough place for newcomers, as it's a complicated business and Aetna doesn't invest heavily in training or development."
good,"Aetna was a fast paced environment.  The job was to help customers be able to understand their policies, and if they needed help with a claim to process their claims and work with them on their needs.  The strict schedule of not being able to miss one day in the first three months with no exception was a bit harsh, especially to new mothers.  The people there for the most part were friendly."
good,Aetna is a fast paced environment with constant changes.  Typical day is assisting Part D Team Members with tasks in the Eservice System as well as coordinating meetings and calendar management.
good,"Aetna is a Great company to work  for. Excellent opportunity. Great benefits. "
good,"Worked there for a brief time.  Friendly environment.  A bit unorganized with training program, still trying to improve process with every class.  Great opportunities for advancement within the company."
good,"US Healthcare prior to Aetna's buyout in 1996, was a great company to work for. Management and training were the best industry wide. "
good,"Depending on your job function, it is quite an intense atmosphere to drive cost down. The pressure is on to control healthcare cost. The compensation is very good; job security is iffy as management sees whether or not you were able to save Aetna dollars. If you did, you're in, if you did not, then you are shown the door."
good,I was let go due to two companies merging. I worked for Aetna for 10 years. pros: you could work at home. cons: insurance had a deductible of $1600.00 per person per year.
good,"good company to learn healthcare domain and mainframes,"
good,"Hello,"
good,"very micro managed , jobs is performed by stats, very busy, hetic phnes, very angry members, not polite, workers tend to stumble over other workers to get ahead."
good,Meritain Health is a third party administrator for administering employer health benefits for various lines of business ranging from small members of a captive organization to large national accounts.
good,Some departments are more laid back than others. But overall it's a great place to work no rude coworkers or micromanagers not yet anyways
good,Great job if you get along with supervisor.  Work is a 8 hour a day and a 40 hour week. Work is Monday through Friday. Constant turn overs and changes.
good,"Aetna was a good place to work.  I feel as though the folks that worked for me were rewarded well when doing a great job.  Personally I would go back, if a non management job existed."
good,this company has great benefits to offer there clients in the advantage plans. the plans are easy to understand. great company to work for.
good,this is a place that is extremely strict. the daily goals set for the employees is only for the type of person looking to get into sales. this place was geared toward customer service toward customers and not employees.
good,"Not as diverse as expected. Overall, OK company. Requires alot of sitting which could be bad on the back for some.  A Must be able to except change environment. "
good,"Aetna is a great professional environment with management and staff that is dedicated to improving environment. Great company, flexibile, promotes individual and team growth,"
good,"Aetna is a great company to work for. Once you are in there, promotion within the company is highly encouraged. "
good,"A typical day would start by arriving to work at least 15 minutes prior to scheduled time.  Greet staff all staff with a positive attitude and make myself available to assist anyone at anytime."
good,"I was working  as a sas developer and this project helped me in my interview for  fulltime job. It was a large team , very monotonous work. I am not familiar with their benefits as I was a contractor"
good,"Great company to work for, however not much room for advancement. Hours could be better. The company provided me with excellent training"
good,"I cleaned office, restrooms and conference rooms which includes vacuuming, dusting, wiping tables and emptying trash cans."
good,answering 30-40 calls per day from medicare customers answering their questions about their benefits- and making payments over the phone-and tech support for customers with log in issue-I got along with all my co workers-most enjoyable part was when customers would say thank you for your help- I didnt like the benefits- Deductibles extremely high for employees
good,"I met wonderful people! Very busy place to work and learn. "
good,I work from home.. that's a plus.. just don't feel we are paid enough for the work that we do.. I only have to go in once a month for meetings.. management is pretty cool an lenient.
good,"Nothing at this time, I have already written a review on Aetna and do not wish to further say anything."
good,Working at aetna has been a great learning experience.  I have been able to learn new skill and work closely with providers. The employees are all very friendly and management tries to be as involved as possible with in their group.
good,If you are looking for a temporary position and to learn something new this was great to do.  I enjoyed working with the Quality management team and the experience will help me grow as a nurse.
good,Conduct educational meetings for Medicare recipients in Pittsburgh and surrounding communities. Also did inbound calling and outbound calling to enroll new members. Licensed to sell insurance in PA and WV.
good,"My place of employment has it challenges, but overall the staff and Management always can come together to take of our Patients."
good,"work cafe that was nice and convenient "
good,Assist External/Internal users with their computer systems.  Work to escalate problems to tier 2/3 for further resolution.
good,"The satellite office is really small and laid back. The culture is diverse, although sometimes communications lacked"
good,They had a great training program and the company was operated according to ethical standards of large corporations. It was like working for the government.
good,"This was a call center environment. Though many enjoy this, I did not like to constantly being on the phone. The co workers were great but I was not very fond of the management."
good,Good job if one is seeking flexibility. Does not offer much room for professional development. This position does not offer much autonomy and decision making for the nurse reviewer.
good,"It is a terrible place to work. Broken computers, poor management No training, travel was hours away.and equipment did not function correctly while on site."
good,productive fun place to work good environment many opportunities to advance and grow company has great vision and great people
good,"Reviewed and processed medical, dental and global claims. I was the only person that handled all the spanish claims from Puerto Rico."
good,Cabelas does have really good discounts with working with them and they do start paying pretty high for part time. But the only thing is you can never work full-time there because there is barely any positions available.
good,"Fun work place with a supportive management. Not all about the number but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected"
good,I  enjoyed my time at Aetna. I made a lot of friends. I received a great deal of training that helped me be a productive employee..
good,"Results oriented IT Professional with extensive experience in the Financial Services, Health Care and Property Casualty Insurance industries.  Known for Technical depth and breadth coupled with unique ability to lead diverse Application Development teams that deliver quality and help achieve business objectives.  Builds high performance teams and partners with customers using a collaborative and inclusive style."
good,"Typical is day consist of taking anywhere between 30-70 calls. I have learned various skills such as claims processing, benefits, billing and other medical terminology. I have enjoyed working with my coworkers."
good,The minimum wage pay scale is competitive and there is a lot of room in the company for progression. Management is supportive and your growth and development is based on your own eagerness to progress.
good,Explored and learned about various Aetna group plans. Based on patient info was able to adjust coverage properly. Interesting resolving discrepancies with various patient plans.
good,It was a nice place to work but they sold off their financial department to ING and I left because I did not want to be one of the ones that would be laid off.
good,"The exciting thing about this job is the different things that we are able to do for the members, examples are teaching them how to use our website, giving them estimates on their different procedures and contacting their providers for them if they have issues with their claims. The hardest part is not being able to interact with my peers. The most enjoyable part is speaking with our members."
good,It's the place for you if you like computer and data entry work. Management helps you see all the details about the job; There's good training; and you'll always find interesting people to work with.
good,Great place to work. Systems used on a daily basis need to be updated. Many opportunities for growth within organization.
good,A typical day at work is constant change.  What I learned is everything changes.  Management is not in tuned with the workers.  My co-workers were nice people.  Hardest part of the job was everyday changes.  Most enjoyable part of the job was pay day.
good,I learned a lot about handling time sensitive items and how to prioritize my daily workload while meeting a tight deadline.
good,At Aetna US Healthcare I assisted customers with claims on their insurance. Helped them to understand their bill as well as their benefits.
good,"Some good people, however  they continue to outsource and have up to 2 lay-offs (4th qtr & 1st qtr)  a year. Not much growth available for a developer."
good,"they had good benefits at the time. In the time I worked there, we had 5 bomb threats. When you deny people's health insurance claims they can become very angry."
good,Very busy day. Compensation was really the part that was annoying. We did a lot of work but were not compensated as well as we should have been.
good,"Meetings, Deliverables and Phase gate reviews. The Management has good processes for SDLC. CMM Level 3 for the procsses."
good,"Good company, however too far of a drive for me. I did learn many different systems. Co-workers were always helpful. Very intense training. Management was nice, helpful."
good,"I receive in coming calls in a call center environment, for a major Medicare medical insurance company, based out of my home (Work at home), from Medicare members about their group medical insurance. Using company based software and resources; I provide eligibility info and resolve issues, educate the callers on available plans for their group, enrollment into those plans, premium billing and payment & resolution of any issues, provide plan benefit info and claim resolution; I answer all the unasked questions with 100% accuracy, one call resolution and 100% customer satisfaction at the completion of each call."
good,"Challenging environment.  Personnel can make the job good and bad.  Upper management is very mobile, not able to depend on certain positions for relief when running across obstacles."
good,Cannot formally review Aetna as I am currently employed by Aetna.  I will be able to provide a review if I leave employment of the company.
good,Transitioned from state to commercial insurance and have learned a wealth of knowledge!
good,I enjoyed working for such a large company and their contribution to my 401K. The benefits were awesome. The work environment was disciplined and work monitored on frequent basis. High demand for quality which is to be expected at a nationally renowned company such as this. Employees encouraged to grow in their jobs and stay current on the many changes that occur on a frequent basis in this industry. Outside education on job related skills strongly recommended.
good,"Aetna is big on culture and health. They try to motivate and challenge their employee in health advancement. Aetna can be a fun place to work based on the nature of your job, if you can handle a heavy workload you should not have a problem in that envoronment."
good,"Enjoyed patients, working side by side with doctor was good, the office manager was a pill."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of answering calls from providers regarding benefits for their patients and the status of claims payments."
good,Good hard working individuals at this company.  I very much enjoyed the interaction with my co-workers as well as admired their dedication.
good,"Great company to work for. I was able to learn Workforce Management, including appropriate staffing, call volume forecasting, call trending and types. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all plan types and different departments. Learning many different work personalities and incorporating them into our daily workflow for a successful implementation as well as learning new things daily."
good,Always something new. Low employee recognition. Very stressful. Poor room for advancement. Best part of the job pleasant coworkers.
good,Excellent training. See previous comments made for Aetna Life and Casualty.
good,Providing co-workers with the necessary documents to reach a positive outcome at the end of the work day.
good,"With my position at Aetna, we were able to work from home twice a month. "
good,"Management tries hard to promote a culture of diversity of culture, point of view and ideas. Coljeagues are helpfull, funny and great to work with. Corporate says they want to promote from within but employees are seldom promoted."
good,Enjoyed exceptional training and becoming a lead adjuster for national accounts.
good,I was neither satisfied or dissatisfied with the company--as this is a moot point--there are no further comments
good,Was a great place to work. Company use to promote within but then started to send lots of work overseas.
good,"•	Coordinated hotel and travel arrangements for both domestic and international travel "
good,I started working at Aetna when I was in college. The hours were flexible which allowed me to complete my education while continuing to work.  There were always opportunities for advancement and hard work and positive results were recognized and rewarded.
good,Had a good experience and learned new things. Need complete targets every day. Recognition's were done to encourage employees.
good,Not really a great place to work but it's a job. There is no job advancement unless you know someone.
good,In comparison with my past employee. The Plantation Florida Office is alright.
good,"I have great co-workers, that makes my job enjoyable. The hardest part of my job is inconsistency. Process and Procedures, change often. Management, is OK-at times you're not acknowledged by management and it sends the wrong message. I've learned how to adapt to change."
good,"My overall opinion of the company is simple I have no idea who I really work for. Aetna acquired the company Coventry and as with any acquisition changes are expected but the changes within the company are actually going from bad to worst and before my performance becomes negative because of my dissatisfaction with the company I would rather part. I like helping other but I do not like bias, or dishonesty within leadership."
good,This office is no longer open.  All operations moved to another location.
good,"My typical day of work consists of answering calls from providers in regards to benefits, eligibility, policies and claims questions. I educate providers on new changes to different polices and procedures. In order to do my job effectively and accurately I have to use many different internal systems. The hardest part of my job is determining what information the providers need and which systems to use to give them accurate information. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am able to answer questions for providers that other customer service representatives could not answer."
good,Leadership is in a state of flux with all the changes taking place in healthcare.  May or may not be able to adapt from being a 100 plus year insurance company to changes in the marketplace.
good,I started my insurance career at US Healthcare.  US Healthcare was bought out by Aetna in 2006.  Working for US Healthcare and Aetna tought me everything I know and use today in my career.
good,Corporate culture is evolving; very focused on process and compliance; long tenured staff;
good,"enjoyed solving customer issues "
good,A busy but nice place to work good life/work balance. case manager since 2003
good,"nice company, very large company. talking to people all over the world. No contact with co workers. Educational, and a lot of research"
good,I was working as a temp and didnt get hired on full time. Aetna is great place to work with wonderful people. I was sad to leave the great environment.
good,I think Aetna has a lot to offer depending on your experience and skill set.
good,Great community hospital with varied experiences available.
good,"Job security is low."
good,"My job as a QA Business Consultant was challenging as well as enjoyable."
good,Visit member assist queue and distinguish priority for day. Learned different hardships of our members and gained insight of provider care and agendas for potential new patients. Most difficult was hearing those hardship cases for adults and children and finding a provider to meet there needs accordingly. Best part of position was the positive updates I received for cases I worked in past months.
good,I have a great manager. Hard to move up or around. Good company i guess.
good,"Analyzed system requirements and developed Test plans, Test cases for Functional, GUI and Regression Testing. "
good,"Production base job where management delegates your every move. The hardest part of the job is management.  The most enjoyable part of the job is coworkers are very spirited and try to make the job more enjoyable. I have learned a lot in my position at Aetna, additional computer skills, training skills and supervisor skills."
good,I met with clients both large  and small for all type of insurance coverated and consulted on their safety activities.  I made my own hours and learning was an on going  process.
good,"Good employee, management cares about the employees. Good opportunity for advancement"
good,"- It is a fast paced work environment. "
good,I enjoy working here. The flexibility of working hours is the best benefit of working at Aetna.
good,Install benefits into Aetna systems so claims could be paid. Worked with national account customers.
good,The work environment is very fun and relaxing and your co workers are very helpful
good,"Assist providers with health care insurance questions, including benefits, claims, etc"
good,management had multiple changes and therefore inconsistency
good,Company is generally a good company to work for  as it offers great flexibility in terms of hours.
good,I've learned a lot about being a technician and how to communicate with this job.
good,"A typical day at work was filled with duties such a s picking and packing orders. I had to make sure that all Lot numbers and NDC numbers matched the prescription orders. I was responsible for doing Audits on my employees. Also, I was responsible for teaching new employees how to pack orders."
good,"Support and provide superior service via phones, e-mails and faxes as a receiver and caller,"
good,"Management was very professional and showed good leadership skills. The employees were very professional and I learned a lot. "
good,We would start our day off with a meeting and I would get on the phone and help members with there problems
good,"In this position I have learned many aspects of customer service.In my position I have to resolve every issue, from ordering a new id card to resolving an outstanding claim being paid. Management is relatively hands off and my co workers will help out if asked. I enjoy telling a customer that their procedure is going to be covered and that they don't owe the bill they've been sent. The hardest part of my job is telling the customer the opposite."
good,"I have learned that in a diverse and large organization that management styles and the policies that are implemented and carried out are just as varied as the people that you work with and change when you switch departments.  I have worked under and with management that has inspired tremendous growth within me because I enjoyed their leadership style and the positive changes they were responsible for creating.  I have also worked under and with management that has inspired an appreciation for the attributes that inspire growth and instill within me a strong sense of responsibility for myself and how that translates to my thoughts and actions as part of a team and a broader picture, the organization as a whole.  "
good,"I worked at Aetna for 21 years.  For the most part was a good place to work but over the years they work you harder and every year took away another benefit and reduced compensation (raises, bonuses) and increased drastically the amount employees contributed for medical benefits along with reducing the benefit itself.  "
good,Implement tracking systems to reduce turn around time and follow up where needed.
good,Micromanagement. Constant criticism. They work you like a dog and pay you as little as possible.
good,"In the early years of my long career Aetna was an exciting, creative and challenging workplace.  Over time many functions were outsourced overseas making work more difficult"
good,A typical day at work was going over applicants health benefits and helping them understand their policy.I learned that people will listen to you when you are confident in your answers.Management was supportive.My co-workers were made up of a diverse group of people with diverse backgrounds and we supported each other.The hardest part of this job was allowing people to vent while trying to meet their needs.The most enjoyable part of this job was when I could redirect the customers anger toward a resoultion to their problem.
good,A strong company with very rigid and conservative culture.   Even for high performers promotions are hard to come by.
good,"room for growth and expand knowledge, supervisor was supporting and encouraging"
good,"room for growth, wonderful company but change of managers were affecting employee's performance as there were 4 supervisors in transition with in 1 year."
good,"Management team was good, very high stress level, traning tools are very good, useful, and helpful, very well diversed company. Pays well, good incentive, your productivity have to be excellent in order to reep the benefits."
good,My typical day at work starts off with checking email on my personal account and the Marketing Review mailbox that I'm responsible for coordinating reviews. Attend meetings and take notes for my boss. There are 4 co-workers in the Blue Bell office the rest are work at home around the country or in Hartford.
good,Authorizing care and treatment for women with medicaid for prenatal treatment.
good,There are many things lacking in this company such as professionalism.
good,* Fast paced environment
good,"Aetna was a challenging place to work - I enjoyed the interaction with audit, technical teams and our customers. I led a team of 15 diverse people and enjoyed watching them excel."
good,Handled multiple projects.
good,"Reviewed and adjudicated complex, sensitive, and/or specialized claims in accordance"
good,I was a unit lead and had a timed account. This means that all calims had to be processed in a certin time or we would fines. I did training for new employees and made sure that my team completed their assignments on time. I learned that it was very difficult to get rid of employees that wern't performing.
good,"Lots of incoming calls nation wide.I learned how to finish tasks in a timely manner how to research for information, superb customer service and medical terminology. Great manager always willing to help. I enjoyed working with my co workers. The hardest part of the day high peak call volumes."
good,"answered phone,assisted clients,set appointments billing assistance,and data entry"
good,Overall Aetna is a good company to work for. Good pay and professional enviroment.
good,•Provide administrative support for three sales representatives and the underwriting department.
good,Fast passed well managed environment. Possibilities for advancement within the company.
good,"I've definitely worked at worse places. They let me listen to my mp3 player while I worked which was nice. I was mostly left alone to do my work. The main problem for me was the drive, which took 2 hours out of my day round trip."
good,I have worked here for almost five years. It is a very large company with several different departments.
good,"Large company Excellent Benefits great culture of people. Easy to commute. Nationwide company easilly Recognizeable Brand.The most enjoyable part of this job was the experience I gained. Previosly I was a full time Student in Temple University. Aetna was my first ""Real job"""
good,"typical call center, calls from patients and Doctors alike"
good,Have worked for company for 5 years. Great stable company to work for
good,Used to be a great place to work but culture and morale are changing since CVS acquisition. Hard to advance your career unless you brown nose or are best friends with management. Raises are rare so make sure you come in with a good salary. Work from home and my non micromanaging manager are my only reasons for staying to this point unfortunately.
good,"I would not recommend this company to anyone wanting more of a career as advancements are almost impossible. There have numerous owners, which makes change almost a daily focus."
good,"I really loved the department and company, it taught me a lot about the Health care industry and managing multiple task and still maintaining great customer services."
good,Good company for which to work.  Paid fairly.  Had some management issues.  Work life balance not really important to the company.  Had the ability to learn new technologies.
good,Great place to work if you have the opportunity to work for a good manager. The pay is average however you can receive quarterly bonuses that can exceed $1000.00.
good,"I was busy with phone calls all day long. Very controlled atmosphere. Good pay and good bonuses, but had to work hard for them. Good food at the lunch room"
good,They train you 16 weeks on Medicare which is great.  Then you hit the floor and have use 10 to 13 different  systems to process 1 claim.  You get training on a new task 1 or 2x a wk and have to add that task to your duties the next day. It's way too much for one person idk why it's not broken up to teams I mean the company is huge. Very stressful but flex hours are nice.
good,"I last worked there in 2004.  It was a stressful, production, work environment although I had a great interest in the field of disability.  I understand Aetna no longer offers a Long Term Disability product."
good,"had great benefits, CVS buyout"
good,"I enjoyed my work in APM initially but my enjoyment decreased due to leadership.   In 10 years, I had four directors.  Two cared about my department and two did not.  The software we used was updated frequently but we were not given permission to expand the functions of the software resulting in the competition being able to gain an advantage over my job function.  We could have done so much more but were not permitted to expand.  I should have moved to a different department or left the company sooner."
good,I believe certain things can be better. But overall it can be a great company to work for. Just a lot of loose ends. That could make the workplace better
good,"Work life balance, mindfulness, stress reduction through yoga only applies to upper management. The clinical pharmacy team works forced mandatory uncompensated overtime. It is not unusual to work until 1:00am after a full 8 hour day to keep the prior authorization request queues in compliance because of inadequate staffing. I was so grateful to be offered a severance package."
good,Fast paced and very stressful; demanding.  But great resource tools and education.  Good inservices;  Started changing holiday schedule for the worse and impinging on live/work balance.  Didn't see a positive trend.
good,"Monday-Friday, typical office hours, management couldve been better, it wouldve made the environment less stressful and drama free other than that a great organization to work for!"
good,"I worked in the back end (quality/escalations) of ASRx. I can say many processes caused more difficulty than ease, for employees and customers. Not much communication between departments, and higher leadership's ignorance regarding how things actually turn out caused issues with how protocols were established and enforced. "
good,"Working for Aetna was an experience, it helped strengthen my customer service skills, reading and comprehension, researching, patience with peers and alot of other skills."
good,"the over all culture wasn't bad - most upper management meetings were just full of business jargon, it seemed there was more interest in hiring outside people rather than advancing internal people"
good,"Would have been better to be able to transition into another part of company.  Several applications submitted for positions, automated responses not acceptable."
good,Great organization with work/life flexibility. Room for growth internally and team work is appreciation. Management supports associates feedback. Some area for improvement just like any organization
good,"Job is metric based. Felt like a used car salesman and a bother most of the time. It would be better if we received inbound calls mostly. Unable to help many patients due to insurance restrictions which defeated the purpose of the call in the first place, which was mostly to prevent hospital readmission within 30 days."
good,"The training has improved over time because the drop-out rate has been 30%+ for new hires, but they have to hire so many people that half the new people are obviously not capable of doing the job. The company has extremely high expectations for top quality service, and you must learn and remember a massive amount of information that is continuously changing; you are being audited, listened to and rated by Aetna, and getting reviewsfrom customers that you cannot contest directly affecting whether you can get a bonus. Sometimes the calls are back to back to back, or you may have a 2 hour call that goes an hour past your break-- don't complain because it's part of the job. You are expected to ""go above and beyond"" and don't get praised for doing so. You have to be comfortable researching information, learning multiple computer programs/systems, taking good notes, and must have good logic skills! You are on teams, and if your teammates don't bother to do their job, you get nagged and won't get a good bonus-- and often you have to fix problems they've caused. You can get some very stressful calls (people screaming, crying, making threats). If you do well, they give you more work and more responsibility without more pay or recognition. And don't forget, giving out wrong information could dramatically affect the life of the person who is calling-- no pressure!"
good,"I had a wide variety of responsibilities as can be seen in the resume I uploaded.  There are few ""typical"" workdays."
good,"Aetna is a good place to work if you like to sit in one spot all day. A lot of time is spent on phones requiring patients and thoughtfulness, it can become challenging at times."
good,Good for a temporary role.  I was only there for three months.  The customer service side of the office was kinda sketchy.  The benefits side was ok though.
good,"It was a good place to work if you like working with a team to help people. However, it was a lot of work for the position. The CSR should be allowed to assist customers, not do the jobs of other departments as well."
good,"Great Company to work for. the company offers incentives, the benefits are ok I guess. The work environment  is awesome. whish they had a gym but most of the company is great."
good,It's a good place to work. You meet friendly people willing to help out. You learn a lot about health insurance. The down side was dealing with rude members. But I did enjoyed getting to know people from different backgrounds. Supervisors have a lot of favoritism and are willing to help you succeed only if they like you.
good,"Arrive to work by 7:30 am I would get my coffee and breakfast, eat before I would have to clock in at 8. Once I clock in, we have to log into my phone and began taking incoming call from clients. I learned about the importance of a medicare supplement and the whole life policies. I also learned how a call center operated. Management showed a lot of favoritism and were not very friendly. Workplace was fast paced. The hardest part of the job was trying to take care of the clients needs in a timely manner 3 minutes or less. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I was able to another client and they were very happy with my customer service."
good,Explaining to members how their benefits are covering their services if their deductible has been met or not. Handling issues with Claims and payments.
good,The company offers great benefits and 401K. You meet a diverse group of people which is good. They train you well in your job. Depending on what department you work for the management team can either be a very good one or not so good.
good,"A great company.  I love my coworkers, I love my bosses.  The only negative thing I would have to say is that there is limited room for advancement.  Work life balance is great."
good,"As a Network Relations Consultant, a typical day starts at 7am with reviewing calls and emails sent. Gathering data and completing necessary documents for groups and or providers to be added to Aetna Better Health."
good,The hardest part of the day was on phone calls with new staff because no face to face interactions.  Hard to get a good feel for the company culture in the Medicaid division.
good,"We basically took calls regarding dental coverage. Of course with insurance, nobody is ever happy so calls can get rough. !y department is a new one in Arizona so advancement is very limited and lateral. That's the hardest part of continuing to work there."
good,"it was a good company to work for no issues or complaints."
good,I enjoyed my time at Aetna. I am only looking for a career change as I have been a supervisor for about 15 years and looking for a career that I have no direct reports
good,Like any business . Over time it changes sometimes for the good or bad.  Just got keep yourself as prepared as you can . All in all  good company. Benefits good and opportunity to move around is adequate.
good,Aetna needs better opportunities to advance and increase salary. My time there I was able to become a Team Lead and my pay didn't really change as much.
good,A long career with many development opportunities. Management overall supportive. Opportunity to change positions and learn new skills. Work place culture semi formal. Hardest part of the job is unknown technology problems.
good,"i started with the company in office the first 2 years and then everyone changed to work at  home. It was a high call volume environment  job speaking with members, providers other insurance carriers clinicians etc. taking from 40-70 calls per day i learned a lot about the behavioral business, from beginning to end crisis calls, benefits,eligibility,claims, authorizations, and also assisted member with referrals providing list names,phone#, address according to what type of provider they where in need of. Also assisted members with claim issues. Also screen crisis calls and got caller over to the appropriate area for help. My direct manager was great. The hardest part of the job was not being provided the proper training in some of the areas that was needed.The most enjoyable part was helping the members making sure i assisted them with all the resources available   to them and also giving them great customer service making them feel good about calling the company. We had a very good work environment even though it was just thru instant message."
good,"Limited support"
good,"typical day at work - good"
good,Aetna is cutting edge when it comes to technology and changing health care delivery.  Most of their investments are focused on technology and acquisitions.  They have not invested in improving core business infrastructure and enhancements that allow employees to perform their roles effectively and efficiently.
good,"Committed to becoming younger and ""hipper,"" with two efforts in the past five years to convince older employees to take early retirement."
good,The benefits were awesome! The job was flexible and the work at home option was great. Lower management was great to work with and for. The caseloads were pretty high and a bit overwhelming at times.
good,"My typical day is very busy.  I take, usually, between 70-90 phone calls per day.  I do have resources available to help me, should I need it.  Our workplace culture is one that is inclusive, and everyone is encouraged to participate in team building activities.  There truly isn't a hardest part of our job.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the fair pay, PTO hours we're given, and employee discounts we're offered.  They're also very conscious of our overall health."
good,"From the CEO to the management staff, everyone would try to make the workplace a positive one.  My typical work day consisted of going out on the road meeting providers.  These meetings were mainly to educate them on the policies and procedures of the health plan."
good,I was in case management. Pay was satisfactory. The computer/phone work was enormous and constantly changing which is typical for the insurance field.
good,I enjoy my time here.  I do think some leadership isn't great.  you have to pick who you work for and where in order to have a good experience.  I expect reviews will vary significantly based on leadership in different departments
good,Challenging calls so ideal employee is professional problem solving people person that can articulate effectively while navigating multiple systems ensuring information provided is accurate and correct. Must be comfortable multitasking as well.
good,"I enjoy working with members, providers and broker.  Helping people on a daily bases makes coming to more enjoyable. Keeping up data integrity took some time but it was worth it."
good,No Transparency.  No Trust.  Incompetent Management.  Lead by fear vs example.  There are a few good leaders within in the company but there are many terrible ones that shouldn't be in charge of leading a shoe tying contest.  Aetna is trying to get too big too fast and is completely disorganized without biting off more than they can chew.  Fly by the seat of their pants rather than thoroughly thinking everything though.
good,"Team work is crucial especially in claims, There is always something new to learn, mostly because everything changes so fast. "
good,"Provide compassionate, effective case management to meet the needs of individuals identified as having long-term rehabilitation and psychosocial needs as a result of birth defects, chronic conditions, illness or injury. Social Worker are responsible for developing and carrying out strategies to coordinate and integrate all acute and long-term care services to members to prevent exacerbations and/or placement of the members in custodial care."
good,Mostly a good place to work -  reorganizations occur often leaving many out of work - yet they seem to keep outsourcing.  The  job for an IT professional can become difficult as they keep changing the technologies.
good,"Good place to work for. Lots of oppertunity. Very large, national locations and international oppertunities as well."
good,At the time I was there we were not able to work from home.  Also they were very strict about the quality/quantity of claims processing.  It is good if you are a good processor but it can be a bit of a struggle for those not as efficient.
good,"This is a good stable company to work for. But unfortunately the dept that i was in your schedule changed monthly based off of your personal metrics. This is something that is hard to do when you have a family,"
good,Aetna is a good place to work.  The organization has faced several macro environmental headwinds but does a good job in meeting the street's expectation and maintaining profitability.  The organization is somewhat dynamic considering its a 150 year old health insurance company.
good,"Inbound call center, stable position, very caring employees.  I enjoyed the overtime options, and that my office was closed on weekends.  Hardest part of the job was the occurrence policy and quality."
good,"Enjoyed working at Aetna.   Insurance benefits could have been better but, good enough.  Management was good and enjoyed  working with them.  Some of the mangers were better than others, as with most big companies.  Salaries were raised to meet cost of living expenses, which was great!"
good,"wasn't what I expected.  Aetna is currently in a Lay off status for all govt. related fields.  I will admit, this company gave me more experience in different fields."
good,"A typical day at work consists of processing a minimum of 12 medical claims per hour, based on CMS guidelines. Over the past 2 years on this team I have learned a lot about the coding and how to make sure the claim is ok to pay. The management I honestly very good people, the co-workers are very friendly and eager to assist  with any  help that may be needed. The best part of my day is knowing I have did my job and did it correctly."
good,"The workplace was interesting. There was alot of different personalities within the center, within your actual team."
good,"High Volume, long hours, medical benefits are not the greatest. Really hard to advance."
good,"Aetna is a great company to work for. They have fair benefits and a strong workforce. However not every department is the same, and so some experiences are much different than others (ie. work life balance, leadership, and career advancements)"
good,I had planned retirement from this job.  I was not employed one year when it ended without any notice to the employees.  We was given severance pay for 9 weeks many left with no insurance or a salary.
good,"I worked for Aetna for 7 years as a call representative and, at first, I enjoyed working there. The company offered many incentives to boost the work moral but that quickly changed over the years. It is a highly stressful job because you are constantly taking calls without little to no downtime. You are monitored by call volume, speed of talk time and pretty much anything and everything you do during your shift.  If you like being micro-managed then this would be the job for you."
good,"Aetna is an amazing company, however, I do think they should work more on their manager-to-employee communication. Micromanaging is not the way to go these days at all. Aetna has unbelievable benefits to take advantage of."
good,"•Manages Pharmacy License Renewals and Officer Change Process by providing instructions to consultants and monitoring work for completeness."
good,"Aetna provides a family like environment, in which employees work closely together on a daily basis. They are consistent with keeping up with current information and keeping employees up to speed with constant changes. The most difficult part of the job is finding medicaid providers for members. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping members find the proper healthcare, its a satisfying feeling helping people lead healthier lifestyles."
good,Aetna is an employer that you can grow with.  There is a lot of opportunity with the company.  You can't be afraid of change.
good,"Aetna offers great work & health benefits to all of its employees. In this department, we can wfh on assigned days. Very high paced environment."
good,"I enjoy the collaborative care, flexibility of the job, enjoy seeing patients get better and return to work. I enjoy my co-worker that I work with everyday. I enjoy making a difference in being a part of the safety team at the customers site, I like the interactions with the injured workers. Hardest part of my job is round table with the customers attorneys whom digest the hardest cases a part."
good,Employment included excellent training that served me well in my 20+ year career in health insurance industry. Was a good employer.
good,Aetna brought the company I use to work for which is Coventry. Can't really say much about working for Aetna since I left before they took over
good,"Aetna is a great place to work if you learn corporate culture.  Difficult to advance as a professional.  Good pay and benefits."
good,"Within my department it's always something to do to stay busy, which definitely helps the day to go by. From the start to finish you log in and you work you assignments for the day you log out only to take lunch and then you must log back in. All of the work is managed from you assigned log in."
good,"Generally good work/life balance"
good,"A typical work environment is to be around nice friendly, professional, and respectful colleagues. The most challenging part of the job is to explain benefits over the phone to a person that is not patient with what can be a long clear explanation. The best part of the job is helping people that you can be your parents, or grandparents. The willingness to learn and the ability to learn is the success to any position."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with there, they became an extended family to me!"
good,Colleague are great to work with an great team. Large company typical day consist of multiple conference calls
good,"Log into Avaya system, begin taking calls one right after another making sure to stay within the 7 minute allowed handle time. "
good,"You will have lot of work, but one of the best place for a frehser to start with."
good,Work in Medicare Enrollment department of national insurance company. Duties include correcting and processing Medicare advantage enrollment applications for new and returning clients. Using great attention to detail and research skills to assure applications are processed in a timely manner and according to Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines.

good,Aetna has many work from home opportunities for people who are self motivated.
good,"A typical day at work is quite busy, lot to learn, cooperative co-workers."
good,"Formerly Coventry Healthcare. This job is currently transitioning over to the Aenta culture. Will update at a later point when we have been fully assimilated to the ""Aetna Way."""
good,"Compensation is a little below competitors, Internal mobility = less money than what they would give an external candidate. Great Benefits and work/life balance"
good,An entry level of opportunity for data entry and call center experience.
good,"A typical day starts and ends with taking calls from providers, assisting them with patients benefits, eligibility, and claims issues. I learned about medical coding and billing, and a moderate amount of medical terminology. Also, a lot about how insurance works and the different types of insurance. The manager's are great. We work as a team and any issue I have, I can bring it to my manager and he helps fix it. My co-workers are just as great. They're fun as well as dependable, not just for work related issues but for anything really. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the providers when they call upset about a claim or issue they have. Most of the time the issue can be resolved right away and we can leave the providers happy but on occasion when an issue can't be fixed right away, the providers express their dislike and would most likely request to speak with a supervisor. The most enjoyable part of this job is the satisfaction of helping the providers."
good,"Working for Aetna Pharmacy PA has furthered my knowledge of the Medicaid business including PNT, formularies, regulations etc. Work life balance at Aetna is perfect and it is a great company to work for. I found it very enjoyable working up the prior authorizations and reviewing clinicals and documenting for the pharmacists so they can make a decision without having to scan through pages of notes. It also pleases me when I am able to really help someone get their medication or at least solve a problem with something."
good,Nice company to work for with friendly people. Great flexibility and hours.
good,"There were many projects in various points in the process with continuously changing prioriies. This industry is very fluid and is impacted by legislation, competitors and needs of consumer. The main challenge is getting funding to implement needed products and programs and to do so in a timely manner."
good,they were a good company to work for allowing for flexibility and balance between work and personal life.
good,"Paying and reviewing claims for 250 small business, following strict guidelines per company policies."
good,The enjoyable part of the job is being able to provide the customer with a positive results to a negative issue.
good,Work was dental claim processing. Hardest part of the job was to pull micro film claims because of error in xrays. Loved to speak to Providers on problems with claims that were not correctly processed. Able to fix problems for all was very rewarding.
good,I learned alot about people. A typical work day was very busy and tedious
good,I feel the expections are unfair to the employees when they don't really train you with every problem that should arise while processing a claim. Not enough coaches for help.
good,"Overall good place to work. Great compensation and benefits compared to other healthcare companies. If you are an independent learner, this is a great place to work."
good,"This company has potential but it need to trust its staff more to make decisions. "
good,Overall good work culture. Great benefits. Ok mgt. Good team work. Not fully a telecommute company. Micromanaged work culture. Had a nice manager. Worked in office after being told I could work from home in a year.
good,"Aetna was a great company to work for, but needs to offer their employees more opportunities to grow. Management was not very good, depending on my team for 90 percent of things."
good,It was stressful to meet numbers and had to work over alot to do so.  Work from home job became unmotivated easily and lack if interaction from peers can be challenging.  Never sure how you were doing/progress wise until audit scores.  Very stressful to make numbers even when volume was down or type of review was lengthy.
good,"Good experience as a Health Coach, enjoyed talking with the members daily and helping them to achieve their goals. Learned about the business side of things . Office culture could be re-vamped a little."
good,"Old-school work environment, very hierarchical.  Management is slow to react and has a hard time breaking from the core insurance business.  Have made several technology acquisitions but fail to capitalize or use to full potential."
good,In this high pace facility you master the use of several programs to confirm the member is getting the best use out of their benefits. All while multi  tasking and note talking for the account and abiding by the insurance laws and regulations.
good,"Great people to work with, stressful environment. Lot's of sources for self-education. No corporate parties or gatherings.  Lot's of perks. Not promoting people :("
good,"Good Company to work for with Good Work Life Balance. Promotions and Salary Increament are not often when compared to Product or consulting company. "
good,This place could be a multitude of different things all at once - fast paced and crazy busy especially around renewal times.  Then there were times when there were slow breaks.
good,"Professional, organized, communicative. "
good,I really dont have a review to give. The job was fairly easy. There was some practices put into place that I didnt think were fair however it was a nice and convenient place to work.
good,"Winning the highest honor the company bestows on it's employees was a great experience that I will never forget, and since I was nominated for the award by 2 great managers, It had an even greater meaning."
good,"Not a great place to work, not a terrible place to work.  Layoffs are common unfortunately in the volatile insurance space.  Work from home is...ok."
good,"Never in my life have I worked with as many whiners/complainers as I have at Aetna. Everyone complains about everyone and they will throw you under the bus any chance they get. Easy job stick just have to yourself, do you work, and ignore the whiners."
good,"Mediocre talent has a better chance of being promoted than excellent talent. The company promotes hiring internally, but external candidates are offered more and hired just as often if not more than internal candidates. The leadership is weak."
good,"There was never a dull day as there is always more to do than one could keep up with.   That's the positive.   Every day you learn new things.   It is satisfying helping others navigate their insurance needs whatever they may be.  Hardest parts of the job:   1) learning to step away for a quality work/life balance; 2) being accountable for things outside your control, and 3) due to several Early Retirement offerings and prior Job Eliminations, the loss of experience in key areas was very disruptive.  Overall, very good place to work with lots of opportunities.   I love being able to work from home."
good,"I had to leave for a personal issue.  However, the management did show some favortism with certain employees. Call center position with some time off phone for projects."
good,"The culture is relaxed."
good,Working at Aetna is ok. The day is spent entirely on the phone and that is the only patient interaction. Unfortunately the job involves approx 75% data entry
good,Great remote position to work during the HEDIS season. Office is easily accessible when needed for support and training. Office staff love to eat and provide great meals.
good,Company has changed overall Aetna was a good company work loads and process are not followed by the policy and procedureswork at home is a great  tuition reimbursement is great
good,"Very high volume, working with the public can be challenging. Learn as much as you can to be as big of an asset to the company as possible. However, if you're really good at your position, it's not easy to move into another."
good,I enjoyed working with my team at Aetna (including my manager).  We worked well together and were able to keep our application's users happy as a result.
good,"This Employer is a good employer to work for, good benefits, Job culture could be a bit better, very stoic and management could be a bit more receptive toward ermployees, but good place to work overall"
good,Typical day wotuld be answering inbound calls concerning medical insurance. I learned different aspects to insurance. Management was hardly available due to multiple meetings. I enjoyed all of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job would be a rude customer. The most enjoyable would be resolving issues.
good,"Good place to work but unstable fiances. Many layoffs and job did not feel stable. Worked thier for 3 years and while their went /made through he Coventry to aetna transition. Not a smooth transition and I feel Aetna after the human deal, they got to big for their business model. My time there was good but I was told I was going to be laid off but no time limit. Management heavy company."
good,I worked for Aetna for five years. Most of the time the work and atmosphere were fine. Was a more relaxed office. Sometimes too relaxed with how people dressed. The better you were at your job the more they gave you to do. However if you were bad at your job they let everyone else do your work for you.
good,There was no room for advancement the learning and skills you receive is great it all depends on who you know for advancement the pay was ok even though you only get an annual they were giving out bonuses but that was stopped they moved you around to different departments if they have a layoff which was good depending on your skills when I worked there over 5 years ago overall it could be a great place to work at
good,"At the time I worked in customer service, it was a typical call center with strict guidelines. Had to obtain a pass to go to the rest room, Most team leaders were ok but some were on a power trip."
good,Continually Chang and increase metrics. Not able to get all done in 8 hr day so many extra hours needed. Expectations described when hired  have never been met
good,Aetna can be a great place to work but you have to seek advancement on your own.  Always look to grow your skill sets and keep abreast of changes in the organization of the company.
good,"Great location to work in Philadelphia"
good,"Responsible for resolving escalated calls and concerns while working with members and medical providers to facilitate ease of care.  Managing dedicated plan sponsors by providing exceptional service through online chat, telephone and email correspondence.  Resolving medical claim issues, educating members on plan features and benefits in addition to providing cost estimates for requested services."
good,"nice place to work, very tiring constantly back and forth with HR about job guidelines, very unprofessional, no loyalty, seniority, rules are case by case."
good,Management did not provide adequate compensation for performance.  Needed to hire extra staff because workloads were excessive.  I learned a lot about reporting
good,"Pretty much the same as with Cahaba. Taking calls from electronic claims submitters, helping them to resolve issues with claim rejections or communications."
good,"Loved working for this company but since the CEO is trying to sell it, culture is moving downwards.  Otherwise, it was a great run, and I hope it doesn't sell for the sake of shareholder value."
good,"Management is good, as well as co workers, however there is no room for advancement and the pay is NOT competitive. Definitely need to evaluate the market and pay fairly"
good,This was a phone line with too many Que's. The upper management did not listen to our department . No interoffice cooperation even though they said there was .
good,"Friendly, fast paced environment with extensive and somewhat confusing training seminars. Somewhat 'unfair' management decisions. Unrealistic expectations of employees"
good,"Overall Aetna is an amazing company to work for. There's a lot of opportunity for growth and its very diverse. The work environment is great and I really enjoy the people I work with, only issue is working in Member Services. Taking calls back to back with rude customers can be extremely frustrating and tiresome. I wouldn't recommended this position if you're not able to handler a high call volume and dealing with irate members through out your entire shift. After a while you will get exhausted and warn out from the repetitive routine, there's not much excitement to look forward to within the department."
good,"It has been almost 17 years since I worked at Aetna.  The management team then and now, I believe, allow for long term job security if the person so desires."
good,"Answering phone calls from customers who had questions about their health insurance. "
good,Enjoyed feedback from management. Town hall meetings were informative. Always incentives to do better. Company luncheons were always my favorite. ....
good,for the most part this company is great to work for. units have nice and professional employees. its a busy place and career advancement is defenently available if your serious and want to do it!! as with typing and starring at computers all day its not good for the eyes..breaks are very short..  they do a lot of laying off !!
good,"Great company to work for to learn about ins and outs of the health insurance industry! We work a lot with microsoft excel, which is also integrated into many of our company-specific rating tools."
good,"I worked for Aetna Better Health in Philadelphia and it was one of the worst places I have worked in my life. there was drama everyday. There were NO providers for the people we serviced which resulted in a lot of inbound calls. Management was very well aware of this, but didn't care. Upper management was leaving the company left and right. The place was so unorganized."
good,"work at home for many positions "
good,"This is a great job for certain people.  Not me.  I was not able to ever meet the required number of claims to make any bonuses that were offered.  Three months of employment are spent in a classroom training.  I thought it was a good thing.  Again, not for me."
good,The CEO is positve and love working here!  Able to do my best without the micro management.  Colleagues reach out and assist where needed and management have open door policy so you can be sure they will provide positive solutions
good,I learned something new everyday.  I was always striving to learn as much as possible so i can grow. The hardest part of the job was when i couldn't get the patients insurance verified for whatever reasons and i cant ship out the medication to them.
good,"Great company with good benefits, good job for someone who likes assisting members via phone. A typical day is very busy but it makes the day go by fast."
good,A typical day at work was pretty smooth. I learned how to use a compactor. The management to me was very unprofessional. I liked my co-workers we worked well together. The hardest part of the job was the trash backup when supervisors did not change trash bins. The most enjoyable parts are when everything is caught up.
good,Working at AETNA was a rewarding experience.  It allowed me to develop the account receivable and analytical skills learned from prior employment.
good,"Poor, work-life balance. Good compensation.  Normal workdays are very busy.The hardest part of the job is working 13-14 or more hours a day, including weekends."
good,Good work place that allows you to interact with a variety of people from different walks of life. Provided me with a great opportunity to work from home while still being a productive employee.
good,Took calls from members and providers.  There was always something to smile about.  I enjoyed speaking with the retirees in the  group I handled. I looked forward to Christmas every year because I could select kids to buy toys for.  I usually pick two.
good,"I work on a diverse team all remotely located"
good,Aetna is a very good place to work. I enjoyed working there. I learned alot when working at Aetna
good,"My current position at Aetna is involved with resolving complaints and appeals from Medicare members.  The position involves much research into members' plans, benefits, enrollment status, claims, and overall complaints they have with their coverage.  My co-workers for the most part are fabulous and I enjoy working with them on a daily basis.  I think upper management have an excellent vision in what the future of the company is and what we need to achieve that."
good,Learned the basics of processing Medical and Dental claims along with how to provide excellent Customer Service. 
good,Working in Aetna on behalf of Cognizant Tech Solution US corp gives me the pride. But I feel difficult to manage the work life balance
good,"Working at Aetna is a tremendous challenge for me. Management at Aetna expects efficiency and productitivity from every employee and provides tools and training that help every employee reach acceptable results. I have learned alot about corporate culture and what working in a production environment really feels like. All co-workers are great, encouraging and empathetic with a accepting attitude that intense production oriented work enviroment can be difficult but very rewarding with the knowledge of significant achievement and accomplishment. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a work/life balance working from home. I enjoy being part of this inovative and cutting edge multinational corporation doing wonderful things for the members they serve."
good,"I enjoy working with my peers, and have had the pleasure meeting some great people."
good,"This was an entry level position in healthcare for me. I learned alot and was paid while training. The information I've learned at Aetna made me excel in my other positions. At the end, I was working from home. This was earned, not given. Based on my complete work record; attendance, call quality, etc. The hardest part of my job when I started was getting there, it was not accessable to public transportation."
good,Advancement is tough in customer service. Medical benefits are substandard
good,"Love assising Medicare members with locating resouces and referrals that will assist them in there daily lives or even if it's for a pet, friend or child,"
good,"During the interview the position/training was presented differently.  The training was intense and the trainer was rude and condescending. This type of situation does not show the company at its best and for myself, I am actively seeking employment elsewhere."
good,"Aetna is a good company to work for and has been very stable considering the merger with CVS. Depending on the department, the flexibility to work remote with teams all over the country is pretty common."
good,"Aetna taught me alot, it had very extensive training that definitely was needed.  However my trainer was very immature and spent a lot of time mixing with trainees in an unprofessional manner.  Great benefits, they held alot of events and parties and that part was fun, but overall it wasn't worth the stress.  It is a high stress environment, you are hooked to your phone with frequent check ins.  You cant spend too long in the rr, you are constantly monitored.  They want you taking calls as much as possible and burn out is a definite there."
good,"Working in a call center allows an opportunity to work from home. However, crisis calls days after day in a queue based setting causes burn out. They do help cover CEUs."
good,"Coworkers were excited to be a part of helping members and learning new tasks."
good,"Working at Aetna was interesting. I enjoy speaking to members about their benefits and out of pocket expenses. Each state has its own way of how the benefits work. Other Customer Service Reps were friendly, there were a few favoritisms as most jobs do, but they were cool. Now to the cons, Insurance for an employee is expensive, and the deductible is too high. Supervisors don't do anything. Always on their cell phones. They avoid as much as possible to not talk on the phone with a member even when it is requested/demanded by that member. They have a next help which is another CS Rep in which they call them, SME, (pronounced ""s'meee""). They will do most of the work to assist you when having trouble. You can advise the member if they want to speak with a SME, but most of the time they want to talk directly for one. There are times where I would wait about 30 minutes to almost an hour waiting for a supervisor to take the call, even before and after a SME tries to deescalate the situation. BOTTOM LINE: Supervisors do not want to take the call. All they do all day is walking around making sure you are on the phone. They are friendly and understandable, but not so much. Our call flow is run by Workforce Management, those who know it as WFO. Whenever you are out of adherence you will have to put in a segment to cover that, most of the times they do not approve it."
good,A good place to work for as far as balancing your career and family life. the scheduling was based on your availlabillity .it is a good place to work if you are a pharmacy technician trying to move into the insurance side. very relaxed and dresscode was relaxed
good,They have different teams on each  floors which is cool and different departments through out the whole builidng  they are mostly friendly. .....................................
good,"My work day consist of dealing with members in Aetna. To inform them of medical benefits and assistance when needed through Care Management."
good,"And great executive leadership, but some of the middle management  doesn't have a backbone. So be prepared to fight if you want change and to be heard. The insurance is free, first day vesting on your 401k and a great wellness program. Work at home is an option and you get like 3 weeks PTO off the bat."
good,everything about this company is OK. Not great but definitely not awful. They try to build morale and have employee fun activities. The salary is decent by not great. The hours are Ok. They do expect a lot from their employees and at times it seems like they are getting more bang for their buck then you are for your time. but overall its a very decent and fair company. I have no real complaints.
good,"Aetna was a fun place to work at if you're the type of person who likes to clown around a lot, most of the managers were ok, of course you always a few bad seeds, but overall management was ok"
good,Aetna is a leader in the marketplace and a great place to start a career.  They treat employees well and have great benefits.  Those who work hard and get along well with people will do well.
good,Aetna is a great company and currently has an excellent C Suite of officers.I would recommend the company to anyone who is dedicated and willing to work hard. My own son works at Aetna.Being a large company being political must be part of your employment strategy.
good,"Aetna is a good stable job to have, advancement goes based off who you cool with; the pay is ok but because of the constant changes it should be more; the health benefits are horrible deductible is $1000 plus and out of pocket expense can be as high as $10000 horrible for an medical insurance company. People are wishy washy, but overall if you need a consistent dependable job with no drama this is a great job for training is 16wks long so be prepared to catch a cold or flu."
good,"My job was stressful in that I had to deal directly with users of the application software we developed and supported.  Fortunately, I had a sharp team of other developers and a good manager who backed me up."
good,It was a job I worked at for 10 1/2 years and laid off due to down sizing.  I learned a lot working there.   I enjoyed my jobs and a nice environment.
good,growth potential and generally a great place to work.  fair compensation and usually a good team to work with.  Helpful management at times but a bit out of touch with staff.
good,"I thought the job was a particular type of position, learned the position, did the position, yet in the end the communication delivered was not done correctly."
good,"The phones are very busy all day.  It makes the day go by fast!"
good,The company has the best overall work space environment  I have worked for in all my career. They are the top leaders in Health Care driven insurance and multiple platforms.
good,Every was an opportunity to learn something new about the insurance that was provided to our medicare members.In order to solve problems and answer questions we would work as a team and reach out to our fellow co-workers for assistance  when necessary.
good,Claims processing positions are difficult to come by and can be even more difficult to keep.
good,Fast paced work environment to work in. Keeps you on your feet. Management is very much involved in the everyday activities which allows everyone to be on the same page.
good,It’s very stressful if you don’t like talking on the phone. The staff is okay. Depending on the team your working with. Management is very rude not really supporting the team like they should. It’s very demanding job and must adapt to fast pace environment.
good,"The on the job training should be broken down in parts due to the job function instead of all thrown at you at once. Training can be way better so people won't struggle and would be better off once your on your own. The pay needs to be more as well, with all the things they add on for you to do. Some get it with the training method used and some don't."
good,Telework was the main driver of job satisfaction.  Professional work environment.  Great colleagues and managers.  Room for advancement if you work hard.
good,"Mediocre environment; Processes seem to be pretty inefficient and unnecessarily time consuming. Good benefits, lower than competitive pay. Enjoyed for the most part."
good,"I can only speak about my department. However, my department is disorganized and mismanaged. Communication between the departments can use some improvement."
good,"I work servicing Medicare retirees. My expectations on how we handle our members are high and in my opinion Aetna can do better with making sure the members are taken care of. Because this is a call center, you are expected to be available for incoming calls. Some of these calls can be complicated and cause for more research in order to assist the member. We should have an allotted time offline to take care of the members . That’s 1st call resolutions to me."
good,"I love working here, but management here is ridiculous. Quote rude and disrespectful. I left the company for that very reason. Besides that, the company is quote awesome to say the least"
good,My former manager who was only in her position for a short period of time fired everyone on her team it’s hard to switch positions at the company poor skills
good,"overall, this place is a great place to work for. Like any company, they have their pros & there cons. One of the cons is mandatory overtime. I feel as if it should be voluntary instead of mandatory. They also should consider paying people the compensation they deserve vs. what they can afford. As a big name company, that should be one of the perks for working there"
good,"Got caught in a snow storm. lived in West Philadelphia. Industrial area"
good,"The reason I left Aetna is because of their 10% promotion policy.  I never understood why they helped me obtain my Master's Degree but would not then promote me larger than 10% of my current salary.  External people could make more on a higher up job than an internal employee.  At Anthem, they also have the 10% unless the base of the salary of the job you are applying for is greater than 10%.  Then you at least make the base of that position."
good,"regarding sick days, Aetna works on a PTO program.  You are given a certain number of days off per year (number depending on how long you been there).  You can use them for sickness or vacation, Aetna doesn't care.  So the question about number of sick days can't really be answered.  When I started at Aetna things were very casual.  As long as you got your work completed you didn't have problems.  Increasingly it seems they have developed tools to keep track of what you are doing.  For instance, they actually have a program that tracks every keystroke on your computer to make sure that you are constantly working during your scheduled time.  God forbid you take a minute to compose yourself or relax after a difficult phone call.  Mine was a phone job so you go in and calls are sent to you for resolution.  Generally they do not have enough people on the phones so the calls are constant with no break in between.  You are expected to complete calls within six minutes which is simply not reasonable given the complexities of health care issues.  It can take two to three minutes just to get the caller's name and account number and a description of the problem to be resolved.  This unreasonable time limit is probably the major contributing factor to the huge stress factor of the job.  This is further complicated by constantly changing coverage policies.  One week we might cover a procedure.  The next week we don't.  Then a month later we might cover it again.  This means you can't count on simply remember the policies, you have to research everything to see if it has changed.  Again"
good,"Have worked for the company for many years, from a wonderful company to what it is today. My entire family worked there at one time. Over the years, they brought in a lot of IBM consultants to clean house and also one of the first or the first to take advantage of the H-1B loophole and hire many offshore workers."
good,I have done job in Aetna on support basis. Work nature was very good but salary was too low. Project management was nice. I was working in Mainframe technology as support basis. Job Culture was good. There was a great management in the project.
good,"While encouraged that this company does the right thing for the right reason with capable and encouraging leadership, Im not sure this transitions to the local market for opportunity.  During my tenure with this company an abundance of change occurred during the turbulent times of the ACA, which contributed to me departure."
good,"Great place to work at, only thing hard to move up in the company, but management is nice, people friendly. You'll learn a lot here and you'll grow here."
good,Learned how to process insurance claims. Management was great and I truly enjoyed working there. Goals were set to meet quality and productivity. Co-workers were very nice and helpful.
good,"Call center environment, with lots of room for growth.  National Accounts, Provider Services and Public and Labor all located under one roof.  Best part of the job is providing a positive outcome for the members."
good,During a day of work I speak with hundreds of people from all over the world. I learn about new products and benefits with a constant change which I love dearly. I adapt well to new policies and new ways to keep the members happy.
good,"Great learning environment, friendly and helpful."
good,"Call Center area"
good,When I was promoted to another department the daily claims to process was 130 claims per hour. Aetna didn't seem to care to have 0 errors oppose to having the numbers processed. I succeeded in accomplishing both but it was stressful. It was also located in downtown Portland so it was a long commute and paying for parking was required.
good,Aetna is an overall ok place to work. The pay is in accordance to the pay of others in the industry.
good,"Call center representatives are the people you speak with when you call your bank, order a new sweater from a catalog or make airline reservations. They do everything from assisting people with customer service complaints to making telemarketing calls. Most call center jobs fall into one of three categories."
good,"Management are extremely friendly and helpful. Overall this is a good company to work for. If you are detailed oriented and can adapt to change, this would be a good fit for you."
good,Aetna was a solid company that empowered me to be my own person. They allowed employees to work in a manner that was creative and always put the employees first.
good,"I had an incredible supervisor that always cared about my needs and helped me to learn and advance in my position. Other than that the work was overwhelming at times. Aetna was in the process of taking over FMLA for FedEx and the process clearly needed to be streamlined but there was no effort to make any changes. Over time Aetna required more contracts and the work flow quickly became unbearable. On top of taking customer service phone calls, we also had to review FMLA claims. Those phone calls took up so much time that everyday was a rush to meet our quota and review claims. At times we were asked to work on weekends to help catch up on our tasks and other departments"
good,It’s an easy job and very easy money. It’s secure and there is virtually no worry. The facility is nice and they try to keep up morale of the team. It’s an easy going place to work
good,"This job is OK. I'm not thrilled about working here anymore. You're told one thing about your role then it changes. Training was so bad, its not even funny, wasted months not learning anything. I'm hoping to leave soon."
good,"Work at Aetna for 30 years.  Awesome Manager.  The year of Training I received in the company was Great., Strong company.  I was able to grow in different departments with the company."
good,"good company, sometimes the managers let their personal lives interfere with staff. but i enjoyed the coworkers and we had potlucks and they liked to feed us and we did get quarterly bonuses if metrics where met"
good,"Aetna have a very convenience cafeteria. Its centrally located.  Parking is very convenient.  Security is provided."
good,Nice place to work.  Learning about all types of insurance claims.  Good people to work with.  Able to move up within the company.  good benefits.
good,"Laid off with 300 others after only 1 1/2 yrs, training was inconsistent."
good,"Even though this job was hard and put too much pressure on me, I learned a lot from this job. My coworkers and mangers were very supportive."
good,"The benefits are great but, when i was moved to this department with new supervisor. She liked to l harass certain individuals like me that I had to leave. Human resources refuse to get rid of this individual so, I left it in GOD's hands."
good,a typical day a lot of calls speaking with customers. The most enjoyable part is that you get compensated for living a healthy lifestyle.
good,they provided opportunity to advance and learn new material to apply for various departments
good,"Skills include:"
good,"Aetna is a self service company of do it yourself culture.  "
good,"My experience with Aetna was wonderful, I really enjoyed the atmosphere where everyone does want to make a difference in the work environment mainly with their members."
good,I did not like sitting in front of a computer screen all 8 hours of my shift. Shifts were great and i loved to have weekends off. Trainer was difficult to get along with.
good,"Nothing bad to say, procedures and steps all in place. Always met my daily quota . Nothing bad to say. Only down side was that the pay was a little under average"
good,This is a very fast pace business and the fact that the management does not know how to do what the employees do is crazy to me. Very poor management.
good,"Call customers to confirm demographic information, great co-worker."
good,"Never knew how it important it was to have disability insurance, till I started working here. The information I've learned these past years has been overpowering."
good,A Typical work day consist of answering the phones for medicaid members as well as providers to assist with information about their medicaid plan.
good,"This was a great place to work and the management was pleasant.  Most of all stay focused and always makes sure the customer is satisfied and you've done your best.  Never take the job personal and never take the job home with you, tomorrow is another day. Everyday was not a typical day.  Sometimes you could have at least 50-100 calls and some days on 20-30 depending on the service level."
good,"i enjoyed working for aetna insurance because it was customer service, i have a great personaily and im very well spoken, also i like to interact with people."
good,"Aetna was a very good company to work for from the top they were concerned with employees."
good,I loved my job placement through Aetna the insurance offered through Aetna I'd unreal no way can someone afford it  with what they pay. Had some issues with getting paid sometimes and the office is a little unprofessional
good,I enjoyed my coworkers and my role. There were a lot of aquisitions causing layoffs etc. Department heads moved around based on reasons other than appropriateness.
good,it was a ok place to work in order to move up you will have to have a click with upper management if you didn't have one you will not go no where.
good,The workload was not comparable to compensation; even working beyond work hours were not enough to meet deadlines and workload steadily increased despite this. There were some experiences of harassment from leadership.
good,"schedule changes every quarter"
good,It was an ok place to work. Just was a lot of favoritism which I honestly think has no place in the workforce especially when it evolving boss & employee.
good,Started processing claims. Moved to auditing claims then became a trainer.  Then our jobs were moved overseas hence the poor rating on job security.  It was a work at home position which was enjoyable.
good,You need 15 minutes per call not 7 min and 31 sec per call. For all the trouble the members give the reps we need more money per hour. Sups are scarce
good,Aetna gave me an outlook on Medicare and the elderly population and how important it is to be aware of them. I gain great knowledge of the medical field as well.
good,"Lots of changes with recent withdrawal from ACA markets and the DOJ blocking of merger.   Early retirement program offered in the fall, many areas impacted by changes in staff."
good,"Build pa auths from faxes or phone calls. No one fax is process the same, everyone is processed different. I work with a very smart group of people. The most rewarding part of my job is being able to assist the member in getting the help they need for healing."
good,"work/life balance manageable, management does not take suggestions well however they keep employees informed with changes. Most enjoyable part of the job assist and help patients with their medications and empathize with them."
good,"I currently work as an on-site occupational health nurse for a national retailer.  Additionally, I do telephonic case management with a case load of over 65 active cases, writing updates/reports per URAC standards. I carry a license in compact states plus Illinois, Indiana, Kansas and New Jersey.  I love working and interacting with people; employers, patients, providers and adjustors.  I like anticipating the clients needs and establishing strong relationships of trust. The hardest part is numerous/constant activities and time restraints."
good,"I work 6:00 am to 2:30 pm. If needed I go in as early as 4:00 am. The first thing I do is check books to see if there are any meetings scheduled, if so it is my responsibility to set them up nad make sure everyone has what drinks they want. Have an awesome boss. Co-workers are great, help out if needed. The job isn't really that hard. I love meeting new people. "
good,Productive and fun workplace.  I enjoyed working at Aetna they had incentives for their employees and always had different activities going on during the month.
good,Contract work as HEDIS nurse. WFH option. There was some turn over in the department from the Director down and the whole project could have been more organized.
good,The company overall is a great company to work for. The Medicare leadership team has received very low scores in the overall employee satisfaction arena. Toxic culture l.
good,Aetna is a great place to grow in healthcare.  Great exposure to the healthcare industry with a lot of advances in technology and promises to expand on a global scale.
good,Productive workplace with many malfunctioning managers and supervisors trying to get employees to work as a team under unreasonable pressure.  The departments are separated without much interaction between the worker bees and this is a basic disconnect.
good,"A typical day consisted of answering numerous phone calls back to back about medical claims, eligibility, and benefits. Some calls were more complicated than others. We dealt with overpayments, check stops/reissues and underpayments."
good,Working at Aetna was a positive experience and allowed case managers to work from home. The difficult part of working at Aetna was the number of hours needed to complete the job.
good,"Constantly new things. Very stressful environment, high demand, opportunity for advancement, not very stable job, friendly people, constantly have new ideas."
good,Aetna is working to maintain integrity in a complex industry that is ever evolving and stretching. Daily change management and adaptability are crucial in todays healthcare market.
good,"I am a Provider Service Rep"
good,"this company picks favorites, the company is self is wonderful ,its the management who is not showing care to all employers"
good,"If you want to clock in and clock out and not worry about losing your job or advancing with more responsibility this is your place. I met some great people here but almost never within management. "
good,"I work remotely from my home, I have a section of my house dedicated to working. I boot up my computer, log in to my phone and desktop through a VPN connection. I bring up my systems, then log into the queue at 8:35 am MST and proceed to take inbound calls from facilities needing to get cases or authorizations for Inpatient (IN), Residential (RTC), Partial Hospitalization (PHP), Intensive Outpatient (IOP) or routine outpatient services for mental health and substance abuse. I have scheduled breaks and lunch during the time from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm MST. "
good,"My typical day at work includes a very demanding work load.  My department has very tight turn around times and they hold us to a high standard of accuracy.  Our minimum goal is 99%.   I usually have several contracts assigned to me to implement along with several side projects.  I'm also the SME (subject matter expert) for the less experienced analyst on the floor. I have enjoyed developing a good working relationships with my co-workers. We rely on one another to problem solve and work thought the more complex implementations."
good,"A typical day was working in the field interacting with all types of people. I learned that I like interacting with people. The management was great because you pretty much managed yourself due to the nature of the work. The co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was when it ended and the most enjoyable part of of it was the job itself, independently working and interacting with others."
good,"Aetna can be a great place to work provided you have a good manager or director. The middle management dictates the stress level and level of collaboration in your department.  The biggest issue is the fact that you are worried about getting laid off twice a year, and the job insecurity has eroded the company culture."
good,I enjoyed working for the company overall. Management like any other job is about politics.  Work your butt off and you'll be rewarded. I worked my way up to a great job. The quality analyst job was a lot of attention to detail. flexible schedule in the are I had.  I worked 4 10s Tuesday-Friday and loved having Mondays off I started anywhere from 4-11am.
good,It was hard to move up. They were regularly cutting positions and slimming down management. Not a bad thing just not a lot resources for frontline workers.
good,If you don't mind poor training and mixed information between management and employees then this is the job for you. Management has no idea how to manage and regional manager is absent 99% of the time
good,"I gained a great deal of experience, really learned a lot. The knowledge acquired will really take me far, and keep me wanting to learn more. I would recommend this company to others."
good,metrics that are not provided to you until 2 months after for monthly review.  Environment  is very negative and coworkers are very rude.  You can walk down the hallways and maybe 1/10 will say hi.
good,the job was fun and challenging a few years ago.  In the last few years we seem only to be concerned about the bottom line and not about our members and employees.  I know that we raised the base pay to $16.00 per hour and that was great for those employees!  In the skilled positions we have lost employees to other companies that are paying them better and we are not filling many of those roles causing more work to be done by less people.
good,It used to be a great company.  I think it needs to change it’s upper management every 5 years like it used to.  Working hours can be long every day and can even include weekends/holidays.  It seems like they are always going through a reorganization.
good,"Aetna was a place I was extremely excited to start working at. After training, I was thrilled to have my own desk on the floor working under a supervisor that would help me succeed in my career with Aetna. However things were much different than what we were told it would be like in training. After working there for quite some time it took a toll on my mental health and no longer was what I wanted to do. It felt like the managers were only willing to work with certain people to get them advanced and I had already missed that mark."
good,"I worked 7 days a week for 13 weeks straight; anywhere from 10 to 14 hours a day and was reprimanded for not working a particular SATURDAY in which I had a family emergency.  "
good,Typical day was relaxing and energetic. I worked with a great team and under good management. I loved the employee perks geared towards health improvements.
good,Every day was a new experience. Policy and procedures changed like the weather. Had to adapt quickly and go with it. Never enough time in the day to get everything done.
good,I worked from home with the short and long term disability benefit departments as a vocational rehabilitation consultant.  I left Aetna after they hired a new manager who did not manage well and finally terminated me because I filed a stress related workers compensation claim.
good,"The company eliminated dedicated employees who worked for over 10 or more years because they wanted to outsource their business overseas, Instead of keeping it in the USA!"
good,Day to day operations vary. There are many issues that need to be solved for our customers. Review of many systems to find root cause. Management didn't delegate appropriately - disconnected from employees actual responsibilities
good,"Aetna has a great work life balance, especially if you get to work from home. The management is slowly revolving to better since the company has been acquiring other companies which has greatly enriched it's culture."
good,"Over my 27 year career I learned about business, networking, relationships and that the IT side of the business was more lucrative for me than the business side. Each year the threat of being laid off grew as did the stress of the unknown. I found myself wanting to work with people again, rather than being committed to just the data."
good,A great place to be if you have the right leader managing you instead of micro managing employee. Employee under a manager needs to be a leader and someone that would be willing to let people grow and expand and give them the ability to succeed. the job enough is very stressful and some people you work with are just there collecting paychecks. another issues is working with a virtual manager whom you cannot see their appearance because they are miles away from you as a result there is no personal or physical appearance to be able to adapt the type of person they are.
good,I liked the challenges provided to me while I was at Aetna.  I only left because of a poor manager.  But I like the people I worked with and the work I did.
good,"Benefit packages are expensive, pay high premiums and still have high deductibles.  Have a changing work schedule which make work life balance complicated to obtain.  Great PTO but can't always use PTO depending on coverage. Ability to work from home if maintain a certain score as well as put in time in the office to demonstrate personal responsibility."
good,No one day is the same.  You learn something new everyday.  Great company to work for but managers of individual departments could use some management training.
good,"Aetna is a great place to start your career, they offer a great succession plan for managers. I however have not been able to move up."
good,"I logged in at my scheduled time and began to take inbound calls from providers and members in efforts to quote medical, dental and vision benefits and claims information"
good,"Very busy F CM position. I am new to CM field and it is great learning experience. Due to speaking Spanish , my travel is quite extensive often up to 3 hrs away. Co worker very eager to support team ."
good,"Aetna is an excellent company to work for. However, the environment is only as good as your supervisor. The fact that this is a healthcare company and the employees pay so much for their benefits is disheartening."
good,Managing employees and sub-contractors on a daily basis. Frequent travel to surrounding states. This job offers me the freedom to manage my crews. I love the freedom and the people i work with.
good,The work was fast pace and a learning experience. I enjoyed my time within this company and believe I have grown within the healthcare field. The hardest part of this job is communication.
good,The Pharmacy team is a well educated bunch but the team leads and supervisors are not experienced enough for their positions
good,"4 to 5 new cases a day."
good,The drive is too far. The company has work from home opportunities but I was not offered a work from home opportunity. You really don't interact much with Managers or Supervisors
good,Good company to work for. The company changed CEO's twice during my time and the culture changed along with it.  There was a lot of work life balance.  Managment is a litte shady though.  I feel that hiring should be back in the hands of Human Resources to ensure fair hiring practices.
good,Working for Aetna is a wonderful challenging place to work. You learn new and more exciting things every day. Your knowledge is put to work and enhanced.
good,Aetna was a typical call center experience.  They were focused on productivity more than actual customer service. I enjoyed working with the customers and providing them with resolutions to their problems and answering their questions.  It was difficult to keep up with the constant changes. Lay offs were constantly hanging over everyone.  Several coworkers were laid off.
good,"Although the pay and benefits were good, the company was more for minorities and diversity, rather than employees as a whole."
good,I worked independently on projects. I worked at home the last three and half years.
good,Great work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job was the culture and the people within the organization.
good,"SRC an Aetna Company has great folks, but no one really cares about getting real work done."
good,"I learned how to outsource work from Microsoft Outlook to work at home staff in Maryland. I had a varitety of duties including small dollar claim negotiaions, order and ship supplies to staff, complete daily paper claims and cancellations. I retrieved financial information from billing company forwarding to staff for work up."
good,"It’s a good job but it’s a call center so keep that in mind, that’s the kind of culture it is. But it’s good pay and benefits .. so it’s worth it. Also you can get overtime"
good,"Currently retired after working 34 years for company.  Aetna provided a great working experience and offered many great benefits including medical, dental and also a 401K plan that they matched dollar for dollar."
good,"Start of the day usually around 8 am. Accepted inbound calls. Out bound calls were directly towards client's who hadn't enrolled yet. Calls were only done to inform client's of their prescription drug coverage changes, as well as, open enrollment period."
good,It was a very productive call center environment. Very fast paced work environment. The company provided very good healthcare benefits and vacation pay.
good,"I had to compiled medical information to be mailed out to doctors, lawyer and sometime the customer.  Looking through medical records made the day go by. The job was good and I worked there for over a year. Management was good. Management let us (temporary) workers go because everybody was to begin to work at home."
good,This company taught me how to process claims. How to work well with others and how to make sure that the customers vibes first. I love the flex time also.
good,"Wonderful company to work for, I would recommend. I would also recommend that the senior staff incorporates more with the whole company. It was great working there, ok environment, good people."
good,"it is indeed a tough job to be in this company (in collaboration with WNS) less perks, no life-work balance as it is a 24/7 operating company which is not like that before (it has weekends off and shifts are just from earliest is 8PM (MNL time) to 11AM closer"
good,"They promote from within, so management style doesn't change. They do promote health and wellness, and offer a wide range of health incentives. The floor plans are frustrating. Seating is cubicle-style, but there are no walls, just windows, and the open floor plan offers no privacy. You cannot call clients without being heard by everyone passing by or sitting around you, which is also frustrating for the clients. The telecommute options are slim as well."
good,"I loved working at Aetna because I am a People person and enjoyed helping the patients, However I was very dissappointed in the management, some workers were too laid back and did not take their job seriously,it was patients life and well being that was involved,also I did not like the fact that mostly everyone was on their Personal Cell phone during business hours."
good,"CEO chose favorites- not really engaged in the overall of employees- not easy to communicate with staff. The work was good and steady. Able to complete tasks in a timely manner. Supported the medical staff. MY CMO was professional and communication was great. Had very good working relationship. Enjoyed coming to work and receiving projects to work on to increase skills and enhance more software skills, learning new ways of doing the work better and working on ways to streamline processes."
good,Be wary on what team you end up on. The Marriott team is the worst. The current manager is unprofessional and into micromanagement. Always being singled out got old and I started standing up for myself but never a good idea.
good,"They are outsourcing a lot of the jobs like mine to Manila, but for those who keep their jobs, its a good place to work."
good,"Aetna exposed me to all aspects of the cost report process.  This knowledge has been invaluable in my development as a professional.  Without all the area's of work there, I would not be where I am."
good,More room for advancement is needed as well as supervisor that are knowledgeable. Training does not prepare you for the tasks that you will be facing. The benefits are good.
good,I was there for quite a while until they hired a new supe from outside the company. She was younger and less experienced and didn't have a lot of AHCCCS and healthcare background. Apparently we didn't get along because she fired me. Depends on which office you work at I guess.
good,"It can get stressful.  However, management was great.  Did not micro managed employees.  As long as the work was done, management allowed some freedom and independent decision making when working. Salary could be better."
good,"Daily tasks & priorities change quickly, very challenging to keep up with changes.  Was very fortunate to work with a wonderful team who appreciated my support"
good,Very relaxed atmosphere. I was able to work from home one day a week which I loved. I left because there was no where to go. My manager lived in Tennessee and didn't know me personally.
good,"I did love the fact that I was able to work from home and on my own hours. Towards the end of my years with the company, the micro-management that was being performed in the department was becoming unbearable along with personal reasons is the overall reason that I decided to leave the company."
good,"It was good place to work, the management was a little over barring. The pay wasn't enough for the jobs that I did there. Lack of communication between management and employees."
good,I learned a lot about the precertification process for many procedures such as gastric bypass and skin removal surgery. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,they did wel at they did alot of hours couldnt ask for more theres alot to be understood with them though they can be rude at times because they know u can be replaced
good,"The company has modest profits and the CEO earns a modest salary. One nice benefit (they may still do this) was that after 30 days, you are 100% vested in the company."
good,"My days were based on working orders by adjudicate patients prescriptions, updating members information and verifying  insurance over the phone."
good,"good company to work for PM  or BA role. for development roles, most of development jobs are outsourced to consulting companies hence less job security. Benefits are excellent with 401k match."
good,"It's not really a hard job and the flexible schedule is a perk. However, if you're trying to advance in your career you're kind of stuck."
good,"Great company to work at, excellent inexpensive benefits. Poor management that lack proactive plans for leadership. Unable to deliver on promises which decreases moral  for employees and integrity for many departments. ."
good,Enjoyed working at Aetna.  Company says to expect change and it does. Diverse group of employees.  There is a great spirit of volunteerism.
good,There is a lot of variety in what we do- every day is different...it is great to be able to work from home.  Job eliminations are an unfortunate part of the corporate world however.
good,"I have been with Coventry for over 8 years, we were acquired by Aetna.. As far as Aetna goes, good pay, decent benefits however the division I work for (workers comp) is being outsourced so we have experienced lay offs twice already in the past 6 months."
good,too new to rate the many facets of the company with a fair review. The department and position I hold are new and there is no comparison to make against other departments in the company.
good,very busy and productive environment.  Field based and fast paced.  Good about keeping up with required trainings and courses.
good,In 2011 they experienced multiple layoffs due to the merger with Coventry
good,Work load manageable but contract was not guaranteed. Responsibilities for the case manager included discharge planning and coordination of services with multiple disciplines.
good,"Aetna is a high performance Health Insurance Company.  It performs its mission.  However, it has become what America has come to define capitalism.  My opinion of that definition, and I understand it is my definition, is that it has become a method for making its senior management wealthy.  It no longer worked for me."
good,"Aetna is a good place to work, room for advancement but also numerous changes have to be flexible and adaptable at all times."
good,Working at Aetna I was able to improve my skills when it came to learning more of the medical insurance
good,"Typical work day is taking phone calls for participants about their flexible spending healthcare/dependent care accounts.  I learned more about how flexible spending accounts work, and how to read EOBs and itemized receipts.  Management was management, and not everyone was on the same page.  Co-workers were amazing and exciting to work with.  The hardest part of the job, there really was not too much that was hard.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when they would have food for us during busy season."
good,"The money was great, I loved the people that I worked with. However, the job duties did not allow for a lot of social contact. We were able to set our own hours, within reason, which was great, because at the time my two children were young."
good,"My typical day working for Aetna was being priortizing duties and managing time to accomplish my job. While working for Aetna, I learned about compliance, consumer rights and laws in the insurance / healthcare industry. I learned all aspects of underwriting: pre-sold business, standard quoting, risk assessment, new & renewal business underwriting. In addition, learned rating methodologies, gained medical & ancillary product knowledge, commission processing, heavy broker/customer contact, and public speaking skills. Also, worked closely with implementation, broker liaision, billing, A/R, enrollment, & eligibility depts to resolve issues, While working for Aetna, I was able to work with knowledgable and experience management level employees in order to further develop my underwriting knowledge and work on special projects."
good,There was never a dull moment. From handling claims & calls to dealing with coworkers.
good,"It is a good place to work with. I have lots of opportunities to learn new technologies and make decisions during the work. Also, the location is good, short commute."
good,"the job was fine. no room for advancement. the job did not match my skills and strengths. "
good,I enjoyed my job at Aetna.  I was going back and forth trying to decide if I wanted to move to a promotion that was giving me an opportunity to move up with the degree I had.  A lot of team work. Not micromanaged. It treats employees like actual adults and not like children.  They are respectable of personal issues and families.
good,"I had a lot of experience prior to my job at Aetna, but Aetna was where it was more finely crafted to near perfection and professionalism. "
good,"A typical day at work would consist of a lot of customer communications, assisting members on their issues and following up with them and trying to resolved their concerns as soon as possible."
good,"Aetna provided me with opportunities to grow my career and learn about different areas of the business.  I was able to develop skills in project management, vendor management, and program development."
good,Overall a good place to work. Normal office concerns and issues. Large company room for advancement. Management is fair. Cafeteria is pretty cool lots of varieties of food to choose from.
good,Their training process is super detailed and that's great. Training of that caliber is crucial in being able to process requests for patients undergoing chemo or needing vital medication.
good,"Sometimes its stressful sometimes its fun, its also challenging and cause you to aspire to do more, managers are also nice sometimes. Late hours and working weekends."
good,"Aetna has a great work envirnoment to work in. Magament is amazing and accomodating to employees that are seeking addiontional degrees, professional certificates, and upward mobility."
good,"Long hours, long days. Very stressful department. Benefits were decent, high deductible medical plans, generous PTO. No employee recognition/appreciation on the local level. Company changed not for the better after CVS merger."
good,It was ok. Enjoyed processing. Enjoyed flex schedules. They're are an abundance of career opportunities. Benefits are pretty good. Good location. Cafe
good,"You just go to work little time to make friends, work environment was good very clean, everyone is very friendly, but the you are paid to be on the phones so there is little time to make friends or feel at home."
good,"Overall general work environment , I feel you get minimal acknowledgement for the hard work but the people you work with make it with it.  It was overall a nice place to start a career;"
good,Friendly environment which a lot helped to work on my skills and learn few more and grow professionally. I was involved in daily standup and SCRUM calls every two weeks. Strong team player.
good,Phone calls to patients to assist them in getting their care and insurance coverage. Follow up with doctor's and social workers involved in patient care.
good,This was a very fast paced but fun place to work. The training was exceptional and there was plenty of assistance when you were on your own. There was always something to do and very little down time.
good,Busy fast paced environment.  Great training and preparation for handling customer service calls.  A typical day goes by fast and your peers are eager to help you when needed.
good,They lay off folks every year.  Telework is a plus. Supervisors were helpful.  I would go back..  Cost of health care was nothing compared to the market rate.
good,Aetna is a great place to work! Provided great training and set the foundation for my professional career. friendly people and decent benefits. thanks!
good,"Since the acquisition of Aetna by CVS, we have seen a lot of great movement and momentum.  Hopeful to see the trajectory continue in the future with a focus on health and wellness."
good,"Great place to work and even better great benefits.  Lots of room to grow due to size and volume of work.   Leadership seems engaged with the employees.  Perks include health rewards, working from home and flexible hours."
good,opportunity to grow is there. willingness for management to acknowledge  you as the talent is tough. i worked closely with management and MD's and watched as others got the positions i was well qualified for.
good,"Expands my understanding and experiences with individuals with autism. One of the benefits in reference to working with the client was the ability to spend quality time with him, engaging in activities that are meaningful to him."
good,"Typical day at work make sure productivity quota is reached ."
good,"With constant new businesses and shifts in the leadership of this company, it can be very unsettling since you don't know what s tyle your potentially new manager will bring to the table. A health plan was acquired and was handed responsibility for many departments. This went badly and as a result they lost almost all legacy Aetna people. Now with a Retail drug store poised to take, over things may shift again. I wish them all good luck, I was very fortunate to have a great experience at Aetna but it was premerger of the above."
good,"Learned:"
good,"In a world where there are increasing demands on the pharmacist, Aetna RX Home Delivery was a great place to work. They truly provided unmatched flexibility when it came to scheduling shifts. There were great benefits such as 6% matching 401k, starting at 140 hours PTO, and work-at-home capabilities. Unfortunately, the company merged with CVS and our services were no longer needed and we were laid off."
good,"Working at Aetna was my first real full time job and I loved it, I learned what delivering great customer service means.  I learned so much an would recommend this company to anyone looking for stability."
good,"Flexible start times"
good,"It's been many years since I was employed with Aetna.  However, it was a very good place to work.  Unfortunately the closed their Louisville office and I lost my job."
good,It was nice working for Aetna in Orlando it would've been a better experienced if I had a more caring supervisor. She gave me a really hard time during my pregnancy and made it difficult for me to enjoy work.
good,Aetna provides a good experience with a variety of opportunities to grow.  It is a large company and will provide employees with the opporutnity to work in a fortune 50 company and learn about the demands of a large company as well as the demands of the healthcare industry.
good,My first company as a UM Nurse. It taught me about Utilization Management. It was fun and it open my eye to a different perspective about nursing. I made lots of friends and make me to pursue UM in my career.
good,It was an overall okay job.. Just didn't make enough money. Every 2 weeks you'll almost get a $300 check sometimes less. Easy part time job though....
good,"Given that I am an insurance broker appointed with Aetna, I work from home. Unfortunately, as far as I am aware, they don't have a lead program, so I have to generate my own, but that tends to be standard in this industry."
good,"Typical day of work is reconciling accounts and reviewing discrepancy reports to send to customers.  Once that is completed I will work with the eligibility consultant coordinate any eligibility issues found on the reports that need to be resolved. "
good,Not a bad place to work. Great flexibility. Good benefits. Sometimes hard to move up. Production based in most departments. Have to be able to handle change.
good,A lot of backstabbing you have to be very careful about what you say or it will be taken out of context by your coworkers and possibly reported. Good benefits
good,"Very fast paced and stressful, on the phone being monitored most of everyday. Weekly training. Not much time off of the phone to process claims. Good bonuses, vacation and paid time off, insurance, 401K, stocks."
good,Nice place to work. I would work there again. They are moving to another location which is a few exits up from where they are now so they are expanding.
good,"From what I remember at Aetna, the management was excellent but there seemed to be no room for advancement during the time I worked there.  Co-workers were very helpful during the training period."
good,"I worked for Aetna in Ohio this company is a good place to work "
good,i really liked it there great benefits great people the only thing they had to let people go. i would def like to go back to this company it was a great place to work overall
good,The Environment is good and a very family friendly employer. Typical Day would sign in and receive my spread for the day and Begin processing claims from Void/Deny or for further investigation .
good,I worked as a recruitment process outsourced contracted through Sevenstep. I mostly worked on clinical/nurse openings. I am now working with the CVS Health/Aetna intergration.
good,I was the team lead of 4 assistants that serviced 20 sales representatives.  I was the also the Executive Assistant to the District Manager with her 4 sales managers.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Aetna,very enjoyable atmosphere, great team work as well. The culture there was one that was open and everyone was very friendly and easy to work with."
good,"My biggest thing about this job was management. Other than that its a wonderful place to work, a typical work day is normal, inbound and out bound calls. I learned a lot about the other side of the pharmacy that you don`t see."
good,I learned group health claims processing skills as well as customer service skills.  I found Aetna to be a great training experience for health insurance claims experience.
good,"My typical day at work was fast paced. Always able to learn new things. I enjoyed all the people I worked with, they made it easy to ask questions. Everyone was always willing to help."
good,I worked there a short time as a CSR for dental insurance claims. It was fast passed. They had a great training program. Management was very hands off.
good,"Overall a good company, but had to leave due to personal reasons. Learned a lot about work ethics. Received good seminars on conducting good case managing activities."
good,A typical day is very busy; many deadlines; will definitely increase one's knowledge and skill set; competitive salary; co-workers were great to work with
good,"Too many nonsense meetings."
good,I had the pleasure of working with many people from many diverse backgrounds that really were dedicated to helping people. Department processes also were well vetted to ensure that departments ran smoothly.
good,muy bien las capacitaciones y desarrollo laboral y salarial
good,"Upper Mamagememt Cared about the staff"
good,Management was terrible but team members and coworkers were awesome. Worked there for almost a decade and culture changed dramatically from being very team and employee oriented to being focused on results and production. Workload increased as people were laid off and raises and bonuses were cut.
good,"I worked as a temp for the HEDIS season. The training was stellar and provided me with all of the knowledge I needed to perform the function as a seasonal HEDIS nurse. Absolutely loved the work and desired to continue, but the temporary project ended after 4 months."
good,"I worked for many years in the specialty products area. The overall company is fantastic, however leadership in some areas has something to be desired."
good,They really sold the fact that they promote within. Most of the employees was very happy there and has been there for a long time. You have to be on time and at work all the time or they will let you go.
good,For a job right out of university I have had a great run in this position.  The only reason I am leaving is because I want to move out to the west coast and it won't work with my position.
good,"Good company- highly matrix with old school systems. CEO did try to stay ahead with active social media and was open to town hall, however typical politics as with any company. Would work there again."
good,"The prior auth department was very quick paced, the co workers are great people, Was a nice office setting and not a stressful department. Hard to get off though"
good,"I've worked at the company for many years.  There are plenty of people and business units who care and who work very hard to help the beneficiaries of our health plans.  However the company is too federated and that impacts its effectiveness.  Internal IT services are expensive, slow, and often ineffective.  Company leadership talks about how excited they are about the things the company is doing but there doesn't seem to be any real progress from period to period.  There are too many people in the company for any group of effective people to drive the real change they would want to see. Those people move on in their careers from the company while those who resist change stay behind.  I had good times and stressful times at this company, but again it depends on which group you are a part of."
good,Excellent company to work for and opportunity to grow and learn.  When I first started at Aetna I was able to move up after 1 year and 6 months and I was able to take on more responsibilities!
good,Aetna was not committed to the National Account space. The leadership team's goals were not consistent with the staff's goals and therefore the team didn't function effectively.
good,I enjoyed the customer service about this job. Being able to assist clients with concerns with medication refills. The hardest part was learning their computer system within 2 days.
good,"busy dept . sometimes to busy to give the amt to time you would like to each member. can be stressful depending on the dept."
good,"If you are interested in moving out or up, there are opportunities within Aetna, provided you are still interested in managed care or insurance. It is a fast paced environment, with frequent changes."
good,"This is a very stressful job , Production and quality based, There is a lot of pressure from upper management.  This is a job where things change constantly, you definitely have to stay on your toes."
good,"The job is very redundant and doesn't call for a lot of brain power. It tends to be very busy from November until about April/May and then calms down from May/October. It's not a hard job to do, however, with the constant changes that management makes (usually on a weekly basis), it makes it hard to keep up with all the procedures and processes. That to me is the hardest part of the job."
good,"Very large company selling and administering health insurance benefits. All employee benefits are available, 401k, health, dental, life insurance and other coverage."
good,"the place has good environment, my first supervisor was great.Iliked talking to all the members and liked the problem solving on the daily, I disliked telling members an answer they did not want to hear."
good,Good company.  You can reach out to designated managers if you have any questions. Once a week they have meeting to see if you have any questions about your work.
good,"1.Phones in the morning from 8am to 10am  "
good,"It's a great place for young people to start their employment.  I don't have a issue with the job just want different type of environment. The people are decent, as long as you go to work on time you don't have a issue."
good,I enjoyed working at Aetna for the most part. I was there for over 18 yrs and learned a lot. Worked with a lot of nice people.  They have good bonuses.
good,"Overall a good experience with this company, ability to try new challenges within the case management department provided.  I found that Managed Care was not my forte and work comp was."
good,This is by far one of the toughest cultures I have ever worked in. People are not focused on doing what is right they are focused on what will help them politically.
good,Aetna is a great place to work with the appropriate manager. Aetna has great advancement opportunities for anyone willing to work for it. Aetna provides great benefits to employees.
good,Employment at Aetna is a fairly standard corporate environment. I left after my temporary assignment ended so as to finish my degree. The pay and benefits are all fairly standard and there is opportunity for advancement. As with any corporation my only real criticism was often bureaucracy stifled innovation.
good,This place was a nice place to work but I did not like that the fact they really focus on quantity verses quality. I kind have grown there but management played a lot of favoritism.
good,You should always be willing to learn something new everyday. You never know when you may be pulled for a special project. Working in the insurance field rules are always changing
good,"On a typical day, I would answer an average of 60 calls a day.  Even though the call volume can get crazy, the co-workers made it fun.  There was always a manager available to help out with difficult calls.  Managers also, insure that everyone is trained to the fullest.  I enjoyed helping callers understand their benefits and felt like I was helping them."
good,I enjoyed working for this company and my co-workers. Always had something to do as for working and keeping busy. enjoyed my co-workers and very team players. A good company to work for and all the people are very nice.
good,"I help Medicaid & CHIP members by help resolve their complaints and appeals.  For example, if a member shows inactive and they're trying to obtain their medication, I make sure after research and verification that they're able to obtain it and apologize for any issues they've experienced.  At the end of the day, it's all about the member being satisfied"
good,I have enjoyed my time working at Aetna and it has given me the essential tools to be able to progress from what I have learnt. Working in client client services has been rewarding and has given me the chance to meet some great people.

good,"Generally a good place to work. Exceptional work-life benefits for people with young children or caregiving responsibilities. Numerous work-at home options."
good,I was with this company for 17 years and was blindsided and laid off one day. I would go back in a heartbeat to get my salary back and PTO bank. I miss working there
good,"Great place to work. I Have no regrets at all. Fun, casual environment. Great group of people to work with. Work place is an older building that needs a lot of work."
good,This was a great company to work for as an employee new to the workforce. The agency offered opportunities for advancement. Management was supportive of employees who wanted increased responsibilities.
good,"Excellent company to work for, with challenging projects and good work/life balance.  This, however, was not the case during my last years with the company, with constant reorganizations, the threat of layoffs and receding benefits."
good,"- Answer questions and resolve issues based on phone calls/letters from members, providers, and plan sponsors"
good,"Flexible hours, 4 day work week and work from home, discounts for  local merchants.  Productive weekly meetings and promotion potential always."
good,"Meet daily call metrics "
good,"This position is the best position I've ever acquired. I worked for an amazing supervisor and great dept, unfortunately the dept closed."
good,"Great company to work for, hard to advance because everyone loves their jobs and nobody will leave their position. You are responsible for how far you want to take your career with this company."
good,"Typical day at work included loaded providers into our OH+ and Actisure data bases."
good,"Great benefits. Poor Management. Can wear Jeans everyday. Work expections are horrible, to much work to do in one day need to hire accordingly. High turn over."
good,"If we do ours work on time it easy to manage our other work, Daily we have learned a lot of new things while working. Our management is up to mark and cooperate with us in critical situations."
good,Good company to work for and learn under. Hard working staff under guidance of leads and management. Very formal documentations.

good,"Great employees that are fun to work with and very helpful when needed for onboarding and daily activities."
good,"Continually growing and fast paced environment"
good,This is where I learned all about being a pharmacy tech. I had great teachers to learn from. The hardest part of the job was the angry customers about their prescriptions.
good,I love my boss and my team but I feel like we get asked to do everything but don't get paid enough for all we do. Their was a lot of drama going on outside my team and I felt that was negative energy that I didn't want to be around.
good,"Overall experience was good."
good,"Productive and Fun, I learned much about Medications in the American Market, Medicare Plan Details and requirements, and types of coverage determination."
good,"Great company to work for, would probably of still be there if they didnt downsize their production staff. Very family friendly"
good,I worked at Aetna for over 20 yrs because of the flexible hours and the benefits.  Aetna is a company with value and integrity.  The company provides morale and growth opportunity for employees.  I was laid off due to budget cut in the department.  I would have work there till retirement if I have given the option.
good,"Great people and treated you well. Busy place to work, one downside is they are not clear with new products and contracts gets very confusing and causes you to make mistakes with costumers."
good,Answering phone and transfer client to the correct department for the question to be answered. This was a front line position for Aetna and enjoyed my position working there .

good,Assist IT departments with conducting SOX and SOC 1 Testing and responding to ADHOC customer request for proposal audit general control compliance questions.
good,"Aetna lives and works by a set of core values.  Which allows employees to grow professionally. There are many tools and opportunities available that support creativity, innovation and integrity."
good,"This was a work at home job.  It was hard for me to keep track of how many hours I actually worked and found myself working many, many more hours than I was scheduled to work.  I usually outworked the productivity metrics because I outworked myself and the others.  I never could figure out when to stop working.  I really enjoyed my job and could work well into the night.  I worked so many hours  because I liked it, and it did not feel like work to me.  I could go on doing it all day and all night, but I feel like I lacked the personal discipline to know when to stop working.  Yet, I liked it so much that I did not want to stop.  It is what happens when you love doing what you do for a living."
good,"Just didn't like the supervisors, I feel that I was discriminated  against, and I think I would still be there if It wasn't for him I would still be there. Other than that I loved the company."
good,"A typical day as a health concierge involves assisting member with their healthcare needs. I explain their medical benefits to them and answer any questions they have about benefits and/or claims. I also reach out to providers, collection agencies, and billing companies on behalf of the member to help resolve outstanding issues."
good,"Good work/life balance. It is hard to advance in this company. Poor management, you are asked for feedback during annual employee surveys but nothing is done to correct the problems. Managers play favoritism."
good,This was a good place to work. The location was in a good location. Close to the freeway and not that far from downtown. They had upgraded the campus when I was last there. Made a big difference with the on site fitness center
good,"I am not comfortable submitting a review for this company, the HR department uses this sight as well to check on canidates."
good,"Review for accuracy and process medical and dental claims.  Train incoming employees, set up and perform claim demos for incoming clients and at risk companies."

good,Many opportunities to advance employment. Unlimited growth potential. Good exposure to cooperate work environment. Great benefits and compensation package. High turnover rate.
good,"Well defined management structure. Supports multi culture environment."
good,"Typically a full day consists of answering calls related to benefits, claims, etc.  Various benefit levels of insurance knowledge are a must when working for Aetna and being able to interpret claim data and medical terminology are a must.  In order to thoroughly understand the work requirements, it is better to either be interested in the medical field or have previously worked in this arena."
good,"Be driven to succeed. If you want to do well here, take ownership of your development. Network, meet new people. There are some good people here."

good,Aenta has been around for a long time.  They are stable and proactive.  Aetna has a strong culture and wants to do the right thing for the right reason.
good,Not a place I would want to work for again. Co-workers were okay
good,Work days were busy but had a fun team of co-workers. Learned how to get through difficult days relying on positive co-workers. Management was concerned with the welfare of the employees. Co-workers were always supportive. Challenging population. Co-workers made the job fun and seeing the patients improve.
good,This is a call center position which taught me how to maximize my time management skills.  Management standards are met and co-workers are professional.  This job requires the ability to resolve complex claim payment disputes using multiple resources to interpret contractual agreements.
good,The aspect of working at home is a great plus and afforded much flexibility
good,good job for starting in the ins industry. good training for focus and dealing with insured members.

We followed Agile/Scrum process to gather requirement.
good,Aetna is an international managed care company. Co-workers are very dedicated.
good,"Typical day starts at 8AM and ends at 5PM.  Learned all about case management when I started with the insurance company.  Management is wonderful, very approachable and more than willing to lend a hand.  Co-workers are dependent, reliable, and fun to work with.  Hardest part may be having to work from home and not seeing my co-workers face to face, but I still enjoy working from home.  Enjoyable part is establishing a great rapport with some of my members and their families."
good,Good company to work for with yearly compensation review and flexible work schedules available. Leadership is innovative and encourages employees to do the same. Talent development is a value. Employees and leadership work hard. Like any fortune 50+ companies change is a constant.

good,"It was an OK work environment and was a learning experience. "
good,"Aetna is a good place to work very modern with their computer systems, at times it felt that you had to belong to a group to feel part of them. It took a lady 3 years to call me by name."
good,"My position at Aetna has allowed me to become involved in all areas of the business – customer service, provider relations, credentialing, claims, delegation oversight, compliance, administrative assistance, and IT. I feel that I have had very strong leadership – people who have helped shape me over the last two years. Aetna has a positive culture; it is a place to grow, find confidence, build relationships, and prove one’s self."

good,Great company to work for and gain the experience I needed in the healthcare insurance industry.
good,The environment was highly productive and intensive. I learnt alot in medical field.
good,"Before and after the fiasco of the US Healthcare merger, Aetna was awesome.  The original culture of Aetna was back.  Aetna had very good benefits, even though they increased the hours from 37.5 a week to 40 hours a week with no increase in salary, and combined time off to a PTO bank, vs, vacation, sick and personal time, therefore losing several days a year, it was still a very good company to work for."
good,One of the best things about Aetna is the flexible work schedules and work at home opportunities.  Almost all employees enjoy either full time or partial work at home time.
good,"Aetna Inc is a nationally recognized organization offering commercial, mediare advantage, and medicaid product lines.  Aetna employs a diverse culture with experienced personnel.  As part of the organization I have been give the opportunity to learn many aspects of contracting including hospital, physicians, ancillary and vendor arrangements.  I recently had the opportunity to manage and move a department from one state to another.  This involved hiring of new staff, onboarding, and training of new staff.  I moved to Ohio to lead a 88 county network build for Medicaid and met all requirements of the RFA.  I am looking to move back to the east coast."
good,Excellent job to work; pays well and has great benefits. However the hours are inflexible;making it difficult to attend school.
good,Aetna is a strong fortune 500 company and an excellent place to build a career. It is customer focused while at the same time recognizing the need for work life balance.
good,"Overall ""Aetna"" is a good company to work for. I learned alot there and Aetna became my home away from home. My co-workers were like family, we cried, laughed, and struggled through all of the good and bad times together. The intensity of the job was how you made it."

good,Lots of smart innovative people with high integrity. Good opportunities to gain valuable experience and grow professionally.
good,"Was terrific to work for, only downfall was the amount of work that was required, quanity not quality of work. Co-workers helped out alot, and management tried to keep everyone excited about their job. Only downfall was office closed and moved to Columbus, Oh and didn't take alot of employees."
good,Must meet quality and production standards
good,"hours 8-5, very rewarding work, feels great solving issue with claim/benefit issues"
good,"Everyone is required to be very focused while at work. I was chosen from my department to go on business trips; & learned how to teach new applications to other employees. My coworkers were very friendly, yet serious about getting the job for the day done in a timely manner, as was I."
good,Temporary worker for over a year. Down sized due to contract negotiations. A Good company if you are hired on permanent. The one constant is change in all call center environments. Be Flexible .
good,Aetna is a very structured environment. Very nice if you come to work and do your job. The rules are clear and enforced. This is perfect for people whole like structure.
good,I took early retirement when Aetna offered it a second time as I saw the company was not the same as it used to be when I was first hired. Too much competition with managers and coworkers
good,"There are a lot of changes occurring due to the ever-changing landscape of healthcare in the US, coupled with the recent acquisition by CVS and the integration of the two companies."
good,Job was clearly defined. Instruction/training minimal but adequate.  Tasks were plentiful.  As a contractor there was no room for advancement but I think a full time employee would do well.
good,"Provided the opportunity to learn about the company and its partners through trainings. Enjoy community involvement by attending health fairs and different walks (Autism, Breast Cancer, ALS, Heart disease and Nami)."
good,"It was a good place to work at, but when cvs took over slot of changers came about. Also the health benefits were not that great. The people there were great. As far as for the management, it could be better"
good,Aetna is a great place to work and grow. Schedules were consistent and employee programs were a highlight of the company culture. I really enjoyed the wellness programs and looked forward to participating in the challenges.
good,"We had committees that engaged the employees in workplace culture.  Employee input helped everyone to be responsible for the work environment and helped to organize employee activities,"
good,Poor training and support.  Equipment is all self setup and start. Supervisory support for training was very slow and poor. Left this employee disenchanted with the company and receiving less than good ratings.
good,"I enjoyed the fact that we had desks that went up in down, in case you wanted to stand. I learned a lot about medical billing/filing claims to insurance companies."
good,"Great place to work. Alot of activities for the employees. I just did not feel the claims training prepared me to handle claim calls with providers. If the training was better then, I would have stayed."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Aeta and it has been challenging, I feel that I am ready to move on to a job with better opportunities. The hardest part of working at my company was communication with the office personnel as I am a work from home employee. The most enjoyable part was being able to do my work on my own."
good,"Typical day: Since it was a remote position, I had minimal contact with other employees. Project started with 2 other team mates but that dwindled to only me within a few months."
good,"The work culture was nice, training was okay but could have been more thorough when it came to the hands on stuff. Most enjoyable part is talking to different customers over the country."
good,I made invaluable connections and relationships with peers during my tenure with Aetna. I was a WAH employee for 3 years and I enjoyed the opportunities I was given and accomplishments I achieved through hard work while employed with Aetna.
good,Job was clearly defined. Instruction/training minimal but adequate.  Tasks were plentiful.  As a contractor there was no room for advancement but I think a full time employee would do well.
good,Great company great pay . This was my first call center job Iam always looking to advance my career to other jobs different positions. I wish this job did not consist of being on the phone all day.
good,"Company's leadership did not work well together, providing middle management with conflicting direction.  Was difficult to know who to listen to.  Some key leaders had zero field experience, were not knowledgeable in local markets, and refused to support market-facing teams."
good,Great company that is flexible and offers tuition reimbursement. Management can be sketchy by unit beware but the overall culture is good. Besides that pretty decent.
good,I loved everything about this job except for management. I didn't even mind the thirty minute lunch. There were so many perks with this job. The hardest part about the job is that the calls were excessive and you really did not have time to prepare for the next call because you were still trying to wrap up the last call.
good,"Because Aetna carries plans that benefit members, we receive daily emails and have daily morning huddles to inform us of any changes or information needed to know how to garner our daily phone calls."
good,It is easy to leave the job behind at the end of the day. There are plenty of job opportunities to apply for from within.  Excellent training program.  You'll be all but certain to know if you are cut out for the job by the end of training.  You'll learning something new just about every day for as long as you work there.
good,"Interesting to work remotely with agents and managers; never did this before...not used to not having management in the office with me. Work flowed easily through OUTLOOK. Even though separated by states and time differences, help was always SKYPE away."
good,This job should have been a remote or work from home assignment based on no supervision or management on location.  The work is not difficult but the workload requirements were unrealistic. I believe that the company underestimated how many people to bring in for this particular project.
good,Aetna has a focus on their employees which was the biggest benefit. In addition Aetna is undergoing major transformation which sets them apart from other companies
good,Aetna promotes an great working environment and culture. Not all follow the visions that are set. if you find a great department the opportunities are endless.
good,"The job I had was a work from home. I went in for meetings weekly. The CRM we used for documentation seemed dated and did not function well, which made working with it taxing.  The management would always say ""are hands are tied."""
good,"The staff is helpful, with providing information in areas you are not sure of and getting through work is manageable. There is also the help line or supervisor available to guide you on a call, and there are different templates that assist you step by step to get through the request of each issues given."
good,"It is vocalized to you that your job is never safe nor guaranteed at Aetna. That being said, it's not a terrible position but do not think you'll have the schedule you were hired on to work."
good,"Aetna provided me a wealth of learning opportunities with wonderful co-workers and career options. During that time, there were many corporate and economic changes occurring."
good,I worked here for a little over 5 years and the benefits were amazing. The healthcare and PTO structure was goood. I only left to pursue more because I didn’t want to be limited to pharmacy
good,"A typical day at work has 6 meetings, many times double or triple booked.  It is a well managed company from strategic viewpoint.  "
good,"Aetna is a productive and good place to work.  It has a well rounded benefits package.  Folks that work at Aetna value integrity and trust.  Overall, Aetna is a place to consider working."
good,And they are a third-party for Aetna and management was never open to anything and they hire their friends and not who is qualify for the job. You have to be in their group.
good,"Great atmosphere it feels like family. Management will be there for you whenever you may ne s them with out hesitation."
good,"Working at Aetna was very informative, I learned a lot about insurance companies. I worked for American Health Holdings which is under the umbrella of Aetna, AHH is very strict and the diversity in culture was lacking. The only thing I did not like was the lack of diversity and the uneasy feeling of being a woman of color."
good,"Great place to work; however, I'm a young and hungry individual, and the culture does not really allow for that.  There is a somewhat set promotion timeline, and you are restricted to your general job function.  It is difficult to really move up in any way besides the set promotion timeline, but the work/life balance is great with 50% work at home schedule after 2 years.  Also, the compensation is less than industry average, which they somewhat balance out with tuition reimbursement."
good,Aetna has great people to work with and several resources available to encourage a healthy lifestyle for employees. Excellent employee opportunities are available.
good,"Had various positions during 22 year employment.  "
good,"Flexible work schedule"
good,Aetna provided the information I needed to have a secure future. We were encouraged to work as a team and to support each other to succeed. My background in FMLA and STD are strong from the training and work that I did in my 8 years there.
good,"Assisting clients with the health plan they have chosen. It's rewarding to help clients navigate the health insurance world, while challenging because of the situations for coverage, you will encounter."
good,Typical call center environment. High stress environment . Very little support from upper management. Very little positive feedback from team leads. Flexible work schedule for some.
good,"You work long hours during open enrollment but the flexible work schedule allows you to manage your life - so I liked the work life balance."
good,"Aetna is a good place to work for that has flexible hours, is a family oriented, normal environment there is friendly, rewarding compensation is ok and the people are great."
good,Good company with constant changes which is normal in healthcare. Usually starts out temp with a chance for hire. Really depends on yourself. Plenty of help from peers eand
good,"All year round was busy, but certain times of the year were high level stress, made work life balance difficult."
good,I enjoyed the employees I work with the culture is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I had opportunities to move up quickly with the company.  They have a great wellness coach!
good,"Aetna sold out to the Hartford and recently sold or merged their medical with CVS so, no job security since no one is sure what Aetna will be selling of next or who they plan to be in the market."
good,"good place to work, good working hours, good environment and good coworkers, great learning experience, flexible schedule, good wellness program, and training"
good,"Working at Aetna has always been fast-paced, challenging, and constantly evolving  with technology and process/workflow. I've collaborated with many dedicated, intelligent and interesting co-workers, have learned so much over the years about Aetna's products and the policy approval and implementation processes, and have had the good fortune of having wonderful and competent direct managers in both jobs I have held at the company."
good,my last role at Aetna was to update provider contracts and geographical information. At times there were some stressful moments however I work well under pressure and wish I still worked there
good,"Aetna is a good place to work as it reacts to being strong on working from home. However, we the employees have high deductible plans (eg. 1,700 single/ 3,400 family). I also feel we are not paid enough and in my department our raises are about .20 per year. bonuses are nice but again only paid once."
good,Strong Linux skills. working in large Health care domain. good at monitoring like zabbix open source.Supported 24/7 high availability production servers
good,"Hoped contract role would progress to f/t employment with Aetna but the opportunity never surfaced upon ending contract.  Good company, fair, work from home 45% time. "
good,Somewhat flexible scheduling. Compensation not comparable with others in industry. Not rewarded for time with company or experience. No discounts for health insurance. Stressful environment. Job security questionable. Employees do not feel valued.
good,"fast paced, always busy, diverse, open, friendly, culture. enjoyed working w/ the hospitals ,updating contracts. Hard when Governor D.M. shut us down."
good,"I was given many opportunities throughout my years at Aetna.  They did offer early retirement twice, and I accepted to pursue other career options. Overall this is a great corporation to work for offering many benefits including the standard health and 401K many areas offer flexibility to work from home or alternate hours."
good,"the pressure to get the job done was immense. I would bring a lot of stress from my day home with me. nothing was ever good enough. That being said, it is one of the best paying jobs in Bismarck. So, I stuck it out for longer than any human should have to."
good,"Work Location and hours flexible"
good,Everyday required several hours of significant concentration and behavioral management of employees. Management practiced lets trust each other and then they would terminate employees.
good,"Aetna provides opportunities for a great Work/Life balance."
good,"Everything was wonderful there, until the RX Home delivery closed down.  Growth in the company is a plus!  The facility had everything needed and they were speedy concerning your concerns"
good,"Managers were not fair but the job paid well and made up for it with benefits. Sick days,  and pto. There are lots of stressful situations with meeting deadlines."
good,"8 hours of processing claims"
good,Aetna has created a good environment and learning experience. A typical day at work requires creating emails and answering a wide variety of emails. Answering phone calls and returning phone calls. Coordinating meetings and arranging meeting space and food and beverages for events. Creating specific Excell reports necessary for management.
good,"●	Exceptional Written and Interpersonal Communication Skills"
good,"Every place has its challenges but I found that some of the people seem to be genuinely nice people, willing to help. What I did not like about the job was that it seemed somewhat unorganized - documents would get lost, with no way to prove that you did the work. I also did not like that every reviewer had to abstract ALL of the HEDIS measures and not become proficient in any of them; However, what I liked most about the job is that I could work from home - I just needed to do 8 hours of work (though I found myself working longer, especially if I flexed my hours). But I did get more work done at home than in the office."
good,Awesome place to work with open culture and nice office environment. Lot of investments in technology which is good and make the company in better position with competitors.
good,This was a claims processing position.  Great training and advancement opportunities. Benefits were great as well. Had an awesome retirement pension plan.
good,"very near come and the hours were flexible and it was close to my home."
good,I enjoyed working for Aetna and learned a lot.  I gained a lot of experience and worked with amazing people.  Management was understand and supportive.
good,"A typical day at work consists of receiving approximately 60 inbound calls a day from medical providers seeking authorization for various medical treatments and procedures. Here I've learned patience, the importance of good customer service, and how to handle irate callers. My co-workers were amazing. The hardest part of the job was sitting for hours. The most enjoyable part was connecting with people from all over the globe."
good,"At Aetna, I worked out of my house for 9 years supervising 21 Mental Health Care Specialists.  I felt that I needed to return to being a direct care manager versus working out of my house with no direct involvement with colleagues. I care very deeply for my clients to help them live a life to their fullest."
good,"Developed both Data-driven and Keyword-driven Framework using QTP. "
good,This is a high-stress environment type of company.  There are ample opportunities to advance and highest producers are rewarded.
good,"I started as a temp 20 years ago.  I was able to go from Temp to FT while working for a great group of managers.  I learned tons of PC skills, coming from the nursing home world.  The office atmosphere was really good, we worked as a team and came together to support each other when necesary.  The cons, I experienced several management changes over the past few years and felt lost in the sea of a large and growing larger company.  I left due to extreme pressure to work long hours without clear recognition and support from my management team."
good,"Kept downsizing and piling on the work to those who were not laid off. Consequently, a high stress situation. IT as good to be able to telework."
good,very high stress environment. Job expectations were much different from what what told during hiring process. Management unfamiliar with process they were in charge of running.
good,"Great opportunity where hard work led to further opportunities and learning experiences."
good,"I had to get a note from my DR to have extra time off the phone to use the restroom. If you enjoy a rigorous continually monitored schedule, then this is a job for you."
good,"A typical day is very busy juggling multiple priorities, many processes are very labor intensive.  Management is shifting and co-workers are leaving.  It is difficult to stay motivated.  My favorite part of this job is helping people navigate the process and fulfilling customer requests."
good,Good company to work for. Many challenges with regulators and competition. Good team building and continued education support.
good,I enjoy working with people and assisting them with lifestyle changes to improve their health.
good,"I liked the overall knowledge of this job."
good,"Aetna is a decent place to work. They offer great development tools and have in place many mentor programs. I started my corporate career at Aetna and learned much such as, contract terminology, Procurement overall and buidling great relationships with constituents on every level. Co-workers are good to work with and do what they can to help get the job done. The hardest part of the job is to really move things in a timely fashion. With the need to upgrade certain systems and technology, it can be a challenge to move things in the speed I'd like to. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new suppliers and internal stakeholders. I enjoy creating and building relationships on every level. Another enjoyable part of the job is to know that you are valued and are mitigating risks and saving the company money."
good,"I accepted a position with the promise of advancement within the company but unfortunately, feel I am being help back from moving to another department or advancement within my current department."
good,Very dynamic and demanding. Working with Accountable Care Organizations
good,its a good job to have but currently im on a seasonal postiton so it not exactly what im looking for. but the help is there when you need it and all the floor support is very helpful
good,"You worked in an environment where work level could change from day to day.  It was a place where you constantly needed to stay on top of your job and the changes that came with it.  The hardest part as with most jobs today is wearing many hats.  The most enjoyable where the ways the company tried to boost team morale.  Also, working with a great group of people."
good,HMO came under pressure to relocate to lower cost areas.  Went through numerous management changes and system conversions.  Direction of company changed often.  Embarked on a misguided employee training program.
good,"I am the ""go-to"" person for HIPAA related issues.  I perform a dual role as the HIPAA Compliance Officer and a Sr. Customer Communications Specialist"
good,"A good place to work, with very supportive employee staff. And good pay scales."
good,"Fast paced enviroment"
good,"I work at home and have worked at home for 13 years during my case management career."
good,"A typial day at work for me is preparing medical cases for inpatient and outpatient admission for hospitals an ambulatory surgery center. Adding and verifying referrals to specialist and precertifying some surgery for patients. Also, validating insurance coverage for mri, pet scans and ct scans. The most tedious part of the jobs is having a case reviewed immediately because the medical providers delayed their time in contacting the insurance company for precertification for a servie needed immediately. The most satisfying part of the job is hearing a smile in the patient or contact parties voice when delivering the news they are most happy about."
good,Working at Aetna gave me the opportunity to work with a great group of individuals and a company that catered to their employees.
good,"Typica day at work involved in boud calls, alot of vendors that come for you to buy products and friendly staff."
good,"I worked in a satelite office, so I cannot say if this was a problem company-wide, but the office I worked in had very incapable and almost cruel managers. Human Resources did nothing to help. I managed to keep my head down and so fly under the radar, so I had no issues myself. Good benefits, wages, values, etc. I enjoyed my time there. I left only because the satelite office closed down (budget cuts, I think) and I was unable to relocate to the home office (which is in another state) - otherwise I would still be working there."
good,>> Confirmed data warehouse information validity/enhanced value by researching medical data issues.
good,Overall i enjoyed my time at Aetna...in this economy Aetna made changes to keep its employees employed..in order to save money for the company they made working from home a manditory to work from home to allow them to rent out the space.. working from home for many is ideal oppurtunity. I prefer to keep my home and work life separate. And that was impossible once I started working from home..They have a great work at home support team..but working at home limits onces ability to move into different departments and job functions with in Aetna. So one's growth is restricted.
good,Assist in setting up and maintaining disability claims for clients over the phone.
good,"I love the work I do because I get to handle claims issues for transplant recipients, and I care about how their claims are handled. I am expected to produce a minimum of 55 claims paid per day. Sometimes that is not possible if a transplant event claims package is being reviewed."
good,"Aetna is a grear company, however it can not compare to the original USHC. Bonuses every years, good chances for promotion, get co-workers - worked with all levels of management as there was always an open door policy."
good,I have worked with the company since 2003 and currently looking to advance with a company
good,"Always things going on, diverse environment, good setting for interaction, provides nice amenities like a fitness center and on site health consultant."
good,I was with Aetna for a year and a half. It was good days and their were bad days. Can’t really say anything bad outside of medical coverage was kinda bad once cvs took over. Supervisors are nice for the most part along with managers. Shifts aren’t that good along with lunch breaks that are only 30 minutes long. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Good company, believes in work/life balance. Mindfulness is important to the company as a whole.  Multiple opportunities are offered and encouraged for volunteer work throughout local communities, in an effort to give back to those in need. Recognition amongst the entire work place was encouraged and a program was implemented allowing employees to recognize those who went above and beyond to do the right thing. "
good,The job is a good place to work at. They have a great staff and very organized. They can have better managers and supervisors but other then all that the place is ok.
good,It's a nice break from the stressful environment of the hospital but it can be quite dull. Like most big companies they promise a lot but don't fulfill their promises.
good,The best work life balance company I've ever worked for. My coworkers have become more like family. There can be room for advancement if you know the right people in the company. It's been hard for me to move around in the company and as a result I am looking for new opportunities outside of Aetna.
good,"productive & fun good company to work for overall & good co-workers. Aetna's deductibles & out of pocket expenses were high. However, they were a great company to work for overall with opportunities for growth & expanding your career."
good,When they want you gone they will find a reason let you go no matter how little. But I had moved to a different city to far to commute. But overall this was not a bad place to work
good,"Aetna was good in terms of location, work life balance. Need to improve in  management and benifits. "
good,"The following errors occurred:"
good,"I loved being employed with Aetna. It was a fun place to work and they became my family for the time I was there. "
good,I enjoyed my tenure at Aetna very much.  Opportunities for advancement were great.  My manager was the best....because he mentored and coached me.....He wasn't just a supervisor.....he became a friend and coach
good,"Fast pace , busy incoming phone calls, little stressed, flexible hours. Great benefits st this time in my life this would be too fast paced, great team leads who are helpful"
good,Very fast pace and stressful depending on the department. Great Supervisors who is willing to help any way they can. I think the job requirements is a lot for the pay.
good,"The culture is very accommodating and diverse. All people are welcome and encouraged. However, there were not enough people working in my department so it made it hard to take scheduled time off. The benefits were not nearly as good as you would think they would be since it's a health insurance company."
good,"The job is okay depending on the department and the pay is great, that’s why I lasted so long but it is very stressful and the only main complaint I have is the lack of help you get from the coworkers overseas. They are hired to help but can’t help with much which is a waste of time to me they make the job more stressful but other then that pretty good job"
good,"Paid training and benefits after 90 days for full time employees. Management works with you and promotes work life balance. Full time job on phone can be challenging, but overall great company."
good,Lots of pressure to achieve targets but if you did the rewards were great. Top management changed on a regular basis which did lead to some job insecurity as each new boss wanted to bring in his own people. In 6 years I had 4 GMs!!
good,They seem to always Strive to become a better place to work and grow. The company’s work/home balance commitment is outstanding! Outsourcing jobs is a problem with Aetna.
good,I have been with aetna several years.  I was able to advance quickly but I feel I have peaked with the current projectory I am on.  They got a new building here in omaha with us which is modern with game rooms and a great work environment.  The work and pay is more than reasonable however communication isn't the best as the company is so spread out.  Overall I like the company and it is the best company I have worked for and wouldnt leave unless a better opportunity came.
good,"Great place to work, salaries are some of the best in Fresno, CA. They offer many great perks such as a great health care incentive program. Free Apple watches and many other incentives for health improvement."
good,"The majority of staff I worked with were genuinely interested in finding the best ways to provide service to Medicaid recipients. But, the workload for much of the team frequently leads to extremely long days, and employee burnout."
good,"Pretty good place to work. Felt a bit overworked and alone at times despite the size of the company. Management tries to please the employees and provides incentives to make work environment fun, but I often felt as if I had to resolve questions myself because no one in management knew the answer."
good,Aetna is a good place to work but some departments are ran differently. If a person wants to advance with in this company it is very easy to do.  They are also very big on attendance.
good,"Culture is outstanding, people are helpful and knowledgable. Team environments were respected and applauded. Opportunities for advancement were regularly offered."
good,"Dynamic company with continuous innovations in products, network improvements."
good,Cafeteria on site when needed. Worked at home 19 years. All the benefits and flexible hours.Raises and bonuses most years.Overtime sometimes.Offered family insurance.
good,YOu would log into your phone with your security codes. start your computer and bring up all your screens that you will be needing for the day. Set up your notes along with pencil and paper at your desk.
good,"The pay and benefits are average, the workload is high, but I get to work from home, so that's my trade off.  I have tried for internal promotions, but it is hard to come by and they restrict it to 10% above your salary.  Its really hard to be promoted when a pay band is above 10% of your salary."
good,I experiences a lot of instability in job security while at Aetna. Went through 3 rounds of job elimination due to department shutdowns and government changes. They have a good job elimination package. There is constant changes in job expectations.
good,Overall there is a high level of professionalism. If you are a go-getter there is a lot of opportunity for advancement. Employees are encouraged to develop themselves personally and professionally.
good,"Poor balance on prioritizing members that need more assistance.  As a Field Case Manager, all members were treated with the same acuity.  In my opinion, the Field Case Manager should be given the higher acuity members with the most needs."
good,Relaxing working atmosphere. Great and organize management. The least enjoyable part of working here is the short breaks employees have. Great workplace culture overall.
good,"Management is terrible& lack of training. It's pretty much a learn on your own better hands on. As far as the environment is bad. It requires a lot more better management "
good,"The position wasn't too bad, but the departments don't always work well together which make for a longer, harder day. Also, they are not open to new ideas. Work harder not smarter."
good,"Aetna is a good company to work for if you are looking for healthcare coverage, dental coverage, vision coverage, HSA/FSA, and 401K."
good,Aetna is cool place to work. It depends on the department you're working in. Some luck would be involved in this process. Work load may be an issue as well.
good,"Excellent benefits but there is not really room to grow or move up. "
good,"Worked under very strong leaders who provided guidance, and coaching when needed."
good,"A typical day at work with Aetna consisted primarily of administrative work.  Reporting was critical with Aetna and following a recent time study it was discovered that that the leadership team spent approximately 65% of their day doing report analysis versus coaching and development of their staff.  The leadership team felt it was important to create a family oriented environment with an emphasis on career development; however unfortunately with the administrative challenges this was often difficult to achieve."
good,"Telephonic tasks were very stressful-Disease management.  However, onsite work was very good.  I was disease manager for a Trucking company and it was very good environment to work"
good,"Employed a short time at Aetna. The role was new and not well planned before it was posted, as I didn't have enough work. A good company to work for. Company & staff care about customers/patients."
good,"typical day was sign into computer, get work assignment and process the claims , sometimes had meetings, a lot of rules and auditing of the claims so done correctly,"
good,Management staff is unfair A company is the production based company it should always be how you get raises or promotions. lovely company to work for.
good,Great place to work. Great benefits and great people to work for. Fact paced work environment with a lot of overtime available. Great working hours as well.
good,"A leading national health insurance company that offers generous work life balance options such as remote work from home, flexible hours (depending upon job role), health and retirement benefits, and a work culture that appreciates employee contributions. As with all large companies, there are always instances of a specific negative experience, but overall, Aetna is a great company to work for."
good,"There are some things that I appreciate about working for Aetna more than any of the other places I have worked. I have worked from home for the last 8+ years which has provided me a lot of flexibility in being available to my family. They also have options for working 4 day or 4.5 day schedules. That being said, I feel that we were often not appropriately staffed for the amount of work we had and that I was not appropriately compensated for my years of experience and quality of work. I don't believe raises and bonuses should be called merit-based when most employees seem to receive the same increases."
good,You have to pay attention to every detail dealing with other peoples health care. It was an all around great learning experience while working with Aetna.
good,"I had a great opportunity with Aetna to work on projects with experts from many areas of the company and were primarily focused on helping not only employees and their families, but all Americans to live healthier lives.  It was very meaningful work.  I worked with amazing and talented people who really cared about doing the right thing.  The company mission of integrity and caring permeated throughout and I was very proud to be a part of that culture."
good,This workplace is fun and filled with exciting people to work with. The work can be a bit much at times and management can make things a little tough but the unlimited overtime and progress for wanting to elevate in the company outweighs it and makes for a great work.
good,Aetna discussed exciting plans for a bright future keeping the employees and the clients in mind at all times. Quarterly town hall meetings were very positive and informative
good,"I love working at home. I do see the culture changing on a daily basis. Much more micro managed, in my opinion, than before. Otherwise, I have had a great career with Aetna."
good,"During my time at Aetna, it taught me a lot about myself and helped me grow personally and business wise. I worked as a teleworker and was able to perfectly juggle family life and work. I would recommend Aetna without hesitation!"
good,"Working for Aetna provided a fun culture and good career advancement opportunities, but the company policy of only a 10% salary increase no matter what level you promote from and to causes major pay disparity issue with peers and subordinates."
good,Positioning staff to succeed and promotes advancement of individuals from within. Ability to move around the company in various positions continuing to improve benefits and knowledge base
good,"I enjoy working for this company.  Everyone is very helpful and friendly.  I'm able to work from home, and hours are flexible. The management team are a bunch of amazing career driven people."
good,"Aetna was a Company which followed its mission statement  very closely.  Work/Life balance was something that was stressed heavily.  For the most part the Managers were capable of Mentoring and had Leadership skills.  The Benefits for working were above average, ie Salery, PTO, ect.  The opportunity for growth within the company were again something that was above average versus other employers.  I have to say that I was given all the tools and resources I needed to be successful at my job.  The work at home option was a major plus.  The most difficult part I found within the job was getting into a management position."
good,"Coordinate medical care for infant, child, or elderly member population to ensure appropriate medical care is provided. I was "
good,"I really enjoyed working with Aetna in Jacksonville, FL and would like to come on as a permanent employee in Ft Lauderdale area."
good,"after training I was placed under a new supervisor who had not received proper training, seemed she was just thrown into the role which made rules and regulations difficult to understand since she didn't quite know them herself. it was very frustrating and later lead to why I left. the other supervisors were hardly around and not willing to help others who were not on their team."
good,"I was able to assist medical providers and provider outsourced vendors throughout my day with things such as benefits, eligibility, and claims of Aetna MBR's."
good,"Aetna is good company that's family oriented, promotes morale and boosts education.  On a typical day at work aside from being in an work environment, friends and associates become family. I've learned a host of things regarding the medical field such as coding, terminology and claims processing. The workplace culture is very diverse which makes the workplace a comfortable environment. The hardest part of the job was when some management was bias with employees. But the most enjoyable was working with most employees."
good,"Solid leadership and culture, high performers and high potentials treated well and given great opportunities for growth and advancement. Highly recommend this organization. Inspired leadership makes a tremendous difference. Needs more ""success"" with efforts around diversity and inclusion but a basic process and people to lead the program are in place."
good,"Thought I would retire from there, downsized my position was eliminated at 2 yrs of employment.I thought the metrics you were supposed to reach were very unrealistic, it was all about the numbers with Aetna, cold call members, and keep trying to contact them regardless, sometimes it was difficult to engage with members, other times you were able to have teaching opportunities and build relationships which were rewarding."
good,"The work was challenging and at times, demanding. There was great collaboration amongst the team and the goals were clear. "
good,Worked here several years and very much loved the job.  Many changes coming now so decided a good time to make a change in jobs.  Flexibility to work from home has been very accommodating to my personal life.
good,"need improve on promotion and scheduled training to catch up with new technologies."
good,"Very slow pace, if you are use to moving doing many task at one time Inbound/Outbound Que Assoc. would not be a great position to accept. It is a very nice company to work for."
good,"I worked at Aetna while completing my undergraduate degree, I had to leave due to a parent's deteriorating health. I had a very understanding Supervisor who allowed me to resign ,so that I would be able to return in the future"
good,Aetna was a great place to work and offered great work/life balance with telecommuting and flexible hour options.   They offered great benefits and were supportive in advancing my career.
good,"It is a very productive, fast paced workplace that allows you to coordinate with other teams to integrate the corporate vision into your work.  Can be challenging, but, is a good work environment."
good,its a cool job good pay and there's a gym in the building fire access if you work here. the people are nice the building is clean. the management could be a little better
good,"Easy going. Good people to work with. Confusing training program that has too many systems to juggle between. Great benefits, but that balances a low pay structure."
good,"The office located at 18444 W Union Hills, was with Meritain Health owned by Aetna.  The culture was the ladies who worked for Meritain Health ruled.  Any new comers were not welcomed. "
good,I enjoyed my time there.Great co-workers and supervisor and senior management . I was rehired in 2007 and was given new opportunities. PTO credit was also given which was a plus.
good,"this place was a great place to work, I recommend this job to anyone who is willing to work full-time and follow any and all rules, regulations, and guidelines of this employer."
good,My experience with management at Aetna was that they were well skilled in team building and leadership. The company offered a lot of internal leadership training courses both mandatory and non-mandatory.
good,Aetna is constantly able to teach you something new and there are lots of opportunities for advancement. I have learned a ton about Medicare members and the health insurance industry
good,Great people working for the organization. With hard work and long hours there is opportunity to advance. There is a discrepancy between the focus the company puts on employee survey results and it's tolerance for actual meaningful change.
good,"My day consist of training all new hires the computer the system. My job was to make sure any training material was updated at all times. "
good,"Flexible work hours, started early.  Management very responsive if questions or situation (technical) came up.  Consistency in documentation.  Quiet work environment."
good,"Aetna was a nice place to work. They offered full training for people that had never done this sort of work before and provided one on one training even after you received cases."
good,Great culture of diversity. I love the work and the team I work with are amazingly supportive from senior management to my co workers. The work is detail oriented and provides great satisfaction on a daily bases.
good,Aetna is a great company to work for but management can cause employees to speak badly of it because of how they treat some of the employees. If not for some dept managers the company would be a much better place. The CEO is the best at innovation and technology and is very inclusive in the daily activities by keeping us abreast of everything.
good,"Productive workplace with missed managed managers. Working from home was the best thing about this company. More work than pay, but the benefits aren't all that bad. You would think since it's a healthcare company, your benefits would be zero or real close to it."
good,"They also had some pinball machines. "
good,"My job as an administrative support was a little of everything. I distribute mail, create letters then process them to be sent out. My main job was to create claims for a large airline client and answer any questions they might have. I also created spreadsheets for voice messages and other documentation. I trained the new employees in different areas of the office. The hardest part was leaving work undone. The most enjoyable was knowing what I created would be used after I was gone. The management for the most part was always helpful and encouraging with new ideas I would bring to them. I learned how to get along with all types of personalities and to be able to multitask."
good,Long days of heavy phone contact. Difficult to meet metrics. Listened to members concerns about cost of health care verses coverage of procedures recommended by a physician.
good,"Aetna is good company to work for as an whole, just my location the management team is unfair and bias most times. I love what I do and work very hard but when they give out promotions to undeserving people it does not make you feel appreciated ."
good,"Training was very clear and a must. Enjoyed assisting our members to my fullest capacity. Spoke to several members that sometimes just wanted someone to talk to, as they called for assistance and were very grateful that they we were able to help in any way possible."
good,Aetna is a good place to work with a great culture for diversity and many programs for employee wellness and overall health. There are groups to include everyone and all backgrounds.
good,"I reviewed COB information for our members and researched other insurance information thru phone calls to members, medical providers and other insurance companies. I updated COB databases to insure correct coordination of benefits were listed so claims would process accordingly. I was also responsible for highly detailed COB issues, assisting COB analysts and providing information to management regarding COB issues as needed. I was also responsible for assisting in providing best practices to policy regarding COB issues."
good,"Culture, being under ongoing review may result in unexpected occurrences in long term expectations. Typically this company looks far out ahead to determine where it wants to be in the future, so its decision could be  short term controversial."
good,"A typical day at work would be checking in via emails to see if any problems occurred, then coding and testing assignments. I have learned to be flexible, as the daily work and priorities are always changing. My team and management worked together well as a group and were able to accomplish quality work, which was well received by our business area and customers.  The hardest part of the job was to support releases which occurred all night.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to see an assignment from start to finish and be implemented successfully."
good,Aetna offers excellent benefits to employee. The only  downside is the fact that company doesn't give employee the opportunity to move up the corporate ladder.
good,It is a corporation and abides by that rule.  I enjoyed my role and met a lot of good people.  I learned a lot in the security world and had a few laughs too.  The most rewarding part was the feeling of accomplishment when deadlines were achieved.
good,All in all -- a good work experience. Great people. Aetna needs to do a better job using technology to meet the demands of the digital transformation.
good,"It can be a great place - all depends on your reporting manager and favoritism........certain individuals are afforded promotions and raises more so than others"
good,Great company for work/life balance and good employee benefits. Most positions are work at home and has great flexibility. Management training in cultural diversity is a plus.
good,Good company to work for. Needs to allow more advancement. Over all one of the best companies I have worked for. The pay is good compared to most companies.
good,"A typical day at work includes developing and enhancing member relationships, responding to member inquiries and resolving concerns within a Contact Center team. Also, de-escalate irate calls and assist in house representatives with questions about claims and benefits."
good,"This is definitely a good place to work for working parents. There is a lot of flexibility in your schedule to be able to attend doctor appoints or kid activities. The workload made the job stressful, but still a good company to work for, I loved all the benefits they had to offer."
good,"Enjoyed the idea of rotating Team leads "
good,Aetna customer service is a good company with expanding potential. Everyday is filled with providing quality customer service to Aetna members to ensure company standards and member satisfaction.
good,Good company but as always depends on the manager that will be your supervisor. Good decent benefits such as vacation and others. Company always laying off people each year.
good,"Aetna is a good company, although over time the changing rules of the healthcare system put a lot of stress on the company, and more and more new policies had to be put into place.  It became a more high stress business situation.  The environment was not especially healthy for employees, but compensation was good and the work ethic was very good."
good,Great company with a lot of room for growth. There is great work-life balance with opportunities to work from home. The company is also large so there's different departments where one can move
good,"I enjoy working for Aetna/Bswift but the company is at times unorganized. I am working as a temporary worker, and when the company has team meetings, we were never included which left us in the dark regarding new plans and concepts that are supposed to take place. I didn't feel valued as a worker, or recognized, for my efforts as well as other temps that work there."
good,"good company, lots of opportunities if you are willing to work for it.  they talk about work life balance but it depends on where you work if you really have it or not.  good pay, decent benefits."
good,A good company to learn various aspects of insurance and health care. Very helpful in learning the various aspects of healthcare. Management is accessible.
good,They make sure the work environment is very inclusive regardless of peoples backgrounds.  Flex schedules and good management.
good,"after the buy out of us healthcare, the environment was very ""corporate:, not family oriented as we all had been accustom to. still it was a good company"
good,They have a lot of the latest technologies. Most people specialize on a particular technology allowing them to become very proficient at their job. Good place to gain experience.
good,"Many downsizings in the years I worked there. Best place I ever worked as far as my department and supervisor. "
good,"I learned time management. The training helped in my other jobs to understand the workings of insurance benefits. I loved working for the company, but it was about an hour away from my home."
good,"It was a nice place to work.People were friendly, management wasn't that good. They were fair with the employees and understanding. Building was very nice and clean."
good,"Very productive and hard working. great job environment, very work-home life friendly and willing to adjust and adapt to different work schedules. Hands off approach for the managers"
good,"Busy work day in the ever-changing field of health insurance.  Working with many different departments, there is a lot of knowledge gained as well as continuing to have room for growth."
good,"Enjoy my job and especially the people I work with. Love that I had the opportunity to work form home. Gained alot of skills while working here (Ouloook. Office, excel)."
good,I was able to fully understand the health care environment and able to assist clients who had questions regarding their plans.
good,"It was through a temporary agency. Eight of us started at the same time and was lead to believe all 8 of us would be hired; yet, dismissed 1 week prior to Thanksgiving...after open enrollment was completed."
good,Enjoyed working with customers the team was helpful lots to do always busy. Always practiced one call resolution with each and every customer
good,The culture at Aetna seems very member focused and company is views the job as more than just a job. Aetna is very driven in reshaping healthcare and focusing on the needs of its members. I enjoy working here because it also supports employee work/life balance. The employees feel valued and that they are contributing to the company.
good,"I would come in and help customers calling in complete there health assessment. "
good,I enjoyed working with the providers and the medical insurance.  I learned alot about insurance and how claims are paid.
good,This was a good place to work with good compensation and benefits and understanding of when things come up with a family.
good,"Aetna spent a lot of time & money in training new employees, with a  minimum of 3 months in class before you ever hit the floor.  However, once you were on the floor, if you had a problem or a question either about a phone call you had received or simply how the best way was to pay a claim, there was never a person or supervisor available or willing to come to your assistance.    I always thought that was odd considering the money they spent to ""train"" each new hire.  It got quite frustrating for me and I am a person who requires minimal supervision!  I learned a lot from my brief stance with Aetna, but was almost grateful when the offices relocated to India and we were all laid off!"
good,"lots of travel, rewarding and great advancement opportunities. Established a new business B2C model through new and dynamic plan offerings."
good,"With the impending ""merger"" of the behemoths, Aetna & Humana, many feel out of the loop as far as what is to come. Other than the typical company communication both factions are hoping for the best but anticipating the worse. No news isn't always good news."
good,Aetna is a good company. You would go in and know what you would need done and be able to work on your own with a supervisor/manager handy when needing assistance. Management was good to work with schedules and time off. Upper management was always changing and wanting vague information at times. Aetna has acquired many smaller companies and is always trying to convert the staff to their systems.  this is an extra burden to anyone who was bought out and leaves a lot of uncertainty in the direction the companies take.
good,"Learned Medicare guidelines for insurance companies and DME providers."
good,"Good place to work, all of my managers were top notch. Found it hard to move up at times...seemed as if it was more ""who you knew"" than your actual work quality. Once you can get around this, this is really the ideal place to work."
good,I learned alot working for Aetna's marketing manager during this short period. The hours were very flexible and I learned so much about every aspect of running a business.
good,"Overall, the company was a great place to work. Management was caring and understanding. They allowed you to work a flex schedule, where you come in between 6 am - 9 am in the morning and not have to be pressed for being there at particular time."
good,"Liked working in the Middletown office. Very professional co-workers."
good,"Great place to work as far as helping people with serious problems, we provided great services and was very prompt with cash outs and returns. Floor supervisors were great when numbers came in with record breaking turn a round's, the co works that were in my team were a family based surrounding, helping each other in anyway that we could."
good,"room for growth advancement, telework, excellent co workers. some micro management but overall good company to work for"
good,Learned a lot there.  I went to college and got out and Aetna allowed me to put my information systems degree into health care!!
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is the constant change which requires quick thinking and urgent resolution to any number of service issues that may arise on a daily basis.
good,"As a Healthcare Consultant Assistant it is a privilege to work the scheduled hours of your choice with 5 hours flex-time per week. This is very helpful for appointments or if you have children. Salary is good and yearly bonus based on company profit. "
good,The busy work flow has helped me learn to manage my time properly and effectively. I am able to help assist each and every customer in a timely manner.
good,One must be an extremely patient and observant person to take phone calls all day non stop. Must have knowledge of HIPAA Privacy guidelines as well as state and federal mandates as they pertain to the area the plan is written out of.
good,"Management not so great feedback was only provided when something was bad and not timely, not able to work you self back from corrective action. Very little good feedback- job always changing no imagination required just pushing buttons on keyboard and following scripts. professed not a call center only job performance measured by call center standards- co-workers great but unhappy always complaining- hardest part of the job not hard at all for some keeping up- enjoyable part speaking to the claimants and vendors"
good,"Environment is pleasant"
good,Great relaxed work environment. Handling a great amount of medical documents and communication via email with adjusters and peers. Must demonstrate great time management skills and punctuality and team work.
good,"Case Managers usually carried a caseload of 60's members. New cases were added at approximate 3 to 5 per day. Heavy days could be as much as 8 members. My supervisor was open to suggestions and was very willing to discuss cases, and extremely supportive of the team. The most difficult part of the job was keeping up with the constant changes which could change from the morning to the afternoon. The most enjoyable part of the job was coordinating care for members."
good,"I started processing claims on the HMO claims system. Then advanced to processing all foreign claims, and moved to special project team where we corrected previously incorrectly paid claims. I then moved to the IT department testing system upgrades, moved up to business analyst writing business requirements for upgrades. Finally I moved to the HMO Claims help desk."
good,"A typical day evolves around Call Center activity, processing of new healthcare membership through the Marketplace, Conference Calls, Systems Administration, addressing escalated issue, and process improvements that are being released for production. In addition, also engage in internal/external audit processes."
good,Enjoyed my co-workers and the company as a whole. Good benefits and was able to WAH was a plus.
good,"I rate this company as a good company to work for.  The co-workers are really great, they have short cubicle walls and you can see the whole department, which makes working sometimes distracting."
good,"A typical workday at Aetna as a customer service rep starts at 8:35 by logging into your computer and your phone and begin taking calls until your breaks and lunch and by 5:00 if you're lucky you can log out of your phone and go home. I learned to be efficient in what I do to reach the goal of our set handle time. I've also learned how to handle difficult situations and deal with difficult people. My co-workers are the best part of working at Aetna, they all understand the daily problems that come up and they can relate as well as help out in certain situations. The hardest part of the job is not letting the job get to me, some days can be more stressful than others. The most enjoyable part of the job like I had stated before was my co-workers, they really are the best part of working at Aetna."
good,Aetna is a good company to work for. Management seems to have a clear direction for the company but the executive team may seem to be on different pages. The CEO of the company has set clear expectations for the company's goals and direction as well as future plans. I think the company is moving in the right direction overall.
good,"Going to  desk and at self pace Data entry, I learned different parts of Insurance plans and how to identify each part. Management was helpful and resourceful. Co-workers were very nice there wasn't to many hard things about this job. The most enjoyable thing about this job was that the hours were flexable."
good,"Typical day was normally planned,unless something unpredictable arose and then adjusted schedule accordingly.Learned a great deal about the health insurance industry.Success management takes teamwork.Hardest part of job was sometimes understanding  the other pieces of the job that make up the end result of what you are trying to accomplish.Co-workers were unselfish and always willing to help and share information for the betterment of the job duties.The most enjoyable part of the job was being recognized by co-workers for any help or assistance that made their day go a little easier."
good,"In the beginning, working for Aetna was a wonderful experience but as time progressed and office restructure began it became difficult to advance. Toward the end of my tenure, a typical day at work was filled with uncertainty and anxiety. There was more emphasis placed on the overseas employees therefore leaving stateside employees with a significant decrease in volume. Aetna gave me an abundance  of opporotunties to expand my knowledge but unfortunately and increase in salary was not included. I loved arriving to work daily due mainly to the many co-workers that surrounded me. The happiness displayed throughout the office among my peers made for an enjoyable eight hours."
good,"Unfortunately, Aetna recently acquired Coventry Health Care and I was part of the job eliminations that resulted."
good,was a wonderful opportunity to work from home who believe that mercy is  the foundation for lifelong relationships
good,Process application to get License Agent to sell Life or  Health Insurance in different qualified states. Handle inbound and outbound calls to handle different issue due to commission to License Agent and Insurance Company.
good,"I feel Aetna Has been a good place to work and I have learned many things there.I enjoy working from home and having te independance to do my job. My day starts at 7:30 and usually goes until about 4:30-5pm.I have learnto manage several tasks at a timeI have been a team lead and a supervisor. The people who worked on my teams found me to be fair,consistant,helpful and a good resource. I work well with other and feel that no job is below me. I pictch in when I can and am always avaluable to answer questions. I love working with the member, teaching and learning new things."
good,"Working helping customers was very satisfying, hardest part of job not being able to resolve every issue for some customers. Working from home with the company being located in another state was sometimes frustrating as far as trying to reach out at a moments notice to get support. Management for the most part  worked with the work at homes as best they could."
good,Job security is not reliable as many companies choose to outsource over seas.
good,"rotating shift (7.55am to 6.00pm)"
good,"Overall, great place to work.  Some issues with long-term company roadmap."
good,It's a typical and productive day at work. I'm learning new things everyday.
good,"Not a lot of room for advancement, looking for a job with more oppertunity"
good,Extremely limited opportunity for advancement.  Micromanaged to the max. 
good,Been employed with Aetna Inc for 7 years. I began in an entry level position and continually advanced into operations
good,"During my work at Aetna I have gained a solid understanding of the drivers behind company results through a number of projects that I have completed with underwriting, actuarial, marketing, sales and external compensation."
good,Aetna is a good company. My personal assessment is that we work harder not 'smarter'. There are antiquated processed and procedures and there appears to be no effort to make any changes.
good,"Come in and sort incoming claims for each departmet, review them and send them to each correct department. How medical claims work, management was easly to get along with and was willing to work with you if you had an issue. Most of the co-workers got along, and the hardest part is learning your job was outsourced. The best part was working there."
good,"A typical day at work would range from 8 hour work day with overtime if you wanted to assist in getting the work load completed ahead of schedule or if a large work order had a dead line. I learned how to work on machinery for wiring, how to make underground cable/overhead cables and how to drive a forklift. I also work as lead-man assisting in leadership/supervision of the team and processing of paperwork. My co-workers became a family and we worked close as a team. The hardest part of the job would have been watching the machines to prevent a back-up of the wiring. It was like watching paint dry at times yet a very serious duty because if the wiring backed up, the job would be delayed. The most enjoyable part was seeing the finished product and working with great co-workers."
good,"Lots of work, lots of overtime, repetitive sometimes but management allowed you to be yourself. Fast paced, Great team culture!"
good,"A typical day at Aetna consists of answering back to back calls from providers and hospitals, regarding a patients benefits. I Iearned how to quote benefits,and the different levels of health insurance, and their premiums. Management was nice, and as helpful as possible. My coworkers were nice, friendly, and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was locating a claim in our system ten years or older, because they were archived, and constantly moved. Most enjoyable part of the job, being able to give active, correct info for terminally ill patients."
good,"Good company. Perform expert level full life-cycle recruiting supporting 2,800 person IT business at Aetna. Consult and provide guidance to stakeholders regarding sourcing, screening and securing of talent including at the executive level. Develop and execute recruitment strategies. In partnership with Segment Consultant, develop and implement sourcing strategies for specific positions. Assesses talent and build candidate flow for point-in-time and future openings."
good,Working at Aetna creating a great opportunity for me at the start of my career. Working in the Medicare department was both challenging and rewarding at the same time.
good,"I have learned a great amount of information concerning healthcare and benefits. That is the best part of the job is all the knowledge you can and will accumulate. The hardest part of the job is all the knowledge you need to know and how to locate it, if you can. I find that some in management are not as knowledgeble as they should be."
good,Really enjoyed working there! Workplace culture was a very high priority. I learned a great deal and felt that I was paid in line with my experience. Would work there again if the opportunity presented itself!
good,Love the management! they are very welcoming and if you are new to the medical field you will go through about 3 months of paid training before talking with the members.
good,"I believe this was a great company to work with.  Bonuses were not paid on time,but you were paid. Aetna plans were affordable and people were familiar with the name"
good,"I absolutely loved my job and would go back in a heartbeat. Now that Aetna is owned by CVS, I'm not sure if this holds true anymore. I know that when Aetna's pharmacy was bought by CVS, the employees weren't impressed with the changes. I wasn't in the office very long after the change so I can't say much more."
good,Speaking and educating member regarding health care and disease process. Difficult part of the job was when insurance did not cover health care needs. member not will to use social workers or other resources.
good,This job is great for a call center rep. The staff is friendly and helpful. Management is excellent. The training program is very long and the trainers dont have enough time to cover everything leaving you to ask lots of questions when you're on the phones. Hours are weird because they cater to west coast students. Salary is average. Customers can easily ruin your day though.
good,"Fast moving, often changing insurance company.  Good appreciation for their employees, and of work life balance. Worked as a part of a team who was a group of hard workers, with varying experience and knowledge  bases."
good,Aetna is a medical insurance company. I love every skill I learned while working for them. I would work in this environment again. Medical insurance for me was fast pace. Sometimes the callers really pull on your heart strings. I must say it was more good than bad.
good,"I enjoyed my time Aetna and found the work challenging but rewarding. Team work was key and I made some lifelong friends whilst working here."
good,The things they let people get away with amazes me! They give several chances so if you get fired you deserved it. Overall pay and benefits are decent! I’d recommend to friends as a good leg up to get you started but I don’t plan on my being in this position long. Advancement is easy to get if you’re serious and work hard and get your name out there. Good luck.
good,"Aetna is a great company that offers challenging work in the healthcare finance sector. I work mostly in accounting, which I learned on the job.  Typical responsibilities include month end close, reconciliations, controls etc."
good,"Aetna is a good company to work for and they have great benefits, flexible hours and work at home opportunities. They have a great culture that is very inclusive."
good,"I was happy with the training I received.  I really enjoyed working there, but it was very stressful and the communication among departments was limited."
good,Aetna has an amazing work culture and I really enjoy working here. The management is great and supportive. The work-life balance isn't the best but it's not the worst either.
good,A typical day at Aetna was all about reaching potential prospects and converting them to customers. Aetna provided all the support and training for anyone hungry to succeed. The hardest part was meeting goals. The most enjoyable part of the job allowed you to operate independently with the backing of company.
good,"Productive and fun place to work, great work / life balance in the Hartford & Regional offices. Integration opportunities are given to internal applicants."
good,Decent place to work. Can't really complain. Compensation is great. No work life balance though. It really depends on the team you work on. Downtown office is beautiful.
good,"My team that I oversee is excellent, and the culture if very positive. Even though I work from home I still feel very close to my team, both my external team as well as my internal team. "
good,The hardest part of the job is balancing work/family. The benefits are awesome. I really enjoyed working with some of the employees and the paid time off.
good,Was hired to fix things that were broken.  Wasn't disappointed.  Had the opportunity to do great work.  The best jobs aren't always where everything works well...
good,Very nice staffing. Co workers are amazing to work with. I became suddenly ill and management was very helpful and understanding with my needs. Some days are fast paced
good,All in All a good company to work for. The work was manageable and centered around the member and the client expectations. Management worked hard to ensure Aetna adheres to the state and federal requirements as well as the ask of the clients.
good,The employees love what they do. The company is going through a lot of changes with the CVS transition but Aetna is working diligently to keep the culture the same as possible. Lots of room to advance.
good,"The nature of any call center is that it is very fast-paced, and that it is based off of your performance. You do have to meet metrics, you do have to meet your quota monthly, and you do have to be present daily because that is what the company and the call center culture is based around. They are currently fighting with legislation to allow the company to grant sick time to their employees, preventing any corrective actions being taken against the workers. There are, however, people who abuse the situation which is why there are guidelines in place. They are a health insurance company after all, they do care about your health and well-being. As such, they reimburse employees for taking measures in becoming healthy and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Onto the “cons”: I have had previous supervisors that did avoid conflict, and who did pass the buck onto their employees instead of taking ownership as a supervisor should. After observing the company as a whole in the last few months, I was able to understand that the Arlington office was a small pocket of the company that had struggled to maintain the department for quite some time. It is very difficult to advance in any given department. It is not something to make a career of, but taking advantage of their benefits while you decide where your life is headed is also not a bad option. Overall, it is what you make it. Being of a negative mindset or having a difficult personality will definitely make working at this company a hard time for you."
good,"Aetna could be a great company to work for if you do not have children or any other personal obligations. I learned a lot while there to take on my journey with me, but this type of company just is not for me"
good,"Very well organized company with opportunities to grow as an individual , provided with training for areas of struggle to achieve growth and development"
good,"Aetna is generally a well-run, established organization. Many, many layers and big corporation tendencies that one would expect from a large insurance company."
good,"Although they made it a fun place to work, they pay and benefits offered at the time I worked there were less than desirable. Then medical insurance was expensive and barely covered anything."
good,"After clicking in we had meetings.Than we drove or walked to our assigned buildings. I loved my job because it kept me busy all night,and I felt good about myself knowing I kept classrooms and restrooms clean for the students."
good,"Good leadership development programs, typical large corporate culture."
good,"Went from working with Aetna with a local manager and dedicated accounts to being transitioned to The Hartford, with a manager in Oregon and ""Round-Robin"" accounts. Having dedicated accounts allowed us to manage claims quickly and efficiently. It also afforded us the opportunity to develop relationships with our clients. After the transition, we lost several employees due to stress and the inability to keep up with the work load. Each client was contract specific and having no knowledge of the clients contracts that we were servicing, everything took entirely too long."
good,"Good organization that is trying to improve the Healthcare landscape in a constantly evolving industry. Good management, leadership, vision with a focus on growth."
good,"The benefits were ok at the time I worked there. When I started I was working as a temp for Meritain Health. When I became full time, I was then employed through Aetna still working for Meritain Health. Working for Aetna was actually good."
good,The Digital Products area supports Medicare/Medicaid websites.  The Aetna Digital staff were very supportive and helpful for outside consultants to come in and help with their Medicare annual projects.
good,Working here has giving me a great outlook on the medical and health insurance industry. It has given me great accomplishment for helping others. Going above and beyond for people who may not be as educated on their health benefits. As well as helping providers to understand the way claims process.
good,If I had received a job advancement when I was at Aetna at least a year or two prior to  leaving I would have stayed and not opted for early retirement. I would go back if I had the opportunity to do what I did prior to leaving. I loved my job when I was there.
good,Nice company to work for. Good Benefits. You will learn a lot. Pay is fair based on position. PTO balance based on year of service. The work environment is good.
good,"Wide variety of activities in fast-paced, challenging environment which I enjoy.  Plenty of on-line learning opportunities to increase technical skills."
good,"I enjoyed my job and working with customers. I worked there for 20 years. I answered the phone speaking to customers including policy holders, doctors, and facility regarding the delivery of health care services and claims. The arena of healthcare is hot button topic is the political arena at this time."
good,"A fast-paced environment. Calls have time limits. Very nice people to work with. The bottom line is you either of the skills to maintain composure under pressure or you don't. The ones that don't, don't stay long."
good,"Working at Aetna has been rewarding, I have learned many skills and have met many members of the management and executive team. I have received classroom training as well as hands-on training, however, my pay in my less than my counter parts."
good,"If this was not a temp agency job i would love to still be there. The people were great, the facility was beautiful and I loved what I did for work. I do not have anything negative to say about it other than I was a temp worker and my PO was not renewed due to the fact the positions were outsourced."
good,"The best thing about working for Aetna is the people you work for and the social activities. In general, upper management did a good job communicating with the employees their expectations and if anything important came up, the worst thing about Aetna was the compensation and pay was less than competing healthcare companies."
good,it was a good place to work when i was there  not sure  on how the people and job is now a lot of old employees have moved  on or work from home. But overall a good job.
good,This was a temporary assignment. Mostly did outbound calls to verify information from the specified individuals primary care physician. Professional enviornment and the two supervisors were great.
good,I loved working there. i worked for a great supervisor and on a great team. The benefits sucked and the time off for vacation was not family friendly.
good,"Loved my job! Good place to work. Aetna training is exceptional to none. If working from home is for you than I suggest you give Aetna a try. Health Insurance is always changing, you must except and move forward."
good,If you had a appointment you needed to go to you could use flex time and make the time up during the week.  You could make unto 2 hours per week.   Aetna is a fast paced work environment.
good,Aetna was a good company and great with work life balance and the location is amazing and the pay was good. Very good stability and security. Employers were really nice
good,The typical day involves reaching out to members and providers for the purpose of improving their quality of care.  I'm also involved in interdepartmental meeting to develop activities around improving the care of our members.
good,"Mergers and acquisitions change the culture and influence the direction of the business model.  Sometimes change is good but sometimes it is disruptive and then you must step back and reevaluate the plan,"
good,"Very good for improving the career path, and the most enjoyable part the culture team, they gave all the cultures and religious to celebrate their celebrations like Christmas, Diwali and UAE national day"
good,"Medical Benefits aren't great but pay is good. "
good,"The hardest part of the job was that training was primarily on-the-job.  There were often numerous meetings throughout the day, and it could be difficult at times to get real work done during business hours.  So not always, but often this contributed to working several extra hours a day to get necessary work done after hours.  This, at times contributed to a work-life unbalance.  "
good,"Three years ago, 40% of employees worked remotely. This put the face of Aetna into the local communities where we serve. Today many divisions have pulled back and require staff to work at one of the headquarter locations. New hires and promotional opportunities are no longer extended to remote candidates."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day was being able to help the customer with their benefits, claims, finding dentists. Also like helping the providers with the same."
good,"Work life varies depending on the position you hold. Most departments are pretty flexible when it comes to work/life balance. The added benefits are really nice. Good 401k matching, health care, PTO, etc."
good,"Great place, terrible supervisors. They keep hiring people that don’t know what they’re doing to manage new people. And they have them train together so the new classes never respect the supervisors the way they should. They need to hire in house so that the supervisors have more knowledge than new employees."
good,"The Customer Service position at Aetna is a very fast paced and stressful workday. The inbound call center is always busy very seldom if at all, sends reps home early due to slow business so steady work is guaranteed. There is very little room for growth"
good,"If you are willing to stick around, opportunities for growth are good. Management is supportive and everyone is supportive of healthy work life balance. Management was also very transparent on what was happening with the company. Compensation could have been better."
good,"Aetna is a great company to work for. A typical day was a fast pace 8 hr shift answering 65 plus calls or more a day average. Management was ok. Not the best, some managers are great others not so much. Moat enjoyable part about the job is helping patients get what they needed."
good,"The staff is friendly, and employees. The job is laid back. The pay is not enough to prosper in life but enough to stay average and pay check to pay check."
good,Hours are from 8am  - 5pm and the environment is a call center.  A good culture exists with fun people and good leadership.  The time I have spent here has been good and I have developed some good tools to grow in my position.
good,I was able to work from home due to a disability and aetna made it a seamless transition. Management was weak when it came to development and promotional oportunities.
good,"The company has a real concern for the health and well being of its employees rewarding them with opportunities and benefits (reduced costs, reimbursements, gym, healthy lifestyle coaching, wellness center including doctor's office and pharmacy)."
good,Aetna is a great place to work.  unfortunately they are not very competitive and salary tends to be on the low side.  They also scaled back on ability to work from home therefore with low salary does not make it feasible to stay long term.  Aside from those things I would have stayed through the end of my career if my salary was competitive! The people are wonderful across the US /Abroad. The company takes ethics and Compliance very seriously. I would most definitely return if offered that opportunity!
good,"Great place to work, very active e in community, spacious break room. provided excellent training for the position. Relaxed work atmosphere. great benefits"
good,"I wish I had never left.  I was a trainer for the Provider Service Center.  I worked with new hires training them on systems, procedures and policies."
good,"The work was excellent and some of the supervisors were superb. However, there was always a yearly threat of layoffs because the work was constantly being outsourced to overseas vendors. This created an stressful environment at the end of every year."
good,Aetna is great company . But with all company’s you have to work and do very best. Work hard and always keep track of and on top of your work and focus.
good,Looking for a place to apply innovative thtinking then this is it.  The stress can be too much sometimes and collaboration run thin but in the ned your helping people and moving an industry
good,"Company strives to go by the values it publishes.  It invests significantly in the employees.  Since it is a very large company they take a long time to make decisions involving multiple meetings, as it is a consensus driven culture,"
good,"Fast paced environment, CEO very involved in community activities, makes you feel proud to work for such a company.   Company is always expanding so opportunities are always available."
good,"Good workplace. Offers benefits such as health, vision, dental and life insurance as well as paid time off. High pace and stressful. Wide variety of positions."
good,"In the end I was part of the management team.  I was the point of contact for all the national PEO companies that offered our insurance to the smaller employers that used their services, I was a key part of the presentations for new business as well as renewals for current or potential business."
good,Call center positions with limited support when issues arise. The management does their best to keep employees spirits up and keep everyone engaged in the events happening in the center.
good,"Aetna was a good place to work.  My manager was very helpful.  There was always a huge workload and not quite enough people to do it though.  "
good,"Can't complain at all about working at Aetna. However, the poor leadership continues to be a problem. The people are incredible! But when you have supervisors who don't know how to be professional nor know the policies better than you or themselves... Therein lies the problem"
good,"Nice working environment , good leadership, a good work/ life balance.  "
good,High paced need to be able to work independently. Users are able to Telecommute. There are many opportunities for advancement. Management cares about employees
good,Being the Trainer I spent a good portion of my day answering questions from the staff members and management. I increased my knowledge of the medical profession and insurance rules.
good,"Customer service and claims processing answering calls from members and provider in regard to benefits.  "
good,"Although face paced training was great and success rates were high."
good,"Aetna treats their workers well."
good,I worked in sales which was competitive with other leading carriers. My direct manager was great to work with and for.  Benefits were comparable to most carriers in the same industry
good,"There really wasn't any way for advancement and the company was more about the numbers than the people.  However, the people in the field office I worked in were very knowledgeable about their own positions and learned quite a bit in a lot of areas of this business."
good,I was fortunate the department I was in I had a great manager who was very concerned and engaged with her employees.   My manager made it a joy to come to work unfortunately a new CEO came in a basically forced my manager out.
good,"Aetna is a very successful insurance company.  At the pharmacy, attention to details is very import as is empathy to patients. A typical day as a claims benefit specialist includes handling incoming and outgoing calls from patients and MDOs. In the 11 years I was there I had 13 different supervisors. Workplace culture was diverse. The hardest part of the job was having to explain to patients when a mistake was made by Corporate.  The most enjoyable part was talking to the patients."
good,Aetna is a good place to work but some of their policies for controversial in inconsistent.  Their work at home program is a definite plus but in the end made many bad decisions around this which prompted me to retire.
good,Working in Aetna is good. You can work from home  2 x a week after six months. Work environment is positive. Quick paced. The schedule of working 7 days work week and major company holidays is a concern of mine.
good,"It's a very big company with lots of room for growth."
good,"Consistence calls coming in... no breather"
good,I played many roles at Aetna and enjoyed my time there and would go back. Every day was a new challenge and I met it head on. I started as an auto-coder who coded bills and worked by way to Analyst.
good,"The job is not stressful and I enjoy the work environment however, the pay is very low for experienced employees. This needs to change. It is very easy to remain stagnant in this position if not careful."
good,"I have worked in the company for 26 years and although the company has evolved over the years, my personal experience has been very positive.  My numerous positions were very challenging and feel my experience has added value to my career."
good,I think Aetna is a great company to work for. I would prefer to no have to give my opinion. I like  working for the company but I am looking to expand my skillset so I am looking for better opportunities
good,"As a  Work At Home employee, it was less stressful, as long as you remain disciplined."
good,"Aetna is a good company to work for however, the company they use for payroll can be a bit difficult at times."
good,"I worked at Aetna for 6 years.  The last 3 years were work at home.  Once I got adjusted to working at home I really enjoyed it.    Aetna's 401k was awesome, they matched dollar for dollar.   They do have periodic lay-offs in which I got caught up in and was laid off after 6.5 yrs of service."
good,Very good work environment the people were great.  the management was okay they worked we with their teams.  a good learning experience of the insurance field. very interesting.  Loved the people.  that's what makes the job
good,Review medical claims for proper payment. Answered phones calls from doctor's offices and clients regarding their claims.  I would request additional information by mail as needed.  I would code and process claims as needed.
good,"AETNA has an extremely high ethical standard.  It is dedicated to providing the best service for its customers and an enjoyable, positive, safe work place for its employees.  Many employees work from home and enjoy the benefits of this work/home relationship."
good,"Must be a quick learner, decent with computers and various softwares, and good organization of a LOT of information. Support and Encouragement is great, but the leadership is sometimes out of touch. Much is expected, but they do give enough time to figure it out. Benefits are good, but could be more receptive to employee feedback concerning benefits. Overall, very good place to work."
good,"Fast paced once you get use to it, its very fun. The people are so generous with helpful tips and advice. Most of the managers and supervisors are very open and try there hardest to help you even with personal problems not just work issues."
good,Aetna was a great company to work for. They make it easy and simple for those who have long term care needs and for their caregivers to report the scheduling and time attendance.
good,"I would still be with Aetna but they are relocating within the city and the commute became too long and they offered no retirement benefits.  Had that not changed, I would still be with them. .."
good,"Aetna seems to be on the forefront of technology when it comes to monitoring employee development and other administrative functions.  They are a very busy company in that there are dozens of employee programs that can be taken advantage of if an employee takes the time to check them out - tuition reimbursement, health incentive programs, educational training programs just to mention a few.  Most of the time workloads are reasonable but working long hours in certain positions is often the case when deadlines are to be met.  The most enjoyable part of the job was always the people I worked with and I learned the most from my peers."
good,"I loved working for Aetna. I understood the mission & agreed with what they were trying to accomplish. Lots of top-down communication, in plain language."
good,"Can't trust people you work with, not even management. Most of the employees didn't feel appreciated for the hard work and performance. Company gives decent bonuses though."
good,"Great people, beautiful building,  has fitness center on site, along with Acute Care, Chair Massage and classes.  Great company with family in mind. Good culture."
good,It was a really nice place to work and the employees were really friendly and built some very good relationships with the staff and fellow team mates.
good,The Aetna Core Values are applied on a day to day basis. The members always come first and we go above and beyond to meet the customers satisfaction.
good,"Answered incoming calls for a phone queue to set up peer to peer request from medical providers with our medical directors, entered all information on a spreadsheet and kept records of the outcome of the provider peer to peers, processed all denial letters for denied authorization requests and reconsideration outcome letters, translated when needed."
good,"I worked there almost 3 years as a CMC, and for the most part AETNA is a great place to work.  I worked at home, but was in the field a lot. Although I worked at home the team you are assigned to is very important because that is your support. Many times the managers are not that involved or supportive and are basically in/out of meetings all day. This job takes a lot of self discipline and is not for the faint at heart. The hardest part of my job was having time management down to make sure all 88 clients are tended to monthly, you must stay organized or you will fail with this company.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the service to my members. IMO AETNA would benefit from some of their management going through sensitivity training. Team members constantly move from team to team because of managers with nasty attitudes.  If the management handled things a little better I don't thing that would happen as much."
good,"Good company to work for but the opportunity to advance is hard even with education unless you have a medical license of some magnitude. pros is working from home, cons is layoffs often."
good,"Overall Aetna has a great set of values and employees are expected to live by them.  Unfortunately, these values are not applied consistently across all departments and there is little oversight from the top to ensure adherence across the board."
good,"I really loved that I had flex hours.  pay was pretty good, but would have liked to be able to work from home sooner.  benefits were good and everyone willing to help."
good,"Great team leads, extremely busy. Best part of job is helping people."
good,"This experience has been wonderful with regard to my co-workers. Everyone is supportive of each other and we celebrate our successes. People take accountability for their actions rather than looking for a scape goat. The hardest part of the job has been that it is predominantly a work from home position. It would be nice to have the opportunity to be in the same room with the co-workers for projects etc. That being said, the most enjoyable part of the job is working at home. It is easier to be productive when working solo as there are minimal distractions."
good,Aetna is a great place to work. Excellent Benefits for those that qualify. Nice and laid back and they celebrate your accomplishments
good,"Aetna is a great company, however there is very little flexibility with schedule. My coworkers are great. Management is not very personable. I enjoy working in a ""family oriented"" environment and that is not the case at Aetna."
good,"My career was cut short of my personal goals with the company.There seems to be a lack of focus. Priorities are not customer centered nor are associates adequately compensated, although my compensation was fair."
good,"Have enjoyed the work tremendously; work with good people, who have good values.  I enjoy environment of hard work and good peer relations, and with upbeat atmosphere."
good,"Challenging work assignments, supportive team and support from team is stressed by management.  "
good,Aetna is a nice place to work. the atmosphere is great and the people are team players. They had user friendly system to help do job effeciently.
good,Aetna has an amazing CEO but sometimes his style and enthusiasm doesn't trickle down to the entire organization. Some older generation people are resistant to change.
good,The work was frustrating do to the constant change in policies.  It was time sensitive and the load of work to be done was overwhelming.
good,"Although I was laid off due to restructing and my job was sent overseas, this was a great company to work for.  Always rewarded for job skills and opportunities to cross train."
good,"Good work environment and good people.  Exceptional learning environment. A good typical day. Learn a lot about people, communication skills enhanced.  The hardest part of the job was when budgets were cut, then employment was cut."
good,I have learned a lot in my time with Aetna and am proud to represent the company.  The culture is amazing.  Aetna stands behind their mission statement.  I have appreciated being able to be a patient advocate while being a Utilization Nurse.
good,"I have learned so much working at Aetna.  In essence I group up there.  I learned how to file, to manage, provide great customer service and how to be on a team."
good,Currently working for Coventry which was purchased by Aetna. Call Center Supervisor that assist with Affordable Health Care Act claims and benefits support.
good,The company as a whole is very encouraging on helping you better yourself as an employee.  Communication is extremely important.  Integration of departments and employee diversity are of high importance as well.
good,I troubleshoot to resolve computer or software issues that user experience with the computer or laptops or printers. I dont particularly like the management because it shows favorite to known employees as far as job placement. Most enjoyuable part is getting users back to work on their computers quickly.
good,"The pay was good, Co workers were good & generally fun to work with and for the most part, co workers were easily approachable and easy to talk to about work aspects."
good,Productive and family oriented employer. Provided the necessary trainings/online courses to perform job duties successfully.
good,"Aetna is overall a good place to work. The culture helps create a friendly and happy atmosphere. Everyone is serious about work, but welcoming. If insurance is your field of choice you will learn a lot at Aetna. There is always someone willing to give helpful advice. Cube life isn't the best, but Aetna makes it bearable."
good,"depending on your position,supervisor,  some positions are flexible as far as your work schedule, which is a huge plus. They do offer work at home, but not everyone qualifies. Pay is pretty good, benefits are ok, the deductibles and ouf of pocket expenses are pretty high. you have to adjust to change pretty well, there is always a new policy, law, etc. that changes within the company, and will say they do prepare you for the change. My co-workers are great, I have met alot of good people here, my current supervisor and manager are great. However, I have heard some negativity from others as far as their departments, but that is with any company. Overall, I have enjoyed working here, and It has definatlely taught me alot."
good,"pretty good work experience. just make sure you meet your stats monthly to maintain bonus and employment. Job was not hard, just a lot of information was needed on each call. most enjoyable was my team and coworkers"
good,"A typical day required me to review patient's cases and current care. If patient was recently hospitalized then their was a need to contact the patient and educate them on a better way to care for themselves and if assistance was needed then it was my job to set that up. I learned a lot about collaberation of patient care. Management was helpful and did aid in educating me on the job. My co-workers were exceptional and we all worked well together. The hardest part of my job was getting emotional involved with patients when they were sick or passed. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting praised by my supervisor, co-workers, patients and their families"
good,Answered questions about this employee previously job should not be included twice. Double populated as I changed positions after promotion
good,"I would go in turn on the computer and put on my headset to take calls. Some of the calls were quite easy: like requesting an Id card for a client, some were harder like figuring out if a claim should be paid. I enjoyed helping the policy holders. I received my compliments on my efforts."
good,The company I worked for is Coventry.  It was acquired by Aetna.  The CEO Mark Bertolini is a true visionary and I expect this company's success to continue making great strides.
good,"Overall fun with assisting patients and helping the ones in need.  I enjoy being able to make one smile from doing my job and completing daily task,"
good,"Updating demographics for members and providers. Process electronic claims, all providers.  Team building learning from co-workers by cross training on different job functions. The hardest part of the job was system updates that weren't working correctly. Enjoyed the job incentive and opportunity growth within the company."
good,"I begin by logging into all the necessary programs to answer my calls from our members and providers (dentists and dental specialists). I answer between 60 to 80+ calls per day from the providers and members asking about their dental benefits and claims that were processed and the amount the member may owe the provider. I also inform the members and providers of those services that may not have been covered and the reason why. I listen to their concerns and those things that they are upset about and have the ability to help them understand and ease their frustration and concern. One of the difficult parts of my job is advising the member the reason a ""necessary"" service and is not covered.  One of the most satisfying parts of my job is being able to assist the members and providers to understand the benefits of their dental plan."
good,"The typical day at Aetna involves getting your things in order at first, answering e-mails and looking at your work responsibilities. I have learned a lot since being here, from opening envelopes to sending out mail via UPS and USPS to scanning and processing applications to doing enrollments. The management gives you every chance to learn as much about your position as possible, depending on your schedule. Co workers are cool, you just have to deal with people as individuals rather than treating everyone the same. The hardest part of the work is dealing with crunch times like Open Enrollment, but my most enjoyable part is making a member happy that needed a prescription today or had to see a doctor or had problems with biilling or invoices and solving their problems and making them happy with Aetna. It's easy for folks to think we don't care because we are a big company. But I try to give service as personal as possible to the member."
good,Good Place to work and a great CEO. Not much room for advancement for a customer service Rep. The Pay is good and the Hours are good.
good,"Management needs to improve. Aetna reorganizes all the time, so having multiple managers in the time you work on one team is common. Your told different things from different managers, so your never sure what the correct process is for completing projects and your daily work assignments. Yearly raises are usually around 2 to 3%. Very low. Other than that, it's not a bad company if you would like to eventually work from home. Lots of jobs allow you that flexibility. Also, most Aetna employees have worked there for years so many people are pretty happy there."
good,"Learn something new about insurance benefits everyday"
good,etna great company; merge with Coventry difficult. Most merges are. Coventry possess old mentality and not open to innovative changes.
good,"I was hired 6 months pregnant and there was no pre-existing conditions considered with the insurance."
good,Enjoyed the team members and the concept of One-Team that Aetna tried to instill. Liked having the opportunity to train for other positions.
good,Great flexibility with working from home. Team members are supportive and lovely to work with. Consistent annual salary increase and merit-based bonuses.
good,Great company that cares about their employees. Unfortunately I was laid off. Enjoyed every moment working there. My supervisors were great. It is very well run. A typical day with them was always good and never changed. Such a fun place to work with good people.
good,"Productive and comfortable atmosphere."
good,Work hours were from 10 am-7pm. I worked on the Utilization Management team. Worked with all types of referrals. Worked closely with providers and our Medical Directors to obtain all the information that is needed to have the referral approved or denied.
good,"This was my first real job.  It was very challenging because I was inexperienced.  A typical day after signing in would be to begin entering data into the insurance database.  I learned the importance of being on-time for work and how important attendance and performance was.  I mainly worked independently so there was not a lot of interaction with other co-workers.  The hardest part of this job was trying to figure out what I didn't understand.  Everyone always seemed too busy to help me and because I was extremely shy and suffered from low self-esteem, I would not ask questions.  I have since learned that if I have questions, ask. That is the only way I will learn/understand."
good,"Great oppurtunity.  When office relocated, was too far to travel to work each day."
good,good to work here and learned a lot and Looking for the better oppurtunity
good,"I have learned many things while working as a Complaint and Appeal Analyst for Aetna Medicare.  Although in my current position there is not too much room for promotion or advancement.  There is room to take on new tasks.  By being open to taking on new tasks, I have learned a tremendous amount and therefore I have the ability to perform and excel in my position as well as understand the duties of other positions.  When I started the position I began as a general complaint and appeal analyst.  I did not specialize in any particular areas.  However, I soon became a Medicare Part D and Marketing Misrepresentation analyst.  I specialized in Medicare Part D and Marketing Misrepresentation complaints.  I soon became a subject matter expert in those areas as well as some other areas.  I enjoy working with my management team as well as my coworkers because working in complaints can sometimes be hard and we keep each other grounded and in good spirits.  We work together to maintain a good work environment.  The hardest part of my job is being unable to assist a member with their request.  Because I work with Medicare we have to follow federal guidelines and sometimes we cannot complete a member's request because it goes against those guidelines or regulations.  The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving a member satisfied."
good,"Pay was excellent, mgmt. was ok to deal with, and if you did your job well there's lot of various projects you can do that will expand your knowledge."
good,"Casual dress on most days.  Flexible schedule depending on schedule.  Encourages diversity,"
good,"I worked in the Plan Sponsor Services department.  The atmosphere is laidback, however, management will be on you to get work done when necessary.  Some of the processes are out of date and are not efficient for everyone.  Overall good company.  Frequent layoffs and mandatory OT."
good,"Good benefits, good people.  Managers overworked take it out on employees"
good,A great place to work! The hardest part was learning all of the programs that you needed to. Overall an enjoyable environment.
good,"Typically I spend the day working on a renewal workup, plan changes, or answering question from the field regarding a group. "
good,Production and Accurate work and willing to learn a change challenge. And must be on time everyday.
good,The typical day involved a 12hr graveyard shift. The work week was 6 days. I did not learn much I simply continued the tasks already Known to me. The company and my coworkers were great. The work schedule was tough but I enjoyed the travel.
good,"my typical day at work starts at home, I check my email for alerts with critical issues. At work the ticketing from users determines where I begin. After resolving issues from the ticketing then i set out to perform my daily routine."
good,"Employees definitely have a voice at Aetna and there are a number of programs they offer to help employees with professional and personal growth including tuition reimbursement, management training programs, and employee awards programs that are certainly more than lip service."
good,Aetna is a good place to work.  I would recommend them to everyone.
good,"They have a great telework benefit. Working at home is one of the best benefits of working at Aetna,"
good,"Answer incoming calls, and also call members back. I have learned a lot about the health insurance industry from many areas. Management most times seem as though they are not as involved or care a great deal about our concerns. I enjoy my co-workers, we do help out each other with difficult tasks. The hardest part of my job is to defuse the angry caller. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I go the extra mile to help a member and they are overwhelmed."
good,Aetna Student Health maintains a quality work environment.
good,"My time at Aetna was truly a learning experience.  The things I learned there, I have used in all of my future positions.  I loved the fact that Aetna invested in their employees to provide extensive training so that we were able to to our jobs effectively.  My coworkers were very friendly and helpful, especially when I first got released from training.  They were always willing to share their knowledge with others and not afraid to openly communicate with the team.  Management was okay, of course, there are some that are fair and objective, and others that like to play favorites.  Very great experience."
good,I enjoyed working for this company the only thing that was bad was the hours. The hours were from 5pm-1am. The management were friendly and very helpful.
good,"Working at Aetna has been a good experience for me. I've been able to learn a lot about the Insurance industry. It has also allowed me to interact with other departments where I was able to learn their daily  functions. "
good,The culture is very friendly and easy going. everyone wants to do a great job. there are lots of opportunity to grow.
good,Management is committed to working and growing employees skills and talents to reach the next level in an employees development.  I have learned much about the healthcare system and how to watch over employees in a structured environment. 
good,"nice co workers, your never knew what to expect with some members, learned alot about the medical feild dealing with health care insureance first hand"
good,Indepent work environment that included team support from all.
good,I would process claims benefits forms on the correct benefit level and pay the claim out according to there benefit plan. I learned to maneuver on various screens and multitask throughout the department.The hardest part of the job was paying out the hospital claims on the correct benefit level if not I had to generate phone calls to get a more detailed description of the visit. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the job in detail and helping others to progress.
good,"A typical day at work was an 8hr day in front of a computer screen and a stack of claims on my desk. The most enjoyable part of my job was the team work. The hardest part of my job was trying to find work when we were getting a lack of it, without having to go home early."
good,A typical day at work with Aetna was always something different. I enjoyed my team and the managers within this company.
good,"A typical day involves working with the underwriters, sales reps and brokers, regarding New Business underwriting quote submissions. My team is the hardest working team in Middle Market. The hardest part of my job is the sometimes impossible Turn Around Times that the sales reps want us to adhere to. The most enjoyable is being able to work at home 4 days a week.. get a lot more done at home."
good,"A normal day differs by position. For my last position I spent 4-6 hours per day participating and/or facilitating conference calls to gather requirements, report on projects, obtain status information of the project, etc. The remainder of my day I would be documenting business requirements, preparing for the next day of meetings, obtaining status from the other business analysts, reviewing project documents, performing system test, etc."
good,Grew internal and external relationships with members of the Monthly Long-Term Care Program of Aetna Better Health NY. Vendors and reps who offer the external members supportive equipment and caregivers for the improvement of their health..
good,Typical day of running daily reports and processing customer payments. Working with a great group of people.
good,"A typical day surrounded providing financial analysis, risk assessment and pricing for all Group Insurance products. I was responsible for underwriting cases for customers up to and in excess of 3,000 lives."
good,"Probably one of the best jobs I've ever had. Pay was great, people were awesome, management was great. I loved it."
good,Aetna has long been an industry leader when it comes to educating talent. They continue to attempt to build on that legacy with newly promoted internal programs. Challenges exist in being made aware of these opportunities and locating the resources who are available to promote you through the processes.
good,"I worked remotely. Enjoyed being at home, but some times communication was 'lost' as messages were sometime misinterpreted, because you were communicating thru e-mail or IM. If equipment was going to the shreds, you had to bring it in to IT, which for me meant a 45 minute drive, and most of the day spent in the bowels of Aetna. Learned how to write in plain language and maintain website.While management was accessable, they werent interested in resolving conflitcs--just get your work done on deadline. Other employees could see when you were on,as they sometime worked well into the night, even thought you werent supposed to. The hardest part of the job? trying to get your assignment off sharepoint and put it back--sometimes, too many tech glitches in software when working from home--and waiting for them to install at home office equipment, and hoping it worked properly.Best money I ever made. Global Headquarters was like OZ, with everything imaginable.Quick, fast paced work, but felt satisfied when it was done. Miss working there."
good,"I was excited to work with Aetna. At the time, my school and full time job intertwined in a way I did not expect. I had to leave. But I was learning new things."
good,Worked mostly in the Managed Claim Pricing System (MCPS).  Normal worked week 43-45 hours.  Was the .Net technical lead and did most of the training when new people came on the team.
good,Working at Aetna was great I love the people I made lots of friends everybody's help each other they took care of us very well and the management was there to help with anything you needed. I liked helping my customers making sure they got what they wanted making them happy it felt really good.
good,"I found this job to be a fantastic opportunity as a newly graduated college student. The culture is generally relaxed, the management is competent and kind, and the benefits were much more generous than I had anticipated."
good,"Great manager, good place to work. Excellent benefits. Good wellness benefits. Health, vision and dental insurance all great. Good amount of PTO. Good compensation for going back to college."
good,"Management is solid, likelihood of achieving plans is less than 25%.  Long hours, but fair reviews and compensation.  Changes since CVS purchased Aetna have been difficult for many of the employees."
good,If you like a large corporate setting then there are plenty of opportunities within the company for a long and varied career.  I've met some great people that continue to be friends.
good,When I started working with Aetna I had no experience with the processing of short term and long term insurances but I learnt. After the training that was provided to me I was very informed on how short and long term insurance work
good,I worked at Aetna for 25 years.  I enjoyed good work/life balance and was able to explore different career opportunities within one company.  They are progressive about wellness and engaging employees in their health and well being.
good,Aetna does not overwhelm you with meetings which allow you to get your daily work completed.  Management was fair and reachable.  They have a great life/work balance.  The on-site fitness center and breakout rooms are a plus for times when you need quiet time to complete projects.
good,"Good job fair wages and decent benefits, competitive within the company to advance up the ladder or even make a lateral move to a new position. I would love to continue to work here except I am not happy about the CVS take over and the cutting of our benefits such as education, vacation, holidays and lowering our pay scale."
good,"Culture is a bit too passive aggressive for my preferences.  The building in East Hartford is fantastic.  Starbucks, a full service gym, and world class café."
good,This company was productive and well rounded and understanding for family needs. They have currently been bought out by CVS and has eliminated many positions.
good,"Reductions in force is understandable, however since the CVS merger there seems to be more of them than usual. The culture is focused on collaboration and inclusiveness."
good,"Very professional; extensive orientation. No advancement opportunities. Remote job turned field job later in employment. As a result, I had to leave my position due to poor car working conditions."
good,Management tend to have an open door policy and provide flexibility when it comes to job work/life balance. Over the years I've learned the importance of resolving issues and the importance of communication to other business units.
good,"Sales enablement was hampered at times based on aligning product areas, regional sales, IT and marketing.  These areas often operated in silos and getting consensus delayed implementing new ideas."
good,It was a good place to work however the benefits and raises could have been a lot better. Medical sucked majorly!!!! Favoritism is a factor at the job but in most office settings that the case but it was outrageous like I have experienced at other places. Pretty much their favorites got first picks on advancements within the department or outside with a glorified recommendation even if they weren’t truly qualified or not as qualified as another applicants. But all and all it’s pretty good company to work for  it’s like a 3.5 on a scale of 5
good,"I was looking for part time work, and at this time Aetna does not offer part time positions. I enjoy working for Aetna and would like to stay, but there are no part time positions available."
good,The insurance business has changed dramatically in the past several years. The management staff has changed and I am not at liberty to comment on people I do not know at this time.
good,Great company love iwith great promotional oppotunities and job security and rxcellent health benefits. You will love the management and the culture which is growing and evolving
good,"I believe that Aetna as a company cares about its employees - the benefits are the best I've had. I grew more professionally at Aetna than in any other job I had; I was pushed to test my limits. However, that changed when there was a reorganization in my department. Morale was at an all time low and work hours were at an all time high. At that time we didn't feel respected by management. If you have a great manager and team...it makes all the difference there. When I left there was no work-life balance in my department."
good,The work life balance is awesome. The freeness to manage your time without being micromanaged makes it a great place to work. The diversity  and culture in the work place is one I have truly enjoyed
good,I like working at Aetna helping the members  advancement is possible with adherence to stats.  typical day would be logging in to the phone system and answering calls from mbrs with questions about their benefits.  Initial training is great.  but follow up training is lacking.  The supervisors are great making the atmosphere good.  The hardest part of the job is updates are done trough email and rarely updated in policy. If they can fix this the job would be less stressful and more successful.  Most enjoyable part of the job.  being able to help the members with their concerns.
good,Management was receptive to associates. I only left  this company as I moved to another  area and their was not an opening. Aetna has some great training for employees and overs upward mobility.
good,"Aetna is a decent company to work for generally speaking. While working there, I worked as a New Business Case Analyst. During the open enrollment periods, it appeared that the company had very little regard for work and life balances."
good,"good team "
good,"Aetna is a company that drives by its mission to improve healthcare. Overall, the company's culture, values, and mission are at the forefront of every function, and employees are treated as such. I will say that the department you are in has a lot to do with the experience you are going to have from a career progression/promotion and compensation standpoint, but every department shares a similar version of the Aetna culture. Work-at-home, flexible hours, and understanding management are strong at Aetna. Now a division of CVS, many characteristics of Aetna are positioned to change, but only time will tell what impact(s) this change will have."
good,"I work at home, and am given independence to complete my day to day work without feeling micromanaged. I have had three excellent managers who have greatly helped in helping me grow in my career. I have enjoyed my time working at Aetna."
good,"Great place to work if you are a numbers person,  too much stress meeting claim quotas, but overall good environment,  they do alot for their employres."
good,"Productive, set metrics to be met and extremely friendly.  Great culture. with a diverse good staff.  Unfortunately, my department was remotely managed which at times created issues. The hardest part to me was the language barrier with the  various foreign accents."
good,"Overall, Aetna is a good place to work. The company culture is one of inclusiveness and career advancement. Great job for recent college graduates who are looking to jump start their careers."
good,"Being the front line of customer base, assisting with customers and their questions was rewarding and challenging. Retaining all the knowledge and balancing all the work load was a managed. Keeping a motivated attitude to and definitely asked a lot of questions."
good,Aetna is fun loving environment. my manager was very friendly . even though i was new in my career. they make me understand what is the project is about even i had thousand of question during my project my team were very helpful.
good,I enjoy the management and the all the individuals that work their. I just feel their systems can be reduced and more user friendly. Some are quite redundant.
good,Good pay excellent benefits. The pace was fast you will have to see many people with a very short period of time to report the notes. There is preference and some supervisor will assign more cases to certain case managers.
good,"Great benefits, great group of people to work with. I've learned a lot about health care within my 3 years of working there. The pay is great. My position is very hands on, and calls are back to back."
good,Offers opportunities for career advancement from within. Offers flexible schedule depending on the position that's held at the time. No weekends unless you volunteer to do so on OT basis.
good,very competitive place to work; Aetna struggled with a variety of issues related to corporate oversight but was able to appropriately deal with things.
good,"Good company, with good benefits.  They have an ongoing training program that keeps you skills sharp. Because of their metrics, it is hard to get raises many have said."
good,"I have been on my job for 15 years and there is no room for advancement and I have maxed out my pay grid.  A typical day for me is helping other departments with client setup issues, entering information into the application for a client setup or creating products to be used by the many clients we have.  The hardest part of my job is handing off my job functions and not being told what my new responsibilities will be since, I have been in the department the longest and is the SME over the application we support. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping others who are having problems with a client setup and training new hires on the applications they will be using daily. My all time favorite is troubleshooting to resolve issues and working with the AppDev team with suggestion on processes improvements.   I have learned to be patience with other when they are in need of help . learning something new and help when help is needed."
good,"I enjoyed the work I did for Aetna, especially working remotely. I had asked my supervisor  about the possibility of relocating to El Paso, TX 1 month before moving. Wish there was that possibility."
good,Aetna is a great opportunity with a great culture. Not so much support for growth as I'd hoped.I left looking for a challenge and personal growth. I would suggest the company to others who are looking to start in a fulfilling career.
good,It was nice working at Aetna. Managers were overall easy to work with as were my peers. I worked there for 20 years. Many changes over the years both at Aetna and in the Managed Care arena.
good,I had a very pleasent experience working Aetna.  The only reason why I left was because of a career change by working in the healthcare field.  Overall it was a very good job.
good,Great place to work with great training period - managers are wonderful to work for and you are given ample time off.  Always providing lunch and learns - great way to keep up with education
good,The position at Aetna offered me the opportunity to become familiar with Healthcare.  I was assigned to work w/Medicare and the elderly.  It was a great opportunity.
good,"Aetna was a very structured work place.  Salary was good "
good,This is a good place to work. Room for advancement. Good training and mentoring programs. Decent salary ranges. Work/life balance needs work however. Some department require an abundant amount of overtime.
good,"Position provided excellent people to work and collaborate with.  The environment was always positive.  The position required that I work closely with a large government entity spread over a large geographic area and ranging from ""blue collar"" workers to highly educated professionals.  Goal was to help this population utilize their wellness benefits to the best of their ability and improve their health which in turn would lower their out of pocket health care costs."
good,"I provided assistance with the customers on what type of expenses were eligible for the flexible spending account that employer"
good,learned how to handle various claims from general liability to bonds. Worked workmen compensation claims as well. Nice place to work with nice coworkers
good,"Would have loved to stayed , unfortunately a family emergency occured and i was unable to fulfill my duties as an employee. Great staff, great pay, and fair breaks."
good,"Looks after their personnel."
good,Enjoy working for Aetna. Very good management. They are very understanding of family issues that arise beyond your control. The majority of the co-workers are very nice and pleasant to work with.
good,"a large portion of the staff work from home once they have proven success with quality, production and ability to stay focused on getting the work done. "
good,"Great place to work - Helpful Management team. Encouraging career development  plan. On site training from first day. Work culture is we work hard, we play hard. We promote from within!"
good,"Aetna is a great place to work, they have a good benefit package. Aetna offers plenty of on hand training for growth or advancement within the company."
good,"Case management is a rewarding job that requires discipline, strong work ethic and compassion. It is about providing clients resources in order to meet their daily needs."
good,"Aetna is a great place to work, if you know your role. I worked at Coventry insurance though. I was told it was Aetna. I didnt know my role. I worked all parts of Medicare, I applied for Part D. Going into a career with a goal in mind can set up any business to rank a little lower. Aetna was fair, it was goal driven, friendly and respectful."
good,"advancement is really if you know someone. however you are left alone for most of the day to answer your own calls. management is hit or miss as sometimes you have a manager or supervisor breathing down your neck all day, but some days there is no one to be found when you need help."
good,"I was employed for 20+ years with Aetna.  My job was eliminated, so I opted for Early Retirement.  Aetna has EXCELLENT benefits.  The hours are good, location is good/ Arlington TX, and the work environment is fast paced.  It would be advantageous to have some medical experience before applying.  The work can involve clinical and technical information.  The work can be cumbersome, but there are many Awards given to those that go up and beyond.  Management manages people.  If you are a self starter, there should be no problems. Aetna provides you countless opportunities, but it depends how ambitious you are.  If you are a go getter, this is your place!"
good,If you desire fast paced work with intensive deadlines this is the company for you. Professional growth and advancement is a guarantee as long as you work hard towards your goals.
good,"It was a good place to work, I was able to work from home."
good,"Health insurance is very challenging due to each plan sponsors account is different, each state laws about the coverage of healthcare is different. Medicaid and Medicare guidelines are great to learn because most medical care decisions start here. I would love to go back to medical billing but learn a new setting like hospitalization or join Medicaid or Medicare division."
good,days were consistent based on job duties. Learned how to be adaptive. Having internal management was ideal. dealing with outsourced managed made duties difficult.
good,"During my tenure at Aetna I feel like I got my College Education.  I learned accounting, data processing, quality assurance skills, Microsoft office products, project management and people management.  The job was challenging and often quite stressful but I learned how to deal with the challenges."
good,"I liked my job at Aetna but I felt like many of my skills were not utilized, and that I was under employed there.  I enjoyed talking to providers and helping members get things covered, but I did not like the politics of it."
good,"Aetna was a good company to work for, but after 32 years it was time for a change. Work/life balance and pay were good.  Benefits were good, but increasingly expensive with less benefits (medical health  insurance specifically)."
good,Expected to be at your seat in front of a CP and signed up to take calls sharp on time.
good,We received too many different answers to the same questions and didn't know the correct information to relay to the members. Everyone is very nice and willing to help but just uncertain on the correct information.
good,Overall a good place to work you are giving all the help you need to perform your job duties the benefits are ok management was good my co-workers were great to work with
good,"The culture was fairly independent. The metrics made it feel somewhat like a factory job. The expectations were somewhat unrealistic, but management tried to balance that out."
good,"A typical call center environment with little to no career advancement. It was great in the beginning but then in January 2016, management changed everything. They expect more than they can do themselves. 6 graded calls quality per month and at least 2 live calls quality grading. Bonuses became too tight to no bonuses at all. They put too much pressure on employees and bring in new hires, a dozen of my team left in less than a year. I heard only 3 out of 24 colleagues still work there, the rest of the team quit since I left in August, 2016."
good,"Regular hours. Oncall on rotating basis for production jobs. Worked on group insurance products. Good downtown location with wonderful staff. Worked on JCL, batch and CICS programming."
good,Overall Aetna is a great company however not every department is the same.  Some managers are a bit too hands off and lack the skills to work with new or less experienced workers.  Great team environment for the most part.  Great hours and ample time off for vacation and study hours.
good,"As a case coordinator, my hours were flexible and there was a good work/life balance. Management was very understanding and some were open when it came to change and new policies."
good,"The work was always challenging and competitive.  It was also a very stressful environment because of all of the metrics one had to meet. We were multitasking all the time but the rules were not always in place to be completely successful.  There were managers and supervisors that were not always great to work under, so it made things difficult at times. (That was my personal experience.) I loved the job, otherwise."
good,"Aetna is a great place to work, very calm atmosphere and very employee friendly. I have learned multiple things working in this environment. It is culture diversified. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with our customers and providers. I don't have a hard part of my job I just would like to recognized for my hard work and compensated better."
good,"fast paced, with high expectations for attendance,                       and accuracy with claim examining. everyone waswas team oriented, which was necessary when working from home"
good,It was stressful but interesting once training was over.  Very confined to your work area I was given flexible time when I had a family emergency.  I had to leave due to family emergency.
good,Working here will make you very good at multi tasking. Follows a very structured process for executing programs and projects. The company is very fast to adapt to new technology and processes.
good,"Is a great company, but it just depends on which department you are in.   I do think our department could make a little more because of what our job entails.   Processes across brands are not cohesive so depending upon which department you are in, your work can be limited."
good,Great work life balance. I am able to work where I need to be and the Paid time off is very generous. Management is helpful and moves you forward. Overall great place to work
good,The department I worked in was stressful but with time management and prioritizing and setting goals daily was able to accomplish my daily task.  Miss
good,Working here is challenging in a good way. There are opportunities to learn and grow. Training opportunities are provided and encouraged by management.
good,The job can be challenging at times but it's even more challenging when management is forcing 8 hours of overtime on you each week and threaten to terminate your contract if you can't meet thoe requirements. It's all just a big mess. Besides that the job is steady and pays the bills.
good,"If you are willing to put in the work, there are opportunities for advancement. They have great benefits, paid time off and a very competitive starting salary. The new hire training program is very good.  The CEO is great and he creates a very diverse culture at Aetna."
good,Work place balance is a great culture my job. Have learned HCC Risk Adjustment and guidelines. I enjoy working from my home during the week and also enjoy going to the office to assist any physicians that may have questions or issue with Risk Adjustment.
good,Excellent broker environment. The company is innovative with good product portfolio especially in the health insurance realm. I am currently licensed with them and will continue to be in the future.
good,"Very happy to work here. Main reason for leaving was increased commute when office moved to Minnetonka. Good benefits. Some limitations due to hearing disability not adequately addressed. Would have preferred work from home, but criteria based almostly entirely on quantity over quality standards."
good,"good company to work for, competitive, learned how to listen and communicate and interact with fellow employees and customers in a positive and productive way."
good,"I had an awesome career working at Aetna.  The managers I supported were very respectful and always willing to assist with any situation that arose. Recognition was a plus!  Benefits were good, however, as a health insurance company, I would have liked to have seen employees receive lower insurance premiums.  Otherwise, a great company to work for."
good,Comprehensive benefit package available.  Supportive and friendly work environment.  Ability to grow in the underwriting field.  Management team dedicated to their employees.
good,"I looked forward to logging-in every morning.  My job was very rewarding, and my coworkers made the day breeze by.  Working at Aetna allowed me to learn many instructional development software applications for use on the job.  I worked in an empowering environment which allowed me to contribute to projects without judgement or criticism."
good,"I feel good about recommending Aetna as an employer and my fellow employees were great."
good,Very fast-paced environment - you work hard but are paid well.  Company has great interest in health of employees and offers incentives to become and stay healthy.
good,"I was offered an early retirement package, and since there wasn't much advancement for me at the time, I took the package."
good,Great advancement opportunities. Great benefits. Fun place to work. Team oriented. Allows time with family. The deptartment I worked for felt like family.
good,"Aetna is a good place for 'lifers' who just want to do a relatively steady job and not feel pressured to constantly try to get ahead.  Opportunities are there if you want them but not requried."
good,"Very fast paced day of phone calls"
good,Aetna has great benefits. There is a lot of room for growth and movement. A typical day is based on production and making sure you meet the demand. It was a nice place to work.
good,Good home workplace.  Great training skills. I learned more about the customer service basics and about the healthcare laws.  It is a great company...
good,Aetna is unusual in that they provide training for entry level jobs such as underwriter and Business analyst.  Their headquarters in Hartford may be moving and that is up in the air.
good,"I worked with some of the best nurses ever assisting them with their hospital admissions,  discharges, skilled nursing facilities and long term care cases....Very relaxed atmosphere and some of the kindest people ever....Nurses are special people anyway...."
good,"My job is nice since I work at home. However, it is repetitive and I would like a change that keeps me learning rather than feeling complacent. This is the reason I am leaving."
good,I sit at my cubical all day and take disability calls to help employees receive job protection through FMLA or pay protection through disability insurance while they are out of work. Overtime typically offered. Two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute unpaid break for 8 scheduled hour shifts.
good,This is a temporary  position .This a position that is being filled by agency and the salary is not enough for the job and skills that is required. this should be a permanent position
good,"Overall, it was a great work environment.  The co-workers, and supervisors were all nice and helpful.  The pay is nice at $16, but for  the amount of work and the stress, its not worth the price."
good,I liked my job at Aetna - they allowed me to work from home which was perfect for me - I learned a lot working here and for the most part I enjoyed the people I worked with on a daily basis
good,Overall Aetna has been a wonderful company to work for.  I am looking for a company that will allow more advancement for my skill level.  I currently work under registered nurses and the only way for me to advance is to become a RN which is not what I wish to do.
good,"This company was very flexible when it came to the employees work schedule.  This is always nice when you have children to care for.   The one thing I disliked the most is that they have a majority of the work handled in other countries.  I was there when quite a few employees lost their jobs due to this.  Because I worked at home, I did not have a lot of interaction with management.  I would speak with my supervisor daily."
good,Aetna is a great company to work for. The hours are flexible. Employees are able to work from home. The benefits are great. There are a lot of wellness incentives
good,I have enjoyed a 30 year career with the company. I have been supported and empowered to learn.  The company continually strives to be proactive in their business plan and continues to adapt to the ever changing landscape of healthcare.
good,Enjoyed working from home and with other professionals to drive the business forward.  There were many acquisitions which created additional work and usually tight deadlines.
good,"1 yr contract, great place to work. Wonderful bunch of people, I worked with, all helpful, friendly. Incredible setup, global company, never saw anything like it."
good,"Large insurance company, good benefits, good culture overall. Not all managers at same level or aligned with culture"
good,Aetna healthcare provided a great working atmosphere. The company values work/life balance and culture diversity. The staff was very friendly and everyone collaborated well together for the greater good of the company and it's customers.
good,"The job could be hectic at times as there always seemed to be less people for the work that was needed to be done. This could leave to a lot of times where overtime work was required to finish the workload."
good,"Productive, fun work place with good & nice cooperative colleagues, good salary package also having free medical insurance benefit for me & my family."
good,"My managers have been easy to work for, and seem to care about their employees.  Schedule is not as flexible as I would like it to be, but they have always worked with us."
good,Aetna is a solid company with excellent employees.  The work environment is focused yet fun.  I would recommend working here.
good,"Very effective with time management to meet various deadlines.  Must communicate effectively with internal and external customers regarding billing, accounts receivable and installation of new customers and revisions of existing customers.  Must daily reconcile payments received for book of business and allocate to various benefits and confirm that the reported information falls within our edit limits. Must be aware of various differences in state legislations and how it applies to benefits."
good,Loved working with Aetna in Disease management. Met alot of great people. Had to quit jobin order to go to school full time to bridge LPN to RN.
good,"The management is great, the co-workers are wonderful and the job culture is warm and welcoming.The most enjoyable part of the job is making a difference in an ever changing environment."
good,Aetna is an exceptional company to work for. Aetna takes good care of its employees. Aetna just raised the minimum wage for its employees to $15 across the country.
good,Customer service advocate for TRS and trained in medical claim processing as well. Learned Medicare A B etc. Good environment with other employees... Management not so good. A lot of information taken on within a short period of time. Getting to help others.
good,"Great staff to work with.  All got along, fun working atmosphere.  All contributed to how things were completed and how to help others. Management willing to work with you in time of needs."
good,Great place to work. They focus on the member and how to work smarter in giving good service. Some members are 'old school' and want hand holding but the company wants to move membership to using online tools and be more self sufficient and be a partner and not so much as a passive member.
good,The people at Aetna are very nice. I am fairly knew and trying to adjust still. My co workers are a lot of fun and we all get along well.
good,"Great company to work for, great training. Good pay! Training and trainers are great. I especially loved my team.They all were willing to answer any questions I had."
good,This a good company to work for.  It has a non conferential culture that helps the right individual to grow.  The worker are nice and approachable.
good,"CEO has a great vision however not all leadership are on board with same vision/growth goals for employees. A lot of politics, extremely hard to advance, even with great attendance and stats...pay is ok and benefits are average.."
good,"good environment"
good,"Management cared about company, very busy environment, constant interaction with members, fun but structured, enjoyed my time with this company"
good,I love Aetna.  It is a very great place to work with many opportunities for growth.  My manager is amazing and so are my team members.
good,"My typical day for my current job consists of various job functions on the computer.  I am an underwriter, I am a team leader, I handle installations, I handle setting up cases to go to our underwriting shop.  I stay very organized which makes me extremely productive on a daily basis.  I work excellent under pressure and under tight deadlines."
good,"My typical work day may begin at 4 a.m. - early riser.  As a Care Manager, I reviewed all pertinent patient information as retrieved and entered into the Care Management Program.  Constant communication with my team of nurses, social worker, physicians, ACO Executive Director, and ACO Medical Director allowed us to manage those patients at highest risk.  Quality data retrieval illuminated the needed quality improvements for continued care.  I enjoyed this new endeavor. I regret that as a management team, we did not have enough time to prove that this ACO management program would absolutely improve quality care and improve utilization."
good,"Good company, tough work/life balance.  Good tools in place to assist with job duties ...ie computer applications and online learning opportunities."
good,"I am at the admin area, where we provide the customer with health care card in which we prepare their card with their details provide."
good,"Excellent work environment which allowed me the opportunity to demonstrate my skills and talents.  I enjoyed working with providers across the Philadelphia region, and  across other counties  providing them with training and education as it relates to  the Medicaid policies and procedures and reimbursement. I found it to be very rewarding when my team resolved provider related concerns."
good,This job was very independent. You get to work at your own pace. There was alot of focus on teambuilding and teamwork. Everything was onsite so you can do everything right at work.
good,"Wonderful place to work. Enjoyed experience, training and skills obtained during my employment. The workplace culture is wonderful. Aetna prides itself on diversity. All walks of life are welcome. The moral in most departments is wonderful."
good,"I learned that Aetna is willing to help you balance your work and personal life. I loved my boss and my job. The hardest part about the job was navigating new materials, however they always provided assistance. I enjoyed working at Aetna and the opportunities I had to learn while I was there."
good,"Wonderful company to work for , fair, great benefits, work life balance  great. Management could use Management classes"
good,Aetna is a great place to work when you are just starting into the work force. Its a great place to get your feet wet and gain work experience.
good,"Once being trained on what to do, the work day was fairly simple. Co-workers tend to help one another when situations arise with claims. There was a disconnect between management and the employees here however that made what should have been an enjoyable job kind of difficult."
good,I enjoy my job and the people I work with. Unfortunately AETA is laying off my entire department and moving operations to the state of MISSOURI.
good,Typical day included pricing claims and updating provider data base.
good,I enjoyed talking to customers over the phone to get there medicine shipped in a timely manner. I did not enjoy when other departments were behind and had to make excuses for other departments.
good,"Great company to work for.  Learned a lot working at this company...especially dealing with irate customers. Management could use a little attitude adjustment, but overall an great place to work.  Company is very diverse and has great benefits.  Loved working my co-workers.  The only issue is for the last 2 to 3 years they have done a lot of layoffs."
good,Great place to start your carreer with insurance and really getting to know the background
good,"Aetna is a great employer to work with. Although the industry is stressful and fast moving, management always makes sure we have fun, are doing well, and can balance our personal and work life."
good,Aetna value is based on being a team player. The key element of my role as an account manager is establishng and maintaining relationships internal as well as external.
good,"There were no typical days! Everyday clients needs varied. Which made it interesting."
good,"Overall I love my position at my job, still looking for a part time position."
good,All work is assigned and job functions are generally rotated. I learned about billing and account receivables at the most basic levels. Management is great. My co workers all worked as a team and were tightly knit. The hardest part of the job has to do with monetary obligations on behalf of the patient's parent. I really enjoyed the opportunities.
good,"Productive and fun people to work with, always had a very productive and enjoyable day. Wish my job assignment could have become a permanent position."
good,Learned a lot and give room for growth. Established mutual fund organization
good,I enjoyed working for Aetna.  I was able to work at home and work flexible hours.
good,"Good training.  Many opportunities for education."
good,Aetna was overall a good company to work for.  The added benefit of having Work at Home Positions helped with not having the added expenses of commuting to work daily and having the opportunity to work at home took away the micromanaging that most companies attempt to do to their employees which is detremental to an employees self confidence.  The hardest part of the job was some of the metrics that were set for us as processors to reach while using a system that experienced issues and hindered our performance at times.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the fellow coworkers and how everyone reached out to eachother to assist with problems or questions on certain claim processing/state legislation that was not worded the best for interpretation.
good,"Answering the phones in the queue, building cases for prior authorization via fax, phone, web based portal."
good,The hardest part of the job was reworking claims from a different department.
good,Overall I gained lots of knowledge and experience with Aetna.  I was able to move within the company while advancing in my knowledge.
good,"Aetna  has a self service model and has a centralized support model for  most leadership and employees. Resources and tools are readily available to all employees and business is run by core Values (Values Wheel) which are integrity, excellence, inspiration and caring.  Great place to work with an inclusive work environment.  Recently Aetna acquired Coventry Health Care and is working on integration of the two companies while meeting the demands of the the health care business."
good,"I have knowledge of HIPAA, Protected Health Information (PHI) and the related transaction guidelines. A typical work day would include me doing any and/or all of the following: researched medical procedures to verify if covered under Member’s plan and reworked medical claims, payment discrepancies within established service level agreements. I maintained accuracy and production standards while ensuring high Quality Customer Care. And I used applicable system tools and resources to assist and educate Medical Providers on patient’s benefit information. The hardest part was implementation of changes, such as new equipment and or systems. Other than that I liked my contribution within the company. It was the motivation for me to persue my degree in a career in the administrative /clerical level of the medical field."
good,Worked in consulting role to advise underwriters and clients of risks and hazards associated with insureds' business
good,"Great Place to work, goes well with life. Schedule allow me to attend school also."
good,"Answer phones, address tickets, resolve walk up problems or drive bye, take level 1 calls to help out.   Tape backup, team meetings."
good,Four months of training to be a claims benefits specialist for the Home Depot department. It was a new account to Aetna and it was getting off the ground.  I was excited to be part of the growing company.
good,Aetna is a great place to work. You must be detailed oriented as you explain patients coverage to avoid any unnecessary charges to the patient later. The company offered any opportunities for additional training.
good,"I scheduled patients, pulled and reviewed their charts and made sure all lab and xray results were available.  I learned to set up the patients by taking their blood pressure, pulse, weight and height and filled out any forms necessary for the exam.  I learned to performed the prep work for various lab tests and sterilized the instruments.  I collected money and provided reciepts.  I also learned to filled out insurance forms and do the billing."
good,"I was a work at home processor so didn't have any personal contact with my supervisor or team mates.  All meetings were done by phone.  "
good,"Heavy call center for the biggest health insurance company of America. "
good,My typical work day as a customer service representative was very stressful.
good,Working at Aetna Inc. was one of the best career choices I have ever made. They work environment was extremely positive and I loved interacting with out clients. My work schedule was flexible and my supervisor was understanding and caring.
good,"This is a very diverse company with lots of opportunities for those with a good work ethic, and dedication. There is open communication about what is going on within the company good or bad. There are a lot of smart people who truly care about customers."
good,"As a member services representative you are fielding calls on a daily basis explaining benefits and claims to members. You are educating them on their healthcare and the new changes with healthcare reform. You are an advocate for them when they are something needs assistance with a hospital or doctor. Multi-tasking is a must in the job as you navigate multiple screens while on a call. General office skills from faxing, generating letters and copying are all must haves for this job.

good,"I enjoyed working for Aetna, it allowed me growth and advancement opportunities. My co workers were team players and management was great, the hardest part of the job was having to leave the job due to job being outsource overseas."
good,"Aetna Provided me with the tools to learn and build any healthcare job. I learned phone ethics, great customer service, how to review medical claims, pre-certifications, medical reviews, approvals and denials on cosmetic procedures. Not a lot of room for advancement, great benefits, great management!!"
good,"Nice calm environment"
good,"Very respectful to employees, treated well by administrators, large layoff of many employees seems common"
good,"Very much productivity driven. Typical day includes translating, keying, and updating prescriptions.  Great importance on staying focused all day."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the position after 17 weeks of training. I enjoyed helping customers with any issues they presented."
good,This company is together in their corporate structure and order...I had no problem with the way this company ran it management style...I only felt dismayed at the outsourcing of an entire department to the Philippines...How are we Americans suppose to live???
good,"Taking lots of calls, getting decent pay, benefits are pretty good, and the co-workers are great."
good,Working for Aetna was a breeze. I enjoyed sending out correspondence to new patients. I also enjoyed speaking with new patients on the phones about new plans.
good,Job was spent at a cubicle but was surrounded by very friendly people.  would highly recommend this company to others
good,"A typical day at work would start out by checking my email and making sure that I have read all emails from supervisor or company. I would look at my task list to see what work I would be doing and how much work I have for the day. (it would update every five min) everyone at work was so helpful and nice. management was there when you needed them but wasn't over the shoulder which was great. you worked independently and that's what I really liked about the job. my co workers we awesome I loved coming in to work and seeing my co workers. the hardest part of the job was that there wasn't enough o.t, to go around. the enjoyable part of the job was that co workers would ask if anyone would help with their big task list and when people are available they would take from peoples list and help out,"
good,"A typical day at work at times working under pressure which I enjoyed and thrived on. I was the go to person for my management for any information or research. "
good,I had the pleasure of working for Aetna.  It is a great company with excellent benefits with great working environment.
good,Stable company with great diversity and benefits package. I enjoy learning new things and having a chance to deal directly with customers to solve their issues. I also enjoy working with my co workers and working as a team to achieve our goals.
good,"I basically spoke with different provider building case for different need. Management was great, I enjoyed my co-worker they taught me a lot about the job."
good,"The benefits Aetna provides it's employees should be much better considering we are a Health Insurance company. The high deductible plans are really nothing more than catastrophic coverage. To be fair, they do provide excellent wellness (routine check-up) coverage as should every company that is interested in keeping health care costs to a minimum."
good,"I have learned alot about Healthcare & with Customer Service details in numerous fields....Local office is a small office and we have received word that they may be closing the office down completely in near future... I am a hard working, dedicated , loyal employee who has a great attendance record as well as great work record... I would be a asset to any employer I have no doubt!"
good,"Aetna was a great place to work. To give employees incentive to meet or exceed goals we created a Wheel of Fame. Those that met or exceeded goals were allowed the opportunity to spin the wheel to win a prize consisting of a free lunch, a half a day of PTO added to your bank, free jeans day and much more.It was nice because they allowed you to work at your pace and management had an open door policy and they communicated changes as they were going to happen, not after the fact."
good,"Various different type jobs.  Growth Opportunities.  Sometimes overtime season got to be much but compensation was pretty good and quality/quantity related.   Company offers WAH positions, customer service type positions, and typical cubical positions and management positions.   Just watch out before layoffs they practice mass 'natural attrition' then the WAH positions seem to be first hit in layoffs."
good,"handled incoming health insurance calls, learned a lot about medical terminology and billing.  most enjoyable part of the job was helping individuals that didn't understand health insurance process."
good,"I worked at Aetna for a little over a year and really enjoyed my time there.  My colleagues were very friendly and treated everyone like family.  Very productive warm environment to work in.  The only challenge was dealing with a supervisor who was very immature.  I really enjoyed my work and my teammates who were always more than helpful to assist.  The training was very thorough and extensive, which prepared us for the job that we were hired to do.  I really miss working there"
good,This is a great company to work for with room for advancement.
good,This was a great company with good co-workers and management.
good,I processed medical claims.  Everyone worked as a team and the people were great to work with.
good,It was a very strategic position that required me to pay attention to detail. I enjoyed the challenge and independence of the position.
good,"The day starts with a review of the log to prioritize the cases to be worked and set the pace.  Management allows its employees to work at their own pace and does a good job of keeping moral high.  Co-workers are like a family and we know each other by first name basis.  At times, it is feast or famine so it is up to each of us to manage our slow periods productively.  I enjoy the versatility of the job and enjoy the challenge of working the larger cases.  "
good,"A typical day at work with Aetna was busy, however repetitive.  The moral seemed to always be pleasant and the supervisors were realistic, and understanding.  The things that I learned at Aetna, was to keep trying you do get better with, time, hard work and patience.  I had some very sensible co-workers they weren't to pushy however they weren't to standoffish.  The hardest part of the job didn't come from anything relating to work for me, it was my own personal life, that caused me to resign.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was the potential to move up the corporate ladder."
good,It was fun and interesting. A lot of departments and fun to learn. I enjoyed it.
good,"logged in the phone for clock in and for breaks,"
good,"Handle provider service inquiries and problems via telephone, internet, or written correspondence. Process error-free claim referrals, new claim handoffs, nurse reviews, provider complaints, grievance and appeals. Perform review of member claim history to ensure accurate tracking of benefit maximums and/or coinsurance/deductible. Performs financial data maintenance as necessary.

Also handle any type of Provider call backs, and supervisor calls that may arise, and educate the reps if needed. Perform any other work as needed from supervisor."
good,The company out source there business that the reason for leaving
good,"Most of my day was spent working with providers to verify insurance coverage. I would also review, analyze and resolve and provider discrepancies involving benefits."
good,"Helping people solve issue, and helping provider solve issue"
good,"Managed all regional site activities, with oversight of 7 direct reports and more than 250 employees. Ensured excellence and exceeded performance objectives such as P&L for Provider segment with more than $10M in revenues per year. Improved customer satisfaction and increased employee engagement in a contact center environment. Executed vision and culture of Aetna in operational segments of network, benefits, claims, complaints, appeals, government programs and self-service tools. Enjoyed the Aetna culture and the inclusion aspect of leadership towards employee engagement and employee resource programs."
good,"Obviously it depends on the job and department you work in but overall a great company to work for. Flexibility, diversity and openess is valued. It's still a huge corporation so you can get lost in the shuffle and beauracracy sometimes. Would recommend."
good,a typical day for me is being at my job before the required time so i can plan my daily routines or activities and to start working on the most important tasks that lies ahead for my day . I am very organized and i use outlook to set up my daily calendars of events.
good,Each day presented new issues and challenges for excellent service for our providers and each day saw new information that allowed us to grow our expertise to expand our range of helps. Our supervisors were strict but fair and pleasant people in general. I worked with a wide variety of ages and personalities making the hardest part of the job; gossip. But the most enjoyable part was the exposure to and interaction with those co-workers and team associates as we all had the same goals grounded in service excellence for our customers.
good,A typical day at work would be spending 8 hours on the phone answering calls from providers. The Command Center would try their best to give you some time off the phone to complete trainings or follow-up calls or work on projects. A few teams had a little store where you can stop for that uplifting candy during your break. Management always encouraged involvement in the Call Center activities wether within or outside of our location.They also offered a suggestion box and did agree with and followed up with some of our ideas to improve our working conditions. We did a lot of fundraisers. we had contests between the different teams where you could win a free meal for the team or a special recognition. That was for me the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest was trying to meet the Average Handling Time and still give the best customer service possible. For most part my co-workers were willing to participate in the team events and helpful.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Aetna. I did not have to drive too far to work and the office was very pleasant. I made a great salary and received good bonuses. Paid time off was excellent, as were all tbe benefits."
good,"Aetna expects a lot from it's CSRs, but in return employees may earn quarterly bonuses and be recognized by management."
good,large work load but very good place to work
good,"Reasonable compensation with great additional benefits available. Very little overtime required. Friendly, smart managers."
good,"Love to start my day off with coffee that morning rush, ejoy working with co-workers on different assignments while getting through the hardest part of the day handling client issues in a timely manner."
good,Aetna is the type of company I would recommend to a friend if their skills matched a job opening for Aetna. It has been around a long time and job security there is pretty well established. I worked for a department that was new and being developed so I was around while a lot of problems were getting worked out for this department and that was challenging
good,"Would pack customers order to be shipped out, recieved email to fill presciptions."
good,"I received great opportunities in going from a claims examiner to auditor. I was also a trainer in which we also created the manuals that we used for new hires and also current employees. This was for all areas such as processing claims, adjusting them, customer service. It was very exciting and energizing."
good,Reaching out to Patient and setting up their medications to be sent out to them in a timely manner. also processing credit card transaction.
good,Their was always something to do. Interacting with my providers always gave me a sense of value and building relationships with other organizations and networks was the best part. The days rolled by fast and it never felt like work if anything it felt like a lifestyle.
good,Worked temporary in the work compensation department repricing claims.
good,Huge company with lots of opportunities for employment. Good compensation and benefits.
good,"The office in Moon is accommodating, warm, and hospitable. I feel like Aetna hires more for personality and conversational skills than anything a piece of paper can tell you. Managers are mostly great, staff leans younger, and there is good opportunity for advancement but the expectations far outweigh ability to move up."
good,"great place to work, was able to work at home, able to transition to train new hire employees, received three Aetna way Excellence award. Able to relocate to Florida from Ohio"
good,"The company is very goal oriented when it comes to customer facing innovation.  However, unless an system or API helps drive revenue, funding is very limited.  Operational support plays a major role in developing departmental business developed applications to overcome the funding shortfalls."
good,Was brought out by CVS health so not sure how things will be. Great place to work and alot of work at home opportunities. They thrive on team work and management is great
good,A good place to work. They are fair. Equal opportunities upon proving yourself. Benefits have high deductible but manageable .........................
good,"Due to the acquisition by CVS, Aetna was in a busy transition period during my time there. It is a great place to work with very friendly corporate culture. The people and the mission of the company as a whole made working there a very positive experience."
good,"The positions pay well, but the stress is overwhelming! If you start young you can advance if you try. Older people not so much. You can please the customer every time, but not the company."
good,"I loved the flexibility I had. I was able to schedule consumers in my own time and working from home was convenient. Only issue is gaining official work from home status which took months and after a year of working there, I never achieved. This allowed employees to not have to travel to the office at all, provided a printer for home and other conveniences. "
good,I have worked for this organization for 10+ years.  The company has unlimited learning opportunities for self driven individuals. Great company to work for!
good,Good . Likable people and room for growth. the job duties were a bit difficult but the job was nice. good pay and benefits. good management. competitive place.
good,"I have been with this company for over 9 years, and they have been very good to me in that time. I spend my day f/u with my assigned providers and reviewing medical records."
good,If would go back if i had an opportunity to do so. Great benefits and good salary. The only down side is that they didn't let me work from home in another state.
good,"Working at Aetna has been a wonderful 15 years. The management has always been supportive and positive. The people I work with are an amazing group of people. I truly love getting up every day and going to work. It has helped me to accentuate my people skills, not only dealing with co-workers, other departments within the organization but also having the pleasure of helping and assisting patients and other healthcare professionals. The job is very rewarding and the environment is always positive. I have most enjoyed the close bonds I have made with my co-workers and helping our patients in various aspects."
good,"Diverse benefits such as medical, dental, vision, 401K, education reimbursement and voluntary options."
good,"Nice place to work, many amenities, such as great cafeteria,  places to relax at lunchtime,  great atmosphere in your workplace."
good,"I enjoyed working for Medicare and HCFA in developing the Focused Medical Review Program.  My managers and physician were supportive and collaborative,  It was truly a team environment."
good,"I love working at Aetna. It has great flexibility and great personal/ work balance. I am happy with  my coworkers and my managers as they make the work environment enjoyable. The only concern I have is minimal room for advancement and most positions are for LPN and RN. Otherwise, I see myself there as long as they will have me."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Aetna until my position was outsourced. I genuinely enjoyed most of the management who nurtured and helped my career grow, with the exception of the final one who hadn't spoken to me in 6 months until the day he let me go."
good,"I was hired with minimal medical experience. They trained and cultivated me the Aetna way. They taught and practiced their Core Values. They fostered an environment geared to support and elevate their employees. "
good,"Aetna culture and vision are proven drivers in the success of its employees. There is strong support for career development which builds upon individual success and failure, allowing for a persons growth and advancement. Management is accessible and open to employees. Team work is stressed with execution in reaching realistic goals. Employee opinions are valued and innovation is facilitated. Autonomy is encouraged and supported."
good,"Well established company, actively innovating to stay ahead of changes in healthcare services. Innovation proram to develop clse relationships and risk sharing contracts with Provider organization. Direct outreach to members to improve their health and self-care."
good,"A typical day at work varies depending on the workflow cycle. There's times when you can go a whole month with barely any work and then there's times when you're so busy you barely have time to use the bathroom. Most of the work I do was taught on the job. I learned a lot of excel functions, how to underwrite healthcare products and also how to research legal information. Management tends to be hands off and oversees work from a high level."
good,It's a great place to work with work-life balance environment that has manageable job scope. It will provide opportunity to understand legal laws and gain better knowledge on policies.
good,"Loved Aetna, the vision, mission statement and purpose. Disliked political push within company for performance. But overall a great job and benefits. I enjoyed my coworkers. Supervisors were really good with assisting when needed."
good,"Fun workplace but still a call center, which is always a drag. The most frustrating part of the job is dealing with lazy reps in other departments and then having your supervise blast YOU because you’re trying to help the patient!"
good,The work was fairly easy for me. The support offered helped a lot. There were plenty of opportunities for growth. The environment made me feel comfortable.
good,"I enjoyed working with Aetna. Easy janitorial job. Always had different openings to offer in different locations, and times of services. Very flexible."
good,"I have worked Aetna with almost 8 years. The management team and co-workers were fun to work with.The managers are willing   accomadate your needs as to paid time off requests."
good,"A typical day at work included reviewing emails and task list to organize my day prior to contacting my members by telephone. I loved being able to work from home and providing education to my members."
good,"I worked with a stellar team of developers, testers, and business analysts who really knew their stuff and worked tirelessly to always ""get it right.""  There was lots of teamwork and very little finger pointing and playing the ""blame game."""
good,"This company believes in its mission statement. Workers are generally happy, except for the mandatory overtime called most of the year. The pay is competitive, the atmosphere is team players, and flexibility is optimum in this environment."
good,"I worked in a specialized area at Aetna and all of my co-workers, including my manager, peers and subordinates acted as one team willing to do whatever was required to get the job done.  Had I not been offered an early retirement package, I would still be working there today."
good,"A strong company with high expectations.  I learned a lot and benefited from colleagues who were supportive and collaborative.  The workload was intense but manageable due to the fact that I worked with other high-performing individuals."
good,"I enjoyed educating my patients and being able to assist them with their needs at the time. I was always learning something new about  a disease or disease process, as well as if it would be covered through the healthcare system. This made my job satisfying."
good,"I would still be with Aetna, but they relocated my department to Kentucky.  It was by far my favorite place to work,  and I have been with some of the biggest companies in insurance."
good,"Good place to work.  Cafeteria available.  As a temp I was required to avoid taking time off unless in a case of emergency."
good,"great pay, great benefits, optimal room for growth, extreme flexibility with work life balance, very laid back culture, great opportunities to further education"
good,"Great place to work, great benefits. My team was with the Affordable Health Care and dealt with the marketplace. It was a new program that had its kinks. Aetna tried to train as best as possible but we had to go through separate government entities that the company had no control over. Management was the main issue, My team did not have a manager, we were bounced around and not given vital information on changes until the last minute. We would hear it through the grapevine and have to confirm rumors. Overall Job was easy, great benefits, but don't expect to have any sense of direction"
good,"One of the best places I ever worked for in terms of corporate culture, professional development, career advancement and attitude. "
good,"Great place to work. Days go by fast due to all the demands, changes, learning, assisting and desire to do a great job."
good,I have been a work at home employee for several years and have been a great benefit for work life balance.  It also provides a working relationship with members in our communities through in home face 2 face visits with our members.
good,"Have worked for Executives over the years.  Have been with my current manager for 2 1/2 yrs until his job was just eliminated.  Looking for a manager similar to my last manager; ie., communicates, cares about his directs, engaged, personable."
good,"During the 15 years of employment with Aetna I learned UM, CM, Supervision, Management, taught Motivational Interviewing, and had outstanding mentors and managers. Training was excellent. The hardest part of any of the jobs I had was the ever changing environment, which is the necessary nature of the insurance industry. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to work from home and maintain work-life balance. I will miss my ""work family"" at Aetna."
good,Aetna provided great benefits. I did not prefer the long drive to work and the second shift hours. This is a Call center environment that requires long hours sitting at a desk on the phone.
good,"Aetna will soon be one of the leading insurance companies in healthcare. Aetna focus is provide great experiences for customers, while offering balance for employees enabling to work with peace of mind in a challenging work environment."
good,The company offers lots of incentives to improve health.  FitBit & Apple watches provided at a discount.  Also extra health care dollars can be earned with exercise.
good,"You don’t expect much from call centers but this one was really good. You make $16 an hour out the gate which is really good for an entry level job. You get a really good discount on health benefits. The training is done extremely well and everyone seems to be really professional even tho you get a few bad apples as you do at most places. There are a lot of potlucks and management makes you feel very welcomed from the get go. Overall, a really great experience and I would go back there."
good,"The typical day was very fast paced, energetic, challenging, kept all ""on-you-toes"", learned something new daily, sometimes overwhelming yet there was always someone you could turn to for guidance and more learning... all in the end it all was very rewarding."
good,It was OK. For a call center. The Pittsburgh call center was a good environment generally. I guess I have no really large issues with it. I would consider going back
good,I have worked in the Group insurance division at Aetna and have learned a lot about the disability product. I experienced working with annual enrollment with outside vendors and attended legal settlements.
good,This job taught a lot about assisting customers with there concerns and questions. It taught me how to treat people and provide the service is that is needed to have the customers happy.
good,Enjoyed working at Aetna.  Truly enjoyed assisting patients with their medical insurance and better understand the insurance industry.

good,Excellent work life balance Excellent management team and CEO. Good training mechanisms. Good opportunities for advancement. Very flexible environment.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Aetna  because I enjoy helping people, and they care about the members but my only complaint is they don't appreciate their employees."
good,"Provided an opportunity to obtain knowledge working in Medicaid Health Services.  Enjoyed being able to make a difference, improve the quality of our member's health, help resolve barriers.   The most difficult part of my job was not being able to reach some of the Medicaid members."
good,Aetna is a great place to work and has lots of opportunities to grow and be challenged.  The management are supportive and there is a great culture and work ethic.
good,"Ability to work from home.  Have a heavy caseload and multiple changes every week to charting and job duties"

good,Great place to work. Colleagues are fun and upper management is passionate about the company. Benefits are great and lots of incentives to stay healthy
good,Aetna was a positive place to work overall.  I was given the opportunity to learn and advance.  Culture is positive and employee friendly.  Pay is good and benefits as well.
good,"A typical work day was on the phone with members either incoming or outbound calls."
good,"The workplace is generally quiet and friendly with the typical office politics.  Management is generally terrific.  There is a culture of excellence, and the company does try to do the right thing for the right reasons.  They are committed to diversity, and they provide training and mentoring to ensure you succeed.  Unfortunately, they could provide a better career advancement pathway."
good,"Customer centered."
good,Great place to work and on a typical day I work on claims project and process up to a 120 claim a day. I management claims project that has short deadlines and the must enjoyable part of the job is the team building with other departments and co-workers.
good,I love working at Aetna. This is the longest I've stayed in a job. There are different skills I've learned in this position that not all employees have. And my supervisors are awesome!
good,Aetna is a very good work environment as it is very divers. They gave me my first  opportunity to  experience what it is like in corporate American and I will admit that I enjoyed working for the Company.
good,I worked for Aetna for over 30 years and learned from some of the best managers/mentors.  Sometimes the hours were long but working from home afforded me with great flexibility and I didn't mind it.
good,"Aetna is a great company to work for, it offers it's employees hundreds of courses for self improvement. It also has a great benefits package. Would love to still be there!"
good,Working with Aetna  as a customer service representative has been an wonderful experience. I enjoy working with medicare members as they are more sensitive about their accounts and I help resolve their problems such as going over claims from a provider or advising the member of their benefits.
good,"I manage 2 thousand Long Term Disability claims. An average day could consist of, taking calls from claimants for a multitude of issues like questions about the LTD contract, stop payment on checks & reissues, integration with other departments like, the Life unit, Settlements, Over-payment unit, etc., as well as communications with Employers. It's an extremely fast paced job, and multitasking is essential."
good,I am very thankful for the opportunty to work with Aetna. Aetna has excellent health care benefits for families. I WOULD RECCOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO EVERYONE IF YOU ARE INTERESTING IN WORKING IN THE HEALTH CARE FIELD.
good,"Aetna has over 30,000 employees and they do a great job at maintaining their culture. Most of the employees have been with the company for a more than 5 years and that speaks volumes as to how they treat their employees."
good,"good training and the managers are very understanding the co-workers were great and typical day was good steady work all the time ,"
good,"Industry leader in Health Awareness for employees and members."
good,"Assist members with claims and benefits information, training development of SOP and continual development. Adhering to metrics and monthly goals, identifying areas of improvement for employees and developing action plans."
good,Have been with company for almost 5 years and have enjoyed it. There are opportunities for advancement and learning. I have learned a significant amount during my time and hope to continue learning.
good,"a typical day at work was coming in and everyone saying good morning.  I learned that having a HSA was a great benefit. Management was very dependable. The coworkers were very cordial.  The hardest part of the job was telling the clients that their funds were exhausted, The most enjoyable part of the job was the bonuses."
good,"Typical day at work, is being on the phones and answering customer and provider calls.  The hardest part of my job sometimes are dealing with denials on claims.  The people that I work with are great and the management is very supportive.  I do enjoy working with people and get satisfaction with my job when I help people with there issues, and sometimes save them money!"
good,"The company schedule had two different shifts, so the earliest was the best one."
good,Aetna was a very good company to work for. The pay was very good and I got evaluated every 6 months for possible raise. The culture was very good. Employees were treated with respect.
good,A lot of room for growth but you have to be willing to work for it. One thing i learned about working in a call center is to leave work at work and home at home. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people on the phones and at times it was definitely the hardest part of the job at times. Some members will give you so much push back about something you can't change like a policy so they might yell at you or curse you out. But most of the time members are nice and thankful that they are talking to a live person to help them out.
good,I enjoyed working for aetna I was never late or absent no matter what the weather was like I enjoyed my co-workers it was a wonderful place to work I enjoyed working for my supervisor I worked with a number of garrulous and loquacious people most of my team workers were very team oriented which made the job great the hardest part using  self control in dealing with difficult callers and situations the most enjoyable was getting information which allowed sometimes pretentious people to realize my job was to help them and at the end to understand that I was there to help them and resolve any issues that might be difficult no matter what it took in terms of time and effort to put myself in there shoes and satisfy there needs was great for me when I got laidoff it was a  terrible feeling for me in so many ways even now I sometimes think about the people that made coming to work feel so wonderful that's why I want to work again I know I will do a job that makes me feel really  terrific  to feel really great when they say    thank you
good,Aetna is a great place to work. I'd go back in a heartbeat. This is a place where women and minorities abound in management positions. Performance reviews and development plans are formalized. I always had a sense of true acheivement when products were launched.
good,My co-works as well as my managers were nothing but great to be around and work with. The work place was always friendly and enjoyable to work in.  On a day to day basis my co-workers and myself did anything and everything that we could to assist the member with what ever problems they would have. Overall the experience was great from the training to the actual work floor it was very enjoyable. The hardest part with this job was telling the member that I could not help them with a problem they were having and having to hear the tears on the phone.
good,"Great management and team, but work/life balance is lacking at this time."
good,"Responsive and collaborative management."
good,improved my business knowledge as well as tecnical knowledge.
good,"I still work for Aetna. About a year and a half ago Cvs/Caremark bought Aetna Pharmacy. So we had to change locations and had to reapply.  The only difference was the location. "
good,"I think it's obvious based on the other reviews here that your experience with Aetna depends largely on what your position is and what part of the country you work in. I'm a Utilization Management nurse in Richfield, Ohio, and I've had a great experience with this company."
good,"I enjoyed working at Aetna, I only had to go in the office once per week.  I enjoyed the people I worked with we were very close. We even went on a cruise together. There was lots of oppertunity for for growth. The hardest part of the job for me was talking in front of large groups of people."
good,Small; Mid- Market and National Account sales to Fortune 100-500 and Healthcare Markets.  Great Team atmosphere and growth potential.  Left Aetna for the National Sales role with smaller Company that was Texas based.
good,"A typical work day involves being on the phone and talking with members about their health issues. The goal is to help them understand as much as possible about their health conditions,  The main role of the nurse is to help the member become as healthy as possible and remain that way through educating them about their specific issues using MI (motivational interviewing) skills. The co-workers are wonderful, although most work from home. The hardest part of the job is meeting the metrics, and being successful with the chart and phone audits. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are able to make a difference in a member's life; such as helping someone to become a healthier individual or work through their depression."
good,"Review claims information including coding, rates, benefits and eligibility, coordination of benefits, pre-existing conditions; process claims for payment or pend for further investigation. I have learned so much from medical terminology, coding, reading medical records, billing, provider contracts, state legislation. My co-workers would assist each other in any way necessary to get the job done right. There were no real difficult parts of the job, just the system glitches and workarounds were a little trying at times. I enjoyed the investigational work, the mathematical calculations, coding, training outsourced vendors."
good,This was a LONG time ago. I worked at Aetna (then was sold to ING) for 21 years. I performed many administrative tasks and self-taught all of the software available. It was where I learned how to be an excellent assistant.
good,"Fun workplace environment, management is helpful and friendly and always tries to engage team participation. Co-workers are also friendly, overall I feel its a very comfortable environment."
good,Good nice benefits busy with calls but it’s cool once you get everything learned and established . Fun nice environment. Cool coworkers . Pay is excellent!!
good,"Great place. Advancement not easy! "
good,"the people were wonderful, it can be very fast pace depending and what you are doing. Great bonus, and raise every year with good employee benefits and employee appreciation."
good,Great job and advanced in a good amount of time. Great work enviroment & people. The only complaint I have about the job is they seem to always be laying workers off. I've been there a couple years & would always see it happen. Just recently I just got laid off as well.

good,Becoming a fun workplace there are a lot more things to do than it was when I first started. Was part of a start up so had to deal with the in’s and out’s of that but overall it’s a good company.
good,"Great place to work but it does require you to be able to adapt to changes quickly. It is a high paced working environment therefore on high call volume days, the work day can become very stressful. They provide good benefits and a way to advance within the company fairly quickly. If you liked to be challenged and want to move up within a health insurance company, this is the place for you."
good,My review of Aetna are that upper management struggles with finding specific info about daily tasks if changes are made the employees find out way too slowly .
good,"This was an awesome experience, as I continued the transition from 15 years in Retail Management to the Healthcare Industry.  Always doing what was right and best for the patient/provider/customers."

good,"Aetna has a relaxed, yet at the same time, competitive work environment. All levels of management at the company are great, and they give you opportunities to further yourself there."
good,Great autonomy to succeed and work from home.  You can plow the time you would have spent commuting in to your work efforts.  Executive leadership hires smart people and gives them the leeway to make decisions.
good,Great pay and benefits. Great place if you are good under pressure and enjoy researching. You can work from home when the opportunity presents itself and you get paid training.
good,Aetna provided the opportunity to work from home. I enjoyed the 10 years I was there. Due to job restructuring my position within the company was cut.
good,"I cannot say enough great things about the manager I had. The job itself was stressful yet rewarding. "
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Aetna.   My managers were great to work for and i enjoyed my assignment.   We were treated fairly.   I was in charge of provider appeals entry,  then promoted to grievances and appeals analyst.  Unfortunately,  the job assignment ended at the end of June 2018."
good,"Aetna has a solid focus on their objective to provide affordable and accessible healthcare. "
good,"The job is a fast pace working environment. You have fun and family and friend friendly. Staff work together, work independently, great customer service."

good,"I am working at Aetna as a temp, but I have to say that I enjoy working at Aetna. A typical work day consists of making phone calls to new members, opening mail and sending out letters. Management is great, I am aware that I'm being monitored by management but not in a way that makes me feel uncomfortable. The office is pretty quiet which I'm ok with. I can't really say that there is a hard part of this job."
good,Aetna was overall a good place to work.  I enjoyed the work environment and my co-workers.  Aetna is also a good place to advance your career.  The hardest part for me was the travel.
good,My time working for Aetna can only be described as a great experience for me. Strong leadership from all the managers and provided me the necessary tools for both my personal and professional growth
good,Aetna wasn t a bad company to work for. Fast paced and needed more people to complete job properly. its hard to work sometimes when building cleaning and personel still working> but overall not bad job

good,"Starting 8:00 am. Phones open up and customers calling in for benefits. Wanting to sign up for insurance, get quotes and make payments, some time transferring to the correct department. Management was great, always ready to step in and help at any time. Culture was well blended. The hardest part is not able to assist the customer when the system is down. The most enjoyable is a happy customer and working with good co-workers."
good,Fast paced work environment with plenty of opportunity for growth. great benefits that included wellness programs and employee initiatives that kept all involved.  Aetna communicates with its employees very well through the Aetna home page website.
good,"Working at Aetna, has been very enjoyable despite changes over the years. Case management expectations have changed over the years. Some for the better. Some with difficulty. The toughest part of the position is the expectation of a high caseload in addition of traveling to meet providers/ members. Despite the time you spend with this the salary is not comparable to the other companies. "
good,The focus on healthcare innovation has been a hallmark of the firm and there is alignment throughout the firm to these strategic objectives.  The consistency helps to maintain progress on projects and minimize inefficiencies

good,Aetna was an excellent company to work for. The company had excellent benefits and was flexible with scheduling so I could go to school. Unfortunately the company outsourced the IT service desk.

They have a vast amount of resources for employees to utilize to better not only their careers, but also their lifestyles as well.

Then they left the state and allowed other people to work from home."

good,This position involves colocation in a community mental health clinic.  There are daily member clinical team meetings and staffing of cases.

The coworkers and management are truly there to be supportive and informative.
good,"Very Nice company to work, having very good processes."
good,"Changed scheduled for me for school, but hate being micro managed. same things 8 hours shift 30 mins lunch which sucks because everythignwas crowed you always had to end up wating at your desk"
good,"vey happy with the overall employment here.  many different opportunities for advancement within the company.  management was extremely fair and professional, yet approachable.  great team of coworkers.  the job itself could be difficult but always fair (upset and difficult clients, employers, doctors etc)"
good,"Great Team Coordination "
good,"I worked there for 15 years. The benefits are great. Overall atmosphere is not suffocating. You have a lot of freedom, w/ very little supervision, which is great when you know your job and what's expected of you."
good,"I learned alot about the Specialty Pharmacy industry and I learned about various diseases ."
good,Helping customers obtain healthcare providers and specialists within area.
good,I must say this was one my favorite places to work. Not only did I gain a stable place of employment as well as learning the back end of the insurance healt care world. It taught me how to research my own health plan for my own family. Also I gained some long time friends
good,"This opportunity was the best position I have held.

I've learned the importance of having compassion toward all of my customers and the power of will to help them out no matter what the situation was. I also learned how to work with various systems; such as Oracle, ASD, Home Prod, and Citrix. Working at Aetna, I had the opportunity to meet a lot of great people. My coworkers were very friendly and fun to be around, which made the work environment a better place. I would say that the hardest part of my job was knowing that I had a solution regarding an issue, but it was mandatory to call the escalated line in order for the issue to be approved, which may take up to 10-15 minutes. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that my customers were satisfied and happy with the service I have provided them with."
good,"When I first started working at ASH, it was actually a smaller company called The Chickering Group. This company was amazing. They took a small hit when Aetna bought them in the way of moral and perks, but its to be expected. It wasn't anything that made me dislike my job. I learned so many things. I also got to be a part of multiple special projects. I started a charity board and helped train new people. Management was awesome. I don't think I've ever had a better management team. My supervisor and Manager are people I still keep in contact with to this day. I left because I moved out of state, or else I guarantee I would still be there and loving it."
good,Never a dull moment.  The pace can get hectic  but was laid back somewhat.  It was busy but there were activites and fund raiser that kept things lively.  Training was learn as you go for the most part unless there were classes for CEU hours or some major change in the law.
good,"Handled Office of the Chairmand complaints"
good,"I enjoyed working for Aetna for 19 years. I felt that I made a difference in many peoples lives by helping them with their benefits with Aetna, and giving them a helping hand when emergency situations in their lives came up with advise and where to go, what to do information. I also helped with questions regarding Medicare benefits, when to sign up and information on part a & part b of Medicare."

good,"Aetna is a great place to work for. Great benefits. Just not so great hours. Schedules are constantly changing every month. As soon as I got used to my schedule, it would change again"
good,it is a good place to workflexible with scheduled hrs nice people but benefits could be alot better. everyone gets along well in my dept helping others we are team players. the health insurance should be better for is older people with health issues.

good,Aetna was a wonderful place to work. My manager and supervisor were very helpful if you had something that needed to be escalated.  Working there was great experience.
good,"The work culture had a wide range of diverse employees from college age students to middle age individuals, which created a balance of personalities and work styles.  It was one of busiest job I have experienced in my entire employment history.   However, having  diversity of employees and team orientated culture made working there pleasant."
good,I would have to say this was the best place to practice CM. They have many great programs to help the member's of the organization. Staff worked relatively well. The work at home situation was great.  Unfortunately they started some programs that were a little off the wall. Overall a good experience.
good,"I truly enjoyed my time employed at Aetna. My long term goal was to finish my career and retire from Aetna but unfortunetly I was laid off. If the opportunity would be offered to return back to Aetna, I would accept and work until I could not work anymore"
good,Productive work place that helped me to utilize my skills and helped me gain additional skills. Very competitive company with great pay and great benefits.
good,"Having worked 34 years for this company, I had wonderful opportunities to learn, grow and advance in my career.  The employees are great to work with and care about the customers they serve!  I would welcome an opportunity to work for another company that feels the way Aetna does."
good,"Love management, coworkers, policy.   Great place to work!   Learned a lot about insurance.    Learned to work with a great variety of people.  Hardest part of job was stress."
good,"Aetna has been very supportive of work-life balance, retirement planning, wellness and overall health. The work at home program makes best use of our lifestyle options."
good,I would recommend anyone to work for this company. Advanced be difficult because so few new positions come available but they're out there. Medical benefits are a little pricey but perks are amazing and you can work from home. Overall wonderful place.
good,I feel that working with Aetna disability has helped me move in a really fast environment. Plus learning on your feet and  have loved every minute.
good,"Excellent working environment. Most of the people I worked with became good friends. There were social activities sponsored by management (Xmas parties, softball games, tennis league, skiing outings, field trips for business purposes, etc.). I only left to move to Florida to be in a personal relationship, then returned 7 years later to the same company. However, the environment and staff had changed and I left to get a job at Connecticut Student Loan Foundation. This job was very rewarding at first but became intolerable because of the people I had to work with. The members on my team were reluctant to take any initiative or responsibility and I was expected to pick up the slack."
good,"The feel that you get when the customer/supervisors are pleased with  your work. Having the greatest team to work with, each learning from what the other knows about how to handle the calls proficiently and accurately. Supervisor and manager as well as the team leads showing/helping you with the different calls."
good,"Would still work for company had I not moved to nc, enjoyed the small office setting,worked with a great team"
good,"This has been my favorite place to work. Though being hired is quite the extensive process, it was well worth it. I had fantastic supervisors and managers that were supportive, informative, and kind. My coworkers were lovely hard working people. I was not bored ever. This company gladly offers projects to those who seek them out. During my employment the company had several hiring freezes and layoffs due to the economy so there wasn't much room for advancement. This may change of course. Twice a year the company experiences a rush and during this time, employees are asked to work as often as they can to help out. You are compensated fairly but during this times your job, regardless of department becomes more stressful. This is to be expected in any job. Overall, I really enjoyed this company and had I not moved, I would probably still be working there today."
good,Managed a staff of 15 people at various levels and presented many opportunities for advancements.
good,"Great place! Give you all the tools and training you need to succeed!  I feel like more personal time off could be given, only earn 12 hours per month."
good,I worked there for 4 years. And it was everything i expected it to be. I was treated as an adult and my dept was not micro managed. I would recommend working there.
good,"fast paced, fun, pto,  hour lunches, meet new people , managers can be helpful at times when in a rough patch. raffles for items to win for perfect attendance, score on calls."
good,"They do not work with school schedules. Even if you ask for different days with different times off they will not budge. That is why I quit. I highly recommend this place to anyone who works there it was a phenomenal pay for me with all the overtime. The benefits were also great as well. Management, was great and really caring about time off."
good,Provided extensive training in any position held.  Excellent promotional opportunities. Well balanced work/life ratio.  Excellent pay and employee benefits.
good,"Typical day at Aetna being a network consultant was receiving calls from our constituents and providing first call resolution.  Calls entailed from web site issues, processed claims to provider contracts. Learned to engage and accommodate our constituents in professional timely fashion."
good,"A typcial day at Aetna is more ""independant"" you have to complete you work // projects thats assigned to you. You can also make your own schedule. this job teaches me great responsiblity skiils. I learned how to use great time management skills and beware of pasing my day.The hardest part is when you recieve a project from another location and theres noone in the office to help you or give direction, mainly at aetna we usually commuicat with comppettors over confrence calls. my most enjoyable part of the day is when im complete with what was assigned to me."

good,worked as a case manager. worked with various type of patient have various type of health conditions. Working in a big institute gave the ability to familiarize my self with different department and observe different workflows. Also gave me the chance to collaborate with different disciplines and department to ensure the continuity of care and achieve better patient outcomes. It was a great experience and chance to learn and shape my nursing knowledge and skills.

good,"I started work at 8:30 am until 5:00 pm.  I carried at first an 80 client caseload consisting of calling and educating clients daily.  I had to maintain a 10-15 call maximum per day.  Transcribed lengthy notes on each call, attended in-services and meetings.  Learned more in-depth organization using virtual methods.  Management was good when I started but was transferred to another group who had never managed telecommuters and micromanaged the team."
good,"Decent Wage but little to no opportunity for advancement.. opportunities to work from home, but no room for advancement. Constant micro-management"
good,Great insurance company to work for just challenging to move up. They do not award tenure here and rather hire outside talent. There is also a lack of transparency with the internal job selection process
good,"Aetna has truly become a leader in the insurance industry and I'm proud to have been a part of it.  I can say that I learn something every day.  While what I do has consistencies, no 2 projects are ever the same, so there is diversity all the time making the job interesting and challenging."
good,"Loud, noisy, work schedule changes, they track the number of calls you take per day & that's how they review you to see if you meet your goals. They say the number of phone calls don't necessary count but then they encourage you to take over 50 calls per day."
good,"A typical day at work with Aetna requires empathetic listening, attention to detail, innovative thinking with the capacity to provide solutions during live calls."
good,This was a short duration task. Evaluations were fair and technical support for poorly performing software was dedicated. The company fostered a good work environment.

After showing what I could do as the evening supervisor I was asked to come to the day supervisor.  Every morning I attended meetings where each department gave their numbers from the previous day, what our goal would be for the day ahead.  Once again I learned what the other departments operations consisted of.  The best part was the production area, from start to finish of a patients order.  I would answer all escalated calls, return them advising when their order would be sent out and when they would be receiving them, whether or not the order would have to be signed for or not.  I enjoyed production because I watched the orders go completely from when I would walk them out to when they were packed and ready for shipment.  I had a very hard working team of callers.

My co-workers were great to get along with I have never had an issue with any of them. The hardest  part of this job was when I would receive an irate caller and I just had to wait til the caller has finished and take all information down and offer them a call back within 24hrs and I had to do that only when it was after hours and there was nothing that I could do.

My bosses (I have 5) were the best bosses I've ever had. I want to find a new position and would like to leave because of the employees that I currently  have to deal with on a daily basis. The work-life balance is amazing, the work is fulfilling, I would recommend this job. The only reason I want to leave is because I do not care for the people that I provide extra assistance too. Once you join this job, its a career for life, but for me I would like to find new opportunities with people I enjoy working with, spending imt with, especially since I spend 8+ hours a day at work and not at home."

good,"Aetna had lots of well educated interesting work participants. There was excellent training.

I worked in the Actuarial Department, Marketing Department, Aetnas Learning Institute..My functions as an Administrative Assistant included--composing correspondence, extensive phone work, scheduling trips for V.P.s, coordinating business meetings, arranging luncheons for employees, etc.  I was extremely organized and swift.

My coworkers included Graduates of Brown, Fairfield University, Uconn, etc. Nothing was particully hard for me The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with people. I   enjoy that along with telemarketing sales."
good,Aetna is a great place to work.  My colleagues were always friendly and the management really seems to care about the wellbeing of the employees.  They are good with allowing time off and very understanding.

good,The work environment was good. You were able to make coffee or tea thru out the day. The people was very nice to work with. There was no pressure as long as you got your work done. Very productive place to work.

good,Aetna is a telework friendly company.  They are also large into volunteerism.  They allow a great work/life balance in order to maintain a high degree of employees.
good,I Loved working at Aetna and would still be working there if I had not been laid off. Aetna has lay offs every year and most of the people that I worked with are gone.
good,"I absolutely love Aetna. Benefits and everything added makes it one of the best corporate companies to work for in corporate America. Unfortunately, what I wanted out of Aetna, I didn't receive. I wanted to grow into management position but there were lack of opportunities at first. The second reason being the management at my jobsite was difficult to work with. Of course, not all management was like that but my immediate management was. Workplace culture the company portrayed was really amazing and involved. Due to my department being a call center and being extremely busy 10 months out of the year, we barely enjoyed 10% of it. Compensation vise, we were not compensated well competitively. HR excuse was the benefits outweigh the hourly rate. They didn't. I was paid more as a temp than as a full time employee. My overall experience was a really wonderful learning experience. I will continue to say that Aetna is one of the best companies to work for but its who you work with that matters, not what you do."
good,I enjoyed working for Aetna very much.  I worked at many companies during my career and found that Aetna was the best over all of them.  It is the company where I worked the longest (12 years).  That says it best.
good,Prioritize urgent and work on those items first and other will follow. Attend meetings when needed and follow thru on any overdue or open items. Participate on projects that will help standardize daily procedures

good,This department is a very high demand work environment with fast past turnaround times and deadlines.  Can be stressful but very rewarding and pays well if you like working overtime.
good,"I love this job.  It was a Contracted position, so I did not receive compensation other than salary.   I have reported to Aetna 2 years in a row so far.  I am hoping they pick me up permanently.  I have had an amazing team experience with Aetna.  A typical day at work is 8 hours.  I often worked longer because I believe in finishing my assignments even if it runs into overtime.  For me, there is nothing hard about this assignment.  What is frustrating is hoping they have the budget to make you a permanent employee."

good,Aetna is a fast paced and challenging workplace. Teamwork and collaboration were greatly encouraged and necessary to provide excellent customer service. All of my team and management worked together to put the customer at the center of everything that we do. I found it rewarding to help people with their healthcare.
good,Awesome place to work. I was able to work form home. Working from home provided a healthy work life balance. No opportunity for growth after completing my Nurse Practitioner degree and certification. The company supported and even paid a portion of my tuition when they did not utilize FNP's within my department.
good,"My work was telework which I enjoyed working from home.  We had daily call in meetings and on-site meetings at one of our local hospitals.  Training was provided in Dallas, Texas  and San Antonio, Tx.   The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting with physicians and hospitals and working the health fairs. "

good,I love Aetna and have nothing bad to say about my time there. It is stressful but most jobs are.  The only reason I'm an leaving is because I want to go back tons clinical setting and it's hard working from home and having your team all over the country when you are a social person.

good,The culture within Aetna is conducive to hard work. There are many great people that work at this company. I have worked for Aetna for 17 years and have learned many things.
good,"The recent changes to the healthcare requirements as defined by ACA caused major changes to the plan administration and plan benefits.  Aetna's focus on living healthy lifestyles played a termendous role in the successful implementation of the changes and the positive results.  There were some negatives as well, such as reducing staff by transitioning some positions to offshore vendors.  One of the most difficult things to overcome was meeting customer demands with a much leaner staff.  Everyone works extremely hard every day and puts the members first.  On days when I was able to make a difference in someone's life by expediting a claim payment or providing information on plans which were critical in the member making the best decision for his/her healthcare needs is the most enjoyable part of my job.  Healthcare is very complicated and can be confusing to many people and they need guidance, especially in situations where the decision is critical healthwise and financially."
good,"Job was great but company moved to another country. I really loved working there, I loved the atmosphere and the people I worked with in the office. We worked great as a team the only con I had was when our department got moved."

good,I would recommend this company to everyone I know. Management was trusting of their employees. I enjoyed working for Aetna.  I ended my assignment due to relocation.
good,"The workplace was productive but for the amount of work I've done, I am not being paid enough nor am I gaining any benefits."
good,"I enjoyed working for Aetna for the past 13 years."
good,"In my time at Aetna, my experience has been that there is plenty of opportunity for individuals willing to buy into the culture and who place value in providing supreme customer service to the members. In my first six months, I received a promotion and have been selected to do special projects, such as train new employees. The training program provided a crash course in learning the basics of health insurance in just 16 weeks. While it is joy to go to work each day for the opportunity to serve members and work with great people, the compensation is a little low for the amount of work and attention to detail that this job entails."
good,"This is a great paying company with a great CEO. Management could use an adjustment.  Their website states they're flexible and a green company and the majority of the employees are work from home. However, when my husband received a job offer in a new state, I was not allowed to work from home, even though we already had 15 employees in our particular department working from home already. "
good,"A typical day at work would include answering call from various doctors, members and providers regarding planned members benefits. It also include speaking with providers regarding benefits that a member has.  Sometimes called of escalated because of claims not being paid.  Therefore, we would need to look at benefits to determine if claim should have been paid.  If is to be paid we would send claim back to claim department for payments."

good,"I work with a unique group of individuals from various backgrounds and cultures. This type of work group makes my work environment very delightful and I enjoy coming to work every day. "
good,"A typical day at casa would include coming in and prepping for meal times.  Assist customers when they come in to dine, answer multi line phone system to answer questions and take carry-out orders, use computers to input carry-out orders, assist servers with food running and cleaning.  It was a very fast paced environment but working as a team we were able to successfully keep the customers flowing and happy.  Management did a very good job at helping the employees and pin pointing any problems and solving them right away."

good,"I could remember the day I did my first modeling of data from heterogeneous sources at GBMC after functioning as a BI Developer for so long that I almost forgot the entire ETL process. My Supervisor saved the day by pointing out my errors to me, he reminded me of the ETL workflow process. It was fun because my colleagues saw me going the wrong way and kept mute, my data types where not in order, so many things were not right, but he came and guide me through. I came to realize that its better to work as a team than do it all alone. The most enjoyable part of the job was how he teaches like he is teaching a kindergarten child so one can grab the entire process. The hardest part of the job was when I was struggling with the entire process, it was frustrating but kudos to my boss that salvage the situation.

The conferencing department was very small. We were a tight knit group. More like a family. The demands were sometimes tough to meet, but everyone pulled together to get the job done.

good,"I really enjoy working for Aetna and all the perks that come with the job. The only issue I have had in the Phoenix office is a supervisor who is condescending and rude to those she doesn’t particularly care for. I am also a supervisor and have to listen to complaints about her. My boss is wonderful but she cannot seem to change this culture. I have been here for 4 years and I am now the 4th supervisor to work with her in that time. The 3 before me left due to this one person and her need for power and control. I am looking for a new job despite loving my current job, only because I cannot tolerate her any longer. Sad"

good,A typical day at work is helping Medicare members/ Provider offices with claims. The hardest part of the job is listening to the struggles of the senior community.
good,"Aetna is a great company to work for.  The opportunity for advancement is available however somewhat difficult to do. Some of the departments seemed to be isolated from others. It is possible to be crossed trained. There is a large amount of information available, training courses, etc...  The workplace culture as a hold is keen on advancement, excellence, training. There are employees who have there for over 20 years.  That says a lot about the company's structure. The hardest part about my job was the lack of direction."

The culture is nice and the engagement committee really listens to our concerns and encourages participation.

good,As a Short Term Disability Claims Manager my day began with opening the new claims that were assigned the prior day. After all new claims were completed the rest of my work day consisted of calls to claimants and/or providers to obtain supporting medical information to make further claim determination. The hardest part of my job was when a claimant passed away and having to speak to the family. The most enjoyable/rewarding part of my job was being able to approve a claim and get the claimant paid. Aetna is a great place to work and there is alot of teamwork within the departments.
good,"The typical work day for me is productive and challenging. I never know what to expect, meaning the challenges I will face when I come in each day, keeps me on my toes. I learn on a daily basis because no one call is the same. So, from each call or issue I handle there is always something to take away and apply to the next. the work environment is pleasant for the most part and the people are great to work with. Aetna offers tons of incentives and perks along with great benefits and programs for employees that help balance out work and home life. The hardest part of my job is to listen to some of the callers health issues and not being able to communicate with them on a level that I am use to. I am very passionate about people. I have a big heart and deep care for people. I also have to respect the profession and follow policy and regulations and most of all the law."

good,This is a production based environment but very laid back. The management is great and fair. Co-workers are pleasant and nice to work with. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with productivity and working mandatory overtime during enrollment season.

good,"I love that there is an option to work from home. "

In my responsi bility was: research and resolve eligibility and billing related issues, involving member specific information; monitoring daily status reports, completing screen coding and data entry requirements."
good,"I have had the opportunity to work in three verticals - healthcare, automotive, and household appliances - albeit in operations and/or customer service, however, I have been able to leverage best practices and approaches not previously thought about.  My day is all abot finding ways to take the complexity out of processing and to simplify how we do business.  I have learned the voice of the customer is key to any solution or launch.  I enjoy mentoring and working with people - I pride myself on being hands on but not to the point of micro managing or crippling others growth.  I am seen as a change agent, non traditionalist that comes from working in many industries.  "
good,"Provide around the clock service ans support to members"

good,"I learned a vast amount regarding clinical case management of disability claims with little supervision needed. I was given the opportunity to work at my own pace, and utilize my clinical skills in various areas of claims management, documentation, crisis intervention, and treatment planning. The hardest part of the job was having to complete a high workload within a 40 hour work week. The job demanded more time than a regular full time work week with work life balance not promoted. The timeliness constraints and strict auditing guidelines contributed to high level of personal stress."
good,Very good company I worked there 9 years it changed on leaders  and to me all were good to work with I was able to take  lots of classes and learned about the green clean travel to meeting
good,"A great place to work and provides a balance for personal and work life."
good,I really enjoyed my time with Aetna.  This is a great company.  The management and my co-workers were all high-performing and cared about one another on a personal level.  They even offered to maintain my employment through a cross-country move when my husband was transferred on military orders.  I learned a lot working here and was able to hone my skills in health coaching as an RN.
good,"This job is challenging but very rewarding. There is a lot of research that has to be done in order to complete your tasks for the day. Plenty of reading and follow ups with providers. But you learn a lot regarding how different states discipline providers for their wrong doings, yet the management is very good with giving you more than enough time to complete your work with minimal supervision. That would be the best part about this job. The hardest part about this job would be trying to locate who would be handling the credentialing for the providers if the credentialing contact information isn't listed on the providers application."

After 2 seasonal assignments, I no longer think I just ""got lucky"" and worked with exceptional people.

What I found in their management style is that they are professional, humanistic, supportive and can you believe it? . . . humble.  My co-workers demonstrated the genuine definition of teamwork. The hardest part of the job was knowing the assignment would come to an end.  The most enjoyable part of the job was waking up in the morning and knowing I was a member of a great team.
