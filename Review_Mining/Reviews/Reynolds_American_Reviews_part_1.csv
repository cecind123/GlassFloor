rating,review
bad,"1.  Worst Technology I have seen.  We were given new Pads to record our visits, did not work properly for 3 months.  After two years we are getting laptops.  They sometimes just stop working, delete everything on them, lose ability to connect to internet.   IT is in India "
bad,Awful company culture that cares so little about the customers and only about its own bottom line.  It's all about tell and not sell at RJ Reynolds where they waver their contacts around like weapons.
bad,Awful company! No respect for its employees and management could care less about training and coaching new employees. Too much work for too little pay.
bad,Asked and trained to forge retail sales contracts within 2 weeks of employment
bad,"Will fire you for no reason whatsoever. Too busy giving sorry/lazy employees easy machines to run/repair, while giving the harder working people the hard machines. Everyone in a job class makes the same amount of money, regardless of how good or sorry you are. You can work your butt off, and get the same raise and bonus as the sorry employee standing beside you. "
bad,The organization has begun the process of throwing out projects and initiatives for products with little success.  The work load is continuously increased into unmanageable levels and expectations or irradic and unpredictable.  The focus of the organization changes weekly and the company has adopted the throw it at the wall and see what sticks mentality for products.  The max pay for Territory Managers and Account Managers is the starting salary of our competitors with 5x the workload.  My recommendation is to look elsewhere and out of the tobacco industry.  The culture is toxic.
bad,Job security is very low. The company just had a layoff and some employees are unhappy. The pay has been reduce because of the declining market and government regulation on packs of cigarette.
bad,I hated my division.  They treated me as if i wefe dumb amd the job was not fun everything was a competion.  I dreaded this style of training and coaching
bad,"Management was horrible at best.  Unrealistic expectations and did not follow the guidelines set down by the company."
bad,"Forced to work OVERTIME or you have HOURS deducted from your vacation.  You are NOT paid for those hours.  You work beside of people that perform the same job as you, but make 15 to 20 dollars more per hour.  Management is virtually useless, and only cares about production.  Every employee last year except production workers received a raise. This is the culture!"
bad,"Company is too focused on form (not substance), thoughts, future at the expense NOT results and the present. Company often places youthful and inexperienced personnel in positions they are grossly unprepared for. They then report to others who are the same - and the results are not good.  "
bad,"Typical day is you visit retail outlets and ensure contracts are being followed and build relationships with mangers, owners, etc."
good,Company does not stand by the long term employees.  There is a lack of consistency from one manager to another.   The direction is often not clear and we are not sure if our immediate manager is providing the proper direct from upper or executive management.
good,RJ Reynolds is a good place to work if you do not plan on advancing your career past a sales rep.  Good work/life balance and decent enough salary to keep you in the position.
good,"A typical day could be 12 hrs. Conpensation was good , but the benifits package was too expensive though we received alot of discounts from coutless companys.Their was really no job security, the management was terrible.The hardest part of the job sometimes would be the 19hr shifts with almost no breaks. Overall this job taught me alot more self disipline, my co-workers were fun to be around and it felt good knowing I could slightly be making a diffrence keeping everything secure."
good,Not a very satisfying place to work knowing you're selling tobacco that kills people. Management is the worst because they basically have absolute immunity and do not care if your territory is harder or easier to manage.
good,"After the Newport acquisition everything changed, but not for the better. The company regressed back to the days of 2008. Too many brands and too many initiatives that we are trying shove down retailers throat."
good,Likes younger recruits that have extensive computer skills.
good,"the best parts of my current employment are the people on my team, the independence and the tremendous benefits!  each day brings a new adventure, challenge and opportunity to enhance my social selling skills and grow my business as if it were my own."
good,"Not a bad job overall. You spend all of your day in and out of gas stations.  There have been some major changes since BAT took over, some other reviews have it in more detail and it’s accurate—3rd party merchandising was cut, there has been a major focus on financial stewardship. 4Q19 earnings call for RAI was very good, our company score—which bonuses are based off of, not so good.  Division meetings are not as fun. The biggest problem with this company is they announce things very ambiguously, like salary increases for example—really talk it up, and then when it comes out in writing it’s not great at all can get dishearting, and disappointing.  Everything is priority #1, everything!!! New products launching all the time, with no space/no where to go.  It’s your job to fight that battle with disengaged gas station store managers who don’t even want to bring the product in. You’ll have 2 maybe 3 weeks to get all your stores ready for said product, if you’re lucky. Company has been very slow to ship materials you need to merchandise properly so by the time you get what you need to get going, you’ll have two weeks to get it done. Can be easy, but most of the year you’re running around getting something ready and the second you’re finished there’s something else that’s incredibly important to complete that needs to be started or you’ll get behind. Manage this while accomplishing all the other company objectives like consumer engagements. CE’s as they’re called is interrupting a consumer who runs into Wawa for their smokes, tell them all about some cigs they’ve heard of but don’t"
good,"Easy to get by day to day. Watch out for managers with high turn-over. But if you get a good manager who has a team with > 5 years experience on average, you'll be in good hands. As others have said, STAY FAR AWAY FROM Salt Lake City. Denver Region is good, just not SLC."
good,"Reynolds America is company with a vision and go ""full steam ahead"" with any and all projects they take on. They examine the market and look at the potential and opportunity they have to capitalize before making a move."
good,RAI is a great company to work for but for career advancement you can't dictate your location. I spent 4 years in a rural area coming from a big city and had no work/life balance. After being promoted I had to relocate across the country and only saw my family twice per year. The company is good but it all depends on who you work for and who works with you.
good,"This job, starting as a territory manager, is all about handling the autonomy of being on your own. The freedom is nice, I feel it’s a great way to conduct business."
good,Great entry level job. Work life balance can be somewhat difficult based on your assignment. The company does place a lot of resources into training their employees.
good,"Get to work on your own, and don't have to worry about others being in your business.  Working for big tobacco has a little bit of a stigman attached to it."
good,Good Work/Life balance; great 401 package and overall benefits.  Getting promoted is difficult.  Consistency and transparency is lacking from region to region.
good,"Good company with good benefits and decent salary, many opportunities to learn, many well organized and useful educational programs, working from home, etc. However, not very diverse, deeply rooted in local community with many locals working there (successors of previous generations who worked there). Promotions generally follow this trend."
good,Reynolds American is a great company with great people. We have great products and are given the autonomy to run our territories as we see fit and make informed decisions on a daily basis.
good,It is a good company to join after college. Their benefits are comparable to other CPG companies. Best benefit is the company car. Salary is not where it needs to be
good,Your experience is made by your management.  Some markets have different management styles that are not conducive to  employee retention.  However you could have a totally different experience with another market.
good,"Overall good place to work. Excellent Pay. I enjoyed my entire career there. I really have no complaints.  There is plenty of opportunity to move around and advance, just take advantage while you are working there."
good,"Launch your career here, kids. Suck up to those influential leaders and latch yourself onto them. You are golden. Watch out for the boys club that reigns supreme in some areas."
good,"This company offers a great culture and a extremely good work life balance if you know what you are doing and stay on your game. However, they are very inefficient, wasteful and not a market leader. Growth is limited due to the nature of this business and I've seen my share of smart, talented people leave because the promises made to move up get sidetracked when the pipeline get clogged."
good,"I worked at RAI for nine years in various Finance roles.  I very much enjoyed my time there, the company was very good to both myself and my family.  Pay, 410k, benefits, work/life balance are all fantastic.  However, after the acquisition by British American Tobacco, upward mobility is nearly non-existent as open management/leadership roles are regularly filled by BAT (non-US) employees.  I left RAI to pursue the next level of advancement in my career, but have no regrets about my time spent at RAI."
good,decent company to work for with great benefits...work autonomy...objectives were achievable...nice working culture...needed new opportunity for advancement
good,"Cares about employees, lots of employee benefits. They give you a company car and pay for gas. Job involves a lot of communication skills as you are constantly talking to customers and consumers."
good,RAI is enjoyable for those responsible enough to be on there own all day.  The coaching and peer network to help your sales success is very well structured. Just hope you don't get placed in a rural location
good,You will visit convinience stores that are company contracted to ultimately maximize brand shares. Typically about 100 accounts a month. You also manage your own time and activities. Very profesional and positive culture. Always a lot of growth with in the company. Management is the best resource to your personal success!
good,"Sold in RJR programs and made sure these programs followed with compliance.  Became business adviser these stores.  Spent a lot of ""windshield time in a large territory that compiled 25% of my division."
good,"Typical sales role, the landscape of the business keeps you on your toes. So you have to be flexible to keep up with a changing industry. Great benefits"
good,RAI is a great company to not only gain sales experience but further your career. Plenty of potential growth for those looking to advance their career. Also quality work/life balance
good,"I joined RJ Reynolds at a very busy time. A week after I started we acquired Newport Cigarettes for 28 billion dollars. It was very fast paced and I loved that I was able to learn so much at such a fast rate. The management team did a great job of providing incentives to motivates its sales team. Whether it would be trips to Las Vegas or bonuses. They took care of us. "
good,Reynolds is a great company to work for. They have great benefits and work-life balance. They prefer to promote from within which is great. Would reccommend.
good,"The position really depends on your territory. My territory is pretty seamless. It allows great flexibility so you can enjoy personal life freely. Management is the same, but again, it depends on your territory. Thankfully my manager is big on self accountability and trust."
good,A day in the field executing and closing sales calls. Conversing with retailers/accounts to establish and maintain and mutually beneficial relationship resulting in increased volume and share of market. This position has enhanced my strategic thinking and customer centered selling techniques. I work within a strong team that is lead by a supportive manager. Your co-workers provide guidance and challenge you in your development. The most challenging part of this position is keeping a connection with your team and maintaining homogeny. 
good,Great environment to work. Reputable company. Company is always looking for ways to better solution tailored to specific goals. Future focussed and adapting to changes in the ever changing tobacco industry.
good,I enjoyed working there and would love to go back if possible.  They were bought out by R.J. Reynolds..
good,For over 10 years I truly enjoyed working at Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company a subsidiary of RAI. I loved being apart of a fast growing company on the cutting edge of pioneering business practices in the tobacco industry. I had the opportunity to work with many talented people. Its the people of Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company that kept this a fun place to work!
good,As a manager within the Trade Marketing & Sales Division i would meet with business owners that were selling our products and assist them with product selection and ordering.
good,"I really enjoy this job, my colleagues and the learning opportunities! The training and professional development opportunities are unmatched. I hope to retire from this company one day down the road!"
good,Company values it’s employees. Management makes sure you have a great work/life balance. Company provides resources to prepare you and to continue To support you so that you’re able to do your job.
good,"Working for a tobacco company has its difficulties, but this is great training ground for government affairs."
good,"On a typical day, I would start by checking the spec sheet to make sure everything is operating according specifications. Prepare sheets to record reject data. Clean and blow out if needed. Load the machine and run product. While product is running, collect, seperate, and identify quality defects. I learned how to operate a hand truck and how to identify quality defects. Management was always available when needed; firm, but not overbearing. The most enjoyable part of the job was keeping the product running smoothly. The hardest part of the job was seperating and identifying each quality defect. My co-workers were all very cooperative. We all worked together to produce the finest quality in our product."
good,Good benefits and work environment.  Felt like family but a results driven one.  Recommend highly.  I have not found another company with similar benefits.
good,"An excellent place to work. A typical work day was 37.5 hours. Consideration was given to safety and well being of the employees."
good,"Great work life balance. Company Car, Gas Card, Phone. Great culture. Day starts at 8 you should do about 8-10 sales call a day. 3 weeks vacation days"
good,"A high performing company in virtually all ways.  Top management team, strong performing business units and a vision to Transform their industry for the better..."
good,"A day at work is very routine. Ive learned to operate machinery, communicated with management about major problems concerning the operation of machinery.The hardest part of my job is cleaning at the start of each shift. the most enjoyable part of my job is watching quality."
good,"You receive adequate training, great managers and coworkers.  The whole company culture is collaborative and understanding. A typical day is making 6-8 calls a day.  Got to talk to business owners, managers, staff, and end-user of our products.  Company vehicle (all expenses like gas, maintenance, carwash are provided) You are charged every paycheck but it is well worth what you would pay for any car.  Good pay and bonuses as well as PTO."
good,"I've been promoted multiple times with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco/Reynolds American. Everyone especially our CEO, President, Vice President, and upper management started at the same position. High volume in sales with our quality products in consumer goods. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you sell for the relationships long term and not the salary. Recession proof career. With a diverse culture with well educated people. We work hard and play harder. We are compensated at the highest salary range due to demand of our accounts, customers, and the consumer goods industry."
good,"Reynolds American is a good place to work.  The pay is good and the benefits are even better.  They provide a company vehicle, a gas card, and an expense account.  The down side is you may have to move to a area of the country that you are not fond off to begin working."
