rating,review
bad,"Trenton,NJ terminal is a poor management and the Union runs everything..Treat management like garbage..No one there helps you especially if you are new employee..I do not recommend this employment to anyone.."
bad,Never again. The manager made a scapegoat of me. They laid all of the contract employees off for two weeks in December . No refrigerators or breakrooms.  Dust falling from the ceiling l. We had to bring in our own refrigerators and coffee makers.  Snotty catty management that called people names behind their backs.
bad,Company had a merger  (yellow freight/roadway express) went from one of the best to the worst ive ever worked for. Froze pension which help me decide to retire early.  Did not provide service to its customers or employees.
bad,"Very poor place to work. Does not treat employees well, unless they are a a** kisser or a ""yes man"""
bad,"I worked for YRC for almost 8 years, I worked days/nights/weekends and Holidays. We all called the way of life like the donkey affect "" as long as your still alive and walking they will keep adding to your loadand don't think you will be rewarded."
bad,Procurement department is in an uproar.  MGMT has no clue how the trucking industry works.   Losing great people and filling with MGMT minions.   Time is telling....stock price reflects it.
bad,"The company was greedy, and tried to acquire companies before having an infrastructure in place to support it. "
bad,"The most hostile work environment I have ever been in. Nothing positive to say. Pay is decent, but nothing else is redeeming. I left as quickly as I could."
bad,"It pays the bills  "
bad,"The worst in the LTL business. Losing all the freight to the competition. The senior guys they have here are driving this company in the ground. The Union sucks, they have no backbone. Since they run based on seniority newer, younger, fresher, hard working guys get stuck on the dock or worse Laid off. The pay is subpar at best. The managers are a bunch of liars. Only thing good about this place is the medical insurance if you have a family. Other than that this place is trash."
bad,"Stressful at this point because they are trying to integrate sales to enterprise sales but we do not have visibility of any other companies that we are now responsible to represent. YRCW has launched but have not provided any tools to fully integrate visibility of what we are supposed to represent. Confusing to sales. Opcos are not  integrating but sales has with no tools to help launch until an estimated target date of mid 2020. 401k contribution has stopped along with monthly bonus, until further notice."
bad,"I started off working my azz off just like everyone does but there is petty old folks in here and as time goes by they start getting to you.. you will start to become a unhappy camper working here but you get paid decent for the little work that you do , very easy work! If your not lazy like the seniors in here, this job is really ok besides the fact that you start to become a lazy scum bag after a while lol"
bad,It provided a decent wage and great medical but the work culture is the worst. Run down ragged equipment and unacceptable bathrooms and break rooms. Absolutely the worst run company I’ve ever seen. No future
bad,YRC is a sinking ship. They can not compete with other ltl carriers. Very unhappy place to be at. The drivers are unhappy. The operation side is just out of touch. Pricing is not competitive with the major carriers.
bad,I would start my day by reviewing inbound freight then the chase would begin. I would inspect all freight and do any corrections on BOL that didn't match what was actually being shipped. This would  give you a positive dollar figure for my freight revenue needed for the month. There was no positive reinforcement whatsoever. You had to find your own answers and be prepared to face the consequences if it wasn't correct. Training was vague with a lot of important information left out that was needed to be successful.
bad,"As a Manager with experience in all aspects of operations, I was not allowed to run my terminal or do my job that fit the local marketplace and employees.  I was constantly told how I would manage my people, run my terminal, and report out every operations day.  Entirely too many conference calls, too many daily reports to send to hire management - with 95% of them totally unnecessary, just simply making sure your are spending every hour how THEY want you to spend it.  Their is zero empowerment from upper management to the most critical aspect of the company - The local facility managers.  I would not recommend this company to anyone that is intelligent, a self starter, and good manager."
bad,"Pay is good, but expect to get bothered about requesting vacation time.  I'll say this about my personal experience, which almost certainly differs from other positions, trying to get people to cooperate is next to impossible, management is generally pretty apathetic to problems, and the company itself is grounded in old technologies and ways of thinking."
bad,Theres always a rush to deliver time sensitive shipments. Learned quite a bit about the freight industry and how to properly load trailers. Management is tough and there is a buddy system in place. There is also a negative attitude throughout and it's just not a open and friendly environment and thats the hardest part. The pay is not half bad.
bad,Work over 12 hour days on any given shift. Culture is horrible. Management is horrible. They beat you down until you are just burned out. They pick on certain people and don’t treat everyone fairly. If you make them mad they will move you to another shift that you don’t want to work or can’t work. Turn over at this company is insane. Mostly due to management. Salary and benefits are good but overall not worth it due to the work life balance. 4 on 3 off but you are so worn out by the time your days come you don’t feel like doing anything. Overall bad experience due to management. Company is also close to going under due to the union so beware.
bad,The job was very stressful with too many chief and not enough Indians.Upper management had rather threaten you with you job than look at the big picture if you disagree with them
bad,"They brought in a CEO from Sprint.  Sprint is a mess.  Consequently, YRC became a mess.  They bought Roadway  who hid a lot of debt.  YRC inherited that."
bad,"Typical day varied from day-to-day in a fast paced environment, which was great, but communication was bad. I split my time between recruiting, training, labor issues, and administrative duties. I learned many things there. I learned everything from EEOC to OSHA guidelines. There were several management changes, that caused some miscommunications. The most difficult part of the job was getting time to train employees because the logistics industry is all about time. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the staff and solving problems. I enjoyed the people that I worked with at YRC Worldwide. There was little opportunity for advancement and several layoffs. The company would have better market share if there was more communication between labor and management."
bad,In a typical work day I start off the day reviewing the freight that I have coming and out for the whole day. The i review the man hours to make sure that I have enough man power to move all the freight. Then i set work assignments for each person on each shift. Shifts average 40-50 people. I then monitor the employees to make sure they are acheiving their goals and following proper safety protocal.
bad,Overall this was not an enjoyable place to work. The hours were fair but the capabilities of management were seemingly limited.
bad,"This was a very difficult job to balance home life and work life. This company did not take into account that employees had families, and made decisions based on only the companies needs."
bad,"My experience with YRC was not the best. In fairness, multiple factors have to be considered in my assesment of this company. During my tenure, YRC was experiencing economic difficulty. 3 weeks into my employment, I was forced to take a 10% pay reduction. Once I got promoted, my new salary was based upon a 10% pay reduction as well. Unfortunately, YRC's HR or management forgot that my pay was already reduced and they implemented another 10% pay reduction more than 6 months into the position. There were many layoffs, including myself during this time. There is a seperation between union and non-union employees and management had a tendancy of being rather bullish regardless of the economic challenges that their sales people experienced. Commissions and bonuses were either not paid or took nearly 6 months to recieve after being earned. They no longer provide company cars for their sales people and require the vehicle in use to be no more than 4 years old in order to recieve a car allowance."
bad,"Moving freight to different location to city, inbound and outbound etc...."
bad,"Over worked with zero life/work balance."
bad,"The job would be so much better if they would speed up the trucks to at least 67 miles er hour because doing 63 miles per hour is very dangerous and risky. Also, the equipment is very poor and dangerous, the trucks are very nasty and dirty on the inside."
bad,"It is what it is..................equipment issues, slip seating sucks, atmosphere is at times difficult to handle...........they care about quantity not quality of driver!!!"
good,Good Company enjoyed the opportunity to learn different Internal systems
good,"Hard job,sometimes 17 hour days.good friends to work with.alot to tell to much to write"
good,* What abused equipment will I be required to drive.
good,Lots of old equipment 60 + hours per week  benefits are incredibly good management is horrible but who cares they aren't in the truck with u so I leave and go about my business
good,A good place to work with a bunch of great people I have made a decent living here. As a Union Employee there is no room to advance.
good,"4-12s are nice, but difficult for work and family balance. Not a horrible company, but a very difficult and challenging work environment. Management is not supported therefore the relationship between management and union employees is stressful. Clear direction is often dismissed and left up to discretion. The company struggles to deliver a work-life balance and often expects overtime. Due to the lack of communication, expectations are not clear and difficult to achieve."
good,Old Equipment Union Based Company works midnights will not exceed 25 hrs per week if not holding a CDL License No CDL Training. 13 per hour when i was working there.
good,"Not the greatest place issues never stop and never change."
good,"In my time there, drivers were the bottom of the barrel. Management treated drivers poorly. Company and Union agreed to reduce pensions and reduce wages."
good,"Working for YRCW was difficult due to being purchased by them.  Employed by Roadway before purchase was one of the best companies I have had the privilege to be a part of.  With YRCW came business changes that forced 1000's of jobs to be eliminated, which resulted in employees doing 2 and 3 jobs simultaneously.  This made providing excellent customer service difficult particularly when my team of up to 20 CS reps were responsible for corporate accounts (see resume).  Within 2 years we worked under 6 managers, one for approximately 2 months.  The most difficult part of my job as supervisor was to motivate and encourage my employees.  During that time we earned the first ever CS award from Mattel, and was also recognized with a similar award from Target for managing the movement of 200,000 lbs of freight during the holiday season.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being successful in providing the ultimate in service and rewarding my employees (which cost me personally approximately $300 per month).  They deserved better than I was able to provide via YRCW but I ""had their back"" and left myself vulnerable.  I am not the type of employee who looks the other way when something is remiss, however I also understand business and feel I am able to consider both sides, including the reason for business - making a profit.  I always managed as if I was spending my own dime and feel good about how I performed when I was released from my position due to downsizing.  Working for Roadway was much more pleasant; they held employees in high regard and rewarded them accordingly.  The culture"
good,"the hours suck and no room for advancement, the company is struggling financially and it does not look good for them"
good,"24/7 operation, bring others on from temp agencies to fill vacancies rather then promote within the other departments and people looking for better hours"
good,"Did not know all the co-workers, productive job, some friendly employers."
good,"A typical day at YRC basically included getting on the forklift and then proceeding to your assigned trailer to start stripping freight out. "
good,the management have no idea how to run things. ive been here 5 years and we've gone thru 4 managers. i only stayed so long because of the union benefits.
good,"YRC is an ok place to work. With the pension being up in the air, the culture has really gone down hill over the last 10 years. Working all shifts and the lack of knowing if today could be your last day is tough to deal with."
good,"Basically, from 2008-2014 no one ever knew if one day we would come to work and the doors would be locked.  Holland is a great company, but good example of bad buyouts of bigger corps that shouldn't of made the purchase to begin with."
good,"You work 12 hour days, could never take a day off if you're ill, and there are no opportunities for career advancement. The technology the company uses is  antiquated and outdated."
good,"A typical day includes meeting with decision makers and presenting solutions, coaching and mentoring Account Executives and completing Administrative tasks.  Working as a team is one of things we do best at YRC."
good,Very busy. Learned every aspect of transportation. Co-workers were great. Unstable once they got in financial trouble.
good,"Good place to work, excellent benefits.  Training is mediocre.  Management is knowledgeable,  caring and understanding.  Great team environment.  Great food in the café."
good,Working at YRC means working hard everyday without receiving any credit or thanks from those above you. With this comes a lack of advancement opportunities and no hope of receiving a pay increase for the foreseeable future.
good,"Once job learned typical day was good, I accomplished to learn a lot, most of the management weren't the go getters unless it was crunch time, all coworkers were cool , hardest part of job is coming into some one else's mess and you have to clean it up and also do your job. The enjoyable part was when we worked 7days on and 7 days off."
good,"Most of what I do comes down to really managing personalities. YRC is a union company, so juggling union bylaws, work agreements and individual personalities are obstacles I work through every day. In this job, someone's communication and leadership skills will make or break their success. Luckily, I have been very fortunate at YRC and moved in the ranks fairly quickly due to my ability to communicate with the union."
good,"I was part of a division that was cut, out of the blue, because of mismanagement at the executive level. The company is loaded with debt and not hitting sales goals. The consequence is that headcount has to go. I was part of 1200 people that were terminated in one single cut. It was a blood bath with severance capped at 4 weeks regardless of years at the company. The company is almost always restructuring portions of itself as leadership does not stay long enough to finish any change programs. It's not a bad place to work benefits wise, but it's a tenuous place with a track record of aggressive cutting and executive churn. If you are looking for work in transportation and logistics, I'd consider a more financially sound corporation with fewer headwinds."
good,"Very relaxed and understanding and helpful management. Nice coworkers and helpful for the most part. And great employee's club that is extremely friendly that tries to push to make themselves known. There used to be more retirement parties than anything and a lot of people are planning for retirement. But, there's a friendly surge of younger employees."
good,"12 hour shifts, but good pay. Lots of shifting around in higher management. Lots of room for growth if willing to move around the country. Not extremely structured."
good,"Roadway was an excellent company to work for; they were involved in community activities, equitable pay, and provided opportunities for employees.  When Yellow Freight purchase Roadway everything changed and, having gone through this scenario previously, I knew it was a matter of time before they eliminated Roadway employees...which they did.  They were interested in our customer base as they were in financial trouble.  Roadway never acquired debt so they were a prime corporation to purchase.  Eventually lost job as departments were eliminated one by one."
good,"I worked here for five years and with all the flux of management, you cannot precisely depict that work environment and what to expect.There is a diverse amount of employees that you work beside every day. Be prepared to work nights/weekends and 10+ hour days (could be mandatory)  The money is pretty good but competitors around seem to pay more, but without the benefit package."
good,"This company is stuck in the past, saddled with decades of technical debt.  Despite it's best attempts to modernize, it's saddled with the thinking of career employees that have been with the company for 30+ years and frankly at this point they are holding the company back."
good,YRC use to be top in the industry when I started but it’s drastically have gone down hill. If company & union cared more about employees CO would benf
good,I go to work and put in 100 % + in my opinion. I got told I'm a great worker and was offered a opportunity to get my CDL and that the company would train me for it while soaking up the cost. Now I'm being told I have to learn on my own which after working in a factory for 25 + years is all new to me. I have never driven a clutch or a big truck for that matter. Needless to say I quit my job of 25+ years to take on a new career and now I feel like I have been set up for failure.
good,Excellent pay with excellent benefits.  I would recommend working here.  The truck drivers are very interesting and the business runs seamlessly.  Union job.
good,Seemed like a library. nobody would talk to anyone else because management was always looking over their shoulder.  No personality at all...seemed like a morgue.
good,"Company not profitable and there has been no pay increases in several years and the overall job moral is terrible."
good,"I was able to learn many good habits and grow professionally here, but there is no more room to grow. Overall YRC is a good place to work, but I wouldn't plan on making it a lifelong career."
good,Currently in turnaroud after recession.  Profitability slowly returning as company gets its footing back.
good,"The company has had a very challenging recent 6 years as it tries to bounce back from the difficulties of the recent recession. Many changes have occurred, challenging its employees to find more creative ways to get work accomplished. Much remains to be done to become profitable."
good,"Sales Executive managing top accounts."
good,"The environment was very fast paced and the shifts were 12 hour long, four times a week sometimes more. The workload was a bit much since there was a shortage of supervisors."
good,"When I started with Roadway Trucking, it was just awesome. Customers came first and competitors knew they were outmatched when Roadway came into any picture. However, when Yellow married Roadway, some terminals merged but many closed. Drivers lost out. Roadway then had call centers that personally touched every customer. They were the right arm of sales and stormed the forefront of every challenge with great service. Every state had one or more call centers and multitudes of sales personnel who loved their customers and had great feedback. Then, Yellow also closed Roadways call center set up and YRCW only has a percentage who now serve the many customers. These closures were unexpected, to say the least, and I was in customer service at one of those call centers. A company who used to be first or second place in the world of logistics, changed their role and place in it dramatically in a very short period of time. Competitors have stepped up to take the business and I miss the ole' Roadway. It has been so sad to see YRC have such hard times. I hope YRC Worldwide, Inc. can climb back to the top."
good,always on the run making deliveries and pick ups. during busy season. In the slow season no job security.
good,Not good at all. Bad working conditions. No room for advancement
good,Pretty good paying job if you can take the lack of a predictable schedule.  You are on call and have to be to work in 2 hours.  You can be gone from 1 to 4 days without knowing when you start working.
good,Other than the high turn over rate in management it was a good job i was able to advance and learn a lot of new thing.But the down fall was the back stabbing by management.the co-workers was great
good,Data entry of bill of lady's and manage the dock. Union so that was plus.
good,"I started out as a non-career/casual employee. I was then hired as a career employee after about 7 months."
good,"I really loved my 8.5 years in this company, but there is little to no job security.  YRC claps hands and sing songs when they go a fiscal  quarter and don't get owned by the bank.  YRCW is going to close their doors.  "
good,"Since the joining of Roadway Express, Yellow Freight, Holland into one company, YRCW. Downsizing, pay cuts, pension changes and forced retirements. The company has gotten into bad financial shape, and may not survie. Management, is scared of their jobs and try to get into good position with upper management by trying to fire all that they can. Working conditions have gone down the drain. I was forced to transfer out of state to keep working, and eventualy retire."
good,"If you can't acquire a CDL they won't hire you full time, it's really hot in summer and really cold in winter, they have no dock doors. The dock floors where really bad. Some times the freight was really damaged. Had trailers catch a fire,"
good,When the economy crashed so did YRC.  Management was okay.  Great pay for the job that I did.  Always something new to learn  Was at one time top of the Logistics game.
good,"Normal typical work day, New Industry in Logistics-Need continuos Training in the !st year. Upper management doesn't seem to have their finger on the pulse and micro managing is not the best way to get result.  I believe sales is sales and customer service is customer service.  Learning the terminology and fitting in the groves of things. the people are the best thing about YRC."
good,YRC formerly Yellow Freight.The Middle-level management and lower level management not very knowledgeable; no personal communication skills they don't understand the concept of helping people work better
good,K-Force makes monthly phone contact to make sure there were no problems or concerns on my part with the job assignment. There was some communication problems and shifting of answers to my questions from time to time and the proper person wouldn't contact me when I did have questions.
good,"Previously known as Roadway, Combined Yellow freight and Roadway to be YRC."
good,They would allow me to punch in earlt to start my day. I learned alot about driving trucks and whatb it takes to be a class A delivery driver.
good,Great company but limited growth opportunities until they get the company turned around...which they will but until then...limited growth potential.
good,Good place to work if you don’t mind not being home a lot and don’t mind working all different hours. With no real start time or end time. It’s all over the place
good,"Very busy trucking company"
good,"I have been here for a little over a year, its different working for a union based company that thinks they run everything here. if management would step up and enforce what they should then it would run a lot better."
good,"Learning the freight business is very interesting."
good,This was a great place to work and I'm sad to say that I left thinking that the grass was greener. Union job and the teamsters local 222 definitely takes care of you
good,"Come in, get a trailer assigned to you, get a forklift, and start unloading. Scan bills to find where product went, take it to the location indicated. Help load product in between unloading products. Finish trailer, see supervisor for another trailer."
good,"Good place to work until direction of company changed and Chicago branch got phased out.  After Manager left company, position was filled with inexperience managers with no IT experience."
good,The job was fun and you moved around a lot to different positions and bids.  My co-workers were the best to work with.  You always had to be on your toes.
good,"Stable work, great benefits, outside working with the public. You perform several different duties each day. Everyday offers a new challenge and opportunity to learn and grow and be more productive and profitable."
good,One of the closest companies to military camaraderie.  The IT organization is strong and people really try to help one another.
good,A company with opportunities for growth and new positions.  Extensive product offerings in the logistics market place.
good,Fair place to work. Fair equipment. Deliver loads to satellite terminals. Must chain up in winter time to get loads to destinations in running time.
good,YRC Freight has gone through a tremendous amount of change over the last 10 years. It is probably one of the better IT departments to work for within the Kansas City Metropolitan area. The people on the front lines are knowledgable and work well together. Management does a good job of not micro-managing and trusting their subordinates to make the correct technical decisions.
good,very good place to work being a union shop had lots of benifits and being a teamster was a pleasure work wasnt bad i just couldnt take the cold anymore a open dock
good,Wasnt too bad of a job was in the union so had job security.  would of stayed there if i didnt move. Pays every week only thing that  i didnt like was forced overtime everyday .
good,YRC Logistics was a contractor of Proctor & Gambel in the Saint Louis MO area. It was a temporary contract that paid well for relatively relaxed work.
good,YRC Worldwide has been a staple in the Kansas City area for many years going back to its roots with Yellow Transportation. Excellent regional LTL carriers along with YRC Freight nationally.
good,"I enjoyed working at YRC Worldwide. The management was okay, but other employees were great to work with. I was employed there for 10 years and through all the changes the company endured, the employees were always considered a priority."
good,YRC is very supportive of their employees. There is a sense of pride that is developed working for them. Training is thorough. I would recommend working here
good,"taking inbound calls regarding freight being delivered, rate quotes on freight, questions about on time delivery, and shortages and damages"
good,"Typical day requires, showing up ready to work hard in a fast paced environment for 12 hours. I have learned a great deal of management experience due to the amount of employees and the volume of freight we have to through daily as a team. Upper management is very knowledgeable of operations and guides us in any area that we are lacking. The hardest part of the job is the inconsistency in the industry. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is the people I work with and how we solve problems as a team."
good,"Learned various aspects of freight terms, billing, collections, and intense customer service."
good,I was a hard worker and rarely missed work. I believe that management recognized this.
good,YRC is a good place to work. Management is fair and want you to succeed. Good teamwork there. Long days are expected but compensation is very good. Benefits are very good. The only risk is being low in seniority when business is slow.
good,Entry level of sales knowledge acquired. Success in building client relationship by delivering on their expectation in a logistics company.
good,"I was disappointed that YRCW put so much emphasis on production and not on quality work, as far as doing the work correctly the first time. I was let go for not meeting production quota, but part of my work had been outsourced to India."
good,"A typical day includes rout planning, daily logs, and driving for 8-10 hrs a day."
good,I have been with YRC for 17 years and it has been a great environment to be employed in. I have met several people and made many connections to enhance my life as well as my career.
good,It was a good place to work I learn how to work with others it made me more responsible and that's where I learn how to drive a forklift I learn how to load trucks and the proper way of the trucks and I learned different destinations where the freight was headed to or coming from
good,"I am just a contractor, so I don't get the same perks as if I was actual employee of YRC, but I have enjoyed contracting there for almost a year."
good,Basically making sure trucks go where they are supposed to im a supervisor over everything been there almost 30 years very much experienced
good,"the company was taking 15%every pay check from thr employees.That was 9,800 a year from all the employees .to lot poeple that was a lot money to others its nothing."
good,I have nothing bad to say about this company. It has it's ups and downs like any other company. If I had to compare to other places. It isn't a bad team.
good,either i will drive a truck or work the dock or in the yard.i worked at different terminal
good,"Relaxed, fast paced depending on the amount of work. Learned how to operate forklift, pallet jack, scan and weigh freight, check and confirm bill of lading management is great the work enviorment is always a good mood. The hardest part would be recooperating mishandled freight and the most enjoyable is the dress code:dress according to weather"
good,I liked working for YRCW because this place rewards hard work and talents.
good,"Yellow Transportation gave me my first opportunity at a career, taught me many lessons about the transportation business and gave me a place to grow and succeed for a decade. When the company fell on hard times financially we all took pay cuts and benefit cuts but to me that's part of company loyalty. You ride high through the good times and stick with them through the bad. Finally in 2011 after 10 years with the company I decided to chase my dreams of being a personal trainer and parted ways with the company"
good,"Company has agreed to a new union contract. "
good,"Great M-F job, Great Benefits,  and money for Idaho.... the equipment is not that great but gets the job done. If you add the cost they pay for your insurance and 401k your average salary would be like $ 60 something an hour....."
good,"I actually have worked for the company for about 20 years through the purchasing of the regional trucking companies. Before I went to work for YRC Worldwide, I really had no clue what life balance was. Being dedicated, I worked many long long days to provide results. Once I started at YRCW, I quickly understood just what life balance was, and I am eternally thankful for that."
good,"I find working at YRC a challenge, I'm always busy and learning new things.  At first I learned about freight and logistics and in my position now I'm learning the behind the scenes and can actually use my previous experience in my new position."
good,"I truly enjoy YRC Freight and would not leave if I didn't have to family to Santa Barbara, CA. The management team in Southern, CA is one of the best management teams I've had the pleasure of working with."
good,I like how the company gave you goals to shoot for and had award shows for their employees. The only downfall was that they weren't flexible with scheduling and they weren't very understanding when you had appointments.
good,"Very great company, under the former Roadway express proper. When Yellow freight took ownership, they were going to run as separate brands. Then In 2008, merged operations."
good,I enjoy my job. Love working with the best people! Each day is a new challenge. We take great satisfaction help our customer! We work together to ensure the customer is satisfied and will be a return customer.
good,Excellent pay for good work.  Your benefits are the best in the country.  Able to provide a good life for my family and easily paid for my two daughters to go to college.
good,"A positive place to work, where you are made to feel like a human being and appreciated. BRAVO! Thank you for my time here. You are an example for this genre."
good,On a lift for entire shift. Always something to do plenty of over time great benefits and love the co workers. The rewarded us for having to many safe work days. Genuinely care about the people that work there and go above and beyond to support you.
good,This was a part time position I worked at. It was a on call requirement to work the night shift 10 pm to 7 am. II would of stayed there but when the freight  slowed down they no longer needed the part time workers.
good,"I had a lot of fun working for this company. Do to their flexible hours I was able to attend school while working and allowing me the chance to work diverse shifts and always kept me in work."
good,"Great company I enjoyed my time and the work very much, but unfortunatly the company direction changed and I need to make an adjustment in my career direction."
good,"Fellowship, communication, teamwork.  Problem arises, change gears and troubleshoot.  Always able to go to management for guidance.  The hardest part of the job was loosing my job and the most enjoyable part of the job was that we were a family.  We still have get-togethers!"
good,As a dock worker for them I loved my job truly did and I do wish I could work at another trucking company they certified me on fork lift and hazzmat training the people there were like family to me.
good,"Pressurized and hectic enviroment, strict deadlines are essential to success daily."
