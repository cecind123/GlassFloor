bad,"Management literally one rule for them, one rule for everybody else, pub every other afternoon on the lash, coming back into work stinking of alcohol. The higher you go in mangement, the more stupid and entitled they are."
bad,"Just a typical job to pay the bills - Job is alright but none of the security officers like the pay - £9.22 an hour for working in central London - EMCOR have given little pay rise over the past 10 years, a rise of only £1.50. Staff are leaving for better opportunities. EMCOR stresses a lot about employee safety"
bad,"Absolutely disappointing company you work they don't pay then call you a liar bad manegment do not work for this company  they will steal off you "
bad,Poor management who didn't care about staff. Un skilled supervisors who had no training. No training for staff no inductions. Took clients side if anything went wrong and blamed staff. Lazy staff got praised
bad,Hired as a welder didnt take any welding test from carbon to stainless even super dublex...no welding procedures ...no certified welders on site...no x rays....didnt even put root passes or purge stainless lol no idea how this company gets away with that they must know sumbody lol
bad,"Unorganised unprofessional large turn over of staff, bullying culture within the business."
bad,"So many issues i could list, but judging by the forums online other people already done it. Salary normally wrong every month, with no support or apology’s to correct it.  No career development plan despite numerous promises at interview stages. Management are selfish & treat staff with no respect or decency.  Could continue this but hopefully you get the picture."
bad,"Awful management, terrible atmosphere, awful employees. The general atmosphere that everyone was scared of the IT director who was an awful human who had no real knowledge of how to do his job but would throw a hissy fit if anyone challenged his authority"
bad,"Worked for emcor for 15 months my work colleagues were great and we tried to all work together. Client resources manager was a bully and complaints were made up and emcor would go against their staff. There was no training, no risk assessments, no praise for good work, if someone was ill or on annual leave you were expected to do your job and other people's, with no support or extra time to carry the job out properly. Manager we saw once every few months, mobile supervisor brought his family to work with us, they were lazy had days off when the felt like it, supervisor knew absolutely nothing about the job or the site just sat round drinking coffee and hiding in the clean ing cupboard why the staff did all the work. Never worked for a company who don't care about their staff or staff safety at work"
bad,The Emcor Sacramento is the worst People Walk around that office like they are better then others. Upper management allows other employees to belittle and degrade other employees. the fact that management will also participate in gossip is even worse. this location is nightmare. they place blame on everyone but themselves. show favoritism go against company policies. I have never worked for a more dysfunctional company. If there was a - score they would get it in the short time I was there just in the office 6 people left. do yourself a favor and pass this horrid place. wait there was one perk - They allowed drinking on special holidays on company time. Thank goodness I was offered another position for there competition
bad,"Awful company with outdated tactics to buy contracts for nothing to try and make money by eventually replacing the staff."
bad,"Wasted a year of my life at that hole.......worst job I've ever done.no one knows what there doing , supervisors slag each other off instead of working together.manager is a clueless buffoon and the best hard working staff get treated the worst."
bad,"We was taken over by emcor in July and it went downhill."
bad,"Worked here for a long time and there is no loyalty or support for staff whatsoever. Ideas stolen by management and passed off as their own. Inappropriate “joke” emails circulated with no repercussions. Female members of staff spoke to like dirt and deemed acceptable because it was ‘the client’. No opportunity for progression if your face doesn’t fit, no matter what your capability. Salary is not good enough and environment was toxic at the best of times. Wouldn’t wish this company on my worst enemy!"
bad,"Bury st edmunds location is an absolute joke, you get treated like dirt, rubbish PPE, Emcor rant on about health and safety but dont practice it as they expect you to work with faulty equipment, management is terrible and do not care about workers until they get hurt or sustain an injury and even only then they get involved only to cover themselves."
bad,Very poor raises. Some employees receive $0.05. Everything is based on volume as they do not really care what type of service is given or if the repairs are substandard and not to spec.
bad,"No raises, poor management and lack of evolving into the 21 century. Worst manufacturing/fabrication company I’ve ever worked for.  There wasn’t any sort of training and mentors at with the Sulphur and Beaumont shops.  I saw many good people leave due to bad management."
bad,"The employent environment is terrible.  If you are not one of the Chosen, you.have no hope of advancement. There is major brown nosing going on.  You don't know day to day if you have a job. If you do submit a resignation notice, you are immediately walked out and there is no respect for the notice given."
bad,"I was assigned to a building that they had a contract for the past 20 years and worked there for 8 years and once they lost the contract I lost my job because they had no place to put me even though they took the favorite employees and placed them elsewhere, if you don't play the game you get no where with them no matter what a good employee you were."
bad,A flood of talented people leave and management doesn't care. Blame is always placed on people who had nothing to do with a problem. You will train yourself but get blamed for a mistake that you were never taught how to handle.
bad,I wouldn't get a job here as they don't like paying overtime it took 4 months for them to pay totally unacceptable and when confronted about it they just kept saying next month
bad,Worst company I have worked for. For a minimum wage cleaning job I have never known such 2 faced back stabbiing jobsworths in my life. You had a supervisor constantly ringing pretending to be more important than he really was and if your driving you can't answer because of the law. If you never answered it would be constant ringing until you did. One of the csm's would be nice to your face while taking pictures of little things he thought you had not done and reporting back to office even though people were in and out of these places. Trust me if your face doss not fit with this company they wil find any excuse to hound you out. Vile company and vile staff. Glad I'm out of it. AVOID
bad,Probably the worst company I have ever worked for in my life.The management are the worst I have experienced they give you zero help and the communication is awful. The security supervisor was so inexperienced and couldn't motivate a fly never mind a security team. I have to say if you thinking of applying for a position with this company I think again all I ever heard was about them losing contracts and making people redundant.
bad,"Just to summarise working for emcor - this company has reached rock bottom, but somehow; managed to carry on digging even further."
bad,I hated working with this company. No communication with workers. I hated working with back stabbing so people I work with. No plus points at all avoid working with this company and the people I worked with.
bad,"Significant problems in every phase of the operation in Phoenix.  Will never be fixed until selfish management is replaced with a management team willing to build a cohesive team, including communication, patience & compassion."
bad,"Steer well clear, always getting wages wrong, having to wait two months for overtime, they monitor all face book messages that are supposed to be private, extremely horrible management and HR system"
bad,"Worked for them about three years ago. Was an HVAC Journeyman in Rockaway NJ at Alcoa,  who I think threw them out not long after I left.  Like one of the other reviewers said., extremely poor benefits,  no sick pay,  they don't pay double time for working Sundays or holidays only time and a half and no shift differential. So if you get called in Sunday night you just get time and a half. I asked them why and the answer I got was,  "" there is no law that we pay more then time and a half for overtime, so we don't"".  And if you do start working for them don't expect holiday pay until you complete six months.  And most who work for them don't make six months anyway. I made the mistake of getting hired in September so I didn't get paid for Thanksgiving, Christmas, or new years. Real bad company."
bad,"I worked for this company for 6 years and was Picked on most of my time there.Upper manangement if you could call them that . because  they were all friends so no matter what I did or who I told.It did not matter.The supervisors  walked around like they owned the world. ...Micromange inc.should be their name.I would not  work at this company  if they begged me to come back.Typical office politics  whispering, telling, cliques, micromange, you couldn't go to the rest room in peace..... really a bunch of kids work here.Everybody  in some type of authority flaunts it.The Norristown office.I gave my two weeks notice and got  out of dodge Glad I did..Please read the reviews if your considering working here . don't . I PROMISE YOU EVERYBODY HERE IS REAL UNHAPPY."
bad,"Emcor is a good company as a whole.   I currently use their union tradesmen frequently at my current  job."
bad,They have no idea what they are doing. They will stab you in the back just to cover their own butts. Liars cheeters and don't think for one minute that they care about you.
bad,If you are a licensed journeyman you can find much better companies to work for. Their pay is low and the medical benefits are the most expensive Ive seen. They offered no sick time. So if you are out sick they require you to use any vacation time you may have then require you to provide a doctors note. After taking a pay cut (due to medical benefit costs)when my group was taken over by Viox Services I asked for a raise. My manager replied stating I would have to take on more work even though he agreed I was the lowest paid tradesman on site. He also stated that what I was asking for was a significant raise and he probably wouldnt be able to get it for me. I explained to him that I was aware they just hired a guy to perform the same work as me at $6 more an hour. And that it turned out he couldnt perform at the same level as me and that Viox decided to part ways with him. After being declined by my manager for the raise multiple times I decided to post my resume and explore my options. Within a few months after alot of interest from other employers I had an offer on the table for exactly what I requested from Viox. The same dollar amount that my manager at Viox argued was above the average for my trade and the area Im working in. So I turned in my two week notice letting my manager know that I was doing what was best for my family and it was not personal. A few days later they suddenly believe they can pay me the hourly rate Im looking for and put the offer on the table. At that point it was too late. I had an offer on the table that included just as good a pay rate as they
bad,"The Site Managers don't care about you so PLEASE be aware if you get hired for Emcor there at Bethesda You have been WARNED!! Other employees are not professional and just not a good company to work for. If you are about Integrity, Professionalism, good people EMCOR at Bethesda isn't the place to work at. Its Sad how much Drama is there and how they treat you is not right!!! You Reap what you Sew!! You better cover yourself there and your work if not they will make u look like your the problem when reality is they are the Problem ITS SAD!!!! You better blend in with everyone else cause if not you will see."
bad,"Warning to not apply for this job if you are a HVAC Technician. You will only be doing maintenance work at daycares changing toilets, unclogging toilets, changing light bulbs. So HVAC technicians do not apply you will be wasting your valuable knowledge. Once they get you in the door the you will be unclogging toilets!! Directors at these daycares will blame you for everything that goes wrong and the company believes them over you. Their is no sick time so your constantly sick from going into these day cares and you will have to use vacation time to be out. Supervisors constantly harassing you. This is a terrible place to work. They make you feel stupid or something!! Beware don't waste your time!!!!!"
bad,Management has no respect for employees. Not a good place for women.
bad,Company out of business. Not a good company to have worked with. No opportunity for advancement due to gender. Owner of company had no respect for employees at all and treated them all like they were HIS property.
bad,"First off these Dover, NJ EMCOR jobs that are advertised are not actually EMCOR, it is an EMCOR subsidiary called Viox Services, which is a maintenance contract company who is presently at Alcoa-Howmet since August 2011 located in Rockaway NJ on Roy Street , their mailing address is Dover but the job is actually in Rockaway. Second, Viox Services have the worse benefits package and policies I ever saw. No sick days or personal days, no paid holidays for the first 6 months you work for them, lousy vacation time, and the worse medical benefits package I ever saw in my life which will cost an employee with a family $750 a month out of their own pocket if they want medical benefits for them and their family. And if that’s not bad enough, they expect you to be on call 24/7 but they don’t pay a shift differential or more then time an a half for overtime. So in other words if you work 7 days a week you only get time and a half for the entire week including Sunday. Their answer to that is, “There is no law we pay more then time and a half over 40 hours, so we don’t”. And third, Alcoa-Howmet has horrible working conditions and their management rules over Viox Services management so what Alcoa say’s Viox does even if it means screwing over good employees. For example, Viox terminated 6 mechanics plus two mechanics left on their own within just the first 8 months they are at Alcoa, so what does that tell you? And it gets worse but there is too much to list so I will just say this..... do yourself a favor, don’t apply for any Dover NJ EMCOR job you see. Trust me you will regret it."
bad,"I love the facility I work for but I HATE working for EMCOR. They are heartless and unfair toward employees and have no values. Yearly increases are the same percentage for all employees and not based on performance so a terrible employee gets just as much as a great employee. My manager was excellent but was recently diagnosed with cancer and when she had to go on leave, everything fell apart. She just passed away and I was recommended for the position but instead of making the position available to apply for, they moved someone in from another facility who is causing everything to fall apart. EMCOR is losing contracts left and right. Please don't work there. Your job is not secure."
bad,"Horrible place not professional ,gossiping all day long and push you to do all their job for them will never recommend it to anyone stay clear  better jobs out there, had depression working there makes my life miserable 😖 with some unprofessional so called a trainer from a different company for training their own staff Really?"
bad,"I’ve worked at Emcor for a while now and the head of finance started making cuts and we lost our job. "
bad,Horrible place to work. Management is horrible to deal with. They are incompetent and have a huge turnover in the corporate office in Cincinnati. I would not recommend working there.
bad,They have very poor in knowledgeable management that will say they care about your quality of life but they don’t.  No room for advancement unless you can not do your job and they promote you up.  Upper management has very little education in anything in this trade.   Very poor attitude from management and seem they only hire people that management has previously worked with.      You are denied any chance of promotion  if you are a good worker.  If your injured on job they push you around to try to sign off from  compensation.   Worst work environment ever!!
bad,"Poor management,No raises,benifits suck. Highly recommend looking elsewhere. No recognition for job well done,Sucks the life out of you! Management lies and creates drama"
bad,i worked for emcor on the kings lynn site as a welding supervisor everything described in this job they want in an 8 hr day plus welding as my manager put 70% supervision 30% welding with the manager having no clue on welding or pipefitting was good with paperwork that’s it primarily a cleaning company trying to break into other industries with no experience good luck to anyone trying to take this welding managers job on king’s lynn i see this job advertised every other month which says it all about company structure that doesn’t listen to people with knowledge off there trade.
bad,Work begins early and ends late. Your co workers become friends and that makes this job tolerable. The thing that makes this job difficult is the lack of work/life balance. I learned a lot while working for this employer. I have grown both personally and professionally in my tenure with them.
bad,I was on call 24/7 and was called many times in the middle of the night by people who could hardly speak English. The client treated me better than EMCOR did. The management was terrible. They were quick to reprimand you before they even had all of the facts. Every single thing that ever happen was turned into a very big issue. Not a good company to work for.
bad,Tucson Account with Emcor not worth investing in. Emcor is a Commercial Facility contractor for Macerich ownership. You have an operation manager that is directly hired with Macerich with a little man complex and voices he want's nothing to do with EMCOR but yet EMCOR still hires people for positions at that account. I finally opened the eye's with EMCOR aware of this belittling jerk of an Operations Manager at the cost of me being laid off because this person did not want me back on property. If you know more than he does he does not want you. He has been there for year's and thinks he know's everything and that is a shame for people wanting to invest in EMCOR. I was not fired and received a decent severance pay.
bad,"This company is full of unkept promises. HR isn't on the employees side, they are 110% on the companies side. I've worked here for many years and the company has slowly declined into a horrible business. They are losing customers left and right and they try to say ""we have more work in the pipeline."" The only reason they say that is to keep employees from jumping ship but then they will fire people with only one day notice. Benefits are terribly expensive and poor coverage. They say they will pay for your schooling but it will take you months and months to get reimbursed because they do not pay up front. When you contact HR about it multiple times with no response they will eventually respond with rude generic answers. Direct management is decent and co-workers are friendly. I'm not a disgruntled employee but rather an employee writing a 100% accurate review. BEWARE before you come to this company. Over the last 5 years it has become a subpar employer to say the least. There are ONLY two good things about the company, and that is the customers are great and the pay is fairly good. However, they are continually losing customers."
bad,"The inmates have taken over the asylum. Eliminated all profitable divisions. Letting long term employees go, modeling the business after a twice failed division. Morale is non-existent, no trust."
bad,"Seemed like a great opportunity at the time. However, early on you could tell everyone there hated their jobs. All reps are so robotic. Not at all a good working environment, Poor training as well"
bad,"Lack of staff"
bad,Emcor don't worry about the workers just supervisors and management's as for the workers get treated like dirt work clothes cheap and nasty workers that disappear when they don't want to work sit in toilets on phones being stupid in work breaking laws with airlines and mop and buckets think there back at school instead of working disgraceful they should put people that want to work just a bunch of idiots don't bother working for emcor bury st edmunds unless you want to play like a child and be spoken too like one.
bad,"Worst company i have ever come across,"
bad,"The Management is an absolute joke haven't got a clue what they are doing, there is no room to progress with EMCOR and the salary is terrible. I was a cleaner for 4 years and treated like dirt. None of the managers have any idea, people get given promotions with out the jobs being advertised and the management look down on you and talk to you as if they are better than you."
bad,"Management was bias when it came to filling open positions in other departments outside of customer service. Management ignored csr's concerns over mismanagement of acct. I haven't worked there in years so maybe it's changed, but people I knew who stayed after I left, when they finally did leave, couldn't be happier."
bad,"A call center not a facilities management company. "
bad,"If you are an HVAC Journeyman you will not be valued by this company.The pay is substantially lower than industry standards."
bad,"Profit, profit, profit. Management only care about bonuses and profits. Don't treat staff well and if you're contracting to another firm they let there management treat you like dirt as well. No opportunity to climb the ladder. Management are happy to not let you progress. There is no supervision you can basically do what you want."
bad,"Dont know what to say really. Seemed liked a great company to work for. Left my previous job to try and advance my career cause I was told from the president of the company that nothing but great opportunity would happen for me. Liked my past job and wasn't really even looking. Just hoping to land something that offered better benefits. Lasted about 4 months with Emcor and was supposedly laid off due to cutbacks from the company I worked for. Dont know how much of that is true from talking to some people within Emcor. No notice just laid off in an instant and couldn't even be offered another position somewhere else. So yeah now I'm jobless and I have kids,  a mortgage, and my bills. Just please be aware before applying to this company. You can and will be expendable without notice. Especially if they pay you well. They dont care about experience. Lets just say if they can find someone who will work for less pay they will without any regret. From my time there there's been 3 cutbacks or downsizing. All this from a fortune 500 company! To make matters worse the president/CEO of Emcor wouldn't even pay me for my vacation that he promised me as part of my offer to come aboard. SMH just a sad situation for anyone to go through.."
bad,If you dont mind spending more time filling out work orders and pre task plans then this is the place for you. The management is very poor they are extremely reactive rather than proactive. Demand that you just make stuff happen than spend money to actually make it happen
bad,Dealing with the customer was the most difficult part of this job.  Demands can change daily.  Satisfaction of a job well done was the best thing about working there.
bad,"Very bad work environment, terrible service manager. Newcomb was a great company until they sold it to Emcor. Good people left and new service manager is very condescending and arrogant. Not a good place to work. Glad I got out. Company is a mess!"
bad,"Poor management "
bad,"The management here is a joke, they literally had no clue what they were doing. They are confused micromanagers with no direction. Its not a good sign when a company ask new employees for input to improve the processes and work flow of their culture. Basically they will steal your ideas to make more money while you get nothing. Look elsewhere, disappointment will be the result."
bad,"not a family friendly company"
bad,"Managment was grossly negligent and unethical. Intenionally sabotaged numerous employees because of insecurity. Nepotism was extensive. Not an envrioment you will be challenged or feel supported in. They seek complacent employees, satisfyed by a good salary wage."
bad,"Depressing place to work for me personally, too many people trying to benefit their own advancement and will walk over or try to undermine other people for their own betterment. Unprofessional lower and higher management who  constantly try to play people off against each other. You will do well there if you are like that. But to the hard working and professional workers who have morals , steer clear."
bad,"This is by far the WORST company I have ever worked for. There's a constant revolving door with people leaving and new faces. Most new hires don't stay longer than 6 months. Even the most recent program manager left after just 3 days! Management is extremely cutthroat and constantly playing the blame game and will blast you in emails to all the managers and even some customers as well! Highly unprofessional and hostile work environment. This used to be a fantastic place to work, but not anymore and I'm currently looking because of this. The benefits are utterly useless. And I had also saw in another review that they offer company functions. No. No they don't. Those functions are paid for by the employees. They will lie and cheat you any way they can. We recently got some incentive bebefits that they played off like they offered them out of the kindness of their hearts, but I had found out that because it's a government facility, those benefits were required to give under federal law, not out of the goodness of Emcors hearts. Furthermore, they enable lazy and incompetent technicians and chastise those that actually want to work and do the job right and rarely provide any actual training for certificates in many fields. Even when you ask for training that pertains to your job. Keep looking for another place. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here..."
bad,"Great pay. Horrible management. Money is not worth the stress, and unnecessary BS. Dispatch department is terrible. Workplace culture seriously needs improvement. If you want to work somewhere where you will grow don't work here."
bad,Started Chester way for emcore  said it was full time  lasted 2 months then sacked management don't no what is going on there was even a guy there how got 20 pound for every body he gassed on you could not trust any one you worked with totally waste of time I was better off on the dole
bad,"Do not go to work here. Incompetence and dysfunctional  management,  low pay,  outdated  work  order system. The benefits are horrible. Other than my co-workers,  bad experience all the way around."
bad,"Worked here for emcor for 2 years. While the working hours are good, pay is very poor. No investment in training for employees. Transportation is a key issue on site and respect given to engineer from higher management is another issue.  I leave here at the end of the month not been given a interview with the fm manager at all. Would love to stay if a pay rise was to reflect what others in trade get also get asked to step out of trade with no training. Very poor man management skills from some in key positions. New team come in and don't even Introduce themselves."
bad,"One of the worst companies I have ever worked for. The so called Management was non existent and could not care about their colleagues I was treated very unfairly, the hours were long. training was non existent. I definitely would not recommend this company to anyone probably only good thing was the salary"
bad,"i worked for Emcor for almost 10 years, advanced from a mechanic into a lead then a supervisory role."
bad,"I would take care of usbanks, they basically gave me a laptop, van and said here you go!! "
bad,"Use to work for serco great company and happy workforce ever since Emcor took over morale has dropped completely this is from lack of support from management, lack of funds and total lack of common sense in terms of health and safety"
bad,a typical day at work is straight forward you go in knowing what your job role is for the day. management dont take compaints seriously and your are pushed out if you mention anything to anyone that your have problem. brought an issue to management to be told my issue was invalid and the other member of staff praised.
bad,worked in security in Birmingham most of the the security staff there are a great brunch of lads but for the security manager as not got a clue always trying to put you down if you not agree with him if Emcor put a better security manager in it would be a great company
bad,"Not a good experience at all , was laid off for something very unfair . I don’t recommend this company just because of the horrible management they have ."
bad,Very ineffective and indecisive Management.     Don't bother applying for any corporate level positions as the Company.    They are inconsiderate towards job candidates and leave job candidates hanging for weeks only to eventually fail to hire anyone.    HR and hiring manager don't even have the courtesy to respond to an email.   Explains why they can't fill positions.
bad,"I would not recommend this company to females. They do not treat them fairly and regularly like to employees. Until there is a change in management, it is not a good place to work."
bad,"good thing about working within a pharmacutical company ,good people to work with, have the satisfaction of knowing you done job well ,when you get emails from other members  of staff that you have done good job,"
bad,The workload was beyond reasonable. I never had time to even go to the grocery store for an hour or 2 on weekends (my days off) I worked from home and had to have food delivered just to manage my work  it was beyond what I signed up for
bad,the company is great for starting a new career or fresh out of college. The experience was great to be in a business setting and learn new laws and company practices.
bad,This was a stressful environment based on management. You were treated unfairly based on factors that had nothing to do with your work. Younger generation mistreated and wasn't worth your self respect. Don't even bother to waste your time here
bad,"This is a war zone of tenured people, who are afraid that new young people are coming for their job. Rude, disrespectful and vindictive is the best way to describe some of the individuals in this company. You walk on egg shells daily and belittled. You will never do your position  right unless you do it like the person before you, but the kicker is they screwed things up."
bad,The lack of commnication and training makes this a hard place to work and progress in. There are very few chances to advance in this company even with several years in a current position.
bad,"EMCOR Services, Inc. Provides their customers with the best HVAC products and services."
bad,"I’m embarrassed to say I’ve worked around 10 years for Emcor.  It’s been a ride of up’s and down’s, mostly downs.  Working in central London earning astonishingly low pay, bullied buy managers and supervisors and at the same time project managers running around getting the brown envelope under the table from contractors.  Emcor have on site engineers, I never seen them fix anything instead you will see them escort external contractors around the building.  Management are more concerned about saving money to get the bonus at the end of the year. STAY AWAY FROM EMCOR."
bad,"Great hours, nice paced work schedule. Very micromanaged, you will have your job threatened constantly. Management is poor and morale is very low. No incentive to do a great job for the company."
bad,They will promise the earth and never give it. 1 Rule for one and not the other. no matter how hard you work and how much effort you put in going above and beyond they still don't care.  They are only interested in new bid contracts not there existing ones. Take redundancy do not Tupe over to them - you have been warned!
bad,management are a joke talk down to you don't listen they have to be right all the time going to be a serious accident there soon push the staff to hard
bad,Warning  if you don't mind spending 90% of your time doing paperwork instead of doing the job that you were hired to do and that was repairing every month somebody had to make a new protocol that cost twice as much paperwork. Good luck and thank you for everything. Got so bad they wanted you to clock out to go to the bathroom and that's the truth
bad,working here is ok but needs more communication from all sides i have made some good friends here and enjoy working with them as well as my own
bad,"You will do fine if management or the president  is you best friend  trust no one  "
bad,"Worked here for 1 and half years enjoyed it till new management came in, he was sacked from other sight and brought in to our site :s a lot of back handers going on behind the scenes one rule for one and one for the other if your face don't fit in your in for a rough spell constantly watching you, no authority in this position and no room to progress, the client is always right and bullies the management who bully us, lots of spies / grasses around can't scratch from behind without someone telling you off for it watched constantly by higher up security as there's cctv in control room not nice environment to be in work is mind numbing and slow but always got to be busy cant chill out at all. if your retiring this is the job for you you but otherwise stay clear"
bad,The main issues with this employer was the lack of support given in dealing with an extremely difficult and toxic client. Literally no room for growth or advancement and a completely ineffective work order system.
bad,"Worked with emcor for a few years, I  that time the female manager visited site 4 times, general running was left to site supervisor who was a bullying manipulative idiot...he would try and get money out of you if you done anything wrong so as not to report you to management"
bad,Great company just don't work for accounting dept. Both those managers are snakes and will stab you in the back when you least expect it. Be aware you will always be walking on eggshells. They hire their own friends and family and will pay them more than long tenure employees with experience. Oh and if you call in because your child is sick then expect managers to give you attitude and odd demands days later. If you don't obey their orders you will be out. Management is so secretive on changes going on. Work environment is so tense especially if managers are in a grumpy mood. Trust me when you do leave to another company you will realize what true management really is. If you don't have tough skin then I recommend you don't work in the Accounting dept.
bad,I enjoy my time working with this company but the thing that makes me leave is that it it is not enough challenge for me.  Knowledge and skills development is poor.
bad,Micro managing is really bad here.  You feel as if all eyes are on you if you get up from your desk.  If you leave 1 minute early for lunch you better be back 1 minute before lunch is over.  You have to pay money to wear jeans on Friday.  This place isn’t good with communication.  Temps aren’t allowed to make up hours missed.
bad,"They dropped the ball at this site.. very poor leadership,,  the hiring practice at this site was terrible, they made me the scape goat, a waste of my time and talent.. SHAMEFUL!"
bad,Good ole boy work atmosphere with a lot of nepotism going on.  management had friends that did not have to do there job.
bad,Awesome place to work as well as great time with co-workers. Had a phenomenal company culture centered around a work hard-play hard environment.
bad,"EMCOR, Inc. is a company engage in selling motorcycles and appliances. My work in this company, I was one who evaluate customers that applying for credit by conducting credit investigation. I learned more on managing accounts and how to handle different kinds of attitudes of our customers. The management also provide good benefit but sometimes limited. The hardest part of this job was being assigned in the area far in your home base."
bad,Usm recently lost a big contract .  Suddenly three of the best employees on the account are falsely accused of accusations and have their good nanes dragged through the mud.   Beware they will rurn on you in a heartbeat.
bad,to avoid. toxic leadership.terrible culture and morale. lip service management. needs to figure out what to be when it grows up. great individual contributors.
bad,My day time working hours from 9:00 am to 5:30 pm. I had been received 32 assigned BB&T branches to oversees and to maintain. I worked hard and even took over time to finish necessary work to be done. I was not happy with my company because of tons of responsibilities that had been assigned to me. I have been worked with this company for 1 year because BB&T cut off the contract earlier with Emcor.
bad,"For a company that has been around as long as they have, they need a lot of help! If you come from a previous company that had a solid management structure and good core values, and you get a job at EMCOR in Phoenix, you will be very disappointed. Or, if you're 19-24 years old and just need a steady paycheck, you'll be ok. The management in the call center is ridiculous. They need a strong, solid, experienced call center lead manager that doesn't show favoritism and knows how to effectively lead people. The team I was assigned to work on was part of a huge new account and EMCOR dropped the ball miserably launching it off the ground. Poor preparation, training and selecting the right people to be on board. Embarrassing. They hired almost 20 new people in my training class and only 6 are left. Typical call center staffing I suppose. EMCOR looks good on paper, but I would look elsewhere if you are seeking a solid company to work for and possibly grow with."
bad,"Management did not have a concept of construction management.  Although everyone was nice, no one took responsibility out of fear of getting in trouble for mistakes."
bad,Our contract was up at a jobsite. And Emcor was letting all the employees find out we were being let go by just having us show up to the sit. And be told by the customer that we don't work here anymore.
bad,You are promised thing from your line manager with is not true
bad,"Your job security is only as good as the stability of the contract you are assigned to. "
bad,"*Too tiring day ( 15 days work force fields and 7 Days office work )"
bad,"start the day with signing in then of to my building to do my work as whats on my rota , I have learnt about how to deal with chemical spillages and first aid at work,i was on evening shift and we never had much help or support from the management but the co workers were very good and always helping when needed, hardest part of jjob would be when there is a spillage somewhere and you have to go out of your schedual to clean it up and still have other work completed, enjoyable part of job was seeing all the thankful people after work was done this made me feel good and also made me keep up my high standards."
bad,I loved the job it self. As for management they weren’t very knowing in the job that we actually preformed nor did they have much if any experience. Working in several different locations was nice.
bad,"Not much room for advancement "
bad,Project Management at the time was not good. Managers often sided with the employees with out proper investigation. Many people lost their jobs on rumors verses fact
bad,"The job itself is great, but the management is awful. Too many desk jockeys calling the shots for jobs they know nothing about. Upper management refuse to listen to the workers, even though they preach about being team players. There was a time this was a great place to work, but the past year or so has been a disaster, and it continues to get worse."
bad,A company with engaged and caring employees. The facility management arm of EMCOR was not a part of their core business strategy and it seemed to show at times. I worked with some talented caring people. Unfortunately the team never coalesced before the 2008 banking debacle  disrupted everything.
good,The hardest part of this job is learning the complex idiosyncrasies of 80+ operating companies; learned about media buying & social media alerts. Co-workers are very close among themselves - I feel like an outsider.
good,Working with EMCOR was ok in its on way. I learned the proper mixing of cleaning products. Co-workers vey team oriented willing to work. Not enough time in a day to complete work assignments without rushing.
good,Worst company to work for. they pay substantially lower than most. The accounting girl you will work for under this position is basically a Nit Picker  & will bully you if you do not do it exactly as she asks. No room for growth. The raises are cost of living which they cant go over 2% so that is basically 2 cents to every dollar you earn. reviews are given once a year in February. If you have not been there 1 year by this time you will not get a raise. They have deep pockets for partying & events but not to pay their employees.
good,Hired on at one position. Told later position wasn’t valid. Need to take a step back or step into another role to keep pay. Unorganized. Management and employee turn around very high. Management lack direction. Communication lacks big time. Not what to expect from a big company. Would pass on company if I had to do it all over again. Don’t recommend. Better off somewhere else.
good,"It was a difficult work situation, supervisor and leader payroll clerk kept every one upset and worried for their job, therefore you worked many hours of overtime trying to please them. Never knew when you would be terminated."
good,"I recently left emcor and feel that the training I needed I was not going to get as they said not enough money but they managed to find money for other training."
good,"I assign, monitor and assist maintenance personnel.  I lead the team through tougher tasks and projects, as well as assist in ALL maintenance PMs and repairs."
good,"Not a bad place. Pritty small contract,Good people good working conditions. Lots of preventive maint,The people we work with are very helpfull."
good,"management undermine your knowledge and have no experience within the trade in question. "
good,I worked very briefly for this company. They made poor decisions and the management team was non-existent. I had to take most of the management decisions myself.
good,nothing to say. they do offer company get togethers.  Employees are nice and get along with them.  No room for advancement.  Great if you are looking for job
good,"It's a young mans game this one, lots of travelling around the country and staying away from home for long periods. but relatively easy work, putting power into telephone exchanges and adding new equipment and removing outdated cabinets."
good,"I take calls all day from customers, and dispatch technician to location for service requested, it is hard to advance at this location, if you are good at what you do they keep in the same position with no incentive."
good,"Company as a whole is great to work forwith benefits, growth opportunities, and diversity. Management team in the Phoenix market is lacking direction, experience, credibility, and tact, and professionalism."
good,"EMCOR are a good employer in terms of salary. "
good,"EMCOR is all about the money. They speak about treating you well, but they don't act that way. Good luck with this company."
good,"An intensive maintenance position where the company is willing to go the extra mile to help you succeed. "
good,The typical workday can be filled with multiple requests and actions to accomplish.  All of this is depending on the role and responsibility required for the position.
good,"Started the day at work 07:00 Monday to Friday, finished at 12:00 on each of those days."
good,Longtime fortune 500 company with traditional business culture.  Boys club mentality creates a culture of us vs. them.  Minimal opportunities are given to advance for women. Investment in employees training beyond the basics is non-existent. Limited benefits make it hard to attract and retain talented people. An excellent place to get a paycheck.
good,"EMCOR have more than once changed the working goal posts, they often promise benefits and bonus' but can not deliver. The management are generally good, but have a lack of communication between workers on the floor and higher management."
good,"Great people, fast pace. Work schedule was very irregular and days off too. It made it vey difficult to be apart of your family when you are always working."
good,"Emcor services is a complete cutthroat environment. no job security .complete rat race.every employee is unsure of there job security, and this creates a survival type atmosphere."
good,Fun workplace with good benefits. Good management at some levels. Good life/balance schedule. Professionalism on some levels lacking but over all nice company.
good,I really enjoyed working for Emcor just a pity management didn't open their eyes a little bit wider to sort out the problems on this site
good,"A typical day at work are loads of phone calls, driving on the motorway from sites to sites, meetings, and addressing emails. Good work culture. Friendly, supportive team and managers. Lots of opportunity to learn. Good mix of old and new technology. Work with great management and Clients. Extremely flexible work environment. Technical training is limited and some communications applications are out dated and need retired. Interpersonal skill improved and team work also and great relationship with manager and employees. Travel can sometimes be too much process. Sometimes feels like. Everyone is very friendly and approachable. Work is also really exciting and demanding."
good,Enjoyable to entertain many different people...Convincing costumers to buy the appliances.
good,"Family Company, good working area, flex time ."
good,Ask lots of questions about the job. Benefit package is so. Salary was very comparable to others. Tools and vehicle were provided along with training in areas. Be sure to communicate with upper management.
good,I am so disappointed in the way I was treated by the upper management. Not warned at all about hours being cut I was not able to brace for the loss of income. They had it programmed In the system but couldn’t tell us ahead of time. My lead and my regional managers were awesome though and the job was made great by their hard work and collaboration.
good,I have enjoyed working with Emcor Group UK except for some personal individual experiences.I have learnt a lot concerning Corporaty Security but I want to learn more.
good,The upper management was excellent but the department had a high turn over rate. There needed to be more on the job training as well as company driven task manuals (the employees had their own versions).
good,"Working at Emcor improves me a lot, makes me more responsible, strong and enhances my skills in accounting as well as to communicate with different types of customers."
good,It was a great experience to work for Emcor. Measuring of HVAC duct work systems and implementing them into CAD. Traveled to different locations. Great work culture.
good,"Very fast pace environment. Small and close knit, very unprofessional with foul language. Yet, very efficient as far as work ethics."
good,this is good starting job for anyone in the computer technician field. but would recommended for a long term position. everyone her is uptight and has little communication skills
good,"A typical day at Emcor started off as me clocking into my computer at 5 a.m. everyday except for two days out the week. I made sure to clock into my computer 5mins ahead in case my system took a moment to start up. Because management was trying to keep there call volume high but kept constantly loosing employees, they hired just about anyone. Their training was improper, it was either ""sink or swim"". Majority of the co workers there are very friendly. The company had lunch get together´s, games, holiday events etc. which really helped to lower the stresses of each day. The hardest part of the job was dealing with clients in different regions. The most enjoyable part of the job was laughing with the other employees everyday."
good,A typical day was doing tenant call and preventative maintenance. I learned how to work in a mixed use building. Co workers were go to work with. The hardest part of the job was the very tuff management. We would get a Christmas bonus.
good,"Pushing air craft engines out for delivery is a rollercoaster game. One week you are pushing everything you can just to meet demand. The next week it will be slow because of the material shortages that will inevitably stop an engine from shipping on schedule. Working as a material handler is not  a flashy job, but is always exciting to think about how important you are to the sir craft industry. If you are looking to improve your career then do not apply here. If you are looking for a job because you have no choice because its hard to find one in this area then obviously come on board. The managers are nice, but not truthful when it comes to annual raises. Although I have had surprise bonuses in my pay checks. They are VERY flexible with your work schedule too."
good,"my work day is generally a busy one dealing with tenants , maintenance isues and much more"
good,Learned a lot working for this company. Able to work by yourself. Coworkwers where great. Upper management needs a lot of work to be a great company. Exspect you to perform your work under exstreme weather conditions
good,"has highly skilled experts and the leading-edge technology required to help government organizations achieve consistently high-performance facilities services, with on-time projects and long-term value. Our team has extensive experience ranging from standard facilities operations and maintenance, to environmental/risk management services, to supporting military and healthcare facilities"
good,I learned a lot of work since EMCOR is a multi-tasking company. The hardest part is I/we could not focus on one thing but still thankful since I was exposed to different work assignment with less supervision.
good,overall a good place to work.Decent managers and security.Pay could be better and promoting from within needs attention.The company will protect you from any kind of code of ethics violations at all turns.
good,"I worked as Mechanical Mechanic where I learned more than ever and was given the opportunity to go to school which I received Universal EPA Certification.  I would have tried to get more training but the opportunity was never right, but given the opportunity now I would have tried to succeed.  There were workers gatherings that I attended, and on one or two occasions we were rewarded bonus or sometime turkey for gifts which was very thoughtful. However, there was one incident when I worked at the Reagan Building and was transferred, to EMCOR Government Service in Washington, DC.  I had a incident that caused me to be removed, when in actuality the other person should have been removed, and it went downhill from there, where I finally got removed.  I tried to fight to keep my job but unfortunately I was removed.  I am now working in a residential apartment as a Residential Maintenance Mechanic and what I learned from EMCOR I took with me, and so my surprise I've used those talents. I do hope to get back into Preventive Maintenance so that I may make a difference.   I only wish it was handled much more professional."
good,"Good place with helpful colleagues. Unity amongst department is followed. "
good,"I've spent almost four years as a sales representative. And for that I believe that those experiences made me more competitive, strong professional individual. I have learned to effectively understand any customer relations issues. With this, I'm pride myself of having a customer service skills because it boosted up my interpersonal skills to interact with other people like my co-employees as well as customers"
good,Great place to work with your hands. If you start out as a temp worker you get offers for full time jobs and are able to work your way up depending on your status and work ethic.
good,EMCOR is agood company to work for I spent a fair few years there.  Unfortunately my position was declared redundant. It is a friendly work environment.
good,"Emcor company is really a fun workplace, it is really indeed to work on. This company is a good place where your skills will be challenged and it will improve you more."
good,"For the most part left to my own devices but the management are happy to help if I need advice.  Health and Safety is a priority in Emcor uk, with active and positive support to complete the task."
good,Was a contractor didn't get to really get a feel of this company.  The experience was nice wish  could have stayed longer.  My contract was in a government building so that was a good thing.
good,This is a good laid back place to work however the site is closing in a few years time so unless your willing to relocate this is not a permanent job prospect.
good,Decent people to work around. Lots of overtime. A lot is expected of each employee. Lots of work to be completed. And lots of people to please on each and every day.
good,"As a multi-site Facilities Maintenance Manager in a fast-paced, sale-driven manufacturing industry I seek opportunities to reduce operating costs or increase productivity wherever I can. The position I hold requires a balance between maintaining the facility in a constant state of readiness and allowing the business to change pace based on sales. Facility maintenance, as a general rule, does not generate revenue but it can impact the bottom line by how it’s preformed. Drawing on my experiences serving in the military and working in the construction industry enables me to maintain my buildings to the best of my abilities. I work closely with outside vendors to ensure scheduled maintenance is performed in a timely manner on critical operating systems i.e., security/fire alarms, fire suppression, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, fleet vehicles, forklifts (propane/ electric) guide-by-wire, compressed air and key card access systems.   I am on-call 24/7."

good,I worked for EMCOR for 2 years and was a corporate security supervisor. The company was fare and treated me very well while I was employed with them. The have a high standard of work standards and will employ professional officer only....
good,"Typical days at work i am working with people, check what are they doing in the branch to increase the sales, meeting with them solve the problem encountered and asked very body ideas on how to be productive every day, i learned a lot with my people and the people i meet on how to face the challenging world, i am not a 100% masters when it comes on managing people but i know i that i can share to my people on how to face the everyday challenges in there lives, work place culture its fun we have one culture and that is family culture, the hardest part of the jobs when you lose the big transaction you do you expect to win the but some how they under estimate the competitor, the most enjoyable part is we are sharing ideas we have one goal"
good,"I enjoy my work and am satisfied with my work load."
good,EMCOR Facilities is a company in transition and is in the process of trying to integrate 3 different organizations and standardize.  Therefore it was very stressful at times.

Applied diverse skills in electrical troubleshooting, plumbing repairs, carpentry and cafeteria maintenance. When the need arrised allows presented a team spirit to help solve any issues that might be encountered. Was provided great letters of appreciation from managers that I worked with. They gave me high praises and appreciated the work that I performed for them in their areas of responsibility."
good,Good place to work. Low pay and expensive benefits. Management will leave you alone as long as you do your job. Can't ask for much more in my opinion.
good,"very fast paced enviroment, not alot of cross training for new hires, great place to start a career though and get your feet wet. enjoyed working here for over 6 yeas just feel like ive been placed in a box no room to grow past anything."
good,"EMCOR is a good company to work for. They pay very well, but people are being laid off due to the company not doing well. There's no room for CAREER ADVANCEMENT."
good,"Originally I began working at Viox Services who was a subsidurary of EMCOR. Later during my time at Viox EMCOR purchased another company called USM. USM was basically a janitorial company that subbed out all of its work. USM was flashy and impressed the right people at the right times and merged with Viox to form EMCOR Facility Services. I was offered a promotion that came with much more responsibility  making a salary that was less than I had made as any hourly associate. I truly enjoyed my time at Viox, but as time went on I saw more and more that I was just a number. There are still some great people at this organization that I greatly admire and respect, unfortunatly that number is less and less as time goes on."
good,My day was basically to complete work tickets as assigned pertaining to Carpentry and Security.Worked closely with Security to ensure all Physical Security components were working properly.

good,"Management sometimes slows down work, co-workers are great. currently in a construction zone, so the work areas are dusty and dirty. Being able to access work areas is difficult ."
good,"Emcor was pretty decent as far as salary is concerned, but the particular position that I held was almost impossible to allow anyone to have any kind of life outside of the job. I worked on an old constantly  rotating Navy/submarine shift that ran from 6am to 2pm for two weeks -a week consisting of 7- 8 straight days, 1 day off, then rotated from 2pm to 10pm for three weeks with week being seven straight days- three days off  , and then from 10pm to 6am with some weeks consisting of 8-9 straight days before a day off. I had no life other than work. When offered the position through an inter- company transfer those of us who accepted were promised a suitable schedule change that never happened within the 5 plus years that I worked there. Every schedule we and our Union offered was turned down, not because those schedules didn't meet the work schedule criteria demands, but simply because the Supervisor didn't like them and did not want to change the existing schedule. That schedule resulted in nearly all of the original transferring personnel eventually either quitting or being terminated due to being unable to work that schedule."

good,Nice place to work. No room for advancement. Nice co workers. They had bad managers. They actually got rid of them. Place did a complete 360. Accounting practices are a little shaddy.

Provided maintenance and repairs to all appliance equipment located within the Ft Meade Army base.  What I've learned at work was, that safety is always first no matter what the cost or time spent.  Management was very stern when it came to workers being late.  They where also very helpful in completing work projects.  My co-workers where very helpful as to showing me the repair locations in my first weeks of working for the company.

From this job, I learned everything I know about building maintenance and the ins and outs of working on a military installment.

My coworkers were highly skilled in their trade, and for a while, I felt unworthy of working there because of my own inexperience. I felt like I was looked down upon. I couldn't have been more wrong. The more skilled tradesmen answered any and all questions I had and I took a lot away from this job because of them. The hardest part of the job was actually getting around the hospital.

I was able to build my self confidence and to work as a team. The management is very supportive on us everyone is enthusiastic and cooperative to do their own job.
