bad,"The management style in my role was do as I say, not as I do. Also, the work atmosphere was more of a dog eat dog environment. Not much support from management and many inconsistencies with the team rules and regulations. Seemed to be based on the mood the manager was in on that day. Scary to say the least."
bad,Terrible company on a downward slide. They hired me on a 6 month contract and told me 5 months in that I would be receiving a permanent position. on the final day of my 6 months I received a phone call from  a third party company letting my know my contract was expired.
bad,"Outside of the people, the job is simple and doesn't really push your skill set at all. Once on a project if you are asked to move its not a request. you will be moved even if you have an issue with the management in that department. they talk down to you and treat you like a child. they belittle, yell and call you names if you are even the slightest off from what they want. And that is just their NRC repairs lab."
bad,"This company is a phone sweat shop.  They have high turn over because the ""culture"" is oppressive.  They don't train well, don't treat their employees with respect and constantly ride you for unrealistic high production numbers.  The pay isn't the lowest I've heard of, but it's in the bottom 10%.  If you're into BDSM (Non sexual) at the workplace this place is for you!"
bad,Do not work here! Insight enterprise only care about their contract not the employees. Service technicians working for sap is the most stressful job know to man. This is your warning. Do not work here overall bad work environment. I would give this place no stars if I could.
bad,"i worked their on a casual basis, and then the company changed their business name to something else, the job was not that great, however i managed to reach my targets"
bad,the structure of this company is a joke. Not much goes on here that is beneficial or helpful to anybody and it has many flaws in the hierarchy with promoting failed employees.
bad,"Unrealistic expectations selling in an environment that is toxic, trying to sell a product that nobody wants to purchase. More chiefs than Indians/ Every move is watched."
bad,"I was a lead technician, went to the training and worked the project, and after the job was done, they didn't pay me. I played email tag and phone tag, no one would answer me or talk to me, I would not recommend this company to anyone, they will cheat you and then forget you exist. One of the techs mentioned that he had not been paid for the last job he worked for them, I should have caught on then."
bad,Do not work for this company. They will only hire friends and layoff employees with no warning at all even with nothing but positive performance reviews throughout.
bad,"In the IT department, management is very poorly trained and assembled. There is a bunch of guys that do not have IT backgrounds running the call center. There are a lot of power hungry individuals, that are not able to create processes that allow workflow to be seamless. As one of the few colleagues/supervisors/managers that actually have a degree and background in the IT industry, I can see why stability in that department is lacking. There was firing and rehiring the entire time I was there. That says a lot about the leadership. Being properly trained is nonexistent so be able to work in a hostile and unnecessarily competitive environment. The pay is below any serious IT support, so you will be working for less than the stress associated with the job. It is a very passive aggressive environment."
bad,"I was not impressed with the overall management. The hours, and schedule were not reliable. I would not go back to an establishment that had the organization issues, and lack of progress that this establishment has."
bad,"I took the job at the time as it paid well, but was an hours drive away. Hours were strictly 9-5. Very male oriented. I was able to learn how to set up a server rack and how to load os on servers, but other than that it was repetitive work."
bad,Did not like this opportunity as the training was incomplete and the management was just about numbers as opposed to quality of service. Didn't take me long to look elsewhere.
bad,"I have worked at Insight for 1.5 years and I can honestly say, STAY AWAY."
bad,Would not recommend to anyone. New management of the ICC team very hard to work with and unwilling to compromise. Lost a lot of good people on that team because of the changes.
bad,"applied (mistake) for a network tools job.Recruiter sent me an email stating that she did not think i was a fit.  I was recruited,interviewed and hired from another firm."
bad,"Wow, have an appointment for your child forget coming in late there is 0 flexibility in scheduling as they always put company first and you well no where.."
bad,The schedule is not good for having a family.  They have very little concern for customer service.  Work environment was terrible.  Huge lack of training and communication.
bad,"I worked for Insight, and after the job was done, all the documentation was submitted, the time sheets turned in and all the work was done, they did not pay me. They did not answer emails, or phone calls. I do not recommend this company unless you enjoy working for free. I should have thought something was wrong after one person on my team said they had not paid him for work he had done a few weeks ago (I wonder why he came back to work for them). I listed that I was supposed to get paid $20.00 an hour, they managed to screw me out of $1000.00. Be careful"
bad,it is a true call center environment. old accounts list to call on that will never do business with Insight. They will not let anyone cold call companies.
bad,"They spent a day training everyone, then after training, I went to the job, I worked 6 days, they promised $20.00 and hour, I worked the six day,I called and emailed about my pay, and they ignored the calls and the emails. I would never work for them again"
bad,"My experience was a bad one from start to finish. For the entire time I was employed at Insight I was micromanaged, undermined at every turn, made to feel undervalued and bullied. Also with the inflexible long working hours my work/life balance and health suffered a lot. The office is located on the outskirts of the city which made it awkward to commute. "
bad,Service Desk is poorly managed. There is no support for employees. It's agent vs. management and you will always lose. Forget about pay raises and being recognized for any of the hard work you actually do.
bad,"When I was first hired I was told I would have 60/40 split of existing customers and the ability to cold call for new accounts."
bad,No home/ work balance and the management team cares only about bottom dollar.  Do not appreciate their employees.
bad,The lawsuit that was filed against them by their shareholders is linked at the bottom of their Wikipedia page says it all. Still practicing in a similar way which only causes lots of stress for employees in general and no advancement options.
bad,The executive assistant I worked for was  very condescending and wanted me to read her mind to know what I had to get done. There was really no way to be liked here unless I did personal favors like the previous person who had this position like watching her dogs or buying things for her family. Having this position was being constantly compared to the previous employee and all the outstanding things she did even though I wasn't trained to meet those expectations. This job really made me have mental issues and made me question my whole self worth. I was there at work every  day and on time and always asking what I could do to help but it wasn't ever enough.It was not okay for me to not be familiar with certain things in outlook but it was okay for her to not be and ask me questions on how to solve the issue.
bad,Nice place to work but I feel they focused on the client more than the employees.  Manager wouldn't speak to the employees unless they were spoken to first.
bad,The office was terrible. There's no privacy. Everyone shares rows of desks. Cubes for privacy don't exist. Not conducive to getting things done. People walking around behind you all day long distracting you. Other's near by are on phone calls or meeting with other's at their desk next to yours which distracts. If you like an open office...you might like it there. If you like a distraction-free office with private cubes...you'll hate it there.
bad,"Don't work here unless you approve of gender discrimination, favoritism, clicks, and the ""do as I say, not as I do"" management style. Managers have the freedom to treat employees as they please with total support from upper management. This company is all about making money with a high turnover rate."
bad,"Poor management vision, lake of  management competences."
bad,"Management does not listen, they hear, but will steal your Ideas and then chew you up and spit you out. They are more in tuned to their clients needs, and have no backbone when it comes to providing support to it's employees they place at their client sites. The turn over rate is amazing. Attrition is constant, and management will sell you a dream that is unattainable. Once you've committed your loyalty to this company you will learn that employee to company loyalty is futile. They smile in your face, then stab you in the back. They say they're a diverse company, but even looking at the pictures on their external and internal sites you'll see no minorities and this holds true with the organization itself. HR will try to tell you what to do with your 401K if you ever decide to stop contributing to your so called Retirement Savings which could mean they stand to benefit more from your 401K than you will- Like why do you care if I contribute or not, what does management stand to gain? Probably their own stock in the company. This is just not a good company to work for, they will sell you the Brooklyn bridge. The CEO sends out emails regarding Company profit gains, then the company only gives employees a $0.25 to $0.50 per hour raise.... Hello share the Wealth...BEWARE!!!!!"
bad,When I got hired I notified the management of a medical condition. Three days later I was written up.  Every time something came up I was written up even if it was the first time it happened.  The training suck.  The training lasted a grueling three months and the trainers were very rude and did not have patience although the company hired people with no IT background. After training my paperwork was forwarded to my actual supervisor who took it even further.  I asked at least two weeks in advance for time off work to get my medical treatments but he refused to let me off.  He continued with the writeups as well.  The benefits are not good.  They need to be more specific about when benefits actually start.  We were told that our benefits start 30 days after our start date.  They failed to mention that the 30 day rule is only for you to select your plans and you will have to wait another 30 days before you receive your benefits.  Actually you cannot use your benefits until you have been there 90 days.  This employer is insensitive and does not care about their employees.  There are over 5000 employees who work for this company.  You are just another number there.
bad,"After working there for 9 years, I can tell you that if you are on the IT Service Des there, you have little to no opportunity for advancement.  The merit raise program is very poor even if you are a top performer, you are lucky to get a 1.5% pay increase.  Starting pay is on the very low end of the spectrum, but the benefits are very good with 401k, good insurance, life, vision and dental included. THey also have a good PTO system.  "
bad,"Once Insight purchased HPE the moral of the company went completely down the toilet. Mananagent was trying to squeeze business from a turnip. If you didn’t produce, management didn’t use it as a teaching moment, but as a threat."
bad,Unrealistic goals and very low base pay. Too much micro management  and not enough focus on employee concerns and questions or needs. Brought in under false pretenses
bad,horrible management that only cares about themselves. they have 50 people reporting to one person who never really has managed anyone before in Columbus. they try to make up for their lack of experience by free lunches and party's. you never know if you have a job as the contracts are always in jeopardy.
bad,"Absolutely horrible company, I would not suggest working there or paying for their services.   The management and culture are horrendous.............."
bad,This company isn’t able to answer most question that a typical company it’s size should be able to. Quota never fluctuates with a trend and gifts/prizes from vendors will be taxed on your paycheck.
bad,"Terrible company to work for.  Bad management, bad pay, no advancement.  The only people that advance or make money have been there forever.  Talented people learn this, and move on quickly."
bad,"Its all about the bottom line and what wall street looks like at Insight. If you want to work in a understaffed, underpaid technical teams and crazy long hours with no reward. This place is for you. Only good thing is that you will be doing so much work that you get good experience in different areas then you can take your talents to a place that will appreciate you."
bad,Management was very old and uneducated on current products and how they function in the marketplace. Many managers promote fake pipelines and do not generate quality leads. Many young employees are allowed to under perform. Incentives are limited to those who are a part of the correct clique.
bad,"Insight isn't so much a bad company to work for. They need to change there benefits. According to my former colleagues Walmart has better benefits than Insight. "
bad,"they are changing the pay structure all the time to try to take money from you. They charge for everything, not even free coffee. Do not take a sales job with this company!!"
bad,"I have no interest in reviewing this company as of now. I am okay with not reviewing this company, I would not recommend it to anyone, it is slow paced and amazed anything gets done there at all. I deficiencies are based the the culture"
bad,"I think over all Insight is ok to work for. DO, however, STAY WAY FROM THE NATIONAL REPAIR CENTER! (NRC) It is very isolated, no advancement opportunities. I obtained SEVERAL IT certifications, along with my bachelors at DeVry. All of my efforts and work within the company were DOWNPLAYED at review time! The boss DID NOT CARE! "
bad,"Internally it is a great company, but if you work internally within Insight I would recommend that you consider other positions from a professional services."
bad,Will not recommend anyone to work with cant work with manager is not technical that work is not understood when im recommending work process
bad,nice place to work if you like being in the field as consultant or any other IT position
bad,"If you are looking for a place to move up in the corporate world, this is not the place to go. The people that work for Insight are hard working and great to be around."
bad,"Highest turnover I have ever seen, very little training. Expect you to self learn with no time to do it. Free cisco test, cool people. Managers don't care everyone wants out."
bad,"This is a great place to network within the industry.  You will eventually need to leave in order to advance.  Even if you are able to move here, you will get paid significantly less than if you were hired off the street."
bad,You're constantly micro managed. Pushed to make sales and dials. Not a fun environment.
bad,"The pay was good and that was it. The management has no clue about what they are doing, at least in the division I was on. Employees come and go like mushroom."
bad,They seem to care about there employees until you slip up.the training you get is long distance and up ward mobility is non existent. So be carfull when you work here.
bad,"Insight has a great reputation for being a great company to work for. What they don't tell you is that their perks like prize raffles, redeemable award points and any other perk awarded is charged back to you on your next paycheck. The pay is low for the market and workload. Extra hours are expected, but they won't pay you overtime for it. Management discourages continuing your education by telling you it's not needed to advance at Insight. The company culture is that you feel obligated to donate to every charity, potluck and baby shower they think up. They are pushy and will make negative comments if you don't. Their ""onboarding process"" is non-existent. New employees feel lost, confused and expendable. Welcome to the herd. Required off-site department lunches are out of pocket. Working at Insight has put me in debt!"
bad,"Too many politics, job advancement processes are inconsistent and too many of the wrong people are in management. Huge revolving door, compenation is changed (usually for the worst every year if not every other), with the expectation you have to compsensate to sell more. Overall, I learned alot, as to what kind of kind of company I dont want to work for."
bad,"High pressure, no layoaly after 5 years!"
bad,"It was OK at first but the position I was hired for was through a Third party and I was hired pre maturely, as the role they hired me for was not really defined and or put into application during my time there."
bad,"To start there is no extra compensation for all the work you do, when I say work i truly mean it. This company is so overwhelmed with their customers requests that everyone is bombarded with work. Instead of hiring interns or other type of qualified employee to do basic chores (within IT) they expect the senior level IT staff to do all sorts of ridiculos chores like ""clean up old computers""."
bad,"But promotes and masquerades as a Prof Services Provider with Values and Morals.  Many employees think they are auditioning for ""The Apprentice"" and bosses will stab you in the back with a smile whilst encouraging your colleagues to bark and bite you to add to the confusion."
bad,"Sold the job on the basis of having regular client contact including face to face management which I feel is an essential part for the nature of this role.  It turned out however to be a large call centre with possibly one of the lowest staff retention rates i've ever encountered, There is no face to face aspect and the training is based solely around the company and not the multitude of products or advice you would be likely to encounter and discuss which at times left you feeling out of your depth, especially when speaking with boardroom members on how to best identify and deploy large networking and storage solutions."
bad,Work environment need an uplift. Upper Management understood Business Development but not Sales. Willing to take very low margin and truly was not well established in the Federal space unless it was related to Microsoft. Much better way to utilize inside and outside resources. Commission split was not ideal.
bad,"Insight was a solid company at one time that put their customers first but has completely sold out to stockholder's demands and the greed of the leadership team. They refuse to staff the business to handle the workload and take care of the customer.  The benefits package is insulting at best. I would not recommend Insight to anyone seeking employment unless there is a top-down change in leadership and a serious move to return to their values.  At this time, the organization has lost sight of their mission to exist to serve their customers. The management team is unqualified and unprofessional.  Employees have been threatened and harrassed with impunity. Beware!"
bad,"Insight  could be an awesome company. Middle management carries out the message of Senior Management very well. The problem is that Senior management doesn't practice what they preach. It's extremely political and what applies to one person doesn't apply to the other. "
bad,"inbound billing, repair and sales calls"
bad,"Fairly easy work working with new products. Testing and processing returns. Dealing with manufacturers to begin the repair process. great satisfaction in pleasing the customer with a new repaired item, especially if i'd done the repair."
bad,Currently looking for a permanent position at Insight. 10 year contract ended and am looking for another position that requires computer hardware repair.
bad,If you like to be micro managed and love to stab people in the back you will love this place.. People will do what they need to get ahead here even if it means stealing sales from each other.
bad,Contract Work/Project Based. Clients are Fortune 500 and wonderful to work with.
bad,"Insight is a good place for someone that is just starting their career, but does a poor job of promoting within and retaining top performers."
bad,You will either make some money or none at all! Capped commission along with a very high turn over rate. Management is null and will not develop you at all.
bad,i learned about help other employees at their work while working in there. i do not like working there because they requires very long duty hours
bad,"I have learned very much during the 5 months I spent with Insight. Fast-paced, dynamic environment with some very talented employees."
bad,I think they have a good concept but not a promising career for those sales people involved.
bad,The culture very entrepreneurial. The organization is growing and has sound financials. The organization is seems to be growing at a pace that is not commiserate with it's talent. There have been multiple leadership changes over the past year that have led to some instability.
bad,"What seemed like a decent contractor role coming on to a large project soon turned out to be a daily exercise in fire fighting, with LOTS of stress / office politics / cliques and rabid personalities thrown in. The customer service team members had to figure things out on their own most of the time. Unfortunately, there were lots of things that were never considered or planned out before the project got underway, and when issues became visible to the clients, the project managers would go out of their way to burn the customer service team members by writing them up. The company hinted at offering full-time employment to get more work out of the contractors, but when the project ultimately went under due to poor performance (ironic, given the number of ""we're doing great"" team meetings that they held), they immediately dumped everyone involved except for the office favorites."
bad,"You are consistently thrown into situations where you will not even have the skill set required to assist the customer. Fortunately, your team will help you. The majority of teammates will not leave you hanging because they have been in the same situation and are understanding of it."
bad,"The people were wonderful!!!There is no work/life balance. In this day and age, telecommuting should be an option available to all employees, Taller cube walls or a sound reduction insulation is needed. Too noisy!!"
bad,Too many hours But good company to work for. It was a contract position. Workers were nice and courteous. No really enjoyable part of the job. Contract so they can get rid of you at anytime
good,"This is a digital company however, it should have at least some tangible evidence it exists. Editorial meeting were held out in the open and were sometimes delayed by FIVE HOURS."
good,The director I worked under was great.  The team I worked with was great. Pay rate was way below market especially given the revenue my pre-sales team generated.
good,The job seems nice at first but the company is very low down. If you're not in the circle with mngmnt you're likely to be fired.Non of the supervisors do any work. Horrible HR dept.
good,"In order to succeed, it seemed like there was a lot nepotism and good ole boys club mentality.  The only successful inside reps, were the ones who initially started with the company 20 yrs earlier.  They owned massive accounts.  The only other inside reps to survive turnover, were the ones management liked the most, they would receive a departed reps book of business."
good,Good place to work but long hours and no time for yourself. Management is lacking and not forward looking. Pay is not as good starting out as should be and training is lacking.
good,"This company is very small which is great because you can get to know each other and learn a lot about the company business, however there is a lack of respect, management and guidance here. I have gained a great deal of knowledge of the fashion world which has helped me but I am very stressed and frustrated daily."
good,"its typical data center job. there was really nothing exciting going on. the pay was good but no work/life balance. "
good,Great place to work but I just feel that I wasn't moving up like I would like to. They were also not willing to pay as much moving up in the company versus coming from an external place. There is no work place culture.
good,I really enjoy working with my coworkers but the culture is based on ensuring employees feel a sense that their jobs are never secure.
good,"Monitored operations for Fox Entertainment and Delmonte/Big Heart Pets"
good,ok place to work confused management many projects with hardware sales. multiple locations multiple vertical markets
good,"6 days a week"
good,Many employees including myself would agree. The job is do able and pay is fair but everyone wants more out of a job then just going into collect a check advancement felt almost impossible in this place.
good,"Began professional career as an Account Executive for a Fortune 500 global provider of information technology (IT) hardware, software, communications, networking, and service solutions to businesses and public sector organizations. "
good,"This was a great experience for me as I had a mentor to guide me to become an amazing sales person. It didn't quite work out that way but I did learn an awful lot about how to come across over the phone to build trust, inform effectively without sounding too much like a sales person and how to go out of your way to ensure clients are well looked after so that they come back and do more business with you. "
good,High-Energy fast paced environment but lots of turnover. Many great salespeople got their start there but lots of room for improvement.
good,Overall Finance and Accounting team is a great group of people.  my immediate supervisor was not very supportive or aware of what was going on during the day
good,My position is fast paced and requires the ability to work under extreme amounts of pressure from management.  Management seems to be more interested how and what you do benefits them.
good,"Typical day involves answering emails from clients, dealing with their quotes and requests, hitting the phones to generate new business and progressing pipeline."
good,Insight was a very high demand work environment.  You were treated like a number there.  The kept upping your targets to unrealistic levels so making commission was very hard.  They would take account you built up and give them away to head office reps but would never lower your target.
good,"Insight was a nice company to work for providing service to Chase Bank with regard to computer break/fix, installation, relocation of Chase Bank's computer hardware and related peripheral equipment."
good,"Had the opportunity to work with many great people."
good,"Insight Enterprises Inc., is a company that is growing and is learning to have a people-oriented culture. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team that surrounded me. We had good rapport and all wanted to serve the client and accomplish the same goals. The hardest part of the job was the uncertainty of employment due to the nature of the business. At times, it felt as though our program was doing well; other times, it felt like our jobs were in jeopardy."
good,Insight was the first job that I had in my field of work. I enjoyed working with my team. My supervisor was laid back and made the work load look easy.
good,"Not a good company.  Lack of direction, Mico management, poor career path, and a lack of compassion for their employees. Work hours are erratic.  No flexibility with schedules.  Team members not understanding what a team environment is."
good,"The company is under constant churn for management and employees.  There is no real life work balance, you have to make the choice to have one or not."
good,"Insight's product management and marketing teams structures allow for a high degree of productive and successful collaboration that ensures that the goals and objectives of the two groups, along with partner and overall Company, are closely and consistently aligned."
good,"The company has a lot of potential. However, leadership team has internal conflict and there is not a strong strategic plan. The leaders are not held accountable for delivery and execution."
good,as an intern I've got to work with most advanced technology and expand my knowledge but the pressure was at its highest. they were short staffed and could double their employees and still have more than enough work for everyone
good,Few opportunities for advancement and salary/wages not equal to other companies within the same industry for the same position.   Would recommend the company for a beginner in IT but not for a sesasoned specialist.
good,"It can be a fast paced environment, depending on the role that you have. "
good,"An OK place to work. The Work environment is good but they do not appreciate the efforts that you put in. the culture is good over there and you get to eat a lot of free food due to onsite vendors. They have favoritism. If they like you and you're a part of their inner circle, they'll sing for you on your Birthday. If they don't like you, your hard work will never be noticed. They do not like giving monetary appreciation to their hard workers."
good,"People were very supportive. Initial training of new employees needs to be improved upon. Online training, then thrown to the wolves"
good,"Great place to start because they accept pretty much anyone. Great if you want to learn about IT, but not so great in terms of management and it's a very sales oriented place since it's a public traded company. When I asked the CEO a question genuinely, I was looked at as trying to cause trouble."
good,"It's a good company but the only way to advance or move up to become good friends with your manager.  The benefits are ok and variety of jobs good if you get to be friends with management."
good,Inside telephone sales of IT products and equipment. I learned a lot about IT products and services like software.
good,"The pay scale is very badly set-up, new hires are always walking in the door now making more than the long term employee's. Old timers are to set in their own way."
good,"I found management to be fairly flexible when it comes to scheduling shifts when I started, they were lenient on adjusting to my requirements for education without any hassle as well, as long as I can commit to a near 40 hours. There is moderate to very little supervision depending on what project you might be working on. Most of the work done here would be what you might expect at an IT production warehouse. This is alright as a starting job for possibly a technician or a material handler, but be aware that your consideration to become a full-fledged team member can take ages for management to consider, in which case it would be best to find something else to do. The hardest part of the job would probably readjusting for production line issues where either there are not enough orders to keep you busy or there might be too much for anyone to handle. What I find enjoyable is that you can occasionally interact with some of the senior members, and occasionally get the luxury of sitting on a chair on certain days."
good,"The only real benefits I can say about Insight are that I did learn a lot about Cisco Networking throughout my time working with them. The environment is also very fast paced as they have numerous clients that they actively manage within their Network Operations Center. This has helped me grow to what I am today in regards to my network operations experience. However, unless things have changed since I left the company about a year ago, the pay is terrible for a Services Technician considering the amount of work they do within the Network Operations Center. The Network Operations Center at Insight was a revolving door throughout the time I worked there and everyone left for the same reason, to go get paid more somewhere else, which is very easy to do considering the low pay for the position. Before I left the company, the number of employees that left to seek more pay from other positions was in the double digits. Within one week, we had lost 4 technicians where 2 of which were senior technicians and one of them was probably our best technician on staff. It's a great place to work to get really familiar with Cisco Networking and fast-paced Network Operations. Management constantly had asked us what they could do to make the Network Operations Center better, and we constantly told them that an increase in pay or at least differential pay for 3rd shift employees would be nice. They never listened and have lost many good technicians because of it."
good,"I held several positions within Insight, and eventually chose to leave to further a different career path. This was a decent company to work for. Mostly fair pay (although benefits were a bit weak), and good people to work with (the occasional bad apple). However, once I started working in the operations department, it was totally different. No matter what you did, it was never enough to satisfy the higher ups, much less see them pleased. You could put in 12-14 hour work days every day and still it wouldn't be enough. While direct management would say that was too much time, they also wouldn't take anything off your plate or get enough head count to cover everything. There seemed to be some kind of communication breakdown between the desperation of the employees for any kind of assistance and the people approving new positions. While morale started to improve a little by the time I left with various team activities, it was still a challenge for the group to be anything but discouraged. Once this job evolved into something I didn't recognize (much less what I was hired for), I recognized it was time for a change. Other departments were better to work for!"
good,"I had a great time working at Insight for the first three years. I was able to get some major projects through the pipeline, however, once my major project finished, I was pushed in a direction I didn't want to go and stripped of my original duties. The management came and went. I had at least 4 managers in 4 years. Ultimately, I had to leave because they preach career advancement but don't listen to what you want to do at the same time."
good,"I love working at Insight, but my current position leaves me feeling unappreciated, under-supported, and just plain stuck."
good,They start everyone as a contractor. ITS AN OKAY PLACE TO WORK. They have a great system. Its a very small location. The people are friendly. As a contractor there is no paid vacation
good,Constant changes in the market and in Insights response to challenges makes the culture and job difficult to grow and build relationships with clients or with co-workers.  If you thrive in a transactional atmosphere you will do well.
good,"Worked here through an agency, the work was quite boring and training only lasted 2 days and wasn't that helpful, there was 1 main manager on the team, he was ok and approachable, but seemed afraid to confront other members of staff that pulling their weight. "
good,Senior administrator responsible for a corporate wide data center consolidation and migration project for CVS Caremark. Once it was known that the project was going to be completed on time. In a meeting  I was promised a permanent position with the company. When the contract was completed my position was never created.
good,Again it was because of management and the work was very repetitive
good,lots of great people to meet and work with. not much room for advancement. Management for the most part lives the Insight way.
good,"Flexible schedule, casual environment.  Not a great work environment."
good,"Excellent team, great strengths and work ethics. there is no easy part to my job, thats what makes it so challenging."
good,"Insight has offered continued eduction and certifications, but there are often barriers to advancement. Overall Insight has been good to me. One area concerns me about the company. Poor Employee outlook: The cut-throat sales culture and impossible corporate goals give a dismal employee outlook. The unrealistic, unattainable goals, and contant restructuring and re-organization give Insight a poor employee outlook. The unrealistic goals are only applicable to the sales deparment, but the affects and outlook branch across to job functions that have no way of contributing to the success or failure of the company."
good,Insight was a good place to start your career. It offers big time corporate experience but very entry level pay. You learn a lot and can grow if you are willing to go above and beyond
good,Work hard and do your job well and will see rewards.  Like any company there are good leaders that you enjoy working with and then there are leaders that you do not understand how they became leaders.
good,"Configure PC, laptops and mobile devices. Talk with clients and resolve issues with the image. Configure servers and built racks. Some labeling duties"
good,"Not enough advancement opportunities, not enough training, not commission for some roles. The job was fine overall. It is a software sales position and with no commission."
good,limited or no room for growth and the company is behind the times. Midde management is more worried about numbers than getting to know resources. There is a lack of team effort in some divisions. I would not recommend a position  here.
good,"its fine, however the value of an education is not highly regarded. Lots of turnover and very little work life balance. The pay is not good either, barely scraping by."
good,Love my job! I enjoy being able to help customers understand their licensing history. I enjoy being able to work remote and make my schedule to fit our customer needs.
good,This was also per diem work. Good company. flexible hours. All per diem work. manager was well organized. worked independently on a mobile MRI truck with travel.
good,"Only did what customer contracted us to do."
good,"Have not worked at Insight for over 13 years so providing a write up would not be current nor based on any improvements or degradations that may have taken place since that time,"
good,"I joined the company while it was in transition which left teams disjointed and pursuing different outcomes. With that said, the team that I was part of was very talented and a real asset to the business."
good,Have had several contacts at this agency reach out to me. They have some luck finding companies that match qualifications. The follow through is lacking. They really need to call back as often as they commit to
good,"The office at Salford is full of good people, has a good working atmosphere and is very well located with great facilities. "
good,"good organization to work for and learn a lot about the industry."
good,OK company. Large world wide company.  Like most places your teammates and manager greatly affect you work like.......................................................
good,"insight as a whole is a great company to work for with amazing people. This particular location is new with new upper management, who has to develop in his role. This is turn causes a strain on the sales teams."
good,En helt ok arbetsplats om man vill jobba utomlands.
good,Easy way to make some extra money. There are opportunities to move up in the company but they are very slim. Be prepared to be yelled at by those people you cold call.
good,"Responsive management team"
good,"* A typical day at work consists of making 40 cold calls, getting out quotes to your customers, maintaining strong relationships with existing clients, ensuring that your up to date on all the current training's, and handling anything extra that may come up. "
good,If you area not working with top fortune 500 accounts you wont make money.Need to become a field rep and there isn't much growth opportunities. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
good,"I enjoy the team that I work with, however the turn over is extremely high."
good,It is the most glorifying experience ever to work with such a well oiled machine. I would love to retire from a company just like this but  feel as if I am being stifled because I accomplish my duties very well.
good,They are a mousetrap company. Great place to get experience in IT sales. Good benefits and training. Will seem limiting to more experienced sales people.
good,"I worked in their services division and as much as they like to say they promote within that's a flat out lie. They brought more external new hires on than they ever promoted from within. They would interview internally but if you weren't buddy buddy with upper management you weren't getting the promotion. It got so bad that the manager of a major department resigned as manager and demoted himself to get out of the politics while he looked for a new job. It's not a bad place to work, the environment is good but pay is lacking and growth is not an option. I ended up leaving for a better job with better pay in the valley."
good,Always worried about making my quotes in sales every month instead of building a relationship with customers. The manager only cared if he made his numbers every month. I resigned the position after a year. Way to a...
good,"Short stay after merger.  Integration was slow."
good,Processed detailed computer orders for a major hotel chain.
good,"Very fast pace, no nonsense, but good co-workers and benefits. Managers flexible when emergence arises. Training could be better organized. I'd enjoyed the team "
good,I liked it just looking for more. Culture is good alot of good people but only about 5% of the sales people hit the goals the company sets for you.
good,"was interesting like any other wharerhouse, fun people and awesome environment if your a tech person"
good,"The business is relatively new, but with time and great employees the company will thrive."
good,"I would stay there as long as I could, but no communication with supervisor.  If you work hard the look for you too work harder, overtime like crazy, but if your lazy and do the low min. They don’t look for you to do better or less overtime."
good,"Employees at Insight encompasses the values aligned with their mission to strive for Heart, Hunger, and Harmony.  You will almost learn something exciting and new everyday with global technologies."
good,Very large company.   The people at Insight consistently make it a good place to work.  However they really lack employee career path guidance leaving employees to jump around looking for their own path to advancement.  This often makes it feel political instead of merit driven.
good,"I took a temp to permanent job which was supposed to last 6 months. It took them one full year before they made me an offer. They offered to hire me full time but with less pay. I would understand that if they would have to take on extra expenses if I was a contractor. Since I was a W-2 employee and received other benefits such as medical insurance and 401(k) contributions, I felt the lower hourly rate offer was insufficient. I worked hard and did good work for them for over a year, without PTO, and they rewarded me with an offer less that what I was making before the offer."
good,"There's not much room for advancement nor job security when you're a material handler for this company. 3 months tops and they're pretty much looking for replacement candidates even though 3 months & you're SUPPOSED to be a regular employee. "
good,Insight is a great foot in the door for other top technology and IT companies. High turnover and lack of training makes for slow and inefficient culture.
good,"Its a good company but certainly has improving options. I love the range of benefits the company offers and the fact we are internationally represented :)"
good,"Dynamic environment, great place to start career, lots of fun to work at Insight."
good,"Days were very busy and long. I learnt all about rebates, negotiating and handling bids."
good,"Productive and fun place to work with. Really lovely people who genuinely care about each other. Management is really good who try to get the best out of you,"
good,Decent work life balance. A ton of career paths to get into.  Comp plan always changing a downer.  Events and activities all the time.  Ok fortune 500 company to work for.
good,its all in the texas for me so long. nice team with professional managemnet. lovely cafeteria i must mention though. very nice place to work for anyone.
good,"I love Insight's employees, there was just a lot of changes in management and team members that caused the department to be shaken up."
good,"You aren't allowed as a network tech to do much of anything except to escalate tickets even if you know what to do. LEC calls and Engineer escalations is how technicians there resolve trouble tickets. Benefits are horrible, but not the worst. They are 24 hours, so are flexible for schedule. Going from tech (which basically does nothing technical) to engineering there  is usually within around 3-4 years. You will basically learn nothing for 3-4 years and move to an Eng role??? Maybe CCNP will help, but you will still be learning nothing for 4 years. I'd say work there and start passing CCNP certs, then move on in under 1 year from starting. If you come back 4  years later as an Engineer, then so be it. I wouldn't stay there as a tech though as it's a waste. The bright side is they will give you a chance (to do nothing), as I came in there with just a CCNA and no exp at all with any IT job what so ever on my resume. I thank them for that. I'm not talking down on the company as it is a good company. I'm mearly stating my review based on my goals and needs. I want to move up and not be an engineer forever. I did learn a little while I was there though. Pay is low concerning average, but the techs do no technical work anyway, so the pay is actually not low. It's just that their definition of a network technician is under par."
good,"Manage 3 fortune 500 accts for company; I do inside & outside sales; cold call; visit and work on company sites, run all reports, handle returns, orders, quotes. I sell hardware, software, and services to all 3 accts. Handle $30M FY"
good,Insight provides adequate benefits for employees with a good corporate structure and a healthy working environment. Collectively the company is a good group of genuine people from entry level to upper management.
good,it was a good company to work for but they lay off quite a bit despite hitting sales goals. They over staff and it is apparent this is apparently not the first nor will be the last time that they will hire then offer a severance package
good,This is a good place to get your feet wet in the Technology space. From a sales perspective the training was senseless and it seemed we weren't even learning from top performers. Ongoing training into specific product lines was always there for the taking but not in depth enough for my liking. I would suggest making all sales reps get at least 5 REAL certs as in cisco or nutanix etc. Something that will actually benefit them and not constant security training talking about the target breach 3 years after it happened :0
good,I was part of a sales team that sold computer products to both the SMB and Enterprise market.  Our days would consist of touching base with our clients and help them with their IT concerns and needs. We were constantly monitored with our sales effort and our daily productivity. I was in a sales call center environment so competition and micro management are to be expected.  Toughest part of the job was constant increase of your sales quotas but you expect that in a sales environment. Closing big deals and helping out your clients need is what it makes it all worthwhile.
good,Tough to make a living at it but the perks were great. They really do treat their employees well.
good,"Work Place is very good "
good,"Pretty good group, they leave you alone for the most part. You pretty much work offsite at a client location full time. It can be difficult to associate with Insight since your not actually working at Insight, but for them. The longer your contracted onsite with another company the bigger the disassociation can be. They typically dont really get involved with you unless the client has an issue with you."
good,A typical day was doing warehouse maintenance and inventory.  I learned how to maintain a warehouse environment. The hardest part of the job was trying to explain certain procedures to the manager of our dept.
good,great place to work long hours  like my coworkers like my supervisor enjoy learning new things looking for an oppertunityto grow  and be willing torelocate thanks also like working wit new eqipment
good,Fun environment. Great teams. A ton of energy and commitment to improving the company. I am unsure of the environment today. But based on my experience I would recommend Insight as a good place to work.
good,The company's bottom line prevails over service. No direct interaction with management very distant. The enjoyable part of the job was servicing departments and providing solutions and details to multiple locations electronically.
good,Good place to work.  Challenging political environment to work in.  Good place to learn and grow professionally.  Coworkers are helpful.
good,The relationships forged at Insight served as a career springboard.
good,"ok place to work it has is downfalls, I dont interact much just do my job,"
good,Working for Insight brought an understanding and competence in quality assurance.  Orders require accuracy and this position taught me how to recognize this.
good,"Working here on the weekends, one will be standing on their feet overall for about 9-10 hours of the shift. After arriving and beginning work at 8 AM, each break is 15 minutes, unless it is lunch which is 30 minutes. First break at 10 AM, then 12:30 PM, then 3 PM is lunch. The last break is at 6 PM then everyone is released at around 8:30 PM."
good,"Had a great time, Good people around. Friendly place (AI LAB), Good teammates! Little noisy but acceptable. people are helping there and very supportive."
good,"There are still some old school ""good old boys"" there, but they've mostly been weeded out. Great training, decent pay, rewards for outstanding performance, written policies and procedures, unlimited online training."
good,"Company with good vision and results however with no career path, great relationship with employees, good benefits, and community involvement and commitment."
good,"Insight is a very fast pace and exciting sales orginization that seemed  to be in step with the evolution and rate of change in the IT industry.  It took patience however to build a career, but could be done if you do the right things and put in the work."
good,"Build meaningful relationships with tier one manufacturers as well as our clients to provide the best IT Solutions."
good,"NO real vision for healthcare segment which is the fastest growing market in the IT industry.  Over promised, under delivered to sales professionals."
good,"Leuk bedrijf om voor te werken."
good,"worked as a data clerk as we worked for a  big market research firm, where quality was not compromised. we had to clean data to achieve the desired results thus teamwork was very effective. we collaborated with field workers to make sure they also collect sufficient data."
good,"Fun place to work, customer service center is always busy and getting new clients, which is obviously good for business. Amazing healthcare policies as well."
good,I learned how to become a better professional. also learning about technical aspects related to training.
good,"Working in the IT industry was a brand new experience for me. A typical day involved dealing and coordination with subcontractors. This included being the liaison between the subcontractors and our sales team."
good,"Great top-level corporate value and vision"
good,Excellent training and focus on the customer.  Management went above and beyond to make you successful
good,"Insight was a great learning experience.  I came into the IT world with no knowledge and gained a great deal of industry knowledge.  Insight suffers from the same thing a lot of large companies experience, bad middle management."
good,"Nice place.  Very nice staff and great communication between peers. Honestly one of the best jobs I have ever had.  For the most part, I would recommend it to anyone."
good,I have worked for a number of consulting firms.  Some young and some old.  Insight relies on the past experience of their employees to advance their company's agenda.  There is accountability and responsibility for a person's actions and a sense of contribution to the company and the community.
good,"Phones and reviews 8-9 hrs a day. Learned a lot about technology and product lines.  Management changed often; top executives left."
good,"Not much to say. Good place to work. I difficulty had a little difficulty with unrealistic expectations that were on. Outside of that, it is t a bad company to work for."
good,I was not employed long enough at Insight to make an accurate review of the company.  The work/life balance was great.  The hardest part of my short tenure was not having enough time with my leader to build a solid working relationship and getting laid off only 4 months after being hired.
good,"My experience at Insight has been varied but looking back I will say it has grown me and I am glad to be part of the Insight team. I have learned a great deal and been pushed well beyond my comfort zone. The leadership is committed to success and creating an environment conducive to winning, although their expectations are typically quite low and that undermines their effort to grow quickly. This is changing and may be isolated to my particular office. In recent years the company has embraced three key values, Hunger, Heart, and Harmony. I am happy to say these values come through in our day to day experience and actually drive many of the decisions made by executive and middle management."
good,Great work environment and teamwork. Managed projects that fit perfect with my skill set. Company had caring management style and had a ton of fun during my time with the company.
good,Goed en mooi bedrijf echter wordt vanuit EMEA aangestuurd dat geeft lokaal soms strubbelingen omdat er een groot verschil zit in de werk methodiek tussen de NL vestiging en de overige Europese landen.
good,"Great place to work if you are a self-starter and you don't get too mired in the political landscape. Make sure you build additional padding into your salary request, as you will likely be paying more for benefits. Their health insurance and prescription drug coverage is the worst I've encountered and they do not have much of a 401k matching plan - something like $0.25 on the $1 - just enough to say they have it."
good,Not at this time will I comment on this company. I work there and that is all for now. I work Monday thru Friday and no weekends.
good,It was a great opportunity to get my foot in the door. I learned a lot about the television industry when I was at ICN6.
good,There were two shifts when I work there each shift was 4 hours a piece.  One in the day and one in the evening. Managers were always helpful .Laid back environment.  I would call people and try and get them to donate to a worthy charity.
good,I learned a lot about IT working for this company. High energy teamwork enviroment. Phone B2B sales.
good,C'est une bonne compagnie pour travailler qui as les intérêts des employees.
good,"Insight was a great place to work, I provide the sales staff with collections assistance when their clients had not paid for their equipment yet. Each day I would call different clients and attempt to collect their unpaid balance."
good,"Insight Nederland is een zeer dynamische organisatie waar als het gaat om  aanpassingsvermogen er veel van je wordt gevraagd en verwacht. Over de de strategie is men duidelijk, echter de manier om er te komen kan regelmatig in korte tijd meerdere keren wijzigen waardoor er sprake is van enige in-effectiviteit.  Wanneer je hier niet zenuwachtig of zelfs moedeloos van wordt en daarnaast om kan gaan met een regelmatig hoge werkdruk, is het een organisatie waar je in korte tijd veel kan leren en zelfs een mooie carrière kan opbouwen. De algehele werksfeer binnen Insight Nederland is positief en de bedrijfscultuur is over het algemeen goed maar het zou nog beter kunnen wanneer er mindere eiland/afdeling vorming zou zijn."
good,"To start expect a lot of cold calling"
good,"Starting to apply all the financial and accounting system as (Splendid Co.) to rest of 4 companies in Zakko"
good,"Expert licensing advisor for SAP Business Objects and IBM who provides sales support for Account Managers, Field Account Executives and customers. Achieved success through proactive efforts in cold calling, marketing and education of manufacturer’s information to the account sales reps."
good,I would still be working there if not for cut backs. I enjoyed my years at Insight gaining experience and great friendships.
good,"At Insight, you will be taking calls for a assigned client."
good,Need more effective top down management  strategy.  Enterprise strategy doesn't translate.   Need effective IT and BI strategy.
good,My typical day consists of clearing accruals that are dollar for dollar and researching any short/over payments. I learned what it's like working for a large company and office politics. My co-workers are the best part of my job. The hardest part of my job is that I don't always feel I'm being compensated for the work I'm doing.
good,"Trouver des opportunités pour mettre en place un réseau en Afrique avec des organisations patronales pour définir des voies et moyens afin de favoriser un transport inter-état"
good,"A typical day was spent on the phone, building relationships with buyers at schools, colleges and universities."
good,"It was a fun place to work, but had it downfalls. We had too many CEO's and Presidents changing around.  Once you got used to one way it moved.  Yes, it moved my cheese.  I really did like more of it then not like it."
good,Overall we have plenty of work for everyone and our days really are intense.  We are contracted out as an onsite IT support staff for our customer at their Monterey facility.  As an operations manager I have the pleasure of working with all the locations providing support for their IT needs.  The most enjoyable part of the job is really the local people we interact with on a daily basis. And unfortunately the hardest part of the job is dealing with a management team that do not deal with the issue's at hand or have a clear understanding of the customers needs.
good,The company is focused on its customers and treats their employees with respect. The benefits package is average and they only offer a high deductible health insurance package.
good,My direct Manager was outstanding. He would go above and beyond in teaching all software. I owe it to him for teaching me a lot about Excel. He was understanding with work and life balance
good,"Insight is a company with lots of potential and a very competent group of senior leaders from the Senior VP's to the President to the CEO and on to the Board of Directors. Employee benefits have improved each of the past three years, and there are lots of promising plans in place. The biggest challenge for Insight at this point is building out the internal functions required to really advance in the Fortune 500. The HR function for example is staffed with really talented and caring people, but there just aren't enough of them to go around to take care of the day to day and execute on bigger initiatives at the same time. The other challenge is in the mid-management levels where there are too many office politics at play."
good,"I appreciate the time I spent with Insight. I had some of the best bosses I've ever had there. I was a remote contractor so I can't speak too much to what it's like working for them directly. Only negatives were poor benefits, and they also fell back on a promise to send me my personal data when I sent a laptop in, which was a heavy loss."
good,"I learned a lot about IT and had some great successes there.  An interesting set up with the ""stadium"" theory.  It was nice having all of the vendors on-site and the happy hours they hosted were REALLY fun!!"
good,"I love what I do, I love my job, and I have a great manager but I am not sure what I am being strung along for anymore. Constantly am given hope for promotions, raises, advancement, new offers but am not really seeing options become available, salary and pay has been the same since I started (lowest pay in the company if you are sales). This job is certainly challenging. We are being told a lot of changes are happening so I have hope that things will be better or people that come after me. If you start working here now you have hope for a future and good opportunities because things are changing, just may not change fast enough for me to stay. Like I said, I really enjoy my job, it is fun and challenging, but there is currently no clear plan for how to develop and grow and succeed in this company beyond entry level."
good,"My time with Insight was really good.  Unfortunately high margin sales are slowing and they are going through a staff reduction."
good,"There isn't really much to say about this job. They mostly sent me out to various Chase Bank locations around Houston to set up their computers, server and network. They sent instructions on how to set things up so it was foolproof. I usually did this kind of work in the interim."
good,It seems that they don't have a Project Pipeline so it is probably difficult to estimate future needs for PM resources. Temporary Employees should be aware of this when considering whether or not they will be extended.
good,Working at Insight is fairly easy.  A typical work day goes fairly smooth.  There is the occasional argument with a co-worker just like any where else.  Insight is welcoming place with great benefits and hard working people.
good,"Typical day included big emphasis on outbound dials, training and sales knowledge"
good,Great place to grow and gain exposure to Clients and internal LOB's. Co-workers are very supportive and access to the Sr. VP level is available.
good,"Team atmosphere, where sales are encouraged and at the forefront of most interactions with customers, teammates and management. Very money oriented. Challenging in some aspects, but overall an easy and fun starter job, to lead into a career."
good,"It is your normal contractor IT company. Whatever the customer wants within reason. Meet your SLA's and keep the customers happy. "
good,"Competitive workplace "
good,"Management is involved and approachable, Insight is innovative with benefits such as creating their own healthcenter. Starting people off with only 2 weeks vacation is a huge drawback if you value time away from work with your family."
good,"Insight has been through some tough changes over the last year or so and as such its become an unsettling place to work today. "
good,"Managing the Executive's daily agenda, fully engaged in many different projects, many opportunities for professional growth, I was able to work alongside many different dept.'s to assist them; example, HR, Marketing, Event Planning, Social Committee, intranet, etc.  Here I was able to increase my knowledge and abilities to work seamlessly with all Directors.  I was the to ""go to"" person and truly enjoy assisting and helping where I can.  My true passion is a strong team player with a great attitude.  We would have many different types of events, from corporate, to vendor forums, to 5 a 7.  Most enjoyable was the multi-tasking part of my job, I truly have a great desire working with people, administrating one's daily agenda to alleviate their time to better focus on the business."
good,"Ability to move up, fair management.  You are in charge of your success or failure at Insight"
good,• The job involves training the students as well as the worker to get basic knowledge of 3d modeling using CAD software.
good,Requires a high degree of flexibility
good,"Been at insight now for a good few years. has got better over time. but always been a decent place to work with good percs. "
good,This place has taught me so many things like how the network actually works in real world. On site client interaction - one to one. Very supportive and many knowledgeable people are working along.
good,"We were given opportunities for training, but it was difficult to feel part of Insight and to follow through with Insight-specific duties as we worked within another company following that company's rules and culture; however, general Insight culture at Headquarters seems great."
good,"I learned a lot from working here. Have a great many friends still. If I was still in AZ, I would likely want to come back. Happy place with productive employees."
good,"The culture around the office is very relaxed, but with a drive for continual learning and improvement. The only complaint would be that career advancement does not have a clear path or requirements and can take a long time."
good,"A decent indie to work for, paid well, planning was good. Intelligent and good hearted people work here. hard working and hard-playing, they mainly focus on making investigative documentaries. I liked them a lot."
good,"Overall a good company. Friendly employees. The company is heading in a good direction to be employee focused. Fairly stress free. The company provides time to train, and attain certs."
good,"Insight is a great learning place for any individual willing to learn sales, there are tough times with budgets and numbers but the motivation portion of sales is completely satisfying."
good,"As a technical solution executive, I was responsible for working through the Insight sales teams across the U.S. to increase Microsoft Dynamics CRM software and service sales.  I trained, demoed, presented to all sales groups within the U.S. and directly sold to customers.  The challenge is that there is not a quota attached to CRM for our sales teams, so the incentive for them to sell CRM does not exist."
good,Insight Canada is an amazing place to learn and sell everything IT.  My co- workers make working fun and management is the reason I've been working here for over 8 years.
good,"Reports, Phone calls, emails, and LOTS of orders!"
good,"Cette entreprise est une belle expérience pour tous ceux qui veulent connaître l'industrie de la TI. D'ailleurs, la formation continue, le soutient à l'accroissement de notre talent est inégalé. "
good,"At Insight you you learn a lot about technology even if you didn't have a background or were familiar with it, and selling skills. Co-workers are great and nice and always willing to help, and always give you feedback. There was also many competitions and great bonuses as well the occasional free lunches. The environment isn't very work/life oriented, and the harder you work the harder the pay off will be, even if it is a struggle in the beginning, it can get better."
good,Equivalent to an office manager had this been a small company. I was the go to person to get things done. Really enjoyed the caliber of teammates that I worked with.
good,"Insight is a big company that brings in new people and helps them grow. While I wished there were more advancement opprotunities, Insight is a great place to begin a sales career. "
good,I worked for Insight and divisions of Insight for 10 years. There were some bumpy rides but overall a good place to work and have have good work-life balance.
good,"It's great that everyone helps you whilst you are trying to get your mind around things. Very helpful and contributed to my productivity. Its always a fun place to be with different people all sharing the same goal and mindset of Hunger, Heart and Harmony."
good,"Binnen Insight is het bij uitstek mogelijk om je talent te benutten. Als je openstaat voor groei, ontwikkeling, zingeving en plezier kan je veel bereiken."
good,"Great company overall. They develop their people. Have good benefits and pay is competitive. Leadership is concerned for their employees. However a recent RIF challenged their corporate culture. "
good,Agenzia fortemente creativa e innovativa.  Ottima esperienza professionale e personale.
good,"Insight holds true to its Mission and Core Values..."
good,This was a great place to work and room for growth.  Truly can be successful. I have been blessed to have been part of the team here.  Very fun place to work
good,Fun to work for lots of greet and meets with Partners and you get to learn a lot about the technology industry while on the job.  Great working environment. Everyone on the team was helpful. Great work and life balance. Continuous motivation and training.
good,"Insight is a good company and a great place to get a start to your career.  Excellent perks, decent pay, and a nice working environment.  I was not on the sales side of the organization as i working in IT supporting the vendor's."
good,"Good company, good pay good raises, vacation days. Good work environment. The locations were I worked were good for me."
good,"taking calls during the day is little busy, installing printer, software, troubleshooting hardware and software problems.coworkers get along with each other.the hardest part of the job is when things break."
good,"Les journées de travaille sont très discipliné. Vous devez arriver à des heures précises avec une chemise a col au minimum. Il y a beaucoup d'opportunités de développement pour les employés, surtout pour ce qu'ils sont motivés. L'aspect le plus difficile du poste est l'organisation. L'aspect le plus agréable du poste est l’indépendance. Les supérieurs laissent les employés gérer leur portefeuille de clients."
good,"Great place to work, seem to care for the staff really well. I only had a temporary contract but would have loved to continue working there for longer than 6 months."
good,"outbound sales call center that is focused on sales and metrics.  Be prepared to sale, sale, sale and sell.   On the other hand venders do give you free lunches.   what more can be said."
good,This organization is very competitive and rewarding to work for if you're looking for a good career.  Teammates are amazing and always willing to help.
good,"You control your actions day to day which determines your success in this company.  If you want to be the best, expect to put in the time to do so.  Similar to ANY work environment, there are those days when it is difficult to come in."
good,"This was a temp agency, so it wasn't like being in an office setting. "
good,"Insight offers careers for all levels of experience."
good,I enjoyed working at Insight very fun laid back with multiple resources to help guide sales associates in the right path. Working with multiple vendors to provide whatever the customers needs are.
good,"Good company, decent benefits. Have to work your tale off in order to turn a profit. They provide decent resources in order to set you up for success."

good,"Insight is a great place to work. There is a strong culture of teamwork, cooperation, and career development. The environment is fast-paced and competitive."
good,"Great place to work. Like any Service Center you will deal with constant change, but management does a lot to make you feel comfortable. The management structure is really the best part of the job. They really do all they can to ensure you succeed."
good,"Support and maintain in-house computer systems, desktops, and peripherals. This includes installing, diagnosing, repairing, maintaining, and upgrading all hardware and equipment while ensuring optimal workstation performance. Troubleshoot problem areas in a timely and accurate fashion, and provide end user training and assistance where required"
good,Insight was a great place to work. The culture was professional and there was room for advancement within all departments.  Management really listened to their employees and tried to do what was best for the employees and for the company as whole.  I learned a tremendous amount while I was there in all aspects of the company and within my role.
good,"I currently work at Insight and am enjoying it. They are constantly striving to improve things but sometimes struggle a little - (sorry, first the bad bits) sometimes due to the fact that certain people in management as well as normal staff have been hired or promoted prematurely and these individuals have little interest in making Insight a great place to work for for everyone and occasionally don't have the right experience or ability to learn and understand their role - and these are the individuals who bring Insights reputation down. When hiring (especially managers)  I wish that Insight would not only focus on the ""Hunger"" but also the ""Heart & Harmony"" which might be a bit more tricky to test in a job interview. I find that Insight holds on too long to these types of people and gives them a few too many chances to improve - that's partially a good thing but not always for other teammates who work really hard and get stressed while  picking up other peoples slack. Management also has a tendency to keep things too confidential when things are not going well without giving staff heads up or giving any information as to what is happening which often results in gossiping and a feeling of instability. But as always in the end things are never as bad as they seemed at first, but by the time everyone figures that out there has been a lot of drama and negativity. But I think Insight is trying hard to improve these things. "
good,a typical day is very busy but rewarding . order picking or invoicing (shipping).My job was to pick orders with reach truck or high level order picker .The job was physical but not overly physical.Management very helpful.

good,"Excellent company. Sales support is order entry, is pretty much customer service, an entry level position. My co - workers are funny and friendly makes for an easy work environment.  Worst part of my job is the mundane busy work involved."
good,"Very open to teaching and training, new up until you've been there for one year so very forgiving."

good,"I only got limited view of how the company works and the people who are involved. I was only there on a work experience placement created for me by the company, which is an example of the company's generosity and flexibility. My impression as a whole was positive, the employees were friendly and ready to engage with me despite the fact that they had work to do and I was the first ever work experience case the company had dealt with. The jobs I were given were small but enough to keep me busy and the other tasks or opportunities helped me in some way or form, such as introducing me to Photoshop and allowing me to have access to a communication course the employees underwent."

The management teams I have worked with are fantastic."

My job was fast paced and very demanding but the team I worked with was fantastic and kind. We actually did team building activities and had regular group meetings to share knowledge and ideas. It is a great place to work and I am normally rather negative about my jobs!
