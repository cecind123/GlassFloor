rating,review
bad,Recruiter promised multitude of warm qualified LOCAL leads. Did not come through at all. Management in Portland area sucked. Awful leadership. Hated working there
bad,If you want a pyramid scheme filled with promises then yes Prudential is for you.  Management is poor.  No training.  Expect you to give half your compensation away to senior advisors.
bad,Terrible company to deal with didn't have any days off and they way things was ran wasn't like a real company site they sent us to wasnt safe at all for a unarmed guard
bad,"Management is not invested in your success.  As long as their long tenured sales people produce, anything a new agent produces is a drop in the bucket to them.  Therefore you are very much on your own.  You are expected to sell immediately to your friends and family, despite limited training on an incomplete product line.  100% commission based compensation.  Highly variable compensation based on the product sold. "
bad,"no pay, high fees, no leads, all leads that are given are hundreds of miles away, or 85 years old , or the phone number does not exist. they charge you as an advisor for everything"
bad,"The company seek out people with certain criteria, put you through the vetting process. If you fulfil the criteria take you on, then constantly monitor to see how you perform. Not to be taken as easy, too much intense legislation in a short period of time and no helpful suggestions."
bad,"They make you rip your family and friends  off in the beginning to prove you are ready to be on your own, then after they get all the new hires friends and family money they don’t care about you anymore"
bad,I didn’t have a good experience with management not sure I would recommend this company to anyone looking for work. The work environment is very important to me and my family and this company did not have a family oriented work life balance.
bad,"no help or support from management, worst job I have ever worked in. they don't care about staffs needs or mental health only meeting targets, its good for widening skills and meeting people but that is it, also with a tupee transfer, there is a huge wage gap between new people and the staff that actually does the work being on considerably less"
bad,"Susah jual produk nya,nasabah2 banyak yg complian,karna pas claim agent2 banyk lri!!"
bad,Not a good place to work. The company only care about themselves. They don't care about the employees. It's not a place I would tell someone to get a job at.
bad,I really didnt enjoy working for the company due to lack of professionalism. I learned the job and performed my duties well. I excelled rapidly but saw that my talent was not needed
bad,Management never provided a straightforward answer to inquiries while in the midst of problem solving. Employee's job descriptions fluctuated at the whim of management and no consideration of whether or not the employee wished to maintain their position
bad,come October 31st I would have been here for years and there is no advancement opportunities and too much favoritism on a job as where those were potential or overlooked but they expect you to perform a grade a work-related performance instead of acknowledging you for the potential and hard work that you put in as well as being on time at work. 🤔
bad,"Strictly commission, which I knew in advance, but once my supervisor decided he didn't like me, he refused to work with me anymore. Grand total of about $12,000 income in 3 yeas."
bad,Not a great place to work; spent several years here thinking I was only as good as a job title. Other companies offer much more opportunities and growth than Prudential.
bad,"This job was mentally stressful , no safe job security. Management is typical corporate sneaky people . I truly am glad to be moving on from prudential and I would not recommend them"
bad,"Worst place to work, no support, it is just about cold calling, I didn’t even get my licenses money back, so I ended up loosing money with this company"
bad,"Old company with outdated ideas. Management completely out of touch with employees. If you’re in IT, there is nothing to learn here. If you’re coming in as a consultant, be prepared to be treated like a non-entity. Unhappy people clinging onto their jobs for the benefits and retirement. You will not be valued at Prudential. You have been warned."
bad,"This company is run like a company in the 18th century. The systems they are using are antiquated.  The worst is the no support in the local office...everything go to New Jersey or Philadelphia or somewhere in Asia."
bad,"the worst management - backstabbers set unattainable goals "
bad,"I was not a full time employee with Prudential, therefore I am not familiar with what they offer or with their policies, etc. Worked from September 2017 to May 2018."
bad,Horrible company to work for. The management staff where I was located at a high school was really weird. The so called captain liked to watch you on cameras and I believe get off on watching people. Company offers nothing and was hired full time but barely even worked part time. Really weird company overall the wannabe captain I guess thought he was the head of the CIA or something. I don't get it
bad,"The management is horrible, they hire people who are  unprofessional and fire the good hard workers.  I watched this when i wanted to start my life over. It was a daily occurrence at prudential."
bad,Customers were not important. Worked too many hours trying to findways to suck money out of people for brokers that had no morals. Did not want a career taking money from old people.
bad,we paid beneficiaries due to what policy holders left them. Alot of tedious work. Hard to advance. Would not recommend for employment. I was a temp worker.
bad,"Lack of internal promotion. Uneducated management and staff. Uncompetitive salaries. Great benefits, medical/dental. Workout room. Nice cafeteria. Food was good."
bad,"It's a stressful working environment, the employers require the employees with a lot of qualifications. Avoid working with this insurance company if you can."
bad,"The Financial Advisor Development program quickly develops into a relentless cold calling fest. They make promises, call you an ""advisor"", target young applicants, and then you realize that you are a cold calling insurance agent."
bad,"Previous male manager was very fair, but was replaced by a woman manager who seemed to have her favorites, and was blind to their faults. If you were on her hate list, you knew it!"
bad,There is no structure or room to grow in this job. You are not assigned a client base and therefore not set up with the tools to make commissions or earnings. Only money made in this job is from clients you originate. Even the worlds best salesman will have trouble establishing an acceptable income.
bad,I was there at the time of transition. So people were getting laid off and the moral was low. With the constant changes going on there were no policies or procedures in place.
bad,"If you’re on the phones and need to go to the restroom, they discourage you from going!  They treat temporary workers like 2nd class.   Managers are unprofessional!"
bad,"Although the position  was advertised as a Financial Advisor"
bad,"A Typical day at work for Prudential ,which I have worked for 30 years included Administrative Assistant tasks, phone answering, greeting staff, typing, lotus notes, meeting quality and production standards."
bad,"Company takes great focus to achieve respectable financial compensation.   Understand the management contract clearly."
bad,Worst management I’ve ever seen. Male manager comes in whenever he wants. He is lazy and smooching off from everyone else. Horrible unprofessional environment
bad,I enjoy working for the two representatives.  I work from home. The job was calling existing clients and scheduling meetings.  Inputting information on client link.
bad,If you are an incredible salesperson with a massive personal network you have a chance to succeed here. There is high turn over due to the pay being 100% commission.
bad,Licensed agent that was expected to sell mostly life insurance policies. Manager wanted me to find all friends and family life insurance even thought it may have not been the best fit for them.  Management tried to get them to surrender existing life insurance policies to buy from me.  I ethically could not do that to my friends and family.
bad,They sell you the dream as their products but the company does not come through on their end. Left and the company could not trace last paid check mailed to my house. Pay is low. Unprofessional environment.
bad,"La carga horaria es altisima si se necesita llegar a un ingreso normal.Se aprende mucho por el nivel de capacitación aunque ahora los capacitadores no son tan buenos.La gerencia es terrible, y ponen en esos puestos gente sin experiencia, no hay respeto, y hay muchas faltas de etica con los clientes y entre pares"
bad,"Many long hours trying to find leads in order to make appointments and sell life Insurance.  I was expected to be in the office by 8:00 am and be out on sales calls throughout the day and evening."
bad,The senior leadership is cliquish. This cliquishness starves the company of diversity of thought. It also chokes of advancement opportunities for many talented employees.
bad,Again too many reviews. I decided to leave this company in pursue of a better opportunity. At the time this was a great opportunity. It gave me experience as a Logistic analyst which added valuable experience to my career experience.
bad,I worked for a real estate agent who was very sloppy and with poor sales skills. She failed to close sales in a quick and effective manner. She was also not skilled in properly managing her buying and selling of homes.
bad,awful company; awful management who never want to try and help you but will pull you aside and go over everything you did incorrectly. Management gossiped about agents on the floor.
bad,"Strictly commission work with much unpaid required training & client service work. ""Agency Support fee"" is gradually increased while ""Agency Support' has been recently decreased, commissions decreased; you must supply your own computer, are charged for postage, must pay for licensing renewal and Errors & Omissions Insurance. Producer services are not adequate; systems are horrible making job nearly impossible to accomplish."
bad,I didn't like working weekend and I didnt  really like my manager/coach just because she just through me out there. But I did like interacting with buyers
bad,"Pru is a great company to learn; however salary is not competitive, managers are poorly trained and there is not much in the line of advancement"
bad,"Typing up a spread sheet of all clients of Prudential in Auckland New Zealand superannuation."
bad,I am a hard working individual that works well with others.  Given the opportunity I can grow with the company and make an impact for the better of the company.
bad,"Bad place to work, Management has no idea how to help employees. All they do is lie, and tell you to figure it out."
bad,Empresa desconstrói inúmeras carreiras através de muitas ilusões e mentiras.  Pesquisem Muito antes de entrar.
bad,"Some teams execute using modern practices and methods. Other teams do not. As a result, attrition is high on the teams that do not promote an individual's growth and has low cohesion. Large companies, like this one, have slow organizational progress for initiatives to bring new ideas to fruition. Management still has ""the old guard"" mentality. These are people who have been at the company for 15+ years and do not want it to change since they view their own comfort level above the company's best interest to adapt to stay competitive with its peers. Because of this resistance to change, management has difficulty attracting and retaining high-performing individuals. Regardless, this place might be for you if you are willing to sacrifice being not up-to-date on your knowledge and skills, less competitive in the job market and play office politics for the reward of stability and a low pressure, slow-pace work culture."
bad,"Prudential may be a great place for full-time employees; not so much for contractors, who are treated like second class citizens. Contractors are given different color badges than employees; they aren't allowed to access company facilities like the fitness center; they're not allowed to work remotely, even in the event of inclement weather; and they're not allowed to participate in company meetings and activities. Depending on the manager, contractors are subject to verbal abuse from managers and directors."
bad,I don’t like to be nit picked with but I do like to have fun and creat a neutral and down to earth environment while working! I usually am the one if your days is going bad I will be the one to cheer you up!
bad,"I was very unhappy management treated you like a child in a prison, they had a choice to be good to people but chose to pick on every word that is said on phone calls"
bad,"- A typical day at work: Telesales from morning to noon with the source I find on my own. I go direct-sales at night with my team."
bad,"Nobody tries to help you at this company. They definitely have their ""favorites"", and aren't afraid to let you know who is their favorites are. I hated every minute at this company."
bad,"Its better to become an independent broker than work here."
bad,"Job was tedious in that you constantly needed to find leads to keep the ball rolling.  Many times clients would ditch the appointment and you had wasted your time and resources.  Job was 100% commission and many times there was no pay if your commissions fell short of the level needed to get a draw for that pay period. Company assistance in the form of matching for marketing dollars that allowed you to get your name out disappeared in the second year, which was not enough time to build a business. This job requires a person with 200% drive, energy, and stamina. Would also help to have a second income to fall back on in down times."
bad,They made you work endless hours with little to no direction at all. The expectations were completely unrealistic for a 20 something with literally no natural market inherited from my parents.
bad,The orientation was decent - but in my local area local agents were hesitant to share their business.
bad,Bad culture. Poor management. No job work/balance. No job security or advancement. Good benefits. Not pleasant place to work. I do not have more to add they were poor company to work for in almost everyway. Fellow employees had no idea what teamwork was never worked together to get job done.
bad,Manage constantly clock employees. Lots of overtime. Unable to take full lunch break. Too many changes. Manger does not communicate effectively to the staff.
bad,"Lack of advisor support, poor customer service attitude, little dedication to problem resolution, managers recruit with high expectations and promises only to result in disappointment and false information, critical compensation information was withheld for 6 months that is essential to business planning"
bad,"Not a great place to work, wasn't given the tools to succeed, or provided with the tools I was promised when I was hired. Management didn't seam overly concerned with my success"
bad,"All of my team worked from home at least 3 days per week, including my manager. The remaining team was not local and had 5-day per week work from home arrangements.  "
bad,Not a place to advance a persons career.  Management managed up and did not take care of the employees and were always working towards advancing their own agenda.
bad,Outdated business model and leadership.  Other divisions of the firm are driving the production and profitability.  The local and retail distribution platform is outdated and needs to be revisited.
bad,"No work life balance, very cut throat environment, say they are a diverse organization and treat everyone equally but I did not have the opportunity to witness that."
bad,"Stay away from this garbage. They pay you like dirt. If you are a young person right out of college, they're going to fill your head with dreams of all this money you're going to make. This job has an 85% failure ratio in the first year. Would you jump out of a plane if they told you that your shoot had a 15% chance of opening? I didn't think so!"
bad,Challenging environment with leaders/management who did not allow employees to work independently without hovering and questioning  the day to day activities.
bad,"The group I was in had a high turnover ratio as it was.  My group was outsourced after 6 months.  I never received any training.  I was handed a 500 page Procedure guide and told to test the procedures. They put me into another group where I had no experience and it was just my Manager and I who worked part time.  I had no guidance and was expected to understand the downstream effects of everything I did on my own.  It is not a company I would recommend unless you are entering a group in your comfort zone with good leaders.  I was a Senior Associate Manager at my previous company and I have worked for several other big companies in the past.  However, I have never seen a company handle their employees the way Prudential did.  The workplace culture was terrible as no employees in my group alone, where you everyone was uncomfortable and unsatisfied."
bad,"Thu nhập thấp, không có chế độ đãi ngộ, lương thưởng."
bad,"No support for leads, expected to get friends and family to be your source of client base.  It take minimum two years to build a client base for book of business.  Until then no financial support.  Management doesn't care if you can't pay your rent and you lose your housing, not have money for food.  You need a car.  Safety of going into people homes in unsafe areas or dangerous apartment building in low income areas at night."
bad,"I had two little children at the time and my day care closed it's doors at 6 pm when asked if I could please change my hours, eventhough clearly employer could do so, it did not."
bad,"In such a big company, I can't speak for all departments. The culture of mine is very childish and unprofessional. You have management walking around gossiping all day, they sneer at new hires and then act as if they should run behind them begging for them to speak. They constantly breach codes of ethic and non disclosure by discussing job performance and personal life details of other associates with Reps that are not in management. Just the most unprofessional display of management I've ever witnessed."
bad,"Commission only.  No base pay.  They lure you in with ""an exciting career as a financial professional"".  Be your own boss!  Make as much as you want!  Very deceitful ."
bad,"Not a great place to learn about the financial services industry. Required to work self generated leads while not getting paid, which translates into your friends and family."
bad,"Very cutthroat, very stressful environment.  Company does not follow up on training, or what they promise.  Don't expect any commission for at least the first 3-6 months."
bad,Moi truong  lam viec  khong duoc tot lam . Dong nghiep khong may hoa nha . Quan ly   rat  tot  .  Dieu kho nhat  trong  cong viec la bi ap  luc  tu khach hang
bad,If you are into selling insurance products to your friends to grow your business this may be for you.  Had me create a list of 200 friends and then put them into categories as to who might be interested in what.  I did not feel comfortable calling friends and family nor did I feel comfortable giving them my list of people so I left first day in office (after becoming registered mainly at my own expense).
bad,"The culture is not welcoming to new employees from the outside, the knowledge on how to get things done is not shared by long time employees. Its very political. Strategic ideas are never welcomed"
bad,"Ethics? Surely you jest."
bad,Management and Upper management was full of personality. Long hours unjustified. 
bad,"Just all around unprofessional, didnt enjoy working for the company after 2 months. After your settled in you realize how they treat their workers. No bueno"
bad,"The job functions is not hard the Team Leads and Coaches make the job hard. They criticize your work they talk to you like you are a child. They  add more work to your workload and complain about time management. You complain about management behavior and you are retaliate against.This department has no structure  they hired a class in October "
bad,"Number one, poor management. Much backstabbing and underhanded management techniques. Prudential comes across as a great place to work, but once inside the games the backstabbing and the underhanded management techniques all come into play.  There is no true leadership just a bunch of people with big egos and personal agendas. Notteplayeccompanyagendasvendetta's.thisthrocompanythroughocompanyallover the company"
bad,"Weird, cultish environment. When the actual members of a cult don't even know they are in a cult, it means that the cult is in good working order. The company makes money in spite of itself and they like to spend it."
bad,"The compensation was very good, as were the benefits. But it is a work environment where people are governed by fear and politics. For me this became very tiring."
bad,"The job is working for a crooked insurance company and traveling and dealing with customers that Prudential has screwed in the past.  My manager was a jerk who claimed that we should know everything even when he never went over it with us. I also had a deal fall through and wasn't able to make up for it causing me to not get a paycheck for two months and then had to pay them back 10K on top of it! The benefits are god, but not for the junk they put you through."
bad,"Supported a  manager for 5 years.  He was ungrateful, rude, brass and wouldn't let me move to another department since it would look bad for him if his admin left.  Only way out was to quit."
bad,"High turnover rate.  The managers were either not capable or not willing to support the sales force in making sure sales agents were successful. We were provided with a lot of training, but not enough field training.  The hardest part of the job was finding clients to see."
bad,"Some managers will intentionally write non-truth statement on performance review to downgrade performance.  Internal hiring has certain people in mind prior to interview process, so candidate can only be a game player and won't have a chance to get hired."
bad,"There was no support from management even when it was specifically asked for.  The work days were told to expect 7.5 and then expected to be more than 10 hours per day. "
bad,"I would not recommend Prudential. The culture is toxic, management is constantly changing, is not supportive, and getting promoted only happens if you are one of the favorites."
bad,"Salary is Commission Only. Minimal leads are given other than accounts that need service making it impossible to make a decent salary."
bad,"I was not happy with my time at Prudential. I was promised many different things that I would have available to me on my first day when I started. Leads, different programs I was going to be included in, all the different events they throw for producers to get business. It all sounded great when I started it took 3.5 weeks for me to able to sign in their portal in order to be able to work and in the course of a year I was never included in a majority of the programs they promised me. Management is lacking basic knowledge in insurance and is a compliance nightmare. If your going to work in the Tampa office make sure your E&O is up to date and purchase a second individual policy because you will most likely need it."
bad,this company bred a culture of poor customer service. They allowed representatives to be poorly trained and give out incorrect information to customers which is very misleading. They did not believe that training and development was as important as taking phone calls and the management did a lot of underhanded things to mislead customers as well
bad,long days inti nights ... learned alot about real estate .... managment was the pits . co workers only out for themself .... hardest part of the job was being the office coordinator and ceo assistant and recieving very lil compensation
bad,Never willing to promote without having to post for a position.  Will often go through a vague interview process and then 'eliminate the position'.  Not a place to advance a career.
bad,"Estrutura da Prudential como seguradora e empresa Fantástica! "
bad,"Needs more professional supervisors, and also better sites to secure and more money.. They could provide more training and better opportunities for their employees."
bad,"The management was the worst I’ve experienced working with. There was never any true leadership, and this created many communication problems among coworkers. This in turn created a negative work environment."
bad,"I performed my job well for 8 years. My job was eliminated in September of 2017.  My immediate manager was incompetent.  He provided no constructive feedback and did not care about his employees.  He was not, and never will be a leader."
bad,"working in Newark makes it hard.  Management lacking.  Not a good environment.  No room for advancement, dead atmosphere and not a great learning environment."
bad,Excessive micro-management without driven primary action results. Company's side of retirement business is outdatd and led to several consolidations in a span of a single fiscal year.
bad,If you are working less than 10 hours per day you are considered a slacker. I was not paid for hundreds of hours. This was not acknowledged or appreciated. It was expected.
bad,"Would not recommend this company to anyone.  If you are a broker know their systems are outdated, processes are poor and account managers are not on par with industry peers.  They are management heavy and generally not worthy of trust.  Multiple lay-offs to satisfy the growth/profitability of the mother ship."
bad,"Worked in a customer service/contact center role.  Management was definitely the worst part - very inconsistent, unprepared, uninformed as to procedure... difficult to describe tactfully, but overall not a very inspiring, likable or well put-together bunch - however, the values of the company did not comport with my own, either.  Claim managers were not motivated which led to them not managing time well, having poor attention to detail and often refusing to speak with their claimants... which left a lot of (to me) inexcusable situations that CSRs are then expected to smooth over with the claimant.  The job was characterized by constant frustration, sad stories and angry claimants.  Only two positives: 1. a few individuals (mostly CSRs but also a DCM or two... no managers) were down-right impressive at their jobs, and 2. I was able to learn so much from how unsatisfied I felt while working there.  I have a new job now and it's more related to my degree, pays more money, and I am still surprised by how happy I am while at work.  This job may suit some, but overall, based on my experience, observations, and treatment while working there, I would not recommend working with Prudential."
bad,"My org was constantly reorganizing and the change mgmt  around those reorganization was terrible.  This created a culture of fear and imbalance.  There were a lot of folks who were there for long stints... it seems they got used to that, but I never felt settled and I know plenty of folks who were in the same boat as me"
bad,"Not many opportunities for advancement and antiquated technology. Poor management decisions. Good benefits, good work life balance. Not attractive to the younger working generation"
bad,Totally institutionalised with most staff having been there since day dot. Permanent staff are treated better than anywhere I've worked but contractors are not. The day rate is higher due to their location but they expect their 'pound of flesh' and almost apply bully like tactics to contractors which is really unpleasant! Plus due to the outsourcing of most activities there is an uneasy tension between those still with the company and those that moved to the outsource partner which is difficult if working with both.
bad,"I have joined Prudential 3 months back as java developer. The management do not have any idea about proper execution of the project. They are hiring managers unnecessarily. The developers do not find anything new to learn. If you are an experienced developer, please look somewhere else."
bad,"not a good job, it's commission only, not happy at all with the job it is not fun or ok. work 24/7 for a minimal amount of pay. After two years have to pay for desk. $300 a month"
bad,"My duties were to schedule  appointments, fax manage system of   filing  company record, cope,receive and  make phone calls  as well as schedule special events"
bad,"pay was bad no real knowledge of work sites no real supervision, never had a paid off day, they will not keep security vehicles up to date on maintenance."
bad,"Chế độ lương khá tuyệt, chế độ đãi ngộ khác dành cho nhân viên là chưa tốt"
bad,"Prudential has been trying for years to break out of the life insurance sales stigma; however, as hard as they try promoting investments to agents to sell, there is virtually no visibility in the investment market place.  "
bad,"A very hostile environment, if you aren't in to ""sucking up"" to the management you won't get far. "
bad,"Have worked here for 6.5 years in two different departments. I used to love coming to work but unfortunately I have seen a change for the worse over the past few years. "
bad,"Be aware that recruiters won't outline all the risks and hardships you'll face here, they will highlight an ""unlimited earning potential"", but forget to mention that over 95% of advisors leave the company within 1st year"
bad,"Culture is constant change and emphasis is always on control and compliance, as opposed to sales support and ease of doing business. We were working in an environment of change, where the changes repeatedly made it more difficult to write business.  The goals ,however,never changed, but the commissions were lowered."
bad,Typical corporate job. Could be stressful at times but was a lot of fun sometimes. Benefits were excellent. Many opportunities for advancement.
bad,"Worked as an Agent, the corporate side is less toxic towards employees"
bad,"I worked for the company for Over four years. They have a ""4 occurrence rule"" that if you call off four times in a rolling year you r terminated. Even in snow blizzards (actually got stuck in a ditch one morning), Illness or anything. Dr. excuses aren't even accepted. Quality is to be 99.7% or u get fired. It is borderline bullying the way mangers treat employees. It is all negative reinforcement and threats of being fired..  I would never recommend this company as an employer."
bad,Took two weeks to get a uniform that was so dirty my neck broke out jacket to little was promised it would be swapped and the schedule I was given was not honored by employers
bad,"high stress, lots of OTs, low salary. but it depends on working nature"
bad,prudential was an ok place to work. the work life balance was ok. management was ok. the job was misleading and not what they advertised it to be. it was ok.
bad,typical insurance company that is conservative in nature and is slow in its evolution. Has more focus on the business and hopefully can establish a more strategic and systematic vision
bad,This job was as a financial services associate.  Although at its heart the sale of life insurance was the only thing that was important to the executives at the branch.
bad,It was a job i took care of my apartment had food wasnt without i started in May pretty ok til supervisor was being petty towards the guards working at prudential was an ok cool adventure overall
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working there. You eat what you get, recommended only for retirees or people who have a good financial cushion. Very stressful. You work a lot but you are not being paid"
bad,I wouldn't recommend no one to work for this company they are very unprofessional and the managers and very disrespectful if you worked a 12 hour shift and your replacement doesn't come they force you to stay.
bad,"It is unfortunate on my part that I don't wish to be in the business of Insurance as all through out my career, I have been associated with Banking, Finance & Accounts jobs"
bad,"I am currently looking for a job to develop and grow more than my current position. I do not have a flexible work/life balance and would like this to improve. The team is great, and the people are supportive."
bad,"great training program, great benefits and wonderful people to work with"
bad,"its a learning school. Everyday learn new, team environmentent"
bad,"- Prospecting new clients, cold calling, warm calling, business canvassing"
bad,Regional support was non existent. The recruiting expectations were unrealistic and the immense amount of reporting and paperwork was a detriment to recruiting efforts.
bad,"Well since I've been working for prudential. I have not got all my pay, my check was missing hours, I was told that I would have paid training and never received it. I was also told that I would be getting a raise at my current site and didn't."
bad,"I worked as a regular security Officer at a mall site and they pay rate stayed at 10, you never can get a pay raise (if you stay as security Officer). My supervisors were mean and sexist towards the women and there was no real structure as a company."
bad,"You had to provide all your own supplies.  Pens, stapler, vehicle, and so on.  One must work strictly off commission.  If you don't make a sale during a pay period, you do not get paid.  In fact, you actually lose money since they cover your healthcare.  When you finally make a sale, the healthcare gets deducted from your pay first.  I couldn't handle the instability.  Worrying about how I will pay my bills became an ongoing factor in my decision to leave."
bad,This firm is no longer in business here in the Lynchburg area. I competed with the primary broker and received little training.  It was a good place to see about various firms in the area.
bad,Communication with manager was poor no direct location changeing places daily very rude & unprofessional. No help fro management very stressful I wouldn't recommend.
bad,no comment The manager there was very nice. but some of the staff I am not sure about. The Realtors were as friendly as they possibly could be.
bad,"No room for mistakes. Too many, and they reprimand you. Reprimanding is not done in a good fashion"
bad,If you are new to financial sales do not go to work here if you are in a remote office. You will fail!!! If you live in a city where they have a central office I would consider them.
bad,"After coming onboard the work environment not like what I expected.  Training course was fine, but attitude of trainer was not as should be especially for the level of professionalism of the class."
bad,They want you to absorb the cost of doing business then withhold your commission to be paid out over time. No auto reimbursement no cell phone reimbursement. 5 years into my career they closed our office and required me to open my own at my own expense plus pay for the phones and yet I was still considered an employee not contact labor preventing me from selling other products from other companies
bad,It keep me busy for the day. It is nice place. Good location. I got to use my experience and build it more. Working with the people there. One thing I did not like is that I was a temp there for over year it did not go.
bad,"Culturally encourage you to talk big while do nothing, before the senior management figure this out you're likely have already got your promotion in another business unit and become one of these senior management yourself. When politics dominated the never ending reorg, this was "
bad,"When I began working here in 2008 as a consultant, it seemed like a great company, but as time has gone by it's become less desirable to work here. (No advancement opportunities and salary increases are nonexistent)"
bad,Not longer company change to new name. Not using cultures to understand agents and customers. At the same time owners were strong in real estate skills.
bad,"No les importa la gente, ni los empleados ni los clientes. Para ingresar parece todo tan serio y perfecto y luego es una picadora descarte. En Córdoba el gerente de agencia no tiene ética ni respeta los valores de la compañía.  Tiene un serio problema con el personal femenino. No saben valorar ni retener al empleado,  es lamentable xq en el mundo es una gran empresa pero en Argentina es una de las peores para trabajar.  Sobretodo en Córdoba donde ya no quedan empleados de carrera ni con antigüedad."
bad,"Prudential is a great company, when it comes to the products it has available for customers. It is also a good company for employees who work for corporate, or have higher level positions. For agents, people who are in client relations and sales, Prudential does not provide fair compensation. "
bad,"Excessive travel, commission based job. Good place to increase your knowledge but unstable pay. Flexible schedule but long days when all the traveling is considered."
bad,"If you value work/life balance, do not work for the Annuities side of Prudential. Management is unwilling or unable to figure out how to do their jobs. And will twist any piece of feedback or suggestion into a complaint. If you are a working mother and request to see your kids at the end of the day, your considered a hysterical woman. Prudential is a fantastic company to work for but stay as far away from annuities as possible."
bad,"Management didn't know how to keep people on. Of the 50 or so people that made it past testing while I was there, only one makes enough to support her modest lifestyle. You can't support a suburban family with the way the comp is set up."
bad,"It is expected that you hound people in order to sell product even if you know that the customer may not be able to afford it.  Also the fact that there really is no direction of the company except that you sell product, no one actually aids in helping you much to get started."
bad,"Awful place to work, about 20+ middle managers all trying to justify their existence so impossible to ever get anything done. Staff are treated purely as numbers and managers don't want to get involved with customers and won't help."
bad,They will hire you with no experience and give you flexible hours but they do not pay for your gas mileage and they also don't let you pick your own clients
bad,"Pru is not a good place to work for consultants, they are given priority in any field, they are treated as slaves and outsiders "
bad,Does not integrate professional hires well.  Does not allow autonomous decision making and professional judgement.  Culture is is not inclusive and does not promote team building.  Performance management based on hearsay and lacks empirical information.  Mgt swayed by non supportable narrative input.
bad,"Incompetent management.  ""......"
bad,"Terrible training, Poor management structure. High turnover rates because nothing is set in stone ever. You cannot move up in the company as its always a secondment and unless your friends with the right people there's no support for problems."
bad,"Prudential resembles many financial services companies in that compensation for representatives is based solely on commission. Reps often feel pressure to compromise ethics to feed themselves. Morale is very low. Training is superficial. Turnover is high. Prudential does not mind seeing reps come and go. That seems to be part of their model. Nepotism was high. The managing director of the agency promoted her kin over higher producing reps. The NYC-area agency where I worked lost two of their highest performing, seasoned reps while I was there. They left because they felt undervalued and because compensation is higher elsewhere. They did not leave because of inability to compete. They were successful. Working for Prudential in other capacities might be significantly different but working there as a financial adviser was a thoroughly negative experience. Some of these features are industry-wide but they are especially pronounced at Prudential. There are some nice and very knowledgeable people there of course. The wholesalers are very competent. I would not recommend working at Prudential. If you are resolved to work as a producer in financial services and/or insurance you can do much better. "
bad,lack of book of business friendships and salary did not feel it
bad,"A maior parte do tempo estou na casa de clientes, fazendo o estudo e apresentando soluções financeiras para a família."
bad,- A typical day at work was rushing to complete tasks that came in sporatically and required immediate attention which involved constant interruptions.
bad,Firm had many regulatory problems as a result of deceit about products.
bad,"Flexibilidade de horários, remuneração acima da média, reconhecimento por resultados, intensa rotina de vendas, alto índice de turnover."
bad,Poor management and survives by pushing hard for you to do more work than is possible. I have seen multiple people crying due to the pressure caused by the workload. Team managers delicate a lot of their work to people who don't have time to do it and have no idea what is actually happening in their own team
bad,poor training and leads that result in poor results. training has poor focus on details rather than success.  management is more concerned with hitting numbers that ensuring success.
bad,"Bons produtos, ótimo capital humano."
bad,"When I first started working here it was a great company. With the new leadership, not so much. The employees and leadership have become very cut throat and toxic. The VPs don’t know how to lead and leave it to incompetent supervisors with poor communication skills. There’s no room for advancement and they lie and promote for the wrong reasons. If you’re going to work there, make sure you do your homework on your future boss and ask around about them with people that worked for them."
bad,"Prudential is a great company to work for. As a agent I was 100% commission.  I needed a certain base to grantee certain bills, mortgage. As a result I looked for a salary position."
bad,"No work life balance Days are 16 hour long, management is not for the employees. not a place to work if you want to stay married and see your kids. All commission."
bad,If you are in the call centre and your face doesn't fit or you are young good luck because the managers give you nothing but grief. Very rude managers in the place. Taking constant calls from people in wrong departments being passed from pillar to post. No chance of first call resolution and getting calls from abusive financial advisers. Half the time they didn't even know what they were doing.
bad,"If you get with a good group of people, your experience could be better but they make a lot of promises that you will never see happen once you're on board"
bad,"took DEATH Claims calls all day "
bad,"Prudential uses mass hiring to fill the customer base with their friends and families.  The target is 500 people.  These new contract employees go day and night self-funding their studying for required licenses, mandatory cold-calling, city-wide traveling for appointments that are made.  In the end, the process is upsell, upsell, upsell.  And the concerns of client are after the company.  They say you make your own schedule and you'll never miss a family function.  But the reality is that you might take an hour here or there but you'll be at work 11-12 hours a day 6 or 7 days  a week."
bad,"This place doesn't pay you until you bring them in with 150 thousand dollars in premium revenue. Talk about a bait and switch. They promised me all this ""training"" and ""advancement opportunity"" and when I walked in the door they handed me a pencil, a pad of paper and said ""good luck"". Yea, thanks!"
bad,"Prudential is a great place to work as long as you are working in a department that values your opinion, expertise and knowledge.They value work life balance but there is little room for advancement."
bad,"Prudential offers a platform that allows an individual to potentially make a reasonable commission.  The problem is that it is up to the individual rep to obtain clients, so there is no source of income to sustain someone that is new and learning the business.  If you already have a source of income and this job is to fill the time, then you will do well."
bad,"I currently work as part of a wonderful team and have done for the past 17 years. Due to the reduction in work, my department is reducing employees and I requested redundancy, which was accepted. I opted for redundancy as I would like to increase my working hours to full time, I currently work 25 hours per week, and I also want to expand my knowledge and challenge myself further. I currently administer a DB Pension scheme and also am cross skilled in a further pension product. This involves calculating quotations of current and projected benefits for both policyholders and Financial Advisors and providing requested information, sometimes complex in content. Hardest part of the job is the complex calculations which are sometimes required. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of successfully producing the quotation based on the most complex calculations!"
bad,The hardest part of the job was working under managers that definitely needed management training.  It felt like I was Training my supervisor and they kept changing every year.
bad,"The nature and culture of Prudential Ins Co. when I was there was racist.  When they couldn't understand why the moral of the employees was so down they hired an outside consultant.  Upon being given the results of the survey was not pleased.  As they began researching and interviewing the staff members they stood with intimidation to make people not admit the truth of what they felt.  I told the truth.  They asked and I answered honestly.  For that I was given a conference by my manager, director and VP in their offices and different time being told the same thing....We are applying the glass ceiling to you.  You will not have any other position in this company."
bad,"Workplace I made up of 50% workforce is subcontractor. After the demerger expect a significant reduction in resource. "
bad,Would not recommend doing this job if you do not want to call all of your family and friends to bring their assets under management for your manager to then split the generated revenue gained off of them with you
bad,I wouldn't recommend working at Prudential but everyone is different and some people may enjoy the high stress levels.  It also depends on what department you're in.
bad,"Despite the mission to help pensioners obtain their pensions, working for this company is just like any other customer service place. Unless you are a favorite of the manager you will be treated disrespectfully. There is no room for growth. Deadlines are unreasonable and there is retaliation if you stand up for yourself. Don't count on management, HR or anyone within the company to change. If you are looking for a place to gain customer service skills to move on, then this is your place. You will communicate a lot. Employees have childish behaviors and they are not corrected. Do yourself a favor and continue to look for a position that is better fit for you."
bad,i worked at prudential financial in 2011 for a full commission job. there was a lot of turnover and it seemed like people didn't have much loyalty to the organization.
bad,"A huge amount of change in Prudential at the moment, with mergers, demergers and transformations. With this amount of change you'd expect some form of clear communication - but there isn't any."
bad,Good people to work with but management will not help you with advancement whatsoever. People at Prudential have been there for way too long and get complacent.
bad,As with every firm I've been in. The culture is cutthroat and pays little care to long term development. It's about what you can bring to the table right from the start and generate PruProduct sales.
bad,"Terrible management that shows no support for new employees. Set benchmarks that less than a quarter of the sales staff can hit. Expect you to sell immediately after receiving licenses, without any product knowledge."
bad,They have flexible hours and opportunity to work from home. I have very understanding managers that knew family comes first. It is the main reason I have stayed with the company.
bad,"Office environment is uptight, and coworkers are clique-y. Sometimes, free lunch is provided! "
bad,"The recruiting process is overwhelmingly geared towards inexperienced hires and career changers.  As such, there is not much resource available for experienced hires to continue to sharpen their saw.  I was sold on the promise of being positioned as a joint work partner for less experienced hires, but the bar kept being moved and I was thus never positioned in that role."
bad,"Told fibs. Not supported. Used to fill a quota. was told there was 10,000 orphans to call on and was only given 36 names in 7 months of working there."
bad,"Was promised a lot but instead they made pay for all my licenses, the only job that I ever lost money instead of make money.  The job has potential for the right person, but few succeed."
bad,The hardest part of the job is putting in over 50 hours a week and not getting a paycheck.  Commission roles are not for me.  Training is much to be desired.
bad,"Excessive focus on collecting ""educational"" hours.  In some cases it's productive but the limited time available to complete assignments/projects was often impacted by frequent redundant meetings hosted by insecure executives."
bad,Overall working experience with them has been stressful. Management is poor with a lack of employee support. Not having a home office here in Cleveland always makes it hard to get questions answered and who a manger really is
bad,"根據上司指示工作,因為上司是內地人,所以溝通不是太好。與離職秘書交接不夠時間,需要學習的事情不夠全面。"
bad,"Very difficult position.  Calling and calling people to try and make appointments to sell them insurance and investment products.  Very long days, and lots of driving."
bad,Work directly with client on company level for self insured groups designing the benefits surrounding their health insurance plans for their employees.
bad,"Corporate culture best described in book ""Serpent on the Rocks."" They talked compliance, but encouraged us to mislead customers at sales hype meetings."
bad,"Job work/Life Balance is good here. ""Every man for himself"" is the attitude at Prudential. Management will not stand up for their employees. Compensation is Ok."
bad,"PRUDENTIAL: Not for the faint hearted, no leads, not much training, hiring lots of people and few stays, about 90% turnover, only for people who are ok with hustling, knocking on doors, etc"
bad,"The truth is, this is a great company... on paper. Like most jobs, the first 6 months are amazing and you quickly realize that people are both friendly and willing to work with you. However, accountability and communication is a major pain point for the organization and you should expect to take on the weight of several job functions. Further, the company has no problem letting 100+ employees go on any given day.. Teams operate in silos, communication is never clear and management tends to gloss over things.. a lot! Overall, it is a good company to get your career started in but if you want to earn money, get promoted, and be challenged (not frustrated) this is not the kind of place you stay long term.."
bad,Was not there long enough to provide enough details on typical day on job. Was only there for a few months. I only received my licenses and left afterwards.
bad,I learned to process insurance applications based on eligibility requirements at the time under Prudential.  Because of my quality results and great attention to detail I was then promoted to quality reviewer and reviewed the work produced by the Enrollment Processors
bad,"Many promises made about making money but the products did not keep up with the competitors. As a captive agent, you were told this is ""your business.' But in reality, one could not sell another companies' products and the commissions were very low."
bad,worked through a temp agency never hired on as a regular employee
bad,"This is a good stable company to work for with more than 135 years of experience in the industry. For a minority it is difficult to get an equal pay and candid feedback. Very limited potentilal in growing this with company more than 1-3 years."
bad,"-Typical Day: Reporting Deadlines, Client relationships, participant inquiries, meetings, implementation, Auditing."
bad,In this type of business the Internet is taking away all possibilities of gaining new clients. My direct manager was great but limited on what he is able to do. Very heavy rotation of employees.
bad,"I've learned a great deal in the last `13.5 years at Prudential. I've had the opportunity work with some wonderful people and although the hours can be long at times, I appreciated the flexibility the company has adopted over the last few years."
bad,"First of all the recruiter lied to me about several things, one being there was not going to be a charge for my desk, and another being they provided you with free leads. Yeah they give you free leads they just failed to tell you it's from a list they bought several years ago. The head of the agency is unapproachable and to be honest is not on an educational par with the employees. "
bad,Management is very incompetent and they are also outsourcing A LOT of jobs. The culture there is a joke and you have to suck up to the bosses to get any sort of advancement opportunities.
bad,"Hired as the hatchet person to let go of US workforce and replace with less inexpensive resources abroad. That wasn’t discussed in the interview . They pay well, but work the heck out of you"
bad,team members and manager were great to work with however no clear defined processes in place and outdated systems were used. office building was also outdated. close by amenities
bad,"You work 37.5 hrs a wk,  no overtime. No paid time off for the first year. Stressful work environment & compensated very little. Most people start as a temp or hired through W.O.T.C. program if your lucky might get hired after 1 year. They mostly hire former military or military spouses. There largest client is the U.S. Military contract. They pay to avoid bad press as so avoid ever losing that contract."
bad,"You make it what you want it to be. If you're driven, you'll like this job. You can make a career out of it. It's best if you have a network of family and friends who can help launch your career."
bad,not enough pay. highers through outside source and only keeps a few. Its a typical call center. The people were nice and most clients were also. I am just going away from call centers
bad,"They have a great pitch and their recruiting should be given credit for that.  My immediate manager was great.  The goal, however, is to get as many friends and family before you will ever receive a paycheck"
bad,The coworkers were very great to work with. Management not high up on my list of favorites. The compensation was also pretty respectable but once again the micromanagement was pretty over the top...
bad,"Commission only work in 1995 for a young 27 year old father was not realistic starting out at all!  A base salary with benefits would have allowed myself (a very high quality people person) to continue building a career and ""book of business"" for the company had they done more to train and retain the high quality people they hired into my Sales class.  Among 5 new agents, only 1 young guy living at home still with parents was able to survive beyond 6 months.  Shortly after I left the agency did they restructure management and offer base and benefits. Nice timing jerks!"
bad,"In fairness the compnay was going through a transition with management.  (1998-2000).  The transition was not a smooth one for many of the employees."
bad,People who have been there for many years are counting the days until they retire. It probably depends on which department you work in as far as having job satisfaction.
bad,"Rampant with nepotism, ol' boys club. Advancement is very tough if you are not close to the managers. Hard to get recognized on merit. Not diverse in culture and very slow to adapt to and retain new and younger employees. Managers blatantly favor and promote their buddies or relatives without any reproach. Little to no regard for years of experience, personal development or the work quality produced. There is no accountability or adequate oversight given to departmental managers."
bad,"This company no longer exists so I can not recommend it to anyone as they no longer are in business."
bad,"A good place for people who are not social and don't mind working 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. They put you in exempt roles and expects you to work nights and weekends with no COMP time."
bad,People are very kind and generous. Friendly to all employees and very polite to places of being located. Needs improvement on pay rates. Good training and trainees with positive attitudes towards their careers.
bad,"Not a very diverse work environment. If you're different this will be a very uncomfortable place to work. Paid less than my colleagues. Undervalued in every sense of the word. Great pay for a call center environment however! Keep track of your own sales leads because they will give someone else the credit. "
bad,Not a lot of training and no help when you needed it. Not very friendly and made the atmosphere uncomfortable. Happy the job was temporary
bad,"You don’t get paid until you complete a 26 week cdp program that you have to pay for which costs $1500, in those 26 weeks you have to get the L&H, series 6, and series 63 exam. The managers rush you through it weather you have the money or not. Poor organization as each man explains the rules different."
bad,"Company has strong product line, however compensation for FPA position is strictly commission with some startup money given to you in first 6 months, but after 5 quarters you start being required to pay core costs, which are basically rent, equalling $500 a month, no base salary, no compensation for mileage (I did roughly 30k miles a year the last 2 years).  At first, management does supply free ""leads"" which are existing life insurance clients that have no agent, but theyve been called a ridiculous number of times in the past due to high turnover, and have heard it all before.  The idea is that you go and provide service with the potential to cross sell other lines of business.  Apart from this, the company does not provide much in the way of teaching effective methods of marketing and prospecting, more than likely due to the fact that theyve been playing the law of large numbers right back at the hiring process, they bring you in, get you to sell to your friends and family, you have moderate success/failure, and you move on."
bad,Go here if you are desperate and looking for something to get in the industry. Management is one of the reasons many people willingly left from this company.
bad,"You do all your own marketing - like all the financial industry. commission is relatively low, They do have a great retirement program. Limited product offerings and support."
bad,"A typical telemarketing job which appeared flexible in the beginning but went on more pressuring to get more clients for them. After working for a while, until i got a full-time or other part-time job that is related to my field of study, i knew insurance was not the the right field for me right now."
bad,Decisions require management approval.  Projects linger because approvals take forever. Very frustrating atmosphere.  No recognition for employees who go the extra mile.
bad,Solving business issues is just a front.           The real way to succeed at this company is to make political friends with the powerful and popular.
bad,"I wish to not comment on my experience here. The pay was good but I did not believe in the products or the sales practices"
bad,not really a place of consistent development. they throw you under the bus right away and don't really develop you in a lead by example manner. Products weren't as competitive as well
bad,Great benefits and perks when you begin.  Staff if supportive and partner well within their division.  Opportunities to advance past entry level are minimal.
bad,"The best part of working for Prudential was the ability to have a work life balance. The worst part of working for this company was their Management... pretty much non existent along with their Training. You are on your own and if you ask anyone for their help, you better believe they will want part of your commission. This is a commission based position only. Prudential definitely lacks culture as well as office spirit."
bad,Awesome co-workers.  Management sucks. I wouldn't recommend and pay is low.  Excellent mentorship and ethics program. I would not recommend.
bad,You take calls from client's and financial institutions answering their questions about our annuity products and our website. I learned a lot about retirement accounts. I do feel that once you are in the call center though it's very hard to progress to another position. The demand of employees being on the phone is very high so the opportunity to participate or do other things does not happen very often.  
bad,"No staff are valued. Training was brief and not suitable for the post. Too much expected of new employees too quickly, very little help from 'coaches'. Worst part was that it's very cliquey, if your face doesn't fit, you've no chance."
bad,It was ok working there. They had a contract with the steel plant and I worked as one of their shuttle drivers. We were constantly forced over because people always called off and there were never enough drivers. They didn't mind giving you the hours if you wanted to work. The vehicles were just poorly kept.
bad,Prudential is a great company and I would not have left if the position was not eliminated. The asset management business I supported as an attorney was very focused on the needs of its investor clients.
bad,"The company as a whole is good. Could be a great opportunity if you land in the right office, at the right time, with the right manager, and managing director."
bad,"If you get rating of 3 or above in your annual review, then you have a carrier here."
bad,"Prudential is a good company, that offers a work life balance which is worth more than more money.   But, I had a terrible manager who made it his business to publicly embarass me at meetings and then went behind my back to senior management to discredit my ideas.  It made a good company impossible for me to stay at."
bad,"It was not what I was expecting. I got the feeling they just hire people as fast as they can to increase production. Its just a numbers game. Support was not there, my sales manager knew next to nothing and was only able to advance my knowledge to a negligible degree. The official training was more or less useless to me in the day to day."
bad,if you have nothing good to say  then you should not say anything
bad,Commission based pay with no help getting started. Was lost on how to find clients and build a book of business they only cared about adding more people to replace the ones who couldnt do it.
bad,Most confusing job I have ever had. No management structure to help Advisers manage money and run a practice. Did not have the proper tools to help customers. I was on my own.
bad,"A lot of work, and not a lot of support. A typical day starts with a morning meeting, then on mondays you always check in with you manager That is typically the only time you get alone time with him or her all week to discuss things."
bad,"Commission only setup is a no win situation.  Company gave little or no financial support after 1 1/2 years.  Took no financial responsibility at all.  Agents would have to pay for everything. (Desk rental, licensing, EO insurances...etc).  Numbers don't lie....only 1-2 agents out of 10 reach 2-3 years.  Brutal culture."
bad,"Cold calling with a purpose. Over saturated client basis. Forced client-advisor interaction to ""re-connect"" with exisiting clients of Prudential. Wish all the best!"
bad,A typical day at work consists of getting as many contracts as possible processed
bad,***This Company Outsource JOBS so beware of what you are getting into**
bad,Sales team was easy to work with.
bad,Working at Prudential was a good stepping sone into the workforce. It lacked potential growth but created career skills that helped me advance my career.
bad,job was not for me. Selling insurance was not what I wanted to do. I like working with numbers and helping guide others on how we can make improvements to grow the business
bad,"Workplace culture is aggressive with poor HR practices. "
bad,"Overall I really enjoyed the management and trainers at Prudential. The product itself, insurance and financial services, was very difficult to sale in this economy and in my geographic area. I was not cut out for insurance sales!"
bad,Working at Prudential was a stepping stone in order to move my career back into an office environment. Additionally I was able to receive my series 6 & 63 licenses.
bad,"This was at a time when a young 19 year old girl was not welcome in a man's world.  It was a tough job, competing with men, most of them in their 40-50's with families. It was a cut-throat environment.  I managed to be Sales Agent of the Month for 10 consecutive months, but the ruthlessness and hatred I had to deal with from all the male agents made it not worth sticking around for, I moved on to bigger and better."
bad,"The security team here has no morale, the supervisor is uninterested and uninvolved, and there are a lot of call-outs and no-shows. This is definitely a stop=gap measure place to work, if you can get any hours at all."
bad,Prudential is a great place to work. Friendly environment and strong work ethic. Everyone is focused and talented.I would any given day go back to Prudential.
bad,unless you are someone's relative or part of the FLDP rotation you will not get a promotion. It is particularly difficult to adjust to this company if you had previously worked in a small corporation.
bad,"Helping the CEO with daily tasks, such as filing, data entry and secretarial services. "
bad,"Drive sales, but not competitive with products and little negotiation room"
bad,"Was a laid back office, very easy to work with everyone.  Was a temporary job with no advancement."
bad,"Prudential closed offices in Merced, CA. I left being there was no office to servivce the area."
bad,Iworked there for a brief time as the brokerage industry back then.. The basic objective was to cold canvas by phone as we were given a printout sheet of previous customers
bad,Prudential is an insurance company  trying to be a full-service financial services company without the requisite infrastructure and management experience.
bad,I worked there for 32 years and had many different jobs. The people are great and there is a wide variety of jobs there. Too much work is transitioning overseas.
bad,poor pay plan. company does not pay renewals. needs to stream line their hiring process.. But it does seem to be the overall theme of the insurance industry
good,My time at Prudential was as a team leader for the Life New Business team.  I would do quality review as well as the assignment of the work that came into the team.
good,Workplace culture and leadership changes has impacted team morale and outcomes.  Most enjoyable part of my job is the team and the people that I have gotten to know through the years I have been here.
good,"Started out good but suffered after the market crash in 2008; was bought out and never really took off enough to support all of the agents, a small few on top."
good,Prudential as a company is a good company and you have to find your own leads to be succesful. The management in the Cleveland office is awful and that is one of the reasons that turnover is so high
good,"You basically become a servicing agent for old life insurance policies.  This would be ok, if you didn't work on commission only.  Not a lot of opportunity to make any money."
good,"I had to leave once my son was born and he became a priority. It was a lot of work and I enjoyed it."
good,"If you are a Marketing Assistant you don't work for Prudential, you work for an agent that does work for Prudential.  This way Prudential gets away with not having to pay for your benefits.  It's despicable to work for an insurance company and not receive insurance.  How ironic!"
good,Provide monies and living expenses to workers located all around the world that were delivering telecommunication services to people located in often times third world countries.
good,"This portion of Prudential was sold off in 2012. When it was with Prudential, the relocation managers were under compensated and over worked managing caseloads of up to 200 at any given time when the preferable amount was 50 +/- 10 cases."
good,fast paced and very interesting job. great people at time but employees was so unprofessional and supv was friends with some employees
good,"I do not recommend."
good,Prudential is doing all they can to be competitive in today's technology-driven market but they're doing it at the cost of their talent. Expectations are too high and mid-level management is poor. They are constantly trying new things but don't give enough time to see if anything actually works before dumping the idea (and all the people who were trying to make it happen) and moving on to the next idea.
good,Prudential wasn't a professional company I decided to stay with them for a year because of the experience I gained the management was bad and it was lack or communication.
good,"Long days on the phones, middle management was lacking in  experience, co workers were professional, difficulties in generating leads to call people. Helping people reach their financial goals."
good,Each department is different so your experience will be different. I've worked in two different areas and they were drastically different
good,"OK Company to work for:"
good,Typical day had to work on my own to generate business.  Learned rules and regulations pertaining to contracts which was very positive.
good,"- Pru used to be fantastic - new CCO took the company apart; laid off many great but costly people to save money / look good"
good,I only worked there for a week as it was work experience. I would recommend it for people who want to do work experience. but i'm not really sure how it is now cause I worked there years back.
good,It is a position with potential if you are just entering the workforce and no family obligations. I learned to push myself to make a sale. I recognize that long hours can help but you need some connections (a decent customer base).
good,This company requires you to be able to start your own business from scratch. They provide you with the resources but you must create a structure on your own to succeed. It is a SALES position and SALES come first.
good,"I was successful at my job for six years, but the stress took a toll and it was affecting my family. I had to make a difficult decision to walk away. Inconsistent income was hard to deal with."
good,Great place to start as you will typically be well trained. My work environment was a little stringent as we were not allowed to work remotely but those rules changed allowing us more flexibility.
good,"Although this is a large company with a well known image (The Rock of Gibralter) it may appear solid but just like the actual ""Rock"" at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean  through the ""Walls of Hercules"", there is a large group of Barbary Apes who seem to always be up to not-so-solid antics that can be more un-professional then vica versa leaving agents feeling a bit diluted."
good,"Ok place to work poor atmosphere"
good,Good if you have lots of contacts and big book of business. Very hard your first year. Very focused on life insurance sales so you need lots of contacts and referrals.
good,"Working at Prudential is good but not great. I come in and the office is full of empty cubicles. There is no team effort. I feel like I am working alone with not a lot of support from my manager. I would like more mentorship, and guidance. I do not see growth in this position. The office is not usually filled with a lot of people like I'm used to at other offices, and that can make the office environment lonely. This does not motivate me to want to come into work. As for the work culture, there really isn't one as the office is pretty empty like I mentioned. My favorite part about the job is that it is very flexible, and it's allowing me to get my foot in the door with recruiting. The hardest part of my job is finding the right talent because no one wants to be in this field anymore."
good,"empresa multinacional"
good,"Most of the information they give you is geared towards their products. There are red tapes all over the business, especially marketing."
good,"You need to have money or a lot of friends with money.  This position is not for someone starting out in the industry.  A competent mentor will make a huge difference.  You need someone to show you the ""ropes"" on penetrating different markets and establishing yourself as a professional in those markets.  Furthermore, you need to be able to eat and pay your bills while you build your practice."
good,"I was hire through a Temp agency and we were treated as the cannon fodder expected to soak up all the extra work the regulars did not want to take on and work 45hr weeks minimum on the phones. On top of that, the company's antiquated practices often upset customers, which of course made our jobs harder. There were also several rate increases which prompted nothing but waves of angry calls, often not because people wanted anything other than someone to yell at."
good,"Empresa com excelente portfólio de produtos."
good,"Handle call volume for both Spanish and English Customers "
good,"Por se tratar de venda personalizada e atendimento domiciliar, o custo deste trabalho é elevado e o desgaste de um dia de trabalho é mensurável. Embora não fosse nada fácil de executar o trabalho era agradável pelo fato de proporcionar-me a possibilidade de conhecer pessoas e apresentar-lhes um produto que realmente poderia fazer diferença na vida delas."
good,"Formally Bache and Co.taken over by insurance which didn't understand the different culture. Many bad decisions from personnl to investment products,"
good,"arrive at work begin prospecting, cold calling,following up"
good,very stressful
good,"Typical work day requires standard 40 hour work week, followed by after hours support and 7X24 on call status.  Management has little respect for employees during off hours."
good,They don’t care about there temp reps at all they treat you as space fillers because the permanent staff works from home. You won’t have hardly no work because you to be trained on the systems and since it’s poorly managed there was no one around to much to train so my work load was extremely light .
good,"Very insurance focused, and much of your success depends on your training as well as your manager. Paperwork and the compliance aspect are absolutely horrible and the wealth management platform is also particularly bad. You need to allocate a few hours a day to sort out paperwork issues that are inevitable. If focusing solely on annuity and life insurance sales it is a great place to work at. Insurance holders without an active advisor are able to be called on as prospects."
good,"Not an easy job.  Commission only no base salary makes it tough - must be prepared for little income for first 6 months until a book of business is built.  Basically they want you to hit up family and friends to start, and try to get referrals.  Getting direction and leads from management would be helpfu."
good,"Company work culture is relaxed. Management isnt the most helpful in terms of growth, but there are a lot of opportunities to grow/move internally. Typical work day can be a mix bag."
good,công việc tốt tinh thần làm việc của đông nghiệp tập thể cao nhưng mức lương chưa phù hợp với năng lực và thời gian nhân viên phải bỏ ra để đạt được
good,"Long nights making phone calls or driving all over to meet potential clients. The orphan list has been redistributed so many times that you end up with many disgruntled people on the other end of the line. If you are single and have low overhead and are willing to network and put in the long nights this is a great career field. But if you have a family and bills, you may want to reconsider this as a career choice."
good,"I worked for 8 stock brokers.  I one time all of the sales assistance left and I had to work for all 24 stock brokers with no additional pay.  The work culture was not very kind to the office staff, however there were a few brokers who did care about the assistance, but they were few and far between.  I would not recommend working in that environment."
good,"The position required constant moderation of your desk and claims with little to no down time in between clients, so much so individuals were constantly stressed to the point of leaving. Within the time period that I was employees at prudential no less than 20 individuals departed from the office department. "
good,"I worked two positions but paid for one......bad management!!!!"
good,"The company pushes both an entrepreneurial culture as well as a teaming culture because they can figure out which one works. Individual efforts as are mitigated by a management culture that pushes a ""golden child"" of the week mentality. The work is difficult and can be extremely rewarding, and yet totally unappreciated by management if it does not fit the buzz word du jour."
good,"The sector of the company where I was, was strictly commission. There wasn't much support. You needed to be someone who grew your business on your own."
good,"The Iselin location has multiple petty vindictive women.  If you obtain a job there it is best to stay to yourself.  Prudential employees in the Iselin location are not held to the company standards.  A large company such as Prudential should not have the unprofessional, petty, vindictive individuals employed there. But, they really do not care as long as the work is completed."
good,"Hardest part: reach target of monthly loans approval while maintain low rate of delinquency on your account. "
good,"Job Culture, Work, Life Balance depends on where you are located in Prudential.  I was recommended to come to Prudential based on the Work Life Balance but was surprised when it was not the case in our department and is subjective depending where you are placed."
good,"There is a lot of change that seems unneccesary "
good,"My time here was challenging. The hours were long. I worked steady midnight -8 and sometimes was asked to stay until 10 or later if people called off or weather was bad. At least the pay was worth the hours and the work. Unfortunately, the company sold so job security was turned upside down. Most of us were laid off after being promised that would not happen."
good,"It is like a family in the company but I should say that there are time when professionalism is not present.  The good thing is that you can approach the senior officers for any problem, be it work related or even personal matters."
good,"As the Assistant Operations Manager, I was responsible for a lot thing that the Branch Operations Manager gave me to do.   I also did the margin area of the branch.  I dealt with the Margin Department in New York City and was the go between the broker and the Operation staff in NY.  My job at time was exciting and challenging and I love it.  There were day that it was so stressful due to the conditions of the stock market.  There were also days after a down day in the stock market that I had to wheel and deal between the brokers and NY Margin Department.  Trying to get the broker an extra day when have to meet a margin call."
good,If you start as a temp there is very little chance of full time employment. A good job to pay the bills for now
good,Need to like commission based income.  Very difficult to make money if you don't have an established network.
good,A good entry level or insurance only sales job.  Obviously you can only sell Prudential insurance products.  Good for entry level planning but not a broad product line.
good,It was a fast pace environment that has opportunity for growth.
good,"Typical call center, very rigid. They tell you the call center rep job is a stepping stone to a great new career. Not so. Turnover is high, and very few are able to get out of the call center into other departments. Most quit or get fired before 2 yrs. The workday consists of logging into the phones & taking calls all day, which seems straightforward enough, except they expect perfection from you at all times, but the tools you are given to do the job are horrible. Your day is scheduled to the minute. Forget the skills/talent you had in a former life cuz now you are only as good as your stats. As a call center rep, you are just a number & easily replaced. You're also the one to get thrown under the bus for any mistakes whether you made them or not. It's easier for everyone in any department to blame ""those morons"" in the call center. You are the scapegoat. Don't bother to explain or defend yourself, you are always wrong. Even if something is clearly an issue with one of the multiple flawed systems you have to use, or something is just not clear enough to allow you to make educated decisions, you are WRONG. Period. The company claims they are one of the best for work life balance. This could be true, just not for the call center. Scheduling time off must be done weeks in advance, and you may not get the day you need anyway. Doctor appt or medical need for time off? Doesn't matter. Something unexpected comes up and you think you can arrange a shift change or adjust your hours? Not gonna happen. What if your kid gets sick? Sorry bout your luck. 4 unscheduled absences in a 12 month"
good,"Typical day started at 9:30 in a group meeting with managers and other sales reps to report your sales and commissions. Several cold calling sessions throughout the day. Tons of opportunities to get extra training on the side. Management is there is report progress and productivity and you rely a lot on your co workers for sales support. I learned a lot about sales and finances and had a great time working one on one with people. The hardest part is the amount of hours and driving you could do with no security of making money. The position is 100% commission and bonuses, no base salary."
good,"Great company, but the industry is not for me. Also, do not feel as though I am being utilized to my full abilities."
good,"When I first started there (2017), management cared the best they could with the amount of pressure they were under. Then they posted out to different departments and that is when the whole culture changed. Only one knew what he was doing and they recently let him go. The newest manager is absolutely disgusting. He doesn’t care about mental health or being an advocate for his team. he is not friendly at all.  When he does give a verbal warning or written warning, he doesn’t provide you with supporting documentation.  He doesn’t even try to help you before actually providing any citation. He gives no support whatsoever. This is what prudential feels is a great fit for their employees. He seems to enjoy disciplining his staff and seeing them break down. E"
good,Sales based commissions small salary to start. Company wanted 150-200 names and numbers for sales. Provided lists of customers that have or had life insurance policies.
good,The company holds to many company only meetings making it difficult to build your own book of business. They also constantly restructured how the leads programs would work making it hard to keep up.
good,"Daily cold calling and looking for opportunities with current customer, personal contacts, and previous employee customers. Must be independent and willing to work with others. Caution yourself regarding who mentors you and work with. Overall, if you are young and looking to create your own book of business, Prudential can give you the opportunity to move in the right direction but must be savvy on how you go about it and don't be naïve in the process."
good,There are limited resources available to field agents  Marketing materials are minimal and not readily available  Support services are paid for but no support is provided - you are responsible for all application related activities from input to delivery
good,The company as a whole was a terrific place to work but within the company are individual organizations and some of those organizations have a very boys club culture.  If you are part of that club you are safe from downsizing and get the best opportunities if you are outside of that club you are on your own.
good,"long hours, consistent traveling to clients homes and pitch product at obscured hours.  consistently calling clients to set up appointments at their homes"
good,As a Tech Writer I was involved in the production of Standard Operating Procedures.  It was fairly straightforward.  Got the job done and went on to other work.
good,"I loved my time at Prudential EXCEPT working with upper level management. The company likes to say it's a matrix organization, but it's really an old school boys club with a hierarchy and people stabbing each other in the back to get ahead. This is especially true in some of the internal offices outside the official BUs."
good,"Things changed over the years and it wasn't the old Pru"
good,"pru was just ok decent vacation time but some  50 hour weeks to. they would have us training 5 hours then expect a normal workload done the same day, up to 8 cases"
good,Their agency program is being revamped and needs a few more years before they get it perfect. I was use to the NY LIfe structure and needed more autonomy that I was offered at Prudential
good,I learned a lot about the corporate setting being my first job out of college.  As a temp I felt like my role wasn't valued that much and they promised full time employment and in reality gave it to one/two people out of 12 after about a year and a half.
good,"Helped start my career. I was previously working  in a deli  and not provided an opportunity due to my lack of ""desk experience"". Prudential gave me a chance and started my career."
good,"Pros: stable company, depending on the BU, people have long tenure"
good,"Prudential CT Realty is out of business"
good,The continuous calls were what made it more stressful but it was a fairly easy job in all.  Co-workers and managers were nice.  There is a lot of knowledge needed when taking calls.  training is a must.
good,Worked in the agency model as a sales manager. Position was good at beginning but changes to the compensation packages really affected our ability to recruit and retain advisors.
good,Internation company running with local leadership in some section of company. Great work/life balance and benefits but no advancement nor recognition.
good,"I like the company's culture, but the wage is so low.  The amount of work much less than its wage. Though the people are nice there, IT and management are poor."
good,"Typical day at the work place is very busy multitasking and trying to make sales. Learned tremendous amount about financial services, insurance, FINRA, etc. The hardest part of the job is that agents do not get any sort of salary and people do not want to work for free."
good,"Prudential helped me get licensed and that really help me jump start my career in financial services. After my program was over, I became really attractive to other employers and it was much easier finding employment."
good,Typical Office setting selling property and casualty insurance policies.  Management was lacking and direction of office was blurry at best.  Nice people to work with but satisfied with the status quo.
good,Casual easy going place to work.  You worked independently.  Workplace was corporate.  The people were very enjoyable to work with; the hardest part of the job was moving forward with responsibility.
good,Tuy nhiên vì thiếu kinh nghiệm nên không gắn bó lâu với doanh nghiệp
good,"Great place to work if you have lots of friends with millions to invest.  Otherwise, you burn the phones calling people who have been called endlessly and do not want to talk with you (or anyone else, for that matter) about their life insurance/investment portfolio.  Make no mistake, life insurance is pushed hard, even when you have a series 7 and 66 and can sell investments.  Compliance just doesn't permit much action in the investment arena."
good,Tôi buồn vì năng lực kém và không nhẫn nại chờ kết quả
good,Pru was a great organization to start with. It's very hard to make a living though because it is 100% commission. Tons of cold calling and very little pay.
good,"Great Salary coming in, but poor raises. Tough to move up and very bad management. Tons of red tape in this company. It's a good place to jump so that you can jump again."
good,"This company holds high expectation. The challenge is to learn and exceed expectations. Managers drive very hard for productivity and sometimes forget what dealing with the customer needs may be, It's no a one size fit all."
good,"Nice enough place,many good people, but not something I wanted to remain involved with. After a period of time,I decided to return to the Financial Services field."
good,"Meetings and reviews about what to do and what not to do to be a good agent."
good,Great place if you want to sell Prudential life insurance etc. Typical day is making lots of phone calls and trying to get an appointment to sell life insurance or investments
good,They start you out like any normal person but within months you  are given more work as the person doing that work is moved to another department in india and you are soon doing the work of 3 people or trying to.
good,"Management tends to stretch the truth and often omit important information when interviewing for open positions. Hardest part of job is maintaining steady flow of prospects across all lines of business. Company expects you to exhaust all friends and family from prospect list before extending additional leads. Those additional leads are 99% recycled current clients with whom you are supposed to only call for servicing of their existing accounts. If it happens that additional opportunity arises during service work you can then attempt to solicit it, but you cannot call on the client for new business until a new relationship has been established. Company does not allow any use of social media to communicate with prospects/clients. Makes it difficult to keep up with companies who are using it."
good,I was employed by an agent at Prudential as an assistant. I created brochures and online home listings. I also performed hardware and software diagnosis on PCs whenever it was needed. All of the work was on an as needed basis. Hours were extremely limited and the compensation was also very low. The agent I was employed by was highly demanding at times. If an image was even a few pixels too far to the right she would demand that an entire brochure would be done over again.
good,"productive , helpful management, academia culture, very low pay"
good,"Empresa focada na captação de clientes para consumo de Seguro De vida. "
good,I am responsible to maintaining and building relationships with outside brokers in my territory.  This job allows you to create your own hours and provides a lot of social interation.  The company is currently going through organizational changes and management and training has not been readily available.
good,Typical day is 8 to 5 pm. I learned how to file 1120 forms for corporation entities domestic and international taxes.
good,"A lot of cold calling, and asking favor from the people you know to set up appointments. I got licensed throughout the process. Managers are willing to help you, and there is a friendly work environment. Although, going out to see your friends to talk to them about insurance products, trying to sell them is not a pleasant experience."
good,A typical day at work is talking on the phone to potential customers all day who are applying for life insurance. So I really dig into their medical history. It takes attentive listening and fast typing.
good,"Sole, thus lead word-processing operator for 2nd shift (4:00 pm to 12:00 am)."
good,A typical day at work consisted being very busy juggling multiple tasks.
good,"Contract assignment. It was fine while i was working there, not much work was given. Poor leadership, not much growth. Communication within department lacking."
good,"Which created a chaotic and challenging work environment. The business unit has the potential of being a profitable brand just through name recognition and product offering. Overall, Prudential got duped by recruiting a poor leader who led through intimidation and threats."
good,"Maintained electronic and hard copy filling system. Provided General administrative and clerical support including mailing, scanning, faxing and copying to management open, sort and distribute incoming correspondence. Performed data entry and scan documents. Assisted in resolving any administrative problems.  Answered calls from customers regarding their inquiries."
good,"Prudential is a great company to gain experience with.  However, with regards to full career potential, it is extremely hard to try and build a sustainable book of business with the resources offered currently."
good,"Good company basic training and great start to a competitive career in sales. It’s a dog eat dog in the real world of sales, so it’s what you make of it."
good,My career at Prudential met my professional goals. Many challenges and opportunities to demonstrate your abilities as a professional. Overall a satisfactory experience.
good,"Was always a little off-put by certain management characters at the Bellevue location. I lost multiple business opportunities due to management dropping the ball as they typically work with multiple advisors at once. To be exact this is around 12k in GDR (production) on just two deals that were stalled for the bureaucratic state of these firms. "
good,"Chạy theo doanh số"
good,"_Một ngày làm việc ở công ty có biết bao áp lực doanh số đè lên mình, nỗi thất vọng khi bị mất khách hàng lại càng nhiều hơn nhưng ngược lại các anh chị đồng nghiệp ở nơi đây rất thân thiện "
good,This was a great place to start my career ladder where I was able to improve skills and knowledge and advance through different roles and opportunities.
good,"Fife-like budget competition between departments and workgroups. "
good,"Every company has an immediately noticeable idiosyncrasy - here it is the number of people who've worked there for decades and are unchallenged and coasting.  Management is otherwise very good, the majority of people are committed and they appear to enjoy their work environment."
good,"Jump now and see how high is acceptable.  Management always looking to please upwards, regardless of the human cost.  Did not enjoy the emotional cost."
good,typical financial services company. Large organisation with a high staff count. Good benefits. good working hours. progression available but slow. good people.
good,"commissions only, It was hard to find potential clients. There were times when you would not get a paycheck. Had to pay rent for my space so it would all go to that."
good,"The job and your income depend solely on your network. Prudential only cares about how they can make money out of your network."
good,Very poor work life balance. Micro management. Technology is outdated and carries a waterfall approach. Very behind on the times. Advancement is tricky.
good,Very stressful and compensation wasn't great. Worked nights and weekends. Must have a many transactions going to be successful. Management was nice but not around much.
good,"This company was not good to work for.  Some manager attitudes is that their front line staff are ""a dime a dozen"" and that the brokers should be treated like gods even though they relied on the knowledge of the staff to understand the financial presentations and assist with trades.  The quality expectations are ridiculous and does not allow the staff to be reactive and flexible.  They count the seconds of dead air and hold time and constrain staff to follow these are overly scripted call handling guides."
good,Overall the job was good...but if you are hired under a contract its not a good place to be. under contract  you are disposable. you don't  feel apart of the team. just filling a sit that can be taken at any moment.
good,Very stressful. Not having all the resources that you need to solve multiple problems on a daily basis. There are many changes to the process that was not successful to the employees.
good,"Trabalho com pressão extrema em busca de resultados quase que inatingíveis. "
good,"The job itself was not bad, and the work environment was friendly."
good,"Great benefit package. Fairly stable company. Many good people, ethical culture, undervalues institutional knowledge as a company asset. Ponderous and unfair annual review process but overall a good place to work."
good,"Work/Life Balance, the policy needs to be reinforced throughout the company. The people who support this program are the ones who like it. If your manager does not like it, then the policy does not apply"
good,"Good solid company, good benefits. Your experience is going to be based on you business unit and department. Large company but run like little companies with their own hierarchy and clicks."
good,"Leadership was always changing and the support was low. High turn over, pressure and not much balance in you life. Co workers were all nice but everyone always felt like a number."
good,"Working at Prudential Securities can be stressful at time, because your dealing with client's money.  However, because the job can be stressful at times, the company always had afterhours activities for the workers."
good,Good company with great benefits. Management turn over is constant and unsettling. I earned my title of Certified Fraud Examiner and received my Master of Business Administration.
good,"I love the job duties - office work, setting appointments, maintaining records, scheduling interviews. I love doing those type of things however I was told that i could become full time if i choose to and that option i have yet to see that option even though i have brought it up many times. I also don't like the lack of pay increase available. Had i known this i would have never taken the position. No benefits. I have been promised specific bonuses given i don't receive a pay increase only to come back and mention corp doesn't approve."
good,"For someone beginning a career in insurance sales, there is plenty of training.  A manager or experienced advisor must accompany a newly licensed advisor.  "
good,Prudential is a great company and has a good reputation.  Your experience depends completely on the group you work within.  The company has several departments and all are managed individually.
good,"Long Commute 75 miles each way plus appointments late at night. Spent the day learning products and generating leads. Great bond between co-workers. Hardest part of the job travel, most enjoyable meeting with potential customers."
good,"A company with a solid corporate structure, very competitive products, but with little to no room for advancement."
good,Prudential will provide its employees the the best training to get the job done.  Lots of opportunities to enhance your professional skills and post to other positions provided you have the skill-set to do so. I was hired as a litigation paralegal; then I posted to the business side with the help of my department head.  I enjoyed my tenure at Prudential with the exception the micro manager and few dishonest individuals.
good,35+years of sales and sales management experience but with no background on attracting indivisual leads and no help or guidance from Prudential.  Left to find a future.
good,Constant phone calls and networking. Learn how to establish financial goals. Managers need you to do well in order to receive higher compensation. Co-workers try to work in teams but look out for their selves. You must consistently open new business in order to be compensated.
good,"the cdp training program is unpaid, so do not quit your day job. the fast track program was not as fast as i was originally told and all the licensing fees became hard to come up with. fun environment and great people, but when you become financially strapped, it is something you just cannot complete."
good,Go into office for meetings or training.
good,a typical day at work most of the co-workers are great and some other don't know why they are there.
good,"Working out of the Englewood CO office, you were assigned a team and then told to dive right in. This particular firm offered training, but at the end of the day most of your success depends on who you know who HAVE assets. Expect to self fund yourself for at least the first 2-3 years. There is potential to earn a lot of money here, but over the 3 years I was there there was a significantly low success rate. "
good,"Poderia ter um clima organizacional melhor, contudo é um lugar limpo arejado bom de trabalhar."
good,"I enjoyed the organization and leadership of Prudential yet found their systems to be outdated regarding marketing, compliance, and technology which made it more difficult to conduct business for my clients."
good,"I have nothing bad to say, I was a contract worker and I do wish I was still there. I interviewed for another role after my contract was over however I was not chosen. I will keep applying."
good,"The company needs upgrade of computer equipment and systems, those aspects could make for a better work experience.  Those elements would make for a better employee and customer experience."
good,"Management encourages collaboration with business partners to drive innovation and seeks to test new products and distribution channels."
good,"I didn't care for my manager or the type of training they shared back in 1984. It was the main reason for leaving. They prided themselves on training and quite honestly, once again, back in 1984 it was very weak. Furthermore, it was the before computer days."
good,"The current Manager was excellent to work with.  He promoted education and collaboration."
good,"Like any large financial institution, your work experience is all about who you work with and for.  The benefits are second to none and somewhat make up for the less than stellar pay."
good,Was at Prudential for 23 years and truly enjoyed my time there. Loved that we could work from home at least one day a week. Great atmosphere to work in.
good,With Prudential you have a lot of flexibility. I believe that they are a great company but need to work on fixing some things internally that would be helpful for the Advisors working for them. Training structured has changed many times in the 2.5 years ive been with them and unfortunately you don't get a mentor that helps you with your practice and shaping you to become the person you want to be. I love my manager but he took on a lot of work and it makes it difficult for him to tend to the needs of his Advisors under him.
good,Trabalho de muita intensidade. Ambiente de trabalho de muita competição. Exige alta resiliência. É uma escola na área de vendas.
good,"Management will tell you they want to be more Agile and quicker to market, but the bottom line is most people are only concerned about themselves and their bottom line.  Jobs are cut without real thought to what the impact will be and only the ""chosen few"" are selected to participate in any of the impact projects."
good,"The workplace culture is that of ""do as I say"". Advancement is limited based upon who you know. Unable to advance even after they invest in your education. They fail to retain their assets due to poor attitude regarding training to retain their employees that they invest in. No one has the answers and the buck is passed."
good,"An employer that did offer job security; valuing both employees and customers."
good,Solid corporate company but not on branch level. Be very specific in the interview with the branch manager. As what will your daily tasks be and what mandatory meetings you must attend. Asked for the difference between a tied agent and independent contractor.
good,"Overall my internship was fine. I learned a ton from the attorneys and there were always willing to network or answer a question. However, I did find the corporate culture at Prudential HQ to be quite stuffy and conventional."
good,"I wasn't there that long, but my experience was not memorable. Intolerable supervisor who was very big on micro managing."
good,. I have learned on managing finances. The management is great. . Hardest part of job will have to be keep up to the sales quota. Not really a fun environment for me.
good,"Excelente multinacional do ramo de seguros de vida, porém a falta de equilíbrio entre vida pessoal e profissional me fez buscar outros rumos."
good,"The work in my area is cyclical.  There are daily deliverables, monthly, quarterly and annual deliverables that do not change.  Advancement is usually the result of someone leaving the area. Current management style on my team leans more toward micro management. Hardest part of the job is the lack of ability to be creative. Most enjoyable part are the hours and good health benefits"
good,Prudential is a decent company to work for. That being said the culture is both good and bad depending on the business segment you work in. They promote career mobility. Management typically does not push work down. They have alot of events. Salary is on the lower end of the market. Management is highly political to employees.
good,"you have to suspend your belief in being 100% truthful to succeed in any commission sales.  Even your friends become prospects and contacts. You are always working, even in social environments."
good,Very easy laid back work just be aware and do your job people are pretty friendly coworkers are great and very helpful to you everyone works together great
good,"After 2 years you were required to pay office and administration fees.  Pay was based on commission only and was tough to maintain due to the pay tables decreasing after each year, and paying high office and admin fees after the 2nd year."
good,"Supported VP of Marketing.  She was hard to read from day to day.  Very moody and although I was a contractor, treated me like I was her personal assistant rather than her professional assistant. Brought in her dog for me to care for and watch while she was in meetings."
good,"This job is the perfect job, for the right person.  It is high paced and as much a sales job as anything else.  Focus on the end goal and that is helping others and in a couple years you can be very successful"
good,"It was a good place to work since you make you own schedule, however if you don't sale you don't make any money. The commission were good when you sale."
good,"I had a great opportunity at Prudential, I was able to obtain my FINRA licenses and learn a lot about advising clients on financial and insurance products.  I left the company because I did not want to be in direct sales any longer."
good,"On a typical day at prudential is very busy for me as I am only part time, I feel it's not enough hours to the amount of work I need to push out. At prudential they have very nice individuals ."
good,"Working in the calculations Department was difficult because of the makeshift off-site office building we were placed in. People were ""walked out' (fired) fairly frequently and management would yell at us in front of peers for being a few minutes late to work. it was difficult to find answers to questions and the management had a hard time managing the team."
good,"If you can deal with uncertainty and lack of management support in your job it's the place to be. Salary & bonuses are excellent though, more than comparable to the area/industry."
good,"I loved working there until...the Change.  Change was needed and in the beginning welcomed.  But it soon turned to personal instead of professional.  And what was most enjoyed about getting up and coming to work - the people and atmosphere.  People are nervous, scared and are doing things out of the ordinary just to try to protect their jobs.  Very sad ending"
good,It is hard to get established in the Real Estate business.  This company mentors new brokers and provides opportunities for them to get clients of their own.  It is hard to make a living until you have a client base of your own.  You work most weekends.
good,"slow pace is a problem"
good,"Prudential has great compensation and benefits.  However, they don't care about results.  They are more focused on social programs and being politically correct at every turn.  Also, there is no job security and poor work/life balance."
good,My time at Prudential was great. My managers were great but trying to hit infeasible quotas is a major drawback. I was in charge of recruiting and I mostly hit my quotas but when you dont it is the end of the world. Goals should be hard to hit and challenging. Not impossible.
good,My overall experience with my Prudential career was good.  In the last two years I did not like the direction in which my business organization was go
good,"Great Compensation and Benefits, very little room for growth/learning. Great employees to work with. Very friendly culture. For youngsters, who are looking to learn new skills or grow, this may not be the place. It's all about what you are willing to trade off. If you are looking for a good place to retire, this is a wonderful organization."
good,"Prudential provides an excellent benefits package and has recently added new benefits geared specifically to new college hires. Different managers manage differently and some are more people-oriented than others. In general, most employees truly care about each other and with any amount of longevity, tend to become family-like. As an organization, Prudential is highly risk-averse, so it can be a challenge to get changes made in an expeditious manner. After awhile, this can get frustrating."
good,"Đc học thêm rất nhiều kinh nghiệm về làm việc nhóm,kỹ năng tue vấn và cskh,tự tin hơn trong giao tiếp"
good,"Good work life balance, somewhat competitive compensation, nice working culture. Employees like to interact and help one another. HR is easy to work with. Great benefits"
good,Associates afraid to speak up when they care about the company and want to make it better. Lack of management focus and VP's mostly need a formal process to make the simplest of decisions.
good,From the time you start a typical workday the challenges of monitoring the cash accounts as well as other pertinent day to day operations activities keep one engaged.
good,"found several of my colleagues less than ethical. management  placed too much emphasis on sales ""quotas"" and not enough on quality service and the best results for the consumer. interests outside of work were discouraged. for example, I was refused permission to accept a role in local play offered to me by my former theater professor. not only would it have been fun but good exposure for me to the public."
good,"fast pace job, very demanding. Room for growth within the company but not in the unit that I'm in. Looking for a more challenging position to enhance my current knowledge"
good,"its an hard place to work, sometimes quite stressful and a few colleagues not very nice, they expect you to known everything despite of providing training on a class room but not with live cases and then after, they just expect that every staff will know what to do. Those without experience on the field, will not feel well."
good,"The challenge of this position is having a pool of relationships who have money. It isn't enough to know a lot of people. Since this is only commission, you have to be able to tap into those relationships to make your money. They do have good management and training tools."
good,"Fast paced, Customer focused, problem solving, enjoyable work."
good,"Was at the company for under a year, but made some life long friendships.  As well as learned a lot from such a young staff."
good,"grassroots business building based on referrals and networking, all expenses,licensing, marketing out of pocket.  Limited investment offering"
good,"I work daily with health care professionals, claimants, and policy holders to determine and evaluate and manage 80 to 100 different long Term Disability claims at a time."
good,Working in a call center is standard. Assisting customers daily taking 30 plus calls a day is simple. Providing outstanding customer service is always the key
good,"As a student, I work as a staff of quality assurance for such mortgage loan, and personal loan calls made by Prudential Finance Vietnam. Here was the first working place I experience a lot in professional communication, and knowledge in finance area."

good,"Call and make appointments for the agents."
good,"Financial Services Representative, learned communication skills dealing with clients face-to-face and on the phone."
good,"I keep my boss on his toes.  Meaning, all phone calls and emails go through me.  I meet and greet with high end clients and discuss further actions.  Along with open houses and drafting contracts I am the person people love to deal with."
good,"I enjoyed Prudential.  The AARP contract changed to Hartford (Catalyst).  The job in Consumer Affairs, I loved."
good,"A typical day at Prudential involved handling all 22 offices also the corporate office payables, receivables, bank reconciliation, bank deposits, check runs weekly, Budgets etc..... The hardest part of my job was finding ways to cut the budget and to keep the company finances in the green each week. The most enjoyable part was my co-worker we worked as a team and we all helped out where it was needed. We also cross-trained on every position in accounting."
good,"Fast paced financial company with a focus on being the leading provider of retirement product solutions."
good,"My typical work day consisted of • Evaluation of health questionnaires, the interpretation of medical history and medical terminology."
good,I had to call customers in a fast pace call center.I learned to have patients.They where OK to work with.I enjoyed my co-workers.The hardest thing was to hear how they could not get the health care they needed from there carrier.The best thing was to know you truly helped someone improve their quality of life.
good,Good place to work just wish it was more pay. Co workers are nice this is a friendly atmosphere.
good,Cold calling for sales of Insurance and investment products..Hardest part of job is generating paychecks durig conomic downturns and doom and gloom of the news media..
good,Working at Prudential was a pleasure. It was a great experience for me.
good,"A typical day would talking with customers and finical advisers , helping to correct or help with preparing paperwork necessary for finical planing. I learned a great deal about 401K's profit sharing, 403b's etc, the in's and outs when it comes to the different plans that Prudential and other companies like Prudential provide. At Prudential I had several mangers and T.A's, and for the most part the main manager was an excellent leader, it was just those persons under them that made some of my time there a challenge.The hardest part of the job was when I couldn't solve a customers issue in a 24hr time frame , due to missing paperwork or even someone's error, because I never wanted to make a customer wait for a result. Some of my co workers where nice and held the same views that I did when it came to customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job , was really working with the customers and the financial professional helping to solve issues and helping both parties come to a conclusion susceptible for both sides."
good,"Worked with smal department but very well organized. Supervisor was very professional and had wonderful relationship with him and other coworkers. Commute was good, work environment was good."
good,"Decent work life balance, Decent pay & vacation time, beautiful location"
good,A typical day at prudential is always fast paced and usually much work to be done. Management is sometimes helpful . Co-workers can be a handful. Hardest part about working at the job is dealing with different personalities . The most enjoyable part of the job is the work itself. Its very demanding but it keeps you busy.
good,"Prospect or parish! This is the best opportunity for uncapped future earnings… But be prepared at the beginning and work your butt off, good things will come… Most people in this industry start out and fail, the ones that don’t many blessings will come. You better love this industry for the work first and be prepared to marketmarket yourself"
good,"The organization offers a collaborative environment but is slowed down by many layers of management. The current morale of the organization is not the best, as it is in a reorganizing mode."
good,"had fun miss it very much would like another job with them. Paychecks were always on time. Quite work environment, good employees, and management was the best."
good,"Able to learn, and work in three different departments. Co worker would help each other out when needed. The hardest part of work was at times looking for information. Management did it best to help out."
good,"Prudential can be a great place to learn and develop if you are in a group with good leadership. You can be taught how a business works and your skills can be applied to other roles in the company. However, if you are not in a group with good leadership, your skills can be wasted in a stagnant environment."
good,Provides opportunity to learn all aspects of the financial services industry both domestically and internationally. Reasonable benefits package with opportunity to excel and grow.
good,Good salary and medical benefits.  People are friendly. Good work life balance.  Received good training.  Management is fair and compensation is good.
good,"The hardest part of being a financial advisor is getting started in the business. When everyone you work with only looks out for themselves, combined with a bad culture, it's hard to make a livable wage."
good,A typical work day as an intern consisted of watching training videos for the first 3-4 weeks. The program was supposed to be a 3 part program but there was never any communication regarding each program step.
good,".I was put in by a company as a consultant so have no experience of that."
good,The work environment is supportive. Training is extensive and not enough real world training and experience before attempting to sell the products offered.  Products are the best in the bussiness
good,My work experience taught different aspects for this job. Went to work each day and answer participants questions. Worked on computer in data entry and making participants changes in their accounts.
good,Productive and good place to work at.  The culture is nice and they have good people. Many people are there for a very long time. They have good managers and encourage mobility.
good,"I enjoyed my time while at Prudential. I can't think of anyone there I had a great dislike for. From the sales manager to the State's managing director, everyone associated with the company was very helpful"
good,Great for someone who enjoys routine but no ideal for a hard working productive creative type.  150 minimum characters! OK well if your motivation to work is for the salary not for the love of the job then you may have a hard time here.
good,"It has been over 12 years ago since I worked at Prudential. I did enjoy their training program, but was not ready to be an agent. I was a single parent, and did not have enough time to put into being a Real Estate Agent."
good,Worked for Prudential as a temp.  During my time with the Prudential company the atmosphere was comfortable and the people I worked with seemed friendly.
good,"I typically worked under my mom doing real estate secretarial duties to enable her to have more time to do her bigger job of buying and selling real estate. I would show houses, do photos and brochures, and enter listings in FMLS system. Other paperwork duties as needed. Went to required meetings once a month."
good,Investment banking is tough with long hours and tedious work. I learned a lot in this job from a mentor. It gave me skills I've used for many years. Good experience.
good,"Company isn't very helpful if you want to sharpen your programming abilities. Very laid back work environment with a very nice work life balance. If you are seeking better, don't come here."
good,"Co-Workers were friendly and helpful"
good,It was my first experience in the medical insurance industry.  I liked working there.  The company got bought out by Aetna.  Prudential as a health care company does not exist any more.
good,"Culture is very conservative.  A lot of long hours.  benefits are okay.  I would recommend this company to others, young and established professionals"
good,"The company has very high regard for compliance of processes, procedures and sales methods. In addition, they are focused on educating their employees on proper conduct which is very commendable."
good,extremely friendly staff with very helpful management team. You get out what you put into the job. Not difficult but forced to learn things very quickly. Decent starting pay but no real advancement in specific location
good,It's a good place to work except when they started charging for the desk and phone at the office. It was commission only which made the job super stressful.
good,"Good starter for me to gain experiences in Admin position.  Workplace culture is good. Their workers are all great and very friendly. I've learned so many things there such as, how to communicate with customers, how to handling filing, how to use the Microsoft office, excel and power point in a proper way, and other positives things."
good,"I have not worked for Prudential NW Properties (Now Berkshire Home Services) for 18 years so can not comment on the company.  Therefore, the rating is meaningless and I just filled it in because it was required to move forward."
good,Good benefits. Fun division with lots of young people.  Gained a lot of knowledge about the financial markets.  Change of management caused decline in morale.
good,"If I was given longer to pass the licensing exams, I would have had a very successful career I believe. If I would have been able to be paid for selling Life and Health Insurance, while still studying for Series 6 and Series 63, then this position may have worked out better."
good,The work environment was focused on learning and following compliance requirements and  everyday business activities required for financial planning.  The employees were self motivated so my job was to make sure they followed rules of compliance and to make sure they were able to do their jobs to the best of their ability.
good,"There's a lot of individual autonomy after the initial hand-holding training stage. My recruitment efforts were oftentimes decided by myself. Due to the desire of the company to grow, we recruited pretty aggressively."
good,"Very hard to build a book of business, but ultimately rewarding if you stick with it and just grind. There's no easy way to get there, and if you can live without periods of making a salary for a while then you can make it."
good,"Good worklife balance.  I do not see many engineers have to work extra hours frequently."
good,"Typical very busy day everyday, involved with multitasking and achieving goals on a daily basis.  Researching and processing with help of various tools in a efficien manner"
good,I was a very successful agent at Prudential.  I had my own office and did broker thru other companies.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping my clients.
good,Prudential expect the best and work you hard for it.  There are targets productivity tables for every individual. If you don't meet the requirements then there are performance  improvement plans in place if you fail then you are placed on a disciplinary level 1
good,"A typical day was spent setting up new computer equipment, teaching computer skills to new laptop users, desk top users, patching, running backup and mainframe punch downs."
good,Every day was a joy to arrive to work and interact with fellow employees. Management was able to hire staff that worked well together and provided opportunities for team building.
good,"Provided administrative support for the managing Broker."
good,The company overall is great especially to start your career but after a while your career is more likely to stagnate than advance if you stay. The work environment is great is some groups but the company severely underpays.
good,Worked in a System Support group interfacing with application personnel using IDMS to create ADHOC reports using Culprit and OLQ also initiated on-line system enhancements to the Short Term Analysis and Reporting Systems.
good,"During this time period, Prudential, was attempting to force me to resign.  I was one of the higher paid employees, with many years of service.  Every day became a struggle.  I left on long term disability."
good,The lack of management involvement surprised me due to when bringing in new agent you expect there to be a extensive  training program. Instead it was just pass your series exams and get to work. not a fun experience
good,"This is 25 years ago. Sold insurance to individuals, managers helped us to create a solution to insurance needs. Mostly sold life insurance products but did have some homeowners and car insurance as well . We were out in the field daily and many times were partnered with other sales reps"
good,Prudential is collaborative working environment. I enjoy working with my coworkers and management is supportive. I find the work challenging and rewarding.
good,No real growth within industry sales industry. working on commission not appealing to many. Management was kind. Hardest part of job ios getting people to actually be interest in signing up in a market where the majority alreafy have insurance.
good,"Good investment and insurance company, They provided a varieties of investment products and services to client.  Have good benefits for its worker.  There are some traveling and off hour works."
good,"It is difficult to move up internally, as there is a 'clique' culture in many departments.  Despite claims that they are seeking diversity of thought, they tend to only hire with specific experience."
good,"it was ok.  You eat what you kill.  Must be diligent with constant marketing, networking, looking constantly for anyone to talk to.  Very competitive, commission only."
good,"If you are a sales ""natural"", go for it.  If not, run don't walk away, this is not for you.  You have to sell to friends and family to get started.  You have to make 100 calls a day to get an appointment.  Leads are largely worthless, all service, no sales.."
good,worked in private office. Most interaction was with occasional clients stopping in. Average paced environment that allowed time to enhance skills and knowledge in the field.
good,"Good place to start your career.  Nice environment, I really enjoyed the people that I worked with!! Everyday was different and I had the opportunity to have my own schedule."
good,"I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people on a daily basis, creating great relationships with my current and new tenants."
good,Great if you already have a book of business.  They ask for friends and family and then give you some wore out leads. good training program. so that helped
good,"I had an overall positive experience with starting my career in finance here. Use this as a stepping-stone to further your career on your own, or with a much a larger firm with additional benefits"
good,"As a financial professional salary is entirely commissioned based. Very supportive management team. Required to pass life/health insurance exam, as well as series 6."
good,good company to start your career with had training if you needed it and benefits and flexible hours but this was over 20 years ago which means no cell phones and no internet
good,"In my particular role, being a case manager of problem cases, it can be high stress with demanding turnaround times for resolutions  with a  running book of 25-40 cases. 4-8 new ones each day. Management knows that we are under staffed but not able to bring in any new hires due to budget constrains within the business. Knowing that we are a high demand unit, you would think they would want to staff properly taking into consideration how many people will be off on PTO on any given day (maybe there is more to this behind the scene w/senior mgmt, not sure).   That said work/life balance is not as ideal as it could be.  A nice plus is being able to work overtime and get paid for it and working remotely as often as needed. Also, if you meet expectations in the role, come the annual review, a raise in salary is always given and bonuses are provided at year end depending on any extra project work completed."
good,"Typical Real Estate office. Commissioned work, fairly risky inconsistent income, No team atmosphere. Some infighting and office politicking. Clicks were formed."
good,"I can say my job there was over nineteen years ago. I sold real estate I loved it and made a lot of money in a short period of time. However, when my second son was born I was back to a stay at home mom. I have not returned to real estate since."
good,I was an employee there for one year. Setting up their books online to begin the process of new company. The paper flow was from our sales area to the corporate office in Winston-Salem NC
good,"Room for advancement"
good,My time with Prudential was spent building my clientele and working independently to provide my clients with the best possible customer service. The environment was active but I could easily focus in my private office.
good,"Go to work make coffe, check web case for submitted life apps, talk in accordance to underwriters/ case managers about the case. If no cases submitted make calls from personal leads or company leads"
good,"My work experience was enhanced with a support staff, brokers and fellow associates willing to lend a hand and help out when needed. This is especially true for unknown previous work experiences."
good,I outgrew the company. I was very big on self promotion and I feel that as the top agent I should have gotten a better commission split and more marketing from the owner.
good,This was the first company I went to when I received my real estate sales person's license.  I think it's a great company to start with.  They provide a great deal of support.
good,"Great team support system, and a lot of room for advancement if willing to work for it. Company offers a lot of perks to their employees for providing outstanding services and meeting or exceeding their goals."
good,"Good company to work for."
good,"lots of cold calling.  Upwards of forty calls per day.  The sales expectations are exceedingly high.  Also, you are expected to contact everyone that you ever knew and ask them to invest with you."
good,I liked the company. It was fun. Mostly everyone is nice. The company offers very good benefits to their employees.  Human Resources are very nice and helpful.
good,Worked for them as an appraiser in real estate as I went to school.  I did the appraisals on homes in the Southern California are and did some work on commercial property
good,"Most (not all) of the professionals are okay, but the HR department is particularly lousy with confused recruiters. They have easily messed up my interviews, refused to give me important details about my position in a timely manner, and so many other deficiencies."
good,I worked there many years ago to hard to tell how environment is now.  If it is anything like other Insurance companies forget it.  I was always told you will never get rich working for an insurance company
good,Prudential has solid fundamental growth related to their pipeline and business ventures. A lot of organization change occurring which can lead to mismanagement of talent and career advancement.
good,"Anachronistic corporate life. They're trying to create a more agile workforce and are renovating their offices to make them more collaborative and open, something akin to a co-working office or a start-up office."
good,Great people to work with and for - very helpful and always there if needed. Management was good. An enjoyment to work with these fine people and I truly miss them!!
good,Fortune 500 Company that had great benefits and lots of PTO available for its employees.  Needed to have more career advancement opportunities for me to stay there.
good,"While I enjoyed my time at Prudential Healthcare, the company was acquired by Aetna many years ago, and it has been a long time since I was employed by this company."
good,OK company to work for someone that has no major bills to pay. Perfect for kid out of college that still has parents back up. It takes time to build book of business
good,"Office manager"
good,"In my short time at Prudential, I had access to some excellent people and processes to assist me in accomplishing my goals and objectives. The size and scope of the company could be a problem at times from a compliance and marketing aspect."
good,Stressful work for the project managers. Supervisors don't not get involved unless necessary. As a result they lack of knowledge of general situation of the teams. They are more concerned with financials and not much so with the health of workforce. Too much dependency on offshoring and lees and less availability of SMEs. But associates are very helpful and try to work for team. Overall climate is ok. But the contractors are treated much differently that the employees. I worked here before and it was not like that.
good,"135+ year old company that is slow to adopt change.  Internal organizations operate as separate companies and while they are trying to integrate to cross-sell products, their computer systems need an overhaul."
good,Prudential is a fun place to work where everyone knows what they are required to do. I was given the opportunity to learn new and innovative skills that helped me with my job responsibilities.
good,Typical small software shop. Developers writing financial apps and reports for a company in the Financial Sector. At the time I was there the department really struggled with the BAs not communicating very well to get the requirements from the end users to the programmers.
good,The lack of development is stifling. There is room for leadership to vastly improve. Getting anything done requires too much effort as there is so much red tape.
good,An overall good place to work with many opportunities to network with other offices and staff. A very competitive environment.  Sound technology company with good handle on customer service
good,Reviewed Real Estate Appraisals/ Listed homes with Realtors/ Provided input to computer network regarding sales and closings. Team oriented. Rewarded for going the extra mile.
good,"Prudential is a great company if you are old and do not like change. The work life balance is amazing. However, if you are young, there is no challenge or room for growth."
good,"Prudential is a respectable company with high moral standards and support a ""do the right thing"" outlook on work. Prudential encourages an inclusive environment, but the nature of the business can often be dry and boring."
good,"Prudential likes to hire people for claims right out of college. But there is a culture of people not really liking their job, and it turns into a palpable negative feeling on the teams. There isn't a whole lot of room for growth unless you post-out into new positions frequently."
good,"hurry up and wait, managing stress, lack of management communication, negative workplace environment, trying to get feedback from management, resolving complex insurance issues"
good,Average place to work. Nothing special. certain situations were a bit stressful. didn't feel the support of management. didn't sense a willingness for advancement.
good,"• Utilized sales presentations and networking to develop and maintain client base"
good,prudential has poor upper manager abilities. most promoted based on sales production not management ability.turnover must higher then average.to many different divisions.
good,"You are expected to handle a set list per day of XX amount of contracts.  They must be done before you leave.  If you can't complete it, you have to tell your boss why you didn't complete it.  You have to be able to work well with your co-workers and help each other out.  I was expected to train incoming temps on how to do the job but was never told to do this in my job description."
good,Management was average.  Training was ok.  I feel they could have done more with helping with lead generating or marketing.  Product training was good.
good,I initially enjoyed My time at Prudential it was mentally exciting and provided exciting growth. However as time went on the job became more stressful.
good,"would worked there with more training but again just didn't like FA which had a bad attitude,. Sometime FA should be more a little more easy going. Working call center employee should be pay more with all the abuse they received ."
good,"Worked as the liason between the systems and the business team to provide solutions with most ROI. "
good,"Wasn't here very long, but the time I was here. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. The pay was good and the environment was too. Benefits were cool"
good,A job here is tough because it is 100% commission. The training team help in building your sales and marketing skills but it really comes down to how strong your network and networking skills are.
good,"Fast-paced, quick learning, and good people to work with, you learn a lot about multi-tasking, time management, customer service itself, different systems, and how Prudential works with different companies."
good,"Tough industry to work in,working on commission can be lucrative, but, also quite challenging and not so stable,the management and training is constant to keep you abreast of the industry and its constant changes."
good,"Any security officer always have to stop me even I show my work ID # badge. Even they don't always remember me."
good,"A great place to move around within the company, unfortunately there is lots of office politics. You have to make connections across the organization to move up."
good,Worked for Custom One Homes. New home subdivision in Gwinnett County. Check builders progress daily. Answer potential home owners questions. Meet & greet clients in model home.
good,I didn't really give things enough time to say if it was a great company. I was only there for like 3 months so I would say the people were for the most part friendly.
good,Prudential Securities was an enjoyable place to work but it wasn't challenging.  Management was very set in their ways and their wasn't any room for advancement.  Pay was not on par with other securities firms.
good,"Great place to work with good benefits. The job is commission based with no salary but there is also no cap on how much money you could make, if you're willing to put in the work."
good,"Worked here as a temp associate. Cannot speak too much for company. Not bad. Insurance is not the best place to work though. People are nice and building isn't bad,"
good,"You are your own boss. One hundred percent commissions. You have the ability to grow your practice the way you seem fit. Be ready to work, but could be a great career"
good,Nice place to work a wonderful learning ground regarding software testing and compliance.  Nice people and positive atmosphere.
good,Great corporate benefits including a defined benefit pension plan. Management in Dallas needs be fair to all and not show favoritism. Also respect and appreciate employees based on the quality of their work and not who they know.
good,Newark location is awful.   I almost got jumped in the Newark Penn Station area by 4 teenage girls.  I stood up to them and was seeking security but nothing.  People have been robbed at ATM machine.
good,"Great place for career minded people, room for mobility and advancement.  Great team atmosphere and partnership across functions and businesses"
good,"Talking to people with all different personality and smiling even thought you don't see the person. Learn to manage calls and being very knowledgeable of the claim process and procedures.  I have respect for my co-workers and management team and will to help any way to get the job done.  Talking a call and another call comes in before you can take a breath.  My co workers was the best, we did pot luck on holidays and for birthday."
good,At Prudential Retierment you have an opportunity help individuals meet their retirement goals.  Each Day the associates at Prudential strive to provide a secure retirement at the highest quality service at the lowest justifiable cost to be a leader in the Retirement and Investment Industry.

good,I enjoyed working for them overall good company  great managers   good hours.. that's as much as I can say about this company.......
good,Get along great with everyone that works there. Structure is a little old school. Most enjoyable part is the culture. Management is great and are very supportive.
good,"Typical day of work. Picking up the phone and start dialing numbers and when answered then I start my sales talk. I have able to extend my patience for those clients that are angry."
good,"Prudential continues to grow and acquire new areas of interest, if you are inclined to want to move within a company there are many avenues open to you in such a large company."
good,"no opportunity for growth, unsteady budgeting from year to year, good people, good work life balance, interesting business"
good,"Working on IIB as consultant with prudential and currently working in development , testing , the work culture is pathetic and no proper process is followed  , and work is loaded like anything"
good,Was given tasks that were undesirable by others and flourished. If the recession had not hit; my employment perhaps would have remained.
good,"A typical day a work is scheduling and confirmed appointments, switchboard operations. My co-workers was very nice. The hardest part of the job was being on the phone all day."
good,Long work hours but approachable trading desks with opportunity to learn.  Good benefits such as tuition reimbursement.  Decent amount of politics in management of supporting functions.
good,I really enjoyed working in the prudential office! It overall is a great workplace and I learned a lot by being at this office. I had a lot of fun personalizing my cubicle with pictures of family and friends! I always felt very productive in my position with this company.
good,"Prudential Real Estate is a good company to work for, but I would work for them as a W2 employee. Compensation for Real Estate agents is limited on not reliable."
good,"One of the things I loved about Prudential was their focus on diversity and early talent identification. The company is also committed to being socially responsible and having employees participate in different activities (even interns) like food drives for example, to help the community."
good,"I worked for Prudential for 17 years.  Unfortunately, outsourcing caught up with me.  I loved my job, I loved my clients, I loved my accomplishments."
good,Pru has is a business that allows employees to aim and focus in having career advancement goals.  This way of thinking and support to it's employees helps the company to absorb volatility in any one business which benefits their stockholders and employees.
good,It was a great company.  I'm not sure the company is still in business.  The owner was very generous with the tools that she brought to her agents.
good,"Very limited assistance"
good,"The processing of Insurance policy requests which are premiums, payments, changes, cancellations, reinstatements, and refinancing are part of the activities associated with this position.  Adhere to all Prudential laws, tax laws, and state requirements to insure a proper life insurance policy for all policy holders.  Process all requests with sensitivity and quality."
good,"This was an entry level position. The office was always busy and the job itself was always interesting and non-stop. Ultimately, the pay and  benefits where not enough to keep me their."
good,"On mondays, I made referrals by phone , and get at least 20 secured appointments. I learned to make the appointment by phone, and not trying to sell anything by phone, only the appointment. Management was outstanding, they kept us going day by day, our paper work had to be very clean , and legible.  My co-worker were very good always trying to help, and give ideas. the hardest part was to open my house door, but once I did it, I was ready to take over the world, I really enjoyed to help people to understand and get their insurance going, after that they became my best friends."
good,I had a good experience working for Prudential. It is a smooth comfortable place to work. The atmosphere is very low key and easy going not too hectic or slow. Management was very helpful and caring about the employees careers and future in the company.
good,Learned application reviewing. Great co-workers made the day more enjoyable
good,one of the market leaders in financial products. Mix of industry veterans and new talent. extensive training program.
good,"I worked as an agent & office admin /property manager doing variety of office work,train new agents,and manage our tenants & property  . Walk in clients & by referrals"
good,good flexibility in work hours and enviornment.  there are generally long tenured people who work here.  one negative is that prudential is located in new jersey. working here you will learn about financial markets and how to make spreadsheets
good,Company is solid overall. The division I worked in was poorly run
good,"Good work environment"
good,"Os terceirizados, quando demonstram interesse e habilidades, têm boas chances de efetivação e crescimento. Aconteceu comigo e com vários colegas.  O contato com colaboradores das unidades internacionais é uma parte importante e agradável do trabalho."
good,"*Normal data entry updates."
good,"It is exactly what you would expect: good benefits, good security, decent pay, good work/life balance, boring work, boring environment. It didn't help that I had a manager with anger control problems yelling at people left and right."
good,"This organization promotes personal growth and provides tools, services, and benefits focused on supporting an employee's development."
good,I never appreciated the insurance industry until I worked in the call center.  It also helped me accept that the people on the other end of the line are under quite a criteria for time management on the phone as well as accuracy in their ability to assist the caller.  It was quite an educational experience.
good,I enjoyed the time I worked here. The people were fun and helpful and there were good hours.
good,"Hard to advance"
good,"I work here and have for over a year.  It's quickly coming to a close for me because I'm not beating the bushes to sell to my friends who no longer speak to me because I ""sell insurance"" now."
good,"a typical day at work consist of processing anywhere from 10-20 applications for life, short and long term disability claims, gained experience in processing claims for Nea ( national education association) knowledge in offering at a lower dollar amount for customers who may be considered a risk. work well with a diverse group  of people with years of experience. hardest part of the job putting in long hours at the job during peak season."
good,It all depends on a manager in your office. I wish I just changed to a different location because I wasn’t crazy about the way my manager handled a certain transaction that I had. She did not return my phone call for two days on an urgent matter and no one in the office could help me. It was frustrating and I left after my purchase was complete.
good,"Sold insurance products, had licenses in casualty, health, life, annuities and investments."
good,"Prudential was a great, secure company; but in the past few years, changes in upper management have resulted in less job security, less ""fun"" (I.e., no employee picnic), and lower morale. Overall, I enjoyed working with the majority of people I saw on a daily basis, but changes far above our pay grade degraded our areas. "
good,"Focus is on shareholders and stock price like many large, publicly traded organizations.  Many great people throughout the organization."
good,"Was short term assignment, can't say much about this company.  Did not have any memory that stands out for this company."
good,"A typical day at work is filled with reporting, the day is fun and exciting with new things to learn."
good,Great team and broker!  Great training.  great people in Amarillo!
good,"Overall, Pru is a good company to work for. Typical day includes taking phones calls and processing withdrawals. I've learned that it's who you know and not what you know that gets you ahead in the department. Management is incompetent. I really like my coworkers."
good,I learned a lot about sales and had the ability to make my own schedule. Great job for anyone with a family.
good,"The people are friendly."
good,I was an employee of Hartford Life Insurance from 9/2001 until Prudential Insurance Company of America acquired Hartford Life Insurance in Jan of this year at which time I became a Prudential employee.  Times are very exciting as the organization goes through a period of reorganization.
good,I was part of a training class that dealt with processing claims of beneficiaries in order to get them paid in an efficient and timely matter.  Quality assurance was the most important part of the job and attention to detail was key to completing specific work tasks.
good,Good opportunity for growth...Can be unprofessional at times.
good,"Work is mostly on the weekends, takes a while to build your pipeline, a good choice if your willing to wait to make some real money after about 3 years."
good,I worked with clients to deepen relationships and minimized exposure by recommending appropriate levels of insurance coverage and other financial necessities. 
good,"Good place to work. Presented a number opportunities. Move twice, once for promotion and once when the company reorganized."
good,A huge coporation where the agents where super nice and helpful. A great place to work. I loved dealing with clients and selling insurance. 
good,"Make phone calls to the actual clients to updated their information.Offer new services and sold  various types of insurance policies to individuals such as life, auto, and mortgage insurance."
good,"Pru is a great company for people right out of college looking to become a financial adviser.  They will assist you in getting your Life Accident and Health license and series 6 and 63(the basic licenses needed for securities transactions).  The training is great but this company has you build a book of business on your friends and family by creating a project 200, which is essentially an excel spread sheet with 200 people that you know with information about these people, such as age, job title, salary etc..."
good,This was a great place to work until the later years.  Management became less than trustworthy and sales practices became poor.  In recent years the organization has changed and seems to be a better opportunity after weeding out problems.
good,- Underwriting
good,"Easily accessible from the PA turnpike, friendly casual work atmosphere"
good,"Bons momentos na Prudential. Localização um pouco complicada, distante do metro. Porém, uma empresa boa onde pude ter uma experiência em Marketing ."
good,Receiving payments in the mail and posting to the accounts. Receiving payments for customers coming into the office to pay on accounts. Helping Sales Manager with weekly and monthly reporting.
good,Scheduling appointments. There's so much to learn about the industry. The management team is very supportive and knowledgeable. The culture is conducive to learning and teamwork is evident. Finding leads is the most difficult part of the job. Helping others is probably the most enjoyable
good,It's a good career if you're aggressive and pushy with clients and don't mind cold calling. I passed all the licensing part fairly easily but didn't have the right personality for the job.
good,"a typical day at Pru was very calm , quiet and productive. the most enjoyable part of the job was the family life/co-workers (parties),"
good,"Prudential is great company for those who prefer a more structured schedule. It was my first glimpse into working in a real estate brokerage and, overall, I have nothing bad to say. However, I did learn a lot about my current career and am thankful for the experience."
good,Audit Businesses in their office. Property Insurance Audit for Business - what to look for that is safe. Good role models and mentors for success. Not a lot of co-worker interaction because everyone was in a different state. Self discipline is required because you set your own schedule and manage your own work. You have control of your income based on how hard you work.
good,"Enjoyable atmosphere especially among the new comers. Flexible schedule was a plus. Biggest drawback was the cold calling,"
good,"One of the industries top insurers.Good products, and good service."
good,Working productively daily while assisting Financial Advisors and third party companies. Holding team meetings on daily updates to continue to satisfy internal and external customers. Work on projects for problem solving and helping to implement positive changes for the company. A challenge on a daily basis were communicating with third party companies to comply with customer needs. The most best part of a work day would be providing satisfactory service to my internal partners and our current and potential customers.
good,"COmpany can offer benefits to most of their employees. If raising a family, thy offer great benefits. They do not promote within the company."
good,Prudential do offer a good benefit package to their employees. The department I worked in was a production department but still team driven. I learned a lot at Prudential and was able to do some training to help others with what I learned. A typical day is basically data entry of information from health and motor vehicle report forms to assist the underwriter. We also assist other departments like the Billing department to pay vendors for services.
good,A day at work consisted of printing materials to send clients. Maintaining client lists and updating spreadsheets. Binding pamphlets and binders for presentations. I learned how to bind the materials together and how much hard work it is. Management was very helpful. The co-workers were all very friendly. Lifting was the hardest part of my job. I enjoyed the co-workers the most they were welcoming.
good,It is nice to work in a place where you are accepted and feel that your work is appreciated.
good,"i worked there when i was 18, too many years ago. learned how to do the mail and copy room"
good,"Part-time position, was able to get foot into office work and build general office skills."
good,"Prudential is a strong financial leader. Unfortunately, it is so diversified that it takes an extremely long time for there to be any changes specifically ones that benefit employees."
good,"Very high stress, high pressure environment. Long days. Travel required. Decent pay. Constant changes in policies and procedures without warning."
good,"Prudential was challenging and exciting place to work. Working there as a Real Estate Auditor, I was given excellent training to help achieve personal job goals and corporate compliance commitments. There were opportunities to work with several different asset classes and financial functions throughout the investment area of the company."
good,"The company has great benefits. Work/ balance is a definite. Depending which area you are in, you are able to wprlfrom home full time or part time. Or a condensed work week."
good,"The first thing I say is that Prudential does really care about their community. "
good,Not given a book of business. I was responsible for finding and growing all business.Office was fun though and the other employees were helpful. I would have stayed longer but I had personal things come up that required my attention.
good,As Warren Buffet entered in REBrokerage this was an early adventure. Like most first tries you learn more than you profit but not always. Management was stifled although some of the best people in town.  Identity for my segment would have benefited by being Berkshire Hathaway from the start.
good,"Môi trường làm việc linh hoạt, thích hợp với nhiều đối tượng"
good,"Prudential offers great benefits, PTO, and schedules. Not as much growth opportunity as they say, and it takes a lot longer to be able to move into other roles."
good,"Large company that moves very slow to business.  Waited very long for a position offered to me, but leadership would not complete the transfer.  Great benefits..."
good,Excellent place to start in operations.  Management oversees monthly development of candidate through extensive training.  High-paced work life makes this job critical to be aware of surroundings.
good,Professional colleagues to work with however frequent meetings with competing deliverables makes the workplace culture less enjoyable. In addition to high turn over rate of staff.
good,"This position is very competitive in that each producer is competing for a better position on the production lists.  Yet we work jointly for clients, each partner bringing his or her expertise to the needs of our clients.  The management at Prudential is fair and helpful and I have met many fine  leaders while working for Prudential.  The most difficult part of this position is the selling enough products in order to make a decent living.  I have enjoyed this position and its fast-paced work environment, passing the exams for the required licenses  to help clients make sound decisions as related to insurance, investments and retirement planning. I have met and made many friends while with Prudential."
good,"2008-2013 was an unusual time in the annuities industry. Prudential went through alot of corporate changes during that time. In the end, they simply did not want the business and treated the salesforce harshly."
good,"Great worklife balance, benefits, and PTOs. Not as cut throat as other firms. Compensation could be better as well as management involvement. Overall, great company to work for!"
good,Great environment but could use some improvements in the management review processes. The working environment was good and I always felt secure here with security.
good,I was only there for 18 months as a contractor. So I really did not get a feel for being an FTE. I was transferred with the Hartford Life group. Very much like The Hartford.
good,Prudential Financial was a very good company to work for and had excellent benefits although the medical benefits cost was rising dramatically.  The people working there were very professional and easy to get along with.  At times the job was very stressful and working nights and weekends did occur to meet very aggressive deadlines.
good,"Learned almost everything about the insurance business over my 31 years. Enjoyed working with reps, teaching new reps, and working with all types of clients. I liked working with business clients especially small business owners using all types of of methods tofit their needs."
good,Commission only pay is a double edged sword. I found the people there to be nice and helpful. The work culture is competitive. Sometimes it felt like we were being asked to sell products that were not very good or didn't belong in a particular household.
good,Worked at the company for a year.  Nice location.  Training was ok but not enough for the position.  Management at the time worried more about company rating rather than employee meeting goals with proper training.
good,"Great job for first 5 years."
good,"relaxed environment, most of the managers and supervisors are nice but not all, pay could be better, training could have been better, furnished free lunches from time to time."
good,"Management was in the midst of changing and this lead to an environment filled with stress. The job itself was good, it was just not a good time to be working there."
good,"Nice place, pretty stable job. Kinda a conservative insurance company so the technology is outdated. Also, the organization has several layers to it so it is difficult to gain opportunities to work with senior managers if you are mid-level."
good,Company was great to work for overall. The benefits package was great. The offer great healthcare and discounts on a variety of items. The only issue was the advancement opportunites in my location.
good,the jobs on the phones are horrible. managers have favorites and block anyone they dont like from advancing. Pay and benefits were good to start but actually getting a raise is difficult unless you can make virtually no mistakes ever.
good,It is the people company and people whom i worked is nice and friendly. its home away from away culture. work life balance is one of the best in the organization
good,Good work life balance & friendly co-workers.  Technology outdated & needs major overhaul. Culture a bit dry and they do 360 performance reviews which are completely unfair - others opinions of you matter more then your own bosses - a complete popularity contest.
good,The hardest part of the job was not having the materials to get the job done. The Ceo did not care if the job was going well or not. At the end of the day you have a relief it has ended.
good,As stated the pay is great and it is a great company.  Inward mobility is there and encouraged in most areas.  It's a very stable that you can make a career out of if you work hard.
good,"I would come into the office early and usually stay until late in the afternoon. I cold call about 100 individuals each day. Management was okay not the best. I had to teach myself most of the things. I love the freedom of my job, but I hate the uncertainty it comes with."
good,Flexible work place but 100% commission. Work hours are 40 to 60 hours per week. Management is fine. most co workers are good
good,"Công việc đòi hỏi đi thị trường nhiều nên rèn luyện cho bản thân tôi sức chịu đựng về sức khỏe, ngoài ra việc tiếp xúc nhiều với khách hàng giúp tôi giao tiếp tự tin hơn và khả năng thuyết phục khách hàng cũng tốt hơn. Tính chất công việc đòi hỏi sự làm việc độc lập nên giúp tôi có những định hướng rõ ràng về công việc cũng như mục tiêu nghề nghiệp của mình. Mức lương khá thấp so với công sức và thời gian bỏ ra."
good,"A small insurance agency offering competitive insurance premiums to credit union members. Very involved as I had to design managing systems to help manage portfolios, accounts and clientele. Great satisfaction in dealing with and meeting customer needs satisfactorily. I learned how important it is to be well organized and systematic in work processes to be able to adequately meet work demands. It was just me and my associate, the proprietor/agent. However, many of the day-to-day decisions was left to me.The hardest part was troubleshooting where the problems arose for the clients. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually finding the source of the problems and remedying them."
good,"Generally a good place to work, good work / life balance but career advancement limited. Most senior roles filled by external candidates. Elitist grading structure."
good,The culture is a bit laid back but you are expected to deliver. I found the environment relaxed compared to the financial Institution I was coming from.
good,Would consider working again if opportunity exists for more gradual work requirements to achieve minimum living standards until prospect inventory was greater in quantity to obtain second interviews with clients.
good,"It was fine. They pay well, however favoritism is shown a lot. Sometimes not the brightest or best people are promoted. I enjoyed the work life balance, however the managers never push for development."
good,"Call center, taking inbound calls relating to a variety of complex questions from clients and financial advisers relating to specific annuity products and benefits. Gained tremendous insight into the financial services industry in general and variable annuities in particular.  The hardest part of the job was the transition from training, which was essentially being in a classroom for six weeks, to actually taking calls all day. It was a very big leap to make."
good,"I currently work 19 hours a week, Friday being my 11 hours day. My functions as a Security Officer are} Maintain the lobby, assist tenants/guest, do floor check on the vacant floors in the building, assist the building engineer as needed."
good,"It was a great place to work because the people at Prudential are great.  It was a great work environment.  It was very difficult to make consistant money because it is a 100% commission job.  The place that needs improving is training new employees.  They basically just say go out and make money, without actually training you on the best ways to do that.  Hardest part is the long hours but the best part is that the job is flexible.  There is no punching in a clock but if you wanted to make a lot of money you had to work long hours."
good,Very top heavy with management and it takes a long time for any changes to occur.   But they do try to offer nice benefits and have a good work life balance.
good,"A mixed bag.    The office I worked in had a great office staff.   Most people are friendly and easy to get along with.    This is a great company for a recent grad to get experience with a major company.    The downside to that being your confidence could take a hit if this is your first real job.    Most people who enter whats known as the CDP program fail as they cant meet the minimum policies required to transition to full time and more importantly get your first paycheck.    Once you do make it through the CDP program the ""Productive"" number is very difficult to hit.    Over the long term Prudential has a difficult time retaining their employees.    Prior to my departure the 24 month retention rate was under 30%.    I was there just over 3 years and that retention rate was likely significantly less than the 30%.    Prudential has a great training program and its a great place to get started in the insurance industry.    You can obtain all of your licenses that will help you down the road.    They will also pay many of your licenses and tests once you pass them of course."
good,Excellent place to work. Great culture and a fit for anybody with a drive to succeed
good,"Empresas muito Turbulenta e co uma gerencia muita estressadas. "
good,"Being a financial professional is a completely unique experience. There is tremendous pressure on each individual to find, maintain, and sell to their own clients, and an agents income is completely dependent on doing so. The tradeoff is that the freedom and individuality allowed is phenomenal."
good,Big respected company.  Sold unit to competitor to exit buss.
good,I started here right out of high school.  I really liked working in the claims field.  They however closed the office
good,"There was never a typical day; I worked on projects and each day was focused on any given priority to move a project forwards; stakeholder engagement, risk and issue management, financial control, technical workshops by way of examples. In addition, significant effort was expended on improving processes, making process changes where these may have been weak or changes would yield a longer term solutiuon. I learnt much about financial services and regulkatory obligations, which was new to me. My colleagues were a mix of subject experts; some with knowledge about the financial products and most with technical expertise of the systems used. The most enjoyable part was to collaborate with others and either enjoy the successes or share the pain where things had not gone so well!"
good,Never worked out of the office as I had my own home set up. Not much managerial support unfortunately
good,Really you come in and do your job and the boss's really dont care what is going on in your life. They aren't very friendly unless they need something then they act like they care. But the people you work with you become very close too.
good,Prudential was a great place to work but the job security was a little scary as far as outsourcing.
good,Great place to work. If you can last without being layed off you can really build a career.
good,"Arrive early morning by communicating via telephone with customer management for whats needed from my employees for that day. Then I go out into the field, and stop at all destinations to show visibility and loyalty to our customers to ensure my staff are working to the highest potential without laziness. At the end of the week I am gathering all 40 of my staffs payroll. Once finished payroll I would send it to detroit office human resources to conduct payroll for each week.  When short handed I would look for the best qualified individual to schedule his/her interview for employment."
good,"The company is undergoing huge outsourcing, technology upgrades and employee separation...not sure what the Financial Reporting and Operations departments will look like in the ""Future of Work""  Environment at the Company.  Positions are being re-skilled and/or upskilled, with a focus on technology.."
good,"Prudential was extremely good at work and home life balance, by allowing remote work to all employees.  That was one of my favorite parts about working with Prudential."
good,"Long-tenure culture, reasonable comp, excellent place to begin a career.  Limited opportunity to grow a career in front office roles with little turnover."
good,Company offers a.lot. You can thrive in the right area. Some mamagerment is lacking and policies mentioned that they brag about are not always executed from an ethical standpoint.
good,I dont really have one and I think this bd that I have to write 150 minimum characters just to get this submitted.  I did not work there long enough to give an accurate survey.
good,"It was an okay job, I mean what can really ask for it was my first job. the pay was great but then again I really didn't have the correct skills to match for better pay"
good,"I enjoyed working at Prudential, but it is an old fashioned corporate experience. Great pay, and generally nice people, but in an environment where many feel stuck in their jobs. There is an initiative to make the company more agile and project focused, but it will be slow to change the existing culture and processes. In general, it may be a good place for you to work if you like routines and a structured environment. May not be the best place for creatives, and people who want to grow in a dynamic workplace."
good,"I worked there 25 years ago. At the time, I was just out of college and it provided me with a good opportunity to learn about the business world and what it was to be self-disciplined and self - motivated."
good,A good workplace and their staff very productive. Many knowledge   I get from that job. I also learn how to communicate with customer. The management very well. I am happy work at there.
good,Aprendi muito sobre investimento patrimonial. Gostei muito de trabalhar na empresa. Lugar agradável e muito tranquilo.
good,I was told during the hiring process that most people stay in the position a year before advancing and that is not true. Everyone is so nice and helpful though
good,"Had a great time working for Prudential. The only thing is you don't feel great about job security. Prudential has very good benefits, so it's worth to work there. Most companies this days have layoffs, so that should not deter anyone. I was there 9yrs, although my department changed twice to different companies. These companies worked out of Prudential. So I ended up doing 16 years there."
good,Good place to work if you have an entrepreneurial mindset. Management was excellent and was always involved to help you advance your skills and career.
good,It was a great fast paced job. I was on the trading floor so there was always alot of noise and yelling. The brokers are very stressed out and loud. I loved it.
good,Great company that takes care of their employees. Great benefits and pay. Room for growth inside the company and very well driven. Paid time off is more then an average company.
good,Start the day with morning meetings to ensure all associates were up to date on changes within the company. Office was set up to be relaxing to help the associates better perform their jobs. One of the hardest parts of the job is having to deal with clients that do not fully understand the policies that they purchased. The associates that I worked with made everyday going to work enjoyable.
good,"Straight commission job.  If your willing to sell to those who don't mind (or don't know of) the high fee structure for products offered, then you can make good money.  People are of good character who work for this company."
good,Been a while since I worked here. The company has undergone many changes especially in Jacksonville. They were very accomodating of my course load and schedule while in school.
good,"My position at Pru was one of those in which I had tremendous responsibility but almost no authority, and I was dealing with Institutional Investor rated analysts, who can be imperious."
good,High volume paperwork with separated departments and managers.  Some lack of communication.  Probably would have had a better experience in a different department.
good,"Môi trường làm việc thân thiện, chuyên nghiệp, có tính kỉ luật cao."
good,"Management and culture were great. Could not ask for better colleagues. Unfortunately, there is very little room for advancement and you can become easily burned out in just about a year.  Ability to work from home when needed and flexibility with hours that you work dependent upon region you cover.  Must be passionate about retirement planning. Best part of your day is the people you work with. Not a cut throat environment by any means. Management genuinely cares about you. Hardest part of the job is actually having the time to sell and do your job without having to put out fires and be tied up with hours of useless and pointless admin work."
good,This job paid a decent salary. I was able to raise my son on it. The benefits were also good. Working with the employees was a great experience.  Great place to work.
good,You'll have to be productive constantly and extensively to get paid. Great benefits.  Colleagues and culture as well as support from the company are good.
good,Being in management was ok if you could meet your numbers and got along with the right people. The onboarding programs changed so often it was difficult to recruit and retain top talent.
good,"I learned many thing when I worked at Prudential.  The people were wonderful and always willing to help anyone on the team, as well as the clients who called in.  Management listened to all concerns and looked for solutions to those concerns.  I enjoyed my time while working there."
good,"It is a great learning experience, the information and challenges are rewarding."
good,"Proof data feed from multiple sources. Produce multiple tax documents for tax filing. Ensure applicable taxes withheld from claim payments are correct. Report withheld taxes to Corporate. "
good,"I worked temp positions throughout this organization. I primarily worked independently as a Admin Assistant. I learned how to process travel vouchers and set up calendar meetings for the first time, and although I did not particularly care too much for that task, I always received the nicest compliment on the task itself."
good,"Decent company to work for. Pay is great and co-workers are wonderful. Recently the dept I worked in laid off it's entire team. Obtaining another position within the company was impossible. If you apply for a position which you are clearly qualified for 9 times out of 10 your going to get a response that your not qualified. So with that being said I don't see how there is room for advancement with this company. Unless your one of the managers ""favorites"" don't look for anything extra in area of ""special projects"" But if you want a normal 9 to 5 with a good work/life balance then this is the place for you."
good,the hardest part is that its very political..(but thats everywhere). The people are nice and management is fine as long as you get your work done
good,"As a System Coordinator each morning I would log on my computer and start to run my jobs for clients to update their benefit package from Prudential ( health,dental, and vision insurance). I learn how to assess the needs of professional clients through meetings, e-mails, and phone conversations. As long as our work was complete in a timely manner (two days) their were no problems with management. I enjoyed working with my co-workers as much they enjoyed working with me. When Prudential started to have layoffs things changed. Less people more work, and they were dissolving my department. Everything was being sent to Jacksonville Fl.. What I enjoyed the most about my job in System's area was running my jobs."
good,Was a great place to work.  Only thing was to short wish I was permanent and not with temp agency. Hours of work just perfect. Like the over time. The pay was just right. Meme we some times were challenging.
good,"Strong culture, flexible work schedule, and option to develop soft and hard skills.  Significant history in promoting from the outside though strong emphasis on current employee skill development."
good,"Working at Prudential was extremely helpful to my career and family. I was able to purchase Life Insurance and retirement packages for my family.  Prudential paid in full for my licenses for selling insurance and investment products.  I got to work with a lot of experience investment managers and professional staff.  "
good,Most individuals or teams do not want to work collaboratively with any other team for fear that their work may be taken away due to previous experiences. They also do not want to help with other areas because they do not want it to become their job in the future. There is a massive amount of distrust between departments that is hard to deal with.
good,Good company to work for but leads were not provided and you had to rely on friends and family to build your own business initially.  When you did get some unaligned clients you would ask them if there was someone that could use the services that you just provided to them.  You had to constantly have a pipeline of prospects to see and make sales or you got no pay check and went into arrears and would owe them money for a cubical space and would have to start paying Prudential to work for Prudential.
good,San Diego regional office. Lot's of camaraderie with colleagues. Make your own schedule but 100% commission. Financial services can be challenging to say the least.
good,Great place to work after already establishing network and capital.  Hard environment to succeed in right after college.  Set as many meetings as possible and truly create your own brand.
good,"Good management of my group and the equity trading division."
good,"My own immediate office is great (super supportive and caring boss, friendly and cooperative coworkers), but the company overall is disorganized and inefficient."
good,"Environment"
good,"I love working there this is where I got my start paying claims. I learned a lot about claims, insurance  and other things, I really don't remember that much about management. the hardest thing about working in insurance you are good  and about two years later you being bought out by some other company. First job I worked at that actually had maternity leave. The hardest part was every time you were bought out you did not know if you were going to have a job or not."
good,"The job is not a bad place to work. the operation managers are nice and willing to work around your hours. the sites they give can vary on the number of miles your willing to drive, but they wont give you anything absurd. job security. as for moving up in the company however, I have displayed interest in learning as much as i can to move up but to no avail"
good,"worked claims calling insureds and doctors, reviewing and paying claims. i learned how to pay claims, how to review medical information, different aspects of the insurance business behind the scenes not selling it. being a team player...etc"
good,"Tôi đã học được nhiều thủ thuật máy tính mà trước đây tôi chưa từng sử dụng. Công việc mới lạ làm tôi cảm thấy thích thú. Đồng nghiệp của tôi rất gòa đồng, họ luôn giúp tôi mỗi khi không hiểu vấn đề gì."
good,"I loved my job at Prudential, however, in my opinion, you are just a number in the system. Even though I was in Management, I didn't feel like a Manager. I felt as though I was going  through the motion of doing my job."
good,"Find prospects and design financial plans using various insurance and financial products. Cold calling and referrals are crucial. Marketing, fuel and entertainment costs are high."
good,"Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job is working alongside my colleagues and learning from them."
good,"Acquired excellent skill set not limited to marketing, financial assessment and planning, interpersonal relationships and communication development"
good,"Took calls in que."
good,"I enjoy working for Prudential. My job allows me to have a flexible schedule, they have good benefits, and the work enviornment is laid back."
good,"I knew nothing about insurance when I started at this job. I had to go through a very intensive training program, which lasted, I believe, about 6 weeks. I was taught all about all types of insurance (at that time they were mostly deductible/co-insurance type plans) and also medical terms and ""lingo"". At the end of my training, I was assigned to the ""mult-company"" floor, which meant instead of only one plan being paid on every claim that came in for a large company (American Airlines, for example), the floor I was on paid claims for many companies, which meant each claim I picked up was potentially paid differently. Eventually I was assigned 3 or 4 ""special groups"", which means I was the only person paying claims and answering calls for that company. I worked my way up, learning how to process COB (coordination of benefits) claims and also medicare COB claims. I very much enjoyed this job, especially working with my special groups. I got to know the company representatives well. I loved resolving difficult claims for people. I loved doing what we called ""bomb"" claims, which we got mostly at the end of the year or beginning of the new year when people would send in a years worth of claims in one huge envelope and the whole thing had to be sorted out, separating each persons things, then each doctor, each pharmacy, all in date order. Those type claims were the hardest but also the most enjoyable."
good,Good place to work if you like to work at a slower pace. Not very high demand work. Good atmosphere. Cordial co workers and upbeat management.
good,Wonderful people to work with and still maintain their relationship.
good,"Prudential has great training classes provided, Great office locations, Very knowledgeable team leaders, Everything is very accessible from contracts to fax machines."
good,"I performed miscellaneous tasks such as responding to phone inquiries, data entry, maintaining client files, preparing mailings and organizing for sale books. Co-workers were friendly and always looked out for one another."
good,"The company has a good culture, however due to extreme change, job security is low. People are afraid and unsure about the future of the company and their future with it."
good,Great company to work for when I began my job in 1998 but company culture has changed over the years and tenure is no longer valued or appreciated. Opportunities for advancement are only open those who have an established relationship with management.
good,It was okay. Can't complain too much.  Management was adequate.  Hours were good.  Good benefits.  Work was somewhat challenging.  Will be leaving due to relocation of work.
good,My time at Prudential was a positive experience.  Many opportunities to grow and learn the business.  The culture is very friendly and most managers have an open door policy.
good,The culture changed drastically once JP Morgan Chase took control.  Things changed for the worse.  The Prudential people were looked down upon.  Prior to this time it was the best job I ever had.  Lots of room for advancement and recognition.
good,Very challenging to earn a good living.  100% commission based.  Culture is family oriented but support service for your business is lacking.  Without a built in lead list of your own it will be hard to earn a good living.
good,"The pay is 100% commissioned so the job security is not very stable. Really need persistence and a temporary income safety net in order to launch a practice, it just takes time."
good,I would not chose to leave this company nor this role but my position was eliminated during cost cutting time and I really have nothing more I wish to say.  it is great if you are a financial services professional or the like.  They pay well and most positions are bonus eligible based on one's salary.
good,Prudential is a good stable company with a nice culture. The position I had with the company was very low-paying which was my main complaint. The work was also repetitive and boring. Management was fail
good,Working with Prudential Financial was very flexible because you pick your own hours. But the position itself was very competitive and pressurizing.
good,"Prudential was a great company to work for which allowed you to move up in the company. My co workers were good people, for the most part we got along pretty good. Management kept us aware of changes within the company. The downside is they do a  lot of layoffs."
good,"	Identified the need and designed, developed and implemented a Monitoring System that provided status of various subsystems, lines, controllers, devices, and processes on a dashboard. This resulted in reducing down-time by 50%. "
good,Great company to put on your resume. Management opportunities.
good,"worked up to assitant manager from a branch clerk using my skills listed below"
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and the benefits were very good. My direct team was a great group of designers and fun to work with.
good,"My work day started at 7:00 AM and I would check my e-mail, look at the work that had to be done that day and plan accordingly. I was responsible for the dissemination of funds to Pension plan sponsors. I calculated the interest due and sent out the funds via bank wire. I also was responsible for various other office responsibilities"
good,Great company to work for if you have the right management.  Benefits are ok.  Lead distribution is great.  Not a lot of training.  You are expected to learn the industry on your own.
good,"if you look forward to changing your career in a very smooth and well manner there's just one place. Prudential is the world’s largest audience and insights platform, providing researchers and marketers with immediate access to consumers and automated insights tools to make faster, better decisions. Instantly is based in Los Angeles, with offices in the United States,"
good,My job nature work as a secretary. I learned how to fulfill client expectation and my boss expectation. The most hardest part is to learn how to coordinate with other district office assistance and work in paperless office.
good,"As a real estate agent, pay was based on commissions only. "
good,As a mother they were always willing to work with me. In my department I was able to work from home. My job was stressful because the workloads were high but overall it as a good job.
good,"Môi trường làm việc thoải mái, trẻ trung năng động"
good,"Great internship program, went really fast. Worked on various projects for managers"
good,manager sucked all the fun out of working there and made me feel that i could not do anything right. i would recomend working here only if you get along with your manager
good,Company was very rigid.  Hard to implement changes. Was brought in to implement transportation department.  9/11 terrorist attacks occurred which put the brakes on any changes.   Company did offer stock options at the time they went public.   Good 401K program and liberal policy in regards to taking time off.
good,"Great place to work, always had incentives. Always had challenges with rewards. The most stressfull time of the day was close to four pm when the bell to the stock market would ring. Agents would call in two min before the close of business to move funds around. everything had to be processed and repeated back before the final close."
good,I did not work here very long. I felt a sales position was not the route for me.
good,"Most companies look for ""quick learning"" or ""self-driven"" employees, and this is a reasonable thing to look for. Unfortunately, Prudential takes this to an extreme, with incredible expectations for their employees. Prudential has an excellent commission structure for fully licensed individuals but struggles to really help you find success when you are struggling. I moved on and found success at a company in the same industry. Learning their systems is convoluted and takes a long time to learn without the assistance that other companies give you."
good,This would have been a good opportunity had the contract ran the full 2 months due to having a set department for 1 concern and them not advertising this well enough not enough calls came through not allowing employees to reach their full potential which resulted in cointracts being cut short
good,Answer at least 60 calls a day
good,保險跑數追quota，識人多有好處，就係咁多，仲可以有乜寫吖，靠佣金收入囉，搵人買保險與及投資基金等
good,"I worked for many financial advisors, making quality appointments for them.  Typically, these financial advisors advanced themselves since I worked for them. Terese Doherty"
good,"Was to make sure that all the information sent in by the agent, broker and doctors was with the customer insurance files. Made sure that customer medical inforation was reviewed in a timely manner."
good,"I would go through cases in the system and analyze to make sure they were in line with Prudential and government guidelines. If there was anything wrong, I would call sales to contact the customers to get the corrections"
good,Unbalanced and not cultural diversed workplace and Lack of respect my managements.
good,"It is good place to work, good benefits, all  depend on your manager, VP you work for. Solid company, work life balance is good, again depending on the team you work for."
good,"nesta empresa só se recebe quem trabalha, o problema que os superiores são forçados a te deixar sem vida para atingir metas."
good,"If you are able to make the driving short, and have a rather large natural market, this is the job for you.  Unlimited income, as well as the opportunity to grow."
good,"My position just wasn't quite what I thought it was going to be. I ended up as a high paid meeting scheduler, and that just isn't what I like to do. It didn't work out."
good,Prudential is good company for which to work.  It offers superb benefits and personal time off.  Its mission is clear and its earnings growth is excellent.
good,"Overall and great company to work for.   Plenty of training and encourage to succeed.  Tough job since, pay is dependent upon how much and effort you put into your career.  "
good,"As a new Real Estate Agent a typical day involved:"
good,"Prudential is a great company to work for. The company offer medical, dental and vision benefits. Prudential offer tuition to all full-time employees."
good,"Strong company with great fundamentals. Your ""success and lack there of"" is absolutely a team effort. You must buy into the culture in order to succeed or you can easily find yourself an outcast like most legacy corporate positions."
good,Good place to start your career.  Good benefit. Good social / community and corporate responsability program.  Would definately look into other opportunities.
good,"I loved being able to help people with their planning needs for the future.  I loved being able to set my own schedule.  However....working on commission only is not easy and the company really has not made that any easier on anyone.  If you do not strive to own your own business in your own office they really don't work with you as much.  Some people really don't want the hassles of your own office. "
good,"Coordinated the development of annual, quarterly and any reforecasted budgets requirs for the Operation and Systems Group. "
good,During my years here I learned and worked in many departments.  I learned and was advanced slowing.  I trouble shoot for every departments that I work for.
good,"Pros:  Large, diverse company."
good,Call clients to show properties.
good,"Monitoring and driving production and quality of a team of 13 case handlers assessing sales of Annuities to determine they had been executed in line with TRASP requirements and where non-compliant outcomes were identified, bespoke letters were generated and the redress  calculated correctly to ensure a fair outcome for customers. I worked closely with QC to identify any knowledge gaps, and ensured learnings from feedback were rolled out to facilitate a better understanding. I was required to produce high level and granular MI to evidence management of the project requirements, and to provide mitigation for any deficits in my team output from both a quality and production perspective."
good,"It was a temporary assignment, work was fast paced and required a lot of concentration and knowledge. I would recommend this company to anyone seeking employment"
good,"A typical day included a lot of phone coverage, customer client calls, computer work and general office work."
good,"Pro: good compensation and benefit, education support, nice bonus, nice people"
good,"A great place to work on the east coast.  Change is good when you have had the chance to leverage your opportunities and gone through the proper change management modules to prepare for organizational restructuring.  I believe when you land in the right organization within this enterprise, you can grow."
good,Prudential allows for movement within the company to help employees discover the right spot.  The managers encourage movement within the company and raises are plentiful.
good,Benefits and pay are nice. Work life balance is nice. Can be very stressful. No room for promotion or growth. Weak management team. Some of the co-workers are great to work.
good,I learned a lot  about running my own business.  I can not say more due to company regulations. I hope you understand that I am just typing to be able to move to the next box. Thanks.
good,I was with this company for 14 years.    They are now known as Berkshire Hathaway!   Overall it was a good company however no room for advancement or salary increases.
good,This is a great place to work if you have a business or accounting background. Their benefits package is exceptional as well as their compensation package.
good,The Mohawk valley is a very hard place to start a career in financial services.  No really large or quick opportunities so expect to take 10-15 years before you make a livable wage.
good,"public company reducing costs led to outstanding associates positions being eliminated"
good,prudential was the my first position in the insurance field.  I was a temporary employee but spent a vast amount of time with this company it introduced me to the corporate world
good,fair place to work great pay and benefits very long hiring process work life balance needs work they require a great deal of travel you must hit all of your goals
good,"Lots of changes happening at the moment, both good and maybe not so good, depending on where you sit in the organization, or how long you've been there. For a company used to the old and true methods, this is shaking up a lot of ""comfortable"" employees. The company does a lot for the surrounding communities and does have great potential to do more in the financial services space if change strategies are successfully executed."
good,One will surely be exposed to a high level of international corporate culture here. There are plenty of oportunities to expand your career in the financial arena.
good,Good company just had a bad manager who was eventually barred from FINRA.  It comes with some upfront capital but 100% commission.  No book of business some you have to bring clients or cold call.
good,MD did not need Executive Assistant. Was hired as a temporary assistant however there was not enough workload or pay in the budget to keep me on. Good environment though
good,"Experience depends on management. Promotions largely based on ""ability to be seen"" regardless of actual skills and achievements. Mentoring program is dormant."
good,I would come in and work with the team on what was to be done for the day and start on that. I usually ran cables and did most of the moves adds and changes there. I ran a cabling team of 4 people and we did all of the cabling for the DC and all of the floors for the complex. Hardest part where some late nights doing power downs or power ups after power maintenance. The most enjoyable part was the folks I worked with. We where a true team!
good,"Prudential was an awesome place to work. Lots of top producing agents. Great meetings, very informative. We were kept up to date on the real estate markets ups and downs. Management was great before the shut down of the company. That was the hardest part of the job, was informing agents that our office/company would be closing. Most enjoyable part of the job was recruiting great agents and seeing their business grow."
good,Overall a good place to work. Not too many complaints. Nice people. Pay wages could be better and the opportunity to grow in the company could be better. I would recommend for a started job
good,"I enjoy having a good work/life balance, but it is too slow-paced of an environment for me in operations. People can be there for 20+ years at the company and still be at junior management levels. It is not a place where I feel like I needed to get the education I did for the job I do. If that is something you are looking for, it can be the place for you. If you are like me and want to be challenged, I suggest otherwise."
good,"Môi trường làm việc rất ok. Tuy nhiên thì nếu để phát triển cùng cty thì rất khó vì mức thu nhập quá bấp bênh, đãi ngộ kém. Nuôi được bản thân khó khăn."
good,Fun place to work in. Various courses provided during working hours. Very beneficial and chances to grow knowledge. Opportunities to learn independently.
good,I was extremely happy during my short time with Prudential. I left Pru when an opportunity that was too good to pass up was presented to me with another firm.
good,The culture at Prudential was very good. I worked there for quite a few years and many of my peers were like family. I knew everyone's name and got to mentor quite a few young people.
good,"The upsides are unlimited earnings potential, terrific support and training. Top management is accessible and responsive to concerns. Nice benefits package. Fair commission structure. Pru also reimburses 100% of the cost of licensing and required certification when onboarding, as well as additional certifications for successful pros. You've got to bust your butt to make any real money - but I've seen high five-figure commissions on single life policy."
good,I learned that you need to be able to rely on one another and work as a team in order to perform your job well.  You will also need to rely on yourself as other departments are not as willing to assist you as it it is a busy work environment.
good,"Plenty of mobility to move around within the firm but this needs to done by you, not much help from management. With 10 years of experience with the firm, I have diverse view on management and I can say some are better than others. Compensation is relatively pretty good and competitive to NYC firms. But that also depends on the part of the organization, I know mid-back office guys are not paid well but they stay forever because the firm is in jersey and benefits are far better with better work life balance. Alot of lifers here."
good,"Prudential treats their employees very well.  I have increased my knowledge of Excel, Essbase, Oracle, model creation, forecasting, and budgeting."
good,"Owned rental property at the time and be able to balance out both was great. Working on clients paper and phone calls. When business was slow, The great part was the phones kept ringing at times."
good,"Calling prospects into the buy or sale of their real estate properties."
good,I think this is a great place to work.  The work like balance is not too bad and most of the people are very nice.  I am currently a little unhappy because I choose a new job but the description is not what the job turned out to be.
good,"would walk into the office, go to my boss's mailbox and would pick up his mail take it to his office get my to-do list and do whatever i had to do. i would make an calls that i needed to do, i would make copies, i would handle some of his clients.anything he needed i was there to assist. Got along with everyone there"
good,"My days started  about 7:30am but wouldn't end utill 10:00 pm I learned a great deal about people. I was in upper management but I found that the Vice Presidents and Presidents I worked for were quite ruthless but I seemed to be able to work for them inspite of them. The co-workers were great except for the ones not doing there jobs and replacing them was a fact of life. The hardest part was letting poor producers go. The job status was great. I came from a very poor family and now I was Mr. Bolton, but more important than that I helped my workers enjoy higher levels of income to take hone to thier families that was truly the best part."
good,No two days were the same.  Able to learn how to work with a variety of business systems.  Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the amount of work that was coming in from the agents.   I loved being able to help fellow employees.
good,"Prudential is a great brand, a great company that offers work/life balance, diversity and overall good culture. "
good,Hardest part of the job was following orders that you did not agree with especially during the evolution of the mobile world which required re-engineering.
good,"My typical consists of filing,and coding claims, I learn that the purpose of coding the claims, was for the patients to understand what the charge's was made and what they were, My so-workers was good,and professional, the hardest part was remembering the codes,but the atmosphere was good."
good,"một ngày bắt đầu bằng việc check các hợp đồng đã nộp và giải quyết các khiếu nại của khách hàng"
good,"Prudential has wonderful products and services to be offered to our customers.  We pride ourselves on providing excellent customer service.  The company is inclusive and diverse, and has afforded me the opportunities to grow as an employee and manager during my time with the company."
good,"a nice office, help desk very supportive. great opportunity to improve working skills by introducing classes useful to the business and everyday life."
good,"Redundancy and resources could be more focused. Technology ""user"" but too much drilling required for basic information.  Nimble no, solid yes it's Prudential!."
good,The culture at Prudential is very relaxed but can be stressful at times depending on the department. The job that I have is very seasonal so during the summer months there isn't much to do but year end is stressful and long hours are required.
good,"My role was very varied "
good,"I like the culture and management at Prudential, but am looking for an opportunity with more steady income and workload. I've been excited to work as a team leader at Prudential."
good,"Large enough firm to offer mobility opportunities; highly ethical"
good,Supportive managers and a great environment of employees made working in difficult situations a little easier. I loved my experience.  Too bad it was just a temporary position during tax time.
good,Good work environment with lots of Pru Perks.  People are great and the office was located close to my home.  I would love to get back into Prudential.
good,"Good:  "
good,"I became a Prudential employee as a result of an acquisition of The Hartford. I was an Underwriting Manager at The Hartford and was one of the employees selected to move to Prudential.  Therefore, some of the questions asked do not apply."
good,"Good:"
good,"I enjoyed my time with Prudential.  The work culture was very engaging and employees were rewarded appropriately.  Management was transparent with their communications and I knew what was expected of me.  The benefits were great the workplace culture encouraged a healthy work/life balance, which I greatly appreciated."
good,My 20 years spent at Prudential were fulfilling and provided multiple opportunities for growth.   Prudential helped build my financial services knowledge with an expertise in life insurance.
good,"Prudential was a great first job just out of college... I learned a lot about managing projects and people, and had the opportunity to go on several interesting business trips."
good,"I only worked there a very brief time but from what I saw while I was there, Prudential is a great company. They are very friendly, professional people with a great culture."
good,Good company.  Lots of people were kin to each other at the time I was there.  One of the most enjoyable part of the job was the friends I made and the people I worked with.
good,"Since 1875, tens of millions of people have relied on Prudential for"
good,It is all about who you know and not necessarily what you know. The team that I was involved in was not a healthy environment as people were constantly backbiting one another.
good,"A company with traditional values and corporate culture; operate with solid, tried and true processes, albeit cumbersome at times. Making a good effort transforming its way of doing business, and creating new business opportunities."
good,"The company has gone through a lot of change in the past two years.    Along with that, those who play the political game well have thrived, sometimes at the expense of those who have been doing the actual work.  Still, it's a great place to learn and there is a ton of opportunity for anyone at a junior level."
good,"O crescimento profissional na Prudential pode ser considerado limitado pela própria estrutura, onde para entrar na área comercial, é preciso ser na forma de franquia. Empresa que permite uma certa autonomia na forma de trabalhar, garantindo um retorno financeiro atrativo. Porem, ao mesmo tempo, impõe sua cultura sem flexibilizar com as percepções individuais de seus parceiros."
good,I would get in by 8:00 AM and take a look at emails that came overnight. By 8:30 AM I would head to the cafeteria to grab breakfast from the newly update cafeteria. From then on I would work until 1pm. Following lunch I would work until 5pm.
good,"Great company to work for, people are very aspiring and motivating.Learning and keeping up with the pace is the key to success.Good company culture which treats the employers as part of the family"
good,Very scary. With my size and where i live it was very challenging. Cool hours and places i was stationed. Met alot of people with good resources. First job so taught me alot of responsibility with making sure things are done by the book. Wasnt many mistakes made.
good,"The company is great to work, but may not be that rewarding and providing enough compensation to who deserves.  Good work/life balance offered to those who needed,"
good,I left employment at Prudential Financial to pursue a career at American Trust Retirement to further my goals of becoming a Relationship Manager in the Retirement field.
good,"I worked at Prudential Securities for about 17 year although the pay was less the desirable, the firm provided numerous opportunities for career training and paid community service. During my time at the firm "
good,Prudential offers great benefits and options to move forward in your career. They have programs to aid in your career development and options for training.
good,"If you are into finding clients to work with on investment, insurance, retirement planning and more, then Prudential will compensate you well. There is a degree of patience involved."
good,"Excellent for independent people with a lot of experience in the sales culture. Drawbacks are that compensation is highly seasonal, as you depend 100% on client meetings for compensation. Summer and holidays are difficult. Must use your own resources to drive distances to meet clients at their homes."
good,Nothing is too much to ask. People are very nice and would consider there again in the future. The offices are kept clean and tidy and the working environment is nice. The views are lovely but I would say that the cafe layout needs improvement in respect of the queuing and payment of the food.
good,Prudential is an enjoyable place to work. The work environment is challenging and encourages engagement and a culture of learning. I would recommend it to others.
good,This was a temporary assignment that I obtained through a temp agency named Corporate Brokers. I worked at this organization for about a year before it came to an end.
good,"Prudential is overall a great place to work. Most people have been there for 15 years or 5 years. That shows the the company at most is decent. If I had the opportunity to go back, I would."
good,opportunities to advance. typically slow to make decisions given the culture. good people. company emphasizes corporate citizenship and supporting the community.
good,"No micromanagement, but deadlines are competitive. Currently manage and coordinate all aspects of productions while coordinating with five producers and multiple vendor departments in developing production schedules; booking locations, and confirming crew. "
good,awesome place to work! The benefits are really great and everyone within the company is very helpful and friendly. You are offered the opportunity to work from home which allows you to maintain a work/life balance
good,The best part of working at Prudential is work/life balance and the people you work with. I took an average of 2 hours of work home with me everyday. On call once every 4-6 weeks for 7 days. They try to stay up on technology.
good,Politics gave my job to someone being relocated who they had to pacify. They wanted me to stay on and help her run the position so I left. She failed six months later and had to be escorted out. Their political problem solved.  This occurred during demutualization.
good,"1.Good Working Culture."
good,"Great SLT, but lacking in compensation and career advancement on their sales desk. Looking to transition into a leadership role within the company or potentially to a new company and/or industry."
good,Majority of time spent in the field addressing provider concerns or working on network development/expansion type projects. Learned a lot while there.
good,On a day to day basis you will spend most time traveling to clients as well as meetings with other financial professionals. The rest will be doing paperwork and looking for new leads.
good,"as far as your working hard you get paid well"
good,Overall benefits were competitive based on the industry.  Industry related courses are paid for almost entirely so you can advance to get your major or industry related certifications.
good,Prudential was a really great company to grow your retail book of business in early 2000.  The office had several well established brokers that were always available for advice.
good,"môi trường làm việc tốt, năng động................"
good,"Was a good, 24 year progressive career at Prudential.  Learned so much to prepare me for various job functions and roles that challenged me and helped my professional growth."
good,A typical day is slow. I learned to network more often. Management courses are necessary for managers. There is a lack of leadership skill. Hardest part of the job is not knowing if your position is secure. Most enjoyable part is the perks and discounts a employee.
good,"Ok , another company I worked for in my youth . Seriously there should be an option to skip these company reviews ."
good,"At  Prudential Insurance Company was  Financial Advisor and customer service with very long hours and driving all over the city."
good,"Productive and nice place to work. Nice people, good learning experience. People are friendly and always willing to help when needed. Team oriented place."
good,"Very Competitive Environment "
good,"In my view, it is different working environment. There is always new things to learn from each company, management has different style to work. Very friendly environment."
good,most of the work consists of calling people. It was rewarding but very difficult with all of the new changes going on with DOL. You must get a little bit lucky with this job and pay is very inconsistent.
good,This was a part time evening job. The management and staff were all very nice and willing to help. I left this position to pursue full time employment.
good,I have not worked for this company in almost 10 years.  I was located in Minnesota and I do not have anything negative to say about this organization. I typically do not comment on an organization if I have been away from it for an extended period of time since the culture and management would have changed during my time away.
good,"I learned so much about life insurance and the different forms needed.  We rotated jobs so we got to know every different aspect of the Company.  This included reinstatements, overdue accounts, daily balancing and deposits to the bank"
good,Company claims to give you the tools to be successful but ultimately its up to you to develop your skills and become a better salesman. Business model is outdated.
good,Many hours traveling to see clients. Can be difficult to get your personal business up and running. Long days. Great management team. You pretty much make your own hours.
good,It was great working for Prudential many years back. I believe it is still a great company to work for where employees are rewarded for their skills and hard work.
good,Company was concerned about making sure their agents were trained by offering various seminars and training sessions. Company was active in ensuring success for its agents.
good,"Claims processing"
good,"I was very busy most of the time. Worked in App Support. Phone calls when issues occurred. Also did On-call support once a month or sometimes once every 6 weeks. Sometime they would make you feel like you weren't doing enough even though you would do everything in your power to resolve something. Good benefits, 401k, and pension."
good,"Remuneração agressiva pra quem está disposto a trabalho duro;"
good,"The working relation between staff and management was close."
good,The company I always respected due to their strong financial standing in the insurance industry. Worked with them on the general brokerage aspect of my career.  I found the claims aspect of the career to be very stressful and did not feel management supported their employees and allow the intensive research required to be effective and were more interested in their call time limits as opposed to providing the necessary research documentation to be an effective claims processor
good,"We had a great business in place, though management grew faster than revenues. Would have been a great place if we could have withstood a down turn in the market"
good,"Was not what I was looking for as it is more of a financial business.."

good,Good company with great benefits.  IT projects are numerous and opportunities abound in many areas to work across BUs.  People are generally interested and excited about the work they are doing.  Collaboration is part of the culture.
good,"The environment offers experience dealing with customers and candidate applications, basic data entry and communications via Lotus Notes, Fax and Telephone. Management staff varied from being easy going to very strict, overall very professional environment. Hardest part of the job is staying focused and following through with monotonous tasks for extended periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it was not typically unpredictable, dangerous or physically debilitating although sitting for elongated periods of time staring at computer screens."
good,A large corporation with efficient managers who were ready to come out field during insurance sales and presentation. It was a very  competitive field.
good,"Must be highly motivated, organized, tenacious, hard-working. Training needs improvement, set your own schedule, great earning potential."
good,"There were many pro's to working there - young environment, everyone made money. However, the culture was not always in the best interest of the client - in my opinion. Too much focus on annuities and not enough legitimate focus on the client."
good,"Wonderful employees, managers, and director. As an intern I had a great experience learning different aspects of the insurance industry. The downside was how repetitive it became. I did learn a lot, but after being there for more than 5 months I didn't have anything new to do."
good,"I learned to be a very organized person and a great leader. Me and my co-workers get along well. Management is very good to me and my fellow co-workers. I enjoy coming to work and get on the job right away and other than that I like talking, laughing and interacting with my fellow co-workers."
good,I worked on a large systems conversion project as I was graduating from university. Worked with a great group of underwriters who always took the time to explain the business in terms of the system. Awesome experience.

good,This Company division allows independent producers grow business following a training program. Peers and management are willing to help.
good,Just like any other insurance sales position you get what you put into it. If you willing to put in 60+ hour work weeks for the few years it will pay off but it can be trying and difficult

good,Its an okay place. All work no fun. Very demanding. Boss was extremely stuck up and never really worked unless it was for her big clients
good,"Prudential in Shelton is always ranked among the top places to work in CT and is not hard to see why.  They do a good job of understanding their employee's need for a good work life balance.  I will say however that for a sales organization, it is not super competitive. It is not like any other sales organization I have been associated with in that regard. This is not a bad thing.  There is very strong sense of comrodery among its associates."
good,Lot of cold callings and field marketing all day but good part was getting to go out meet the clients and talk and discuss about their needs for helping them to set their future secured was the best part.
good,As a Broker Associate I was an independent contract as all real estate agents in California. I developed and worked my own business plan.

good,"Working for Prudential was an opportunity to learn about the sale of insurance and investment products.  As a District Manager for the company a typical day centered on making calls to prospective customers and setting up appointments with interested individuals.  Management was instrumental in helping new recruits during the first months develop as productive sales representatives.  In meeting with potential clients. it was a representative's responsibility to ascertain their needs and to present investment/insurance products that may help them to reach their goals.  The most difficult part of the job may very well have been developing new clients, but once I was able to make the appointments and begin to fulfill their financial needs, it was rewarding."

good,Great place to work. I had an administrative role and marketing which gave me experience in the industry.
good,Company liked to hire people with no experience and then train them. I learned a lot in my time there. What I didn't particularly like was that the jobs are so specialized. I did the same thing day in and day out.
good,Everyone was always friendly and willing to help. If you're willing to learn something then someone will be more than willing to teach you. It's a very team-oriented atmosphere which was great.

I sometimes did the lease signings and occasionally performed credit and background checks of prospective tenants.  I would assist the senior property manager with any necessary legal action.  The senior property manager and the owner/broker of the real estate company are both wonderful people to work for. The hardest part of the job would have to have been evictions.  The most enjoyable part of the job was offering great service to customers and owners to meet their needs."

good,"A typical day at work at Prudential included taking on average 50 calls, also included team meetings three times a week. Also, once a month, we had one on one meetings with management to review performance. I learned extensive information about annuities, tax, and also money management. Working with the employees at Prudential was great, everyone was always willing to help and provide assistance at any point in time. The hardest part of my job was learning all the new information that I wasn't previously knowledgable on. We had three months of training, which I can say was the toughest part of my job. The most enjoyable part of working at Prudential was the people around me, and just being able to learn all the new information I learned and be so knowledgable about it now."

good,"a fast paced environmnet, during summer full time plus hours, learned DPN, accounting system, immediate manager was very hands on but was relied on for everything from many departments so spread very thin.

good,My time with Prudential have been extremely beneificial to my long term career goals. I have gain a vast amount of knowledge and exposure.
good,I truly miss working at Prudential. I loved my job as a Quality Leader. I loved my coworkers. It was high stress but still a lot of fun. The pay was low and there were no benefits as it was a contract position. I feel that working directly for the company would have been better.
good,"Generally excellent company with very positive and open minded senior leadership at the executive level. There are however many, many levels of mid management that just bloat the company. Many of these people covet and protect what they have as a priority, more than promote what's best for the enterprise as a whole. You may feel quite safe and protected there, but this is an illusion to some, with routine rounds of downsizing that often affect workers first. Pay is good, benefits are excellent, if you can get in."
good,"Overall it's a great place to work.  They care about their employees and seek employee engagement. The company offers good benefits, retirement plans and a stock purchase plan."
good,"Very good work life balance and career training opportunities.  Lately have seen high turnover in senior management, thus the culture has been steadily changing.  Compensation is fair, but not top of the market."
good,Empresa extremamente focada em venda persuasiva com treinamento intensivo no ser humano. Gostei de participar do processo seletivo e de participar da equipe .
good,"Excellent place to work.  Associates are very collaborative.  Prudential is extremely committed to helping the community.  Have given a lot back to the City of Newark, where Prudential is headquartered.  Ethical company committed to doing business the right way.  Love their focus on diversity & inclusion.  Encourages associates to volunteer and give back."
good,"Great company to work"
good,"Prudential was a great place to work with great people, challenging work and great compensation.  Then they shook up senior management and started consolidating to save money over quality of work.  I would still recommend looking at Prudential but be sure to do your homework regarding the management team, culture and morale of the area you will be supporting."
good,"This was a job that tested, my medical knowledge greatly.  It was a fast paced, quota oriented operation. The hardest part of the job was maintaining production numbers, as I was a new mother at the time and sleep was at a premium"
good,unless your are BFF with your boss its a tough place to work.  The same folks get higher ratings and bonus every year.  Take the max bonus percentage they share and expect to maybe get half of that in a good year.
good,"Prudential is a big corporation and provides a lot of opportunities to move around. It is a pleasure to work in a new building at 655 Broad street. In addition, I do like the culture, the people and work environment here."
good,"therefore, cannot give a review given it has been many years ago.  i cannot recall any specific good or bad things working in prudential.  overall, it is quite similar to working at metlife."
good,"This was my very first ""grownup"" job.  I didn't have a real career starting out but fell into the types of jobs that became a career that I loved.  I started out as an administrative assistant in the Employee Benefits department but by the time I left I was administering benefits and have loved it ever since."
good,"I had a very good manager at Prudential.  She was clear about expectations, and kept me accountable.  There was a local office that was closed due to rental cost.  The result was a very stringent commute."
good,Prudential is a good solid company.  No complaints. In my opinion it is better to work in the area of Asset Management rather than the corporate office.
good,Pru is a good place to wok with a lot of good people to work with.  There are opportunities for associates to work on exciting and engaging projects.  I highly recommend this company.
good,This was my first real job working a full time schedule for a corporate firm. I learned a lot about the financial business and how the inner workings of wall street worked. It was very fast paced and educational at the same time.
good,"Prudential operates like a small company and large company at the same time. There is plenty of opportunity to take on new projects and create interesting work, but there are also very ridged protocols that no one is able to change. Each year the workload increases but funding and employees remains the same or is reduced.   Benefits and retirement is great, annual bonus and raise was about 5% each every year. Although overall the compensation is below market average."
good,"Unless you are a sales oriented person, this job is not for you!  Someone who is great at service will surely please the current prudential clients but will not make any money."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being mentored to advance my career.  Managers were very supportive of development and training that ultimately created opportunities.
good,Able to be entrepreneurial and have the resources required at my disposal to succeed.  Given exposure to experienced team members that I can rely on to help with any issue I may have
good,"worked remotely 3 out of 5 days"
good,Overall a good place to work if you're independent and ambitious. Essentially responsible for opening your own book of business and marketing it yourself.
good,"Overall I like working at Prudential. I like my hours (10-6pm) and short commute, I like the people, and am OK doing what I do. The environment is very stressful because of all the metrics on how we're judged. This is a universal complaint by most of my co-workers. Also, there is little opportunity for advancement and pay increases."
good,"When working at Prudential, you are expected to be connected by email, phone 24x7.  It can be stressful.  Even when taking a vacation, you might still be working.   "
good,Prudential was a great place to work.  You were treated with respect and are held accountable for your work.  Your experience at Prudential will of course change based on your manager or immediate supervisor.
good,"A typical day is to make appointments, and put together information for clients. Some days include updating procedures, reporting to management at least once a week. High turnover of employees."
good,"It is a good place to work and learn alot of things. I wnjoyed my time working there. The work and personal life is balanced, I enjoyed the company of my coworkers."
good,"I would of rated Prudential as an outstanding place to work prior to 2001. Once they went public the culture changed, Instead of long term vision it became quarter to quarter, kind of short sighted in the mission statement."
good,Great place to work for Sales/Financial Industry! Perfect for male looking to explore a role in the financial field. Learned a lot about annuities and retirement.
good,"Your whole job orbits around the management style of your superior.  This can swing your work week from 45 to 80 hours a week."
good,"Prudential was a company undergoing a tremendous amount of change when I left for a better opportunity. The company had strong benefits, numerous career opportunities and strong staff development programs."
good,"Good people to work with.  Senior agents were very helpful.  A lot of resources available, and education on products was steady.  Prudential decided to close the Duluth office."
good,Offers an opportunity to work while managing your home life.  Typical day is what you make of it.  Management offers support and leads.  Hardest part of the job is finding people to get in front of while the most enjoyable part is actually getting to meet those people.
good,"Prudential is one of those great names and great company to be associated with.  My time there was great, the advancement into different positions was tough."
good,The company is out of business. Coming  out of real estate school this company had a lot to offer especially continually education and a support team.
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar, possui problemas na gestão."
good,"It was good experience working with Capita India Pvt as senior executive, got to learn different types business strategies, team work, decision making."
good,"It was long time ago and I was a consultant, so my rating is not current. I was working for Pinkerton Consulting Company. It was good experience."
good,"Good salary, decent management, typical corporate culture.  However, you needed a liberal mentality to get promoted.  Very good for working mothers."
good,"Excellent advancement opportunities."
good,"The pay and bonuses are rewarding to those who are willing to work hard. The department I worked in was pretty antiquated. Could've used some automation to lessen the workload, but then that could lead to layoffs. Damned if they do, damned if they don't."
good,"I enjoyed working at Prudential, Everyone in sales were very positive. Management not so great. I loved working with the sales team and buyers and sellers helping them find their dream home."
good,"Great organization- pays well. Although they say they support work Life Balance, a typical day is 10-12 hours and very fast pace!"
good,"1. meeting and approach clients dairy."
good,"Good company to work for.  If anything came up where it was needed to leave work, Prudential was quite lenient when it came to time off."
good,Fun office to work for.  The only time we are required to be in the office is on Thursdays mornings where breakfast is always served.  Then we all head off to attend open house. Its a sales job...time is money. The harder you work the more rewarding.  The best part about being an agent is you get to see all the homes you wish you could see if you were not an agent.
good,Enjoyed my daily endeavors as they were constantly changing in accordance with the Managing Partner's schedule.  Learned to multi task at a higher level and improved my communications skills.
good,Supporting an advisor rather than doing all the sales-my main focus is managing the portfolios of the existing clients of the advisor. Great position but the income is not there to support my needs.
good,"entry level insurance sales. Lots of cold calling. If you can cultivate a relationship with a veteran agent, you'll be better off."
good,"The company was opening a new office. They started with a big open space in a commercial building.  While the office space was being created, we worked out of a little room. "
good,"Carrie Gandolfo and staff were amazing.  Such good women to work with and offered respect to everyone.  If I was able to go back and expand my horizon in terms of Real Estate, I definitely would."
good,"Prudential is a great company to work for. It has excellent benefits (salary, PTO, 401k, additional services) for your needs. Although you have to navigate yourself through different areas for career growth, I truly believe that you end up making useful connections through out your career at Prudential."
good,"As a financial consultant all days were different based on the market itself.  In the beginning, I spent a great deal of time working endless hours to build a client base and grow my business.  As things progressed, I spent a great deal of time working with my clients both in and out of the office.  I spent more time with Clients in their homes around the kitchen table, which gave them a sense of easiness and reduced feeling of pressure.  each morning, I would prepare for appointments and calls that needed to be made during the day.  Worked with my assistant to coordinate each days activities as well as attending morning meetings and most often Daily conference calls to keep informed of changes, new offerings and other information that may be pertinent to my clients.  When with a client we would review goals and needs and confirm that our course of action was meeting their goals and needs, both short and long term.  I truly enjoyed working and helping my clients achieve their goals and help them move towards their objectives and dreams.  My co-workers were a mix of old and young, but all willing to sit down and discuss ideas and lend support and guidance.  Manager was a hard nosed results oriented company individual, who believed everything the company sold, privatized brand,  was best for our clients."

good,"Enjoyed working at Prudential, I loved my co-workers and some of management. In order to move up in the company you have to get to know the right people which can be a crutch for others. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to help others and the hardest part of the job is when you cannot. "
good,Nice place to work.  The work life balance is not as good as it use to be

good,"good place to work, i keep myself active with the new products that i have to keep myself educated about. overall good place."
good,"The work environment maintained its steady daily, keeping the employees occupied an busy. I now have proficient education in insurance and annuities because of Prudential. Management was on top of administration and letting us know what to expect, majority of the co-workers I met at Prudential I have still maintained a cordial relationship with allowing me to network. A trying day for me would be surge areas when a product would change and the work volume would practically triple, although it was needed for overtime as well as making the day go by extremely fast by staying busy. However, I enjoy everything I learned while I was at Prudential and would recommend that as a place to work."
good,"Process contracts, proofread and maintain records for all transactions. Handle all incoming calls regarding escrows. Handle complaints and requests from clients in a timely fashion with tact and good judgment.

Coordinate real estate transactions between buyers, sellers, brokers, and agents. Handled transactions and communicated with more than 20 agents and hundreds of escrows."

I took 50 calls a day in which an average call was 10 to 15 minutes to resolve.I was trained in 6 depts and took calls from all six departments everyday. My co workers each had different skills depending upon their current knowledge and training.

I learned all aspects of real estate, contract writing, the inspection process and handling earnest money."
good,A lot of good co-workers there. Work varied daily based on calendar.
good,"Difficult sales job! HOWEVER, lots of room for growth and financial independence. I have taken the skills I've learned at Prudential and applied them to my professional development. I truly appreciate the training in networking and public speaking."
good,Overall ok place to work. Pay is faor but could be higher. Great benefits package. The work is boring and the days can drag but the people there help.

good,Prudential Financial is a company that is a solid performer in the market place.  They are not afraid to take risks to improve their services and support.
good,"They really did not have a lot of work for me, but the people there were really nice and fun. Also, they helped me with my communication skills on the phone."
good,Goal oriented culture and aims to make people better at what they do. The people motivate you to achieve your goal and you would be driven to success.
good,I worked with a lot of great people and the culture was fun.  Learned a lot and gained a tremendous amount of experience but no opportunity for enhancement.  Kept asking for more even after you did what they asked you too.
good,Definitely a solid old money and traditional workplace.  They do not move fast and are not able to modernize their policies or processes to stay ahead of more nimble companies.
good,Management is very old school and resistant to the changing work environment at other companies. Very high turnover. Very low growth opportunity. Pay significantly lower than competitors.
good,"Coworkers are what keep employees working there. Senior Management is not always engaged. However, the company offers excellent benefits and the location is ideal."

good,"Your attitude determines your altitude.  Your results are directly a factor of your ability to generate leads, follow through and close.  If you can set 8 -10 apps per week, which is the industry norm, you will be successful."
good,"I worked at Prudential for 19 years.  Initially when I joined it was still primarily a Mutual Insurance company.  Over the years as it transformed into a more broadly diversified financial firm the culture changed from a firm that you worked you entire career with to a culture similar to the major financial services firms with which it was seeking to more directly compete.  This was both a blessing and a curse.  The shift in culture made it a more dynamic and exciting place to work, however, it became much more competitive internally.  Ultimately, pay raises and opportunities for internal advancement became much more limited."
good,"I worked as a temp with Prudential and then became permanent. I was with them for 5 years processing short term disability claims."
good,No comment at this time as I am not interested in responding to this question and providing information about my job experience any Prudential.  Thank You.

good,"Prudential is a fun productive work environment, with opportunities for advancement. Prudential has a very well thought out work-life balance. And all work changes are inline with the employees in mind."
good,"I do like how they work and pursue new ways to tackle work flow on a daily basis. They have an open door policy for creative thinkers and they make it a point to be well informed about avenues before taking them. But the fact that they can take them if they so choose is very gratifying. "
good,"The company is very professional and well known in the industry."

good,"Really enjoyed working there but became ever increasingly metrics managed. Very good benefits, paid time off, opportunity to travel. Worked with good people generally."
good,Prudential is talent focused.  Culture is a little different between business units. My experience for the entire career has been with the Corporate Center.  Currently that focus is on cutting costs.
good,"Benefits and Comp are highly competitive.  Location is better than schlepping to Manhattan.  Huge company with lots of opportunities, if you're tapped for leadership you can go far."
good,"I have fond memories of my time working for Prudential.  The skills of my peers and immediate management were impressive and I made quite a few lasting relationships.  However, my time there was limited due to the sale of their healthcare services to another company and my position was eliminated."
good,Your experience depends on the department you work just like every other company. The people who you work with will impact the outcome of your success. It's corporate at the end of the day.
good,"Worked here many years ago but while there I waist various locations, so I got to work for different departments.  I did enjoy the experience and I had GREAT managers each time that I built good working relationships with.  As the years have progressed this company has become a corporate staple in NJ to work for.  If you get placed in the right department, good things will come from it and it will pay off in the long run."
good,Busy call center environment. A lot of middle management that does a lot of micro managing. However the workplace is great the people and the culture is built on team work. They focus on maintaining a health work life balance with on site daycare and flexible schedules.

good,"-Long hours but highly productive work-day"
good,"Due to it being customer service, the typical day at work relied on the type of customer you interacted with and what you learned from them. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning a vast concept which is insurance, all the jargon and specifics was very interesting, The hardest part of the job was dealing with the human part, when needing to deal directly with the loss of an insured, of the closure of a life insurance policy."
good,"I had worked as an Electrical Draughtsman in Prudential more than 4 years and actually Prudential is a Splended company whatever about the management, culture, cooperative staff etc but yes nothing is ideal in this world like the long hours duty and low salary nut when we think about the whole review than it is good."
good,"Overall a good company and I would recommend to someone seeking employment.  Been with company for several years and I've seen allot.  The company is going through a transformation, that ultimately will be for the better.  Generally most people are collaborative, supportive for each other."

good,Prudential is a great company to learn the ropes. However my temp position did not give me a great opportunity to get hired permanently just because of the team i was placed on.
good,Conducted financial investigations on a daily basis. earned my CFE certification and earned my MBA.
good,"Being a licensed Realtor is neither an easy nor laid back job, but can be very rewarding. You are actually your own boss but are held accountable by your Real Estate broker. Typically, your day includes preparing paperwork for either a client, mortgage officer or bank or yourself so you can give your clients the best possible home buying experience. I will say that Real Estate is a fun job, but you have to be a very self driven individual that is not afraid of wearing many hats in one day. Although it can be a very profitable business adventure, I found the fees associated with the title can be a little overwhelming especially at the beigging of your career. I am very much a people person and that was the driving force in my chosing this career path. Overall my experience in Real Estate and with Prudential was a positive one."
good,"Daily routine is fairly rigid; however, there is ample opportunity to involve yourself in the departments events and projects. The community is a diverse cast of employees with an atmosphere of accessibility."

good,I enjoyed analyzing information. I enjoyed my co-workers. I enjoyed the leadership classes. I also enjoyed the hours and flexibility.

good,developed new products and eventually have responsibility for all of the Americas.
good,"Prudential is a good place to get your feet in the door. The environment is very conducive to learning, and the veteran employees are very helpful. I have learned at Prudential how to become more well rounded as an employee; improve my computer skills and work better in groups. The most enjoyable part of the job are my co-workers, the hardest part would have to be the monotony of the job, doing the same thing with no room for a change up. Management is solid, they are very helpful and are willing to get personal with you in order to find what makes you work the hardest."
good,A long training process but the rewards can utlimately worth it if you work hard and are self sufficient.
good,Good People and Technology exposure. Large Call Center Support Activity.

good,"Benefits are the best part of working for Prudential.  You can make a substantial income, but it takes many years to build a team or book of business.  Unfortunately, the company is very corporate and boring."
good,The Compliance programs at Prudential are very traditional in their approach to enforcing various SEC and FINRA regulations. The new senior leadership team has done a phenomenal job of combining technology with individual employee talent.
good,Great people to work with. Team like experience but still individualistic work most of the time. Great cafeteria available and the free parking available to employees that relatively close to the building
good,Process claims for those trying to obtain disability benefits . Calculating the amount to  be disbursed . Following up on claimant for return to work .
good,"I love working at Prudential.  My manager supports flexible work arrangements and work from home, although that is not evenly applied across other areas of the company.  The new CEO is extremely authentic, and the company is driven by ethics & integrity.  Movement into other areas is difficult, however, and they often like to look outside for leader positions rather than at internal talent."
good,There are lots of pros to Prudential.  The salary and overall benefits are great.  There are also opportunities to grow and develop and to move within the organization.

I had to opportunity to work allow and make decisions based on the information that I was provided with.  The management team was approachable and willing to assist.  It was a good workplace.
good,Prudential Financial in Hartford Connecticut was a good place to work.  They offered many opportunities for career growth.  The people were very nice.
good,"My dept interacted with many other depts in the IT side of the house.  I came across some management that were just figure heads and their subbordinates did all the work.  Then there are a few who were working managers and above.  They went to meetings and made decisions.  If you had a manager or above that took responsiblity and pitched in then you were have way there to get promoted or nice raises."
good,"Meetings and participation in training."
good,You need a strong and vast natural market for this job or you will spend many frustrating hours on the phone trying to make some money. They offer okay pay when you start but after a few months you are expected to be on your own.
good,"Good place to work years ago. We had team building events, cultural events, and everyone supported one another. Later years micro-managing arose and caused employees to leave."
good,"Albeit this was a long time ago and the Company has drastically changed, it was a good Company to work for which certainly had a very active social side."
good,Prudential had a great management team and plenty of resources to aid in day to day tasks. Betterment training was offered in abundance and highly recommended.

good,"Room for advancement"
good,"Collaborative place to work, people were great however the division was sold after the company went public.  There were frequent reorgs prior to that due to poor management (company president changed almost every year)."
good,"Prudential is where I started my financial career.  It was a great place to learn about the industry and to get licensed.  They paid well at the time, and fought to keep you in the department/company if you were a valued employee."
good,Typical day was fast paced & challenging. You had to hit the ground running but I loved it.
good,The Prudential Vietnam Finance company is a good place for anyone who want to get more experience about Consumer Finance segment. The company culture is good too.
good,"Prudential is a large company with lots of benefits, but in the end the employee is just a number and are subject to budget cuts and business decisions that really don't give the employee much of a voice.  Verbiage is used like ""Ask me a candid question"" and is always answered in a non-candid way.  This leaves the employee feeling left out of the decision process."
good,There was plenty of opportunity within the company for earnings but you are training and working 12 hrs a day with not ample time to take advantage of the courses on the products offered.
good,"I was an FPA, which required meeting sales quotas and extensive customer cold calls to meet weekly goals.  The managers pushed as hard as possible regardless of the customer/client relationship."
good,"Prudential provides opportunities to learn and grow your career. The culture is supportive, with an emphasis on work/life balance."
good,Outstanding place to work. Great work/life balance. The outlook for the company is favorable as it has been and continues to be the leader in its market.

good,Prudential insurance company is a great place to work but the job is somehow stressful. It is not really a day job because you have to work most evenings to be successful.
good,Prudential is a very good company to work for  The majority of their employees currently works from home. The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines.
good,"I liked working at Prudential, but the management changed a few times and an opportunity became available at Keller Williams.  I worked a full time job and then 10 hours on the weekend.  It became too much too handle with family life.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the people."
good,Handling the multiple applications and balancing the client is challenging task. But I believe that I'm doing well in that challenging task as QA analyst and QA Engineer.
good,I have enjoyed my time at Prudential.  I am happy with Management and the clear vision they have set out.  The benefits and compensation are in line with their peers.
good,Working at Prudential is like being the member of a very large family.  People are working together diligently to do the right thing.  The hardest part of the job was the fact that change takes a long time.  The easiest part of the job was that it was very easy to make your voice heard and people were genuinely decent to one another.
good,"Phone calls all day long."
good,The culture was great and work life balance was a big factor to the company.  However at the time the pay scale was not in line with other companies within the same industry.

good,"Excelente Empresa para conocer y aprender a disciplinar nuestras maneras de entender los negocios en los que trabajamos."
good,"I worked for Prudential for 8 years.  As much as I had bad days, it was still a wonderful company to work for.  The compensation was fair, the benefits were very good.  The only thing that would have made it better is if they offered a flexible work schedule.  They are still behind the times on mothers returning to the work force, despite having MANY young female employees."
good,"At the time advancement opportunities for woman were minimal."
good,I learned there how to work with difficult tasks.I worked as supervisor to verification officer I learned how to work in team as team leader. Tough working environment.i worked average 10 hours a day.

good,"My job was very complex, face paced, quality driven, project oriented, detailed with vast amounts of research, phone calls, meetings for process improvement, daily management reports, managing large dollar reallocation request for life insurance policies (same day processing), spontaneous, and the most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that everyday is a constant challenge and I am making a difference toward providing World Class Service, not only to our customers but individuals as well."
good,"On a typical day I will take between 40-60 claim related calls pertaining to short term disability, long term disability, and FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act).

I'll work on side projects such as mailing and emailing requested documentation out to our claimants. I also present in team huddles where I discuss with my peers any updated or revised procedures for a particular client. I have also spent time with our claims adjustors to obtain a detailed insight of what the position entails. "
good,I interned in the Treasury Department where I worked on the quarterly planning and forecasting model for Prudential and analyzed company financials.
good,I have worked at Prudential for 19 years and it was always an exciting environment.  A typical day would consist of working with over 2500 field employees helping them market themselves to their clientele and help them build their business.  The hardest part of the job was to try to manage all of the on-going projects to ensure they were always on time and on budget.  The most enjoyable part of the job was always being able to meet new people and help them with their business.
good,"As a former Realtor and having completed WA states appraisal course I was extremely qualified for the position of auditing the two or three home appraisals that were performed for relocating employees such as Coca Cola. The corporations had specific guidelines to be followed in order to buy the employees homes so they could be transferred to another location."
good,Prudential was a great place to work.  Made great friends and learned a lot about the insurance industry there.  It was sad to see them bought out by another insurance company and close their doors.
good,"Management provides unlimited training,support and resources for its Financial Professionals.  It is literally starting your own business, building a book from the ground up."
good,"This is a good job,  when you get your clients established , which allows you to manage your own work schedule since it is all about performance and sales.Besides the twice a week meetings , the time management was based on your scheduling of appointments. You definitely  need to be a disciplined person and a bit of a go-getter. The sales manager is available to help any time you may come across a difficult client. Being free to manage your own schedule was a big plus. Even in a competitive atmosphere for sales there was a sense of work comradery. Since a lot of my sales were done in afternoon and at night , i was able to play racquetball twice a week in the morning with some of my co-salesman. We were able to bounce sales techniques off each other while still getting a good workout in. The most difficult part of the job was to not take rejection personally- the rejection was towards the product(s()."

good,"Senior Business Analyst / crafted business solutions that improved efficiency, decrease costs, and boosted productivity"
good,"I completed a full year internship with Prudential and was at the forefront of recruiting, operations, and assisted the life insurance and wealth management team there. Being a Financial Professional Associate is a tough position since much of your income is generated based on clients and the natural marketing plan. Although sometimes it gets extremely tough to handle, being an FPA is really great and starts you off on a career as a Professional in the financial service sector."
good,Prudential has provided me with a vast amount of experience and knowledge during my tenure
good,My time at Herman kay gave me great experience with things team work commitment to my goals and a strong will to succeed. My environment constantly pushed me into becoming more responsible and open to learn new things. There was really nothing to hard about working at Herman Kay but aside from having to constantly file documents and lift a few boxes things aways seemed to sail smoothly due to my positive and humble attitude environment and co workers. the most enjoyable part of the job had to be the funny co workers and the great pay and sense of accomplishment when i finally clocked out.
good,I answered phones all day concerning sales or just modifications that neede to be made to a customers policies. I learned that making customer connections was important when trying to sell insurance policies. The most enjoyable part of the day was the feeling I got from helping individuals with decisions that affect their lives and the lives of their family members.
good,"I have filled both Executive Assistant and Internal Communications Associate functions.  It is a fast-paced environment with never a moment to spare, which makes each day go quickly.  There is high demand for quality work, and at the same time, there is reward for high quality performance, and opportunity for advancement.  Associates are encouraged to move forward and take every opportunity for self-improvement.  The company attracts excellent performers, and has a talent mindset that holds itself and its associates to high standards and a bar that is raised consistently.  The most difficult part of either job is finding enough time to do what's needed, and overtime is the rule rather than the exception.  It's a pleasure to work with motivated, talented people and a company that cares about its associates."
good,"Perfeccioné, gracias a mucha capacitación mis habilidades de Ventas, de Reclutamiento, Selección y Capacitación de equipos de ventas de alto rendimiento. Aprendí muchísimo de Motivación de vendedores en un rubro mas que difícil, con niveles de exigencia altísimos para el rubro."
good,more diversity needed. very good training opportunities.
good,Overall it was a good job. Benefits were amazing and not too much out of the pocket. Balance of life was okay.
good,"I was responsible for adherence to NY Stock Exchange regulations as well as Prudential Bache office policies.  I handled reorganizations (tender offers and exchanges). I was the liaison between the company and the financial advisors, handled special transacions & established specialized managed accounts.  I was responsible for all computer operations and training.  I was the backup wire operator and cashier.  I was also resposible for the new accounts operation.  The office had no procedures in place, so I wrote the procedures and also gave them to the St. Augustine office. I was responsible for all the back office operations."
good,Prudential financial was a great place to work. The parent company decided to leave the equities business and closed up the business.
good,This is a great company with many opportunities. Compensation not offered for commute.
good,Enjoyed working enviroment. Was competative but good suppot. Liked the people I worked for and with.
good,It's ok if you enjoy doing nothing else but answering the phone and making coffee for employees.
good,very pleasant work place but it is a temporary work assignment looking for a long term permanent position
good,"I went to work at Prudential because it was closer to the market area where I live (East Cobb). Also, I knew several agents in that office. After going to work there, I came to find it more like a second family than just a work place. Everyone works together as a team. Noone is out to get anyone else. If you need help, there is always someone around to help. The broker is extremely knowledgeable and professional. The hardest part of the job isn't really related to the office, it's the instability of the market and the lack of job security. The most enjoyable part of the job, by far, are the other agents in that office. They are not only helpful, but supportive and encouraging."
good,"Prudential Arizona is a great company for the experienced Real Estate professional that doesn't want to worry about all the little expenses of being an independent. Great offices, software and support, all at reasonable rates. Prudential offers ""Restart"", a program oriented towards giving experienced agents ideas on how to revitalize their business."
good,The previous Real Estate Company went out of business and I was hired. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to stay with the agents that I had worked with for 5 years.
good,"My typical day at work consisted of going through a queue of cases and selecting cases from that queue. Within the case I would check a series of websites and databases to verify that the insurance agent seeking appointment had the proper registrations, licenses, and trainings. These requirements vary by state, leading me to check several charts for state regulations and requirements. If an agent did not meet all of the requirements I would call out to that agent to notify them to verify if they are indeed missing the requirement occasionally having to reject appointment or insurance contracts to agents. I would sometimes conference call (or joint-call) out to an agent with a representative from another department, taking lead of phone calls so that we could both convey our departments requirements to the agent."
good,Prudential. the name says it all. Everyone knows who Prudential is and what they do and its reputation is well deserved. The training resources and floor support was exceptional.
good,"Working with Prudential as an adviser has its pros and cons. The company does not offer a base salary, but there are incentives, bonuses and benefits. It is a commission position, but that is the type of person it requires (a go-getter)."
good,Management is currently in flux which is difficult to work with.
good,"Great company to work for. I worked for individual agents, setting up appointments for them to sell their product."
good,It's a good place to work and start a career. Management is supportive and honest towards their associates. Working environment is relaxed and I would recommend this place to friends.
good,I very much enjoyed my time with Prudential.  They were a great company and offered a lot of room for growth.  The company is in a state of change and if you are good with change and growth I would highly recommend.
good,Reliable and Stable company to work for. Although difficult but there are opportunities for growth. The company has rigorous interview process and only qualified employees are selected.
good,Prudential is a good company that provides great long term benefits.  Management is very friendly and great to work with.  Depending on the area within the company that you work in career advancement can be challenging.
good,"Managing a call center is always hectic. Adapting to customer needs is a skill needed in order to maintain a stable environment. Working with representatives was always delightful, however working with management was a challenge."
good,"Prudential Finance Company is committed to making the best efforts to become the best customer support finance company in Vietnam."
good,"Prudential in my opinion is a good place to work, there are lots of opportunity to grow and advance. The work is fast paced and challenging, but you are trained to complete each task.  I would recommend friends to work there."
good,"Prudential has a great culture around people: The management is focused on helping their people grow and management is very invested in the development of their employees. Lots of training offering internally with budget for external conferences and training, too. Good benefits and ability to have a work/life balance. The hardest part of the job is the frequent reorganizations and changing management."
good,Since I have been here very few people make it in this business. Being payed commission only is hard. To make it in this business you have to work all the time. Which leaves little time for family
good,"Very interesting and challenging.  I thought the job and people were great.  They were very organized.  I learned a lot.  The tools and software were great, along with the training."
good,"The company has a great life work  balance and with that being said hard work with good work  ethics is expected. "
good,"Prudential has been a great experience for me over the years.  I had a lot of opportunities to grow and advance.  I had great managers over the years.  Senior leadership in the company really did a great job with the company, steering it in the right direction."
good,Very good place to work. There really have small bouts of creativity. For the most part you have to make it as fun as possible to avoid the monotony of the work life.
good,"I would work there again, if the opportunity arose."
good,"Grew a role from initial assignment to a full blown organization that services client-facing with timely, high quality, cost-effective service backed by great talent at all levels. Provided opportunities to add new skills and advance my career."
good,Prudential is a very good company for their employees. The flexibility and atmosphere there was fantastic. The commission only aspect is why I moved on to another opportunity.
good,"Not as good to work for as they were 30 years ago."
good,"I certainly expected to be promoted or given more job responsibilities in the time I have been here, but those seem to be reserved for a 'select' few."
good,New manager came in and wanted to prove something.  He cleared most employees.  The job itself was stressful and fast paced.  Management very demanding regarding the quantity of work and quality of work to be completed daily. Manager cleaned house and is now the Director in which was his goal to begin with.
good,"I happened to be in the one section of the company with high turnover and high stress.  The Job had great mobility, but you do have to be there for at least 1 year."
good,"It is hard to move out of the call center once you are there, but it is hard to beat the benefits and pay. I enjoy the people that I work with. Must be willing to receive constant feedback."
good,"Overall Prudential is a good company, The people that I had worked with are great people and they are all willing to help me when I first joined in to the company. There is nothing really bad about this company, except its commission based."
good,On the whole Pru is a great company to work for. Advancement can be difficult for non-favorites. Recent reorganizations have upset the culture somewhat.
good,"Prudential California Realty is a wonderful, fast-paced place to work.  I would recommend it to anyone looking within the real-estate related industry."
good,"A typical day there will run pretty smooth when you are at my level. Especially if there is plenty to do. People are pretty relaxed on Fridays. Your meetings won't be as hectic and managers are typically relaxed about your work as long as you turn it in onto and communicate where you are in the process. Learned a lot about the insurance world while I was there, and some about mutual funds. I would say the most interesting is the international side of things. It was, however, hard to get in compliance because its more of a process and routine job, lots of attention to detail. Also, you will be reading TONS of policy, and it can get dry after a while. What's good about that is you can basically understand what is about to be said before it's said after a while. So if you aren't that person its hard to get into the work day in and day out. But, you will find that there is always someone to talk to at work. People are friendly enough that if you just reach out and say hi they will say yes 9/10. You can go for a walk around the building, or on the terrace. It's really nice."
good,"Great training program, hands on learning, decent workload, good management. Unfortunately this was a temporary job that I was laid off due to lack of work. I really enjoyed my time there."
good,"I would recommend Prudential to any one.  Good workplace culture, flexible hours, lots of opportunity, good salary and benefits.  Downside is you could be let go at any moment."
good,"The Management was amazing, staff was engaged, however, very stressful due to fast paced environment. They offered many benefits and help employees advance their career."
good,Great company to work for.  Management was competent and fair.  Work volume was high but it kept you busy.  Fun atmosphere.fair compensation.  Only reason I left was because they eliminated my department.
good,"It was truly tough to leave this position. The people and leadership were great along with the benefits that came along with it. The hardest part was it being 100% commission. Not just Prudential, but the industry as a whole needs to find a way to build their retention rate with base salaries. Everyone in the office either started their career living with their parents or had a spouse to lean on for sufficient income in the early years. I wish everyone there the best of luck."
good,"Great company that serves their community and employees well."
good,Entry level position as a financial professional. You must be eager to start a business practice and put in many hours to ensure your business success.
good,"I have been with the company for 18 years.  I have 4 different job titles.  In the 9 years I've been in my current position, I have not had any type of promotion.  I receive great reviews each year, but it seems advancement is non-existent."
good,Pru has a very nice work life balance.  They allow a lot of flex time and work from home.  The culture is diverse which makes it a very nice and comfortable working environment.  They offer wonderful benefits including advancing your education and are very flexible with their employees.
good,"The company is on top of all training, new systems and enhancements throughout.  The training is strong and very detail.  The opportunities within the company help you grow."
good,Your career path is dependent on the location you work at. Seemed like more of the exciting positions were in NJ and not in PA. PA location seemed to be more focused on Operations positions. Company has fantastic employee benefits. Wish I was compensated more but salary was competitive. Middle management needs major improvements
good,"Prudential is a very solid company with wonderful opportunities for advancement and wonderfu benefits. The typical day is often very busy, but the people working around you made the work day very hospitable. The hardest part of the job was researching various policies and stipulations, which had to be done in a prompt time manner."
good,"Prudential is a strong company with an exceptional brand.  Culture is collaborative.  Compensation and benefits are very good.  As with other large companies, allows the opportunity to move within the organization."
good,Work/life balance is great with the ability to work at home. Pay and benefits are very good. Environment can be stressful as company seems to be always reorganizing.
good,Third Shift Operations Supervisor - Duties included the management of eight operators; loading mainframe programs and program libraries; managing reports and print jobs to assure that all completed successfully; Mark IV programming and oversight of all mainframe jobs.
good,I was exposed to a lot of different duties which helped leverage my experience in my field. Important to be able to work with others and be in a demanding environment.
good,This is the number one Assurance Company in Vietnam in term of APE. This is a renowned company in the world so it is running based on Company's values and internatinal practices. All the staff have a chance to develop and improve the career path. The office is designed for great culture.
good,I worked for Prudential for 27 years.  I enjoyed working for the Company.  I met and worked with a lot of very nice people from all around the country.
good,Great potential but the late hours and working on the weekend in my early 20's caused me to lose interest.  They thought and prepared you well for the job.
good,"môi trường làm việc năng động, công việc có tính áp lực và cạnh tranh cao, học hỏi được nhiều kinh nghiệm trong giao tiếp"
good,"Within the company, you could experience a variety of cultures. The call centers are very much micromanaged and lack work/life balance.  Once you exit the call center atmosphere, the business has an entirely different culture that is supportive of work/life balance and nurtures career development."
good,"I was brought in to jump start the office.  We had three employees with 40 years experience and no new agents.  I brought in seven agents the first year.  Improved productivity by increasing office moral.  Prudential has a great culture.  They put customers first.  One challenge that I faced with working in a remote location.  I often had to learn things as they happened.  However, I built  team of new agents and we bonded and learned together.  When I left, we were one of the best offices for business written per week per agent.  That showed that we were making money."
good,"The benefits are great and the people are an added bonus. Unfortunately, they aren't as flexible as they say they are. Having a family with young kids, there are times that you may receive an emergency call. Prior to leaving your desk to take the call, it's preferred that you find a manager and let them know. Also, if you need to come in earlier so that you can leave early on a day, it's like pulling teeth to get an approval."
good,"Prudential was a company that you wanted to invite your friends and family to join.  It was a large community in a few locations.  I still remain friends with some of the people I worked with there.  I was in a division that wound up being outsourced, and eventually shut down.  The pay was not always the highest, but the benefits made up for that with time off, employee organizations, employee gathering spots, etc."
good,"Great company that is run by people who test practices that do not work and everyone follows suit (right or wrong) until that person is fired or replaced. "
good,"Great work environment, however, they should work on a better comp plan for new employees. Also need a better system for helping new employees build a book of business."
good,"Telephone calls to schedule client meetings. "
good,"Prudential is a company that likes to enable employees to push to their potential and own their careers."
good,"Fun place to work at with a nice workplace culture.  Enjoyed assisting clients and reps to satisfy any questions or concerns. I learned how to assist reps in opening up accts for clients.  Acct types ranged from IRA, trust, estate, corporate, and 529 accts."
good,"Good place to work...nice work/life balance...but outside of any Actuarial positions, you need to find your own career path...no one will guide you.  A little behind in technology though...we just changed over from Lotus Notes to MS Outlook and roll out of up to date laptops is slow."
good,"Great.  Broker was always there to talk with and no stress, always provided desk space at no charge.  Always had Senior Broker to talk to with issues."
good,"A day in Life claims at prudential is a day of continuosly looking at your computer and crunching out claims all day. There's a quota to be met and sometimes you are required to do ""non claims examiner"" work. The company is very devided. It's not uncommon for somone within life claims to not know the function of another group within life claims. The people are great but the job itsself is very robotic. You don't really get the oppertunity to know your coworkers and the work is tedious. You have to be able to multitask in order to be a claims examiner."
good,"Prudential offers great pay and benefits.  The work can be challenging at times, but management & staff is always there for support.  Great team environment!"
good,"I enjoyed my 17 years at Prudential. It is a place where employees develop close relationships. "
good,"Great company to work for if you are just starting out in your career. The company offers so many learning opportunities and is heavily invested in training programs. The makeup of the company is diverse in many of the soft skill jobs and operations areas but not in the investment, sales, and client facing roles. The company offers numerous opportunities to get involved in community outreach programs and gives each employee one paid day a year to volunteer at a non-profit organization of their choice."
good,"Working 10+ years. Good job, happy to be there. Work/Life Balance A+++. Best I've ever had. Looking to grow in this company is not easy. Office politics is hard to accept and favoritism is a con, but that happens in all business."
good,"As long as you got your work done, no one bothered you.  My co-workers became friends and to date they are still my friends."
good,A typical day at Prudential/United Health Group included investigating all providers that were added the previous day by either a claims examiner or by electronic claims.  We had to make sure the provider was a legitimate provider and not a fraudulent claim.
good,Flexible workplace with tons of opportunity to educate yourself with various products. Website can be a bit overwhelming with information and office sometimes lacked consistent message or goal.
good,"Love my years at Prudential. The culture, the camaraderie and the atmosphere. I really enjoyed learning about the company and the opportunities I encountered."
good,I enjoyed my work experience at prudential. My colleagues were a pleasure to work with and i was able to establish some long term friendships.
good,The internship experience to date has been challenging and fun. The operational environment has allowed me to focus on building the pool of knowledge needed for me to advance my career as an investment analyst and has fueled my desire to complete and honors in the field.
good,"Prudential is a very solid company to be employed with, however, most companies tend to hire from within, which I worked on temporary assignments at Prudential through Adecco Staffing."
good,I would meet with prospective clients and gather information to determine their financial needs and goals and offer products to meet that need.
good,"Prudential is a great company to work at.  The culture and work-life balance vary widely depending on the team and area of work.  It's nice to work in a positive, supportive environment, but feels isolated from the rest of the industry with the headquarters in Newark, NJ.  The pace can be slow relative to an investment job in Manhattan, and there is red tape and politics to get through just like at any big company."
good,Prudential was a great place to work and great relationships were developed with Broker/Producer assistants and new business team.
good,My typical day starts 9am to 5pm and  i love my work. My management team and co-worker are awesome who  i have learned so much from .
good,Very dynamic and intense place to work. Very pleasant and professional work environment. Compensation is very competitive.
good,"A lot has been learned at Prudential.  I easily able to adjust from a small Logistics company to a large corporation.  Prudential had a lot of training opportunities to not just better myself in Accounting, but become a better employee.  A typical day of work is filled with working with Clients and fellow Prudential employees around the world.  The most enjoyable part of the job is learning about how our clients do business."
good,The California Prudential Realty was a great place for real estate agents to work. Team building & promotions were common there.
good,"In brief, the company is good and the work life balance in the company is wonderful. Co - workers are very wonderful. Managers have  a very good insight on technical issues and are very knowledgeable in using the  different tools and technologies and also encouraging and providing motivation for their team members. Only one thing,a lot of different vendors are competitive at the client place and salaries are going down because of this situation. Apart from that, everything is wonderful ."
good,Fast past and exciting work force with room for advancement. I enjoyed meeting people and learning new things. Challenging at times but was worth it. I enjoyed working here.
good,The people at Prudential are great from security to upper management. They have a great gym and ample parking. There are also flexible hours and the ability to work from home.
good,"Prudential was a fun place to work.  My work day started at 6:0am ended at 2:30 pm   The team I was on paid claims for our platinum"
good,"Great work environment"
good,A Typical Day At Work Was Very Rushed When You First Come In But Throughout The Day Very Layed Backed And Relaxed. I Learned To Always Be On Your Feet And Learn Your Customers. Management Was Never Really Clear With Workers All The Time. Co-workers Became Family. Hardest Part Of My Job Was Not Being From New Jersey And Not Knowing Where Anything Was Located Because It Was A New Stadium.Most Enjoyable Was Working With Friends.
good,"I managed the office facility, supervised staff, coordinated advertising for in house listing and coordinated referrals.   I learned timelines, deadlines and facilities management.   "
good,"Great place to work with a lot of opportunity to advance your career.  Company goes through many organizational changes however, which results in frequent job eliminations."
good,"I enjoyed working there, great management and benefits.  Longs days and hours but if you work hard it pays off."
good,"It was a pleasure working with Prudential management and staff."
good,"Prudential is a good place to work.  It has fair pay and good hours.  There was limited room for advancement and job security was questionable."
good,"Co-manage team to deliver enterprise solutions"
good,Prudential is very supportive and focus on developing the talent their employee talent.  Prudential is also flexible with various alternative work arrangements.
good,It was a great place to work.  I learned a lot about the financial market.  I enjoyed helping support the Trade Room staff with analyzing their portfolios using numerous analytical tools.  It provided me numerous opportunities for advancement until the re-organization which resulted in my layoff back in 1994.
good,"Fun, energetic, social & enjoyable place to work. I got to work a fashion show. The employees were fun and sociable."
good,The workdays can be stressful and very busy but the people that you work with are always willing to lend a hand and help reach a goal together.  The hours are flexible and allow you to take reasonable time to yourself.
good,Good working relationships between staff and upper management
good,"My experience at Prudential will go everywhere with me. I learned how to manage my time efficiently and produce expected results within time and budget constraints. The company provided exceptional benefits along with a daycare for the employees children. The compensation is level with the job market. They do show that they care and appreciate their employees. If your one that thrives in a high paced environment, like myself, then this place is a good place to work."
good,Great department to work with and a very knowledgeable team.
good,I am currently employed at an insurance company processing group life insurance claims. The hardest part of the job is reaching out to the family of the deceased.
good,"As a customer service representative, you handle inbound calls mainly. Few outbounds calls, followups. Dealing with clients personal accounts, inquiries may include account balance, product explanations, trades/withdrawals. You must try your best if you plan to be promoted. There is a lot of competition They do have a lot of moral events.."
good,Lovely co-workers great professional environment it is a fast- paced atmosphere if you are looking for challenge this is the place for you.
good,Prudential is a business of caring and treats their employees with respect. I liked the flexible work/life balance and the benefits you cannot beat.

good,I had the opportunity to be creative and independent in order to achieve company and personal goals.
good,"After working for Prudential for 20 plus years I only have postive things to say about this company. The culture was very friendly and open and the scheduling was very flexible. The benefits were excellent including all of the ammenties set up to create a healthy and fun environment. This included pool tables, ping pong, nurses station, TV room, and excercise room and much more."
good,"Solid Company with good compensation/benefits packages and excellent values and programs for work/life balance, including telecommuting, maternity/paternity leave, support services, etc."
good,Acted as a liaison between the claim staff and the needs of the clients we served.
good,Medical claims office with an extremely heavy work load. Overtime required. Benefits good.
good,It is a commission job so the pay was based on my performance but I did like the management and the accolades I got for a job well done.
good,"Prudential offers employees a fair work life balance. Depending on the unit you work for work from home options are available. This is a plus during inclement weather. This company tries to keep all employees informed its outlook, goals and performance. Semi annual reviews are conducted mid year to give employees and management the opportunities to recognize good work and identify possible problem areas. This allows the employee the opportunity to improve on problem areas before the annual review. I enjoyed participating in the informative and interesting career conference opportunities."
good,"Self paced, learned new software, Broker is a wonderful person!"
good,"Daily: prioritize clients in caseload to organize current outreach calls for updates and services. Monitor claims and diagnostic codes of various insurers for potential entry into long term case management services.

good,Monitor daily fund over tolerance.
good,"closed, the company closed back in 2002"
good,"A Very good company to work for long term, with benefits that would rival any company."
good,9.5 year career cut short by yet another managerial change...this one was the kiss of death. Talk about personality conflict?? Been there.
good,Not too many complaints but I had a hard time clicking with my manager- it's natural because you can't connect with everyone in a working environment.
good,It is a very good company. People working there are intelligent hard working and collaborative. Opportunities exist when you work hard and show results.
good,"Prudential allows their associates to be productive, providing ample opportunities to be successful.  The culture is very inclusive and strongly promotes diversity and inclusion.  Overall, a great company to work for as a college grad or seasoned employee."
good,"I have been working with this company for last 06 years and i find company as very good place to work with and work 5 days a week."
good,was an okay work place but could be a bit stressful at times cold calling customers and not receiving calls back after leaving messages or getting hung up on.
good,Prudential is one of the top companies if not the top in the financial industry.  They offer a very attractive benefits package and perks.  Some areas have limited upside and advancement opportunities.

good,"Pros:"
good,"Prudential is a great place to work. "
good,My review will be meaning less as I worked there almost 20 years ago. Not sure what can be accomplished with this. Prudential is a great company and I am sure continues to be great.
good,"Good place to work, however you have to commute constantly if you want to obtain your clients. Growth is possible if you put in the hours. Salary depends on how many clients you obtain and keep."
good,Working as a manager at Prudential was very demanding and well structure. Expectations are high which makes a good environment for driven people. You have to give it your all.
good,"Prudential is a large and established company with a mix of talented individuals that have been there for 20+ and a lot of employees with less than 5 years experience.  You don't have as many with 5-20 years experience as you may expect.  Prudential is trying to shift their focus from an old, stodgy company to a new and vibrant company which causes many clashes on the future strategy and execution of the company.  Employees are very collaborative and will get behind a clear strategy."
good,"I have nothing negative to say about the company. The environment is positive and competitive, i learned a lot, got to know good people and look forward to reapplying in the future"
good,"I loved working for Prudential, unfortunately, my department was outsourced to a 3rd party company. My position required a lot of overtime which was wonderful."
good,"Good experience. I was there as a consultant. Directed the upgrade and migration of Oracle databases, as well as the delivery of compliance projects to address external web-facing application vulnerabilities to align with audit requirements. Led the installation and migration of AIX application databases to Oracle super cluster, as well as the upgrade of Informatica to support main business applications."
good,It was a great place to work but the amount of time the was needed to for this job was more than I was willing to part with. (Including commute). Overall I would recommend this job for someone willing to work in an office all day.
good,"I felt privileged to have  work for Prudential , it was my dream come true.  I enjoyed my bosses and coworkers it was a fun atmosphere. However  Because of Personal Problems and Family issues , I resigned"
good,I was able to create an order/spreadsheet for this company which they truly needed at this time. I cannot think of one thing that was hard.  The personal was wonderful.
good,"Prudential Securities no longer exists, it was absorbed by a larger bank in a merger years ago. However, it was a great starting job and I learned skills there that carried me into several other ventures."
good,"I was working for a department that was contracted by an outside firm to maintain their retirement system.  When the contract with this company ended, I was downsized."
good,A typical day was slow paced and friendly.  The culture was friendly.  This organization helped me grow into the administrative assistant that I became.  They take care of their employees.
good,I was able to develop essential career skills at Prudential.  Project management and Leadership skills have vastly improved at my time there.  Career advancement is limited though depending on what group you're in.
good,Overall the job was good. I worked 40 hours a week and the benefits were very good at the time. I do not know what it is like now. I worked there over 35 years ago.

good,"I was with Prudential in various roles for 7 years. I was able to advance and increase my pay by over $18k in the time I was there. It was a great learning experience and the benefits were great. I started in life insurance asset retention where I spent a majority of my career - advancing to into more challenging roles within the department. My final 2 years were spent on the Customer Transition Team, selling primarily term and universal life insurance in a call center environment."
good,Môi trường làm việc và các chế độ của công ty tốt. Tuy nhiên tôi muốn thay đổi môi trường và công việc hiện tại để có thể học hỏi và phát huy thêm nhiều khả năng
good,"Great place to work; fitting pay and benefits, great coworkers. Incentives and great office atmosphere. Call center, working with investments and retirement benefits."
good,I worked as a contracted Home and Auto Insurance agent. Prudential had great products that were easy to sell because I could with confidence offer them to customers. They closed this division of Prudential insurance so my job was nonexistent.

I also ran illustrations and responded to customers' correspondence requests via email, mail and fax. My co-workers and I treated one another with respect and courtesy. What I enjoyed is the ability to work independently, which I earned after proving that I was able to process high quality results in a timely manner. My manager was flexible and fair. The hardest part of the job was working with outdated software. The most enjoyable part of the day when I was able to reach a solution to a difficult problem."
good,"At the time I worked there, the benefits were excellent and there were advancement opportunities.  I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Prudential is a great place to work. They have amazing benefits and they allow employees to work from home."
good,"A typical day starts with my schedule of activities for the day like calling clients.  I've learned that customer service is about serving and helping people.  I love helping people attain their financial goals and dreams in life.  I love to attend to their problems and do the extra mile. Management has been very supportive to us and they do recognize our efforts in achieving monthly and annual targets.  My co-workers are all very cooperative and good team players.  We do help each other to meet our production targets.  The hardest part of the job is to activate new agents and make them sell on their first month.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to educate people on the value of financial wellness, getting feedbacks from customers that I did a good customer service and helping the company attain their objective as a leader in the financial services industry."
good,"uma empresa profissional onde aprendi a ser um profissional completo na area comercial."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Prudential. I did not rate the Job security and the Compensation as I was a temporary employee working through another company and they did not control those aspects. I didn't think that would be fair. I worked directly with clients in the Individual Life Insurance dept. My trainer was very nice and effective. She was able to teach and be stern while being nice and flexible. Something not everyone can accomplish. She was promoted to a manager position while I was there because of her wonderful attributes during her training. The environment itself was very relaxed for a place that requires you to dress business casual (more business the casual) and where there are CEO's walking around at any given time. We had many pot lucks and a team meeting almost every morning. If you ever need help you can always ask anybody and they are all nice and willing to help without making you feel dumb. Even during the feedback times listening to your calls and being critiqued it was still just helpful and instructive, not mean and judgmental. It's nice to work at a company, for a company, that values you as a person and what you bring to their company. I just wish I could have stayed longer. The hardest part of working at Prudential is telling people what they don't have with their life insurance that maybe they thought they did, or at one time they did have and has since expired. It's upsetting to people to realize they are not covered the way they expected to be. It's also very difficult when family or loved ones call to inform us of their passing. I only had to transfer"
good,The best part of Prudential is the people. Senior management's door is always open and your opinion is valued.
good,Great company to work for with excellent benefits and work/life balance.The company has a clear vision and believes in investing in their employees
good,A typical day at Prudential is a very busy one. Customer focus and bettering the service we provide makes the job worth it.
good,"This company has a very interactive and motivating management team. They are focused on personal and professional development that not only benefit the company but, most importantly, their employees."
good,"I was able to truly learn and grow with this company and had many job functions while employed.  Unfortunately, the piece of the company I worked for was outsourced and we were no longer needed."
good,"A typical day of work is you arriving to your workload for the day and finding time to manage that work. My location is a little laid-back environment, but all about the business. My co-workers are great - genuinely caring for one another. Management is helpful and will believe in you as long as you believe in yourself. I've learned to ask questions, push myself, be attentive and learn all you can. Never stop learning or asking questions, as the insurance industry constantly changing."
good,"My coworkers are awesome as are my managers, but recent changes in the market place has made job security an issue."
good,I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers.  It was a great place to work and they provided awesome benefits. 
good,"Great company to work for. Great down town location, if willing to work a great deal of OT, I was hourly and enjoyed it for about two years felt burnt out."
good,Great company to work for. Excellent at attracting talent. Promotes a healthy work-life balance.
good,A high energy and fast paced environment. This company offers many opportunities to learn and expand your knowledge on various operating systems. It is mostly a young and diverse atmosphere where everyone is pleasant to work with.
good,"Everyday i go to work in a good mood. its not a really difficult job but, at times it can be challenging. I get to meet new people everyday as my clients. Using Persuasive skills in order to get the job done. The job is very flexible and i enjoy being a intern at Prudential."
good,I worked on a Contracted assignment for almost a year. It was a great experience and I had a wonderful Team Leader that was very patient and knowledgeable.
good,"Prudential provides opportunities for career growth, and at the same time, emphasis accommodation to employee's needs.  Its compensation is good.  A great company to work for."
good,A typical day was spent at the desk making phone calls and appointments. Spent a lot of time speaking to and recruiting possible employees. Positive space with great workers.
good,"The Customer Office at Prudential has a great start-up culture, but significant growth over the past few years has lead to a slightly dysfunctional organizational structure.  It's a work in progress."
good,"Prudential can be fast paced and crazy however there are many people to support you and get you on the feet. Once an employee gets into the rhythm of the job, but becomes much easier. Most you encounter in the company are kind well rounded folk who are more than happy to help you when you ask. "
good,"My position was specialized.  The opportunity to advance or move laterally existed if I wanted to pursue a different position and take the course work and job training available.  However, I had been planning to switch careers and return to social services.  My position was eliminated in December 2017."
good,Good culture and work environment. Everyone was extremely polite and helpful. This was my first professional job and I learned a lot. I would recommend this company to a friend.
good,"You need to have a fairly extensive network of people to reach out to when you start. If you can't reach out to find clients, you will struggle. I started as a college grad so almost everyone I knew was in college or just out of college. That market either does not need a financial adviser or does not see the need for one. Therefore finding people to meet with and do business was hard. Management helped as much as they can, but ultimately its about what you do."
good,"Management always open to new ideas"
good,Everyone is very nice and willing to work as teams to help increase overall productivity. Everyone is very friendly and cares about others in the office and their clients.
good,"It's an opportunity not a job.  As a producer you're there to bring in client's business. And unless you have a lot of rich friends and family this is not the industry for you. Call it what you want, Investments Insurance, Retirement, these buzz words all point back to people on the other side of the phone trying to talk you into a product you have a tough time understanding and it's hard to win someone's trust fast enough to make a sale so your family doesn't starve. "
good,"Good management depending on group. Can be siloed. Great insurance and other benefits. Behind in technology. Very regulated, can be limited in pushing changes."
good,"Large well known company with a great reputation in the financial industry. Good leads and management.  Nice office conditions and co-workers.  Use of private offices in the main building.  Very good accomidations for office supplies, printing machines, phones etc.."
good,"At the time that I was employed at Prudential it was a great place to work.  Benefits were great, employees were recognized consistently and management was good."
good,"I was young and didn't completely have an appreciation for the company. The investment of this corporate environment is unmatched. "
good,"Outdoor Sales "
good,Prudential has been an excellent foundation for me to build my versatile skill set. Supporting various Vice Presidents has made me highly adaptable in any situation.
good,"Working at Prudential Financial was a great experience for me personally and professionally. I learned a lot about myself and how to be a better, well-rounded individual. I concentrated a majority of my work day assisting the agency recruiter by phoning prospective applicants and scheduling face-to-face interviews. I had a lot of fun learning about different people and their backgrounds. Being able to communicate with people and ""sell"" the organization enabled me to grow as a professional the most. A small part of my internship with Prudential Financial was meeting with manager's of the firm and understanding where I fit in as an intern and also learn more about what the financial services industry entails."
good,"A typical day at work for a marketing assistant includes studying for exams, scheduling client meetings, retuning clients phone calls, creating effective and efficient ways to set up client meetings and seminars. Also, selling insurance, for those who are licensed. I find that the exam are the most difficult to study and pass because of the information in each area of study. However, the day will keep one busy with all the filing, scheduling, and leaning and education one needs to put into a job like this due to the licensing requirements."
good,"Prudential is a great company and the people that they employ are wonderful as well. They are very invested in seeing you succeed and everyone is willing to help; there is no unfriendly competition, everyone works together. They could do a little more to prepare a new sales person for their job because once you are hired, they basically throw you out to the wolves with very minimal compensation to get you started. Don't get me wrong, any manager or associate is willing to run appointments with you but there still seems like there could be more training involved  when getting started. "
good,"I provided a professional and empathetic customer service experience to over 90 clients daily with questions and concerns ranging from basic policy clarification to death benefits requisites. In addition, I maintained all client files as they came in. With any updates and or notes for that account."
good,"Prudential Financial is a great company to work for. There are job based incentives if a task or something of the sort is completed efficiently and timely."
good,"Prudential is a great place to work, with such challenging and competitive environment. Prudential offers great retirement plan along with great health benefits. Being part of a fortune 500 company offers satisfaction and career advancement opportunities."
good,Great environment to build a business a learn from experienced producers.
good,"Great company, good co-workers.  I really liked working with all of the employees at Prudential, it was a great learning experience for me."
good,"My typical day was filled with on demand requests, adhoc analysis, and a myriad of tasks and responsibilities."
good,"Great employer focused on it's customers (Internal & External) and dedicated to employee development.  I found being an Information Security Specialist to be a challenging position, one that I found to be deeply rewarding.  There were always new opportunities to expand my skill set as our team was introduced to new technologies that required the security team's support."
good,"Currently working as a temporary member of staff as a customer support adviser in Prudential which relates to pensions, investments and protection plans. The team environment which has been created there is one which is extremely supportive and encouraging. Being a relatively new employee everyone has gone out there way to make me feel not only welcome but secure in the knowledge that if I'm in anyway unsure of something there are all available to answer any queries I may have. "
good,This was my very first job after graduating from high school. I loved working there. This was really a great job. Everyone got along with each other like family from the management team to co-workers. I learned to appreciate a job where you can do your job and still have fun.
good,"Educação e cordialidade reinavam no dia-a-dia, apesar de que alguns dias pudessem ser estressantes, o comum era do ambiente ser agrádavel."
good,"I was an intern at Prudential in their Global Strategic Research group, my manager and department head were both fantastic people who helped me learn a lot about the industry. The team as a whole was collaborative and productive and there was a real sense of family among my coworkers. Everyone was respectful, friendly and more than willing to help me. The hardest part of my job was not having the proper knowledge I felt like I needed to be really helpful. Otherwise it was a fantastic experience."
good,"Pay is good. Life insurance is a difficult product to sell and most people don't think they need it or that the life policy they get through their job is all they need(it isn't, but its up to you to convince them otherwise). Management for me was excellent, the corporate structure for new hires seemed to be a bigger issue for me, I just couldn't gain any traction. The people you will work with are great people. If you enjoy cold calling, this is the job for you."
good,Prudential's employees make working at Prudential enjoyable.  Everyone is a team player. Management encourages career advancement and growth and assists in making moves within the company.
good,"Công ty hay tổ chức đi dã ngoại, họp sip, nâng cao kiến thức nghiệp vụ cho nhân viên."
good,"There is a lot of emphasis on creating a good working environment for every person. There are many training videos that every worker must take to understand how to treat others and work ethically. There are many meetings, and managers will keep you busy the entire time you are there."
good,"Location is not ideal. Work life balance can be difficult considering the commute to Newark. Culture is very  open and management is accessible. Overall, there are pros and cons."
good,"A typical day usually starts with morning full of meetings, and  sometimes whole day of meetings. The department is very busy and includes offshore team in Ireland and Chennai that we have to work on daily basis, sometimes off hours for knowledge transfer to cover knowledge gap and critical project information. "
good,Good place to work but they just want you to call you family and friends and try to sell them insurance. Training is outdated and lacks structure.
good,"Perfect management and very supportive to employees. Strong learning scope in the technology and domain."
good,This company is very knowledge and excellent in training of the insurance policies. This is soup to nuts of all types of insurances.
good,"I spent nearly 24 years with this company.  I had the opportunity to travel a few times and was transferred to Florida in 1996 from Minnesota.  "
good,sold All types of insurance and investments. Was able to network with numerous customers and develop working relationships.
good,Very good people and strong company culture. Great products and marketing strategies to back it up.  Team work is encouraged and is a great way for new reps to learn the ropes.
good,Professional environment with courteous people who are very knowledgeable regarding the financial services industry.
good,"Group life was a very stressful place to work. The job criteria such as quality, production was always changing. The amount of work required slowly kept increasing. The benefits were good and hours flexible. Raises were had to come by since it was based on performance. Getting a good review was difficult."
good,"Ample training is provided prior to being given clients for processing claims."
good,"Just started intensive training for Financial Associate. "
good,Early morning meetings to see where everyone sat for the week and then typical insurance sales i.e. setting appointments and following up on those. The hardest part of the job is getting people to talk to about insurance.
good,"-Researched individual’s insurance policies which lead to the acquisition of new clientele"
good,Great company to work for with good benefits and room for advancement.
good,"Prudential is a great place to work.  Management is strong and focused on doing the right thing not just for the Company, but also for it's customers.  Management strongly encourages employees to stretch their abilities and ways of thinking, to learn new skills and try new ideas. "

good,"Empresa ótima, porém seus gestores são péssimos! Prometem mundos e fundos!! Você trabalha muito, e quando precisa eles não pensam em absolutamente NADA! Fui mandada embora pq engravidei!!!!!"
good,Prudential the company is great . The security team management does not know how to properly handle staff with issues or when important things come about
good,"Como a maioria das multinacionais americanas a Prudential tem um trabalho e uma cultura empresarial muito fortes e competentes, porém dentro das reais possibilidades dentro da empresa é muito difícil conseguir uma acensão profissional."
good,"As an agent, you work on 100% commission. This is brutal. The only survivors are those with a hefty list of clients ready to meet with you before you start. Even then, most fall off and/or do not ever actually meet with you. There is a high pressure to make clients on a daily/weekly basis, because if you don't, you won't make money. There is also a push to express your commissions before clients are actually approved for products or services. So, this means as an agent you're most likely going to pay money back to the company. "
good,"The specific location I was working at had disorganized training, people who didn't know what they were doing were training the new hires. No training handbook, no procedure list, basically no proper training. Lack of communication between entrances. There are good people working there, it just needs to be sorted out."
good,"I didn't realize how great of a company Pru was until I left. The compensation wasn't the best, however the benefits are magnificent! Haven't found a company with better benefits yet."
good,"I had to take care of my ailing  parents, had to quit the business.My Father had become wheelchair bound & I had to care for him find caretakers, then my Mothers health failed she was trying to take care of my father & could'nt do it alone so it was very upsetting seeing this & trying to help them both going to doctors 2-4 times a week."
good,Prudential is as a very fast pace workplace. Very detailed orientated if of great importance when dealing with your clients. Great place to work benefits are great.
good,Foi um experiência muito enriquecedora no quesito profissional e pessoal.
good,"The position was a strictly commission based job. Prudential offered extensive training and support, but little in terms of compensation. Associates were billed for the use of laptops and expected to provide all supplies needed for their work including pens, pencils, postage to mail clients, etc.. This was not an atmosphere I could thrive in. I like to work collaboratively and as part of a team. "
good,"When I started, I arrived each day at 9am and stayed until 5pm. I learned about the many different products that prudential offered as far as Annuities and the different policies that went into each specific product that our department offered our clients. In my area of the department I was responsible for doing the research in finding out who the death claim beneficiaries were on the contracts that the deceased held with us. So that those beneficiaries could make a claim on the funds that were owed to them. Besides doing the research to find the beneficiaries I was responsible for also, sending those beneficiaries letters of the notice that these annuity funds were owed and available to them. Advising them to make a claim to either continue the contract with Prudential or file paper work to liquidate the funds. Yet the hardest part of my job was getting 80 of those letters out a day. "

good,I worked there on a very short term contract configuring and deploying Windows phones to the sales force. I enjoyed working there and I believe if permenant it is also a good place to work.

good,My day would typically start preparing and paperwork that needed to be signed by the Manager being he came in and printing out his schedule of things to do for the day. Some co-workers seemed to get along and others didn't but overall everyone got their perspective duties completed at the end of the day.  The hardest part of the job was preparing the Board of Directors visits. We would work overtime an entire week before their visits because everything had to be so detailed and on schedule.

This of course was a big help in understanding all the pro's and con's of each different product.  Management was very organised and gave clear direction on how we should proceed to build our book of business. I met a number of very well skilled sales people and they really worked hard to help us achieve goals. "
good,I am not sure who actually own Prudential Securities at this time. However when I worked for Prudential Securities it was a gainful experience and coworkers supplied a supportive environment.
