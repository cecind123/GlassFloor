rating,review
bad,"There was a high management staff turnover creating a bad stabilty environment. Management pushed expectations downwards never providing support although saying you could speak up, they shut you down when you did. I never had leave in 9 months, forcing me to leave for health reasons."
bad,"Stryker is an excellent company to gain experience, but caution to those who look to make a career here. It is an awful self serving culture. Good exposure, but the employees do not have the hospitals and physicians best interests in mind."
bad,The training I received from the so call senior rep was horrible. The job is complex and if I would have gotten proper training I could  have been better equipped to do the job. Person who trained me was aloof and not friendly at all. Sales reps were very nice and supportive. My manager was awful. Would not recommend anyone to work here.
bad,"The Management Is Not That Good! They Treat You Like Your Still In High School. An If Your Not in Good With Your Supervisor They Will Pick On You For Little Things. There Is Soooo Much Drama There Its Not Funny. They Don't Care About You!  I Almost Died An They Gave Me Points For It Which Is Not Nice , I Have Health Issues An They Only Cared About  If I Could Work Or Not . An They Try To Make You Feel Like Your 12 Years Old. The Only Good Thing Is That I Made Some Good Friends!"
bad,"N/a "
bad,They say you work “some weekends” but I worked everyday for 3 months. Not only that we were forced to say after an hour later. This is not the best place to work unless you just want money.
bad,Staff it IT provides lectures about professionalism but yet act like 2 year olds. People hear are miserable shady and back stabbers. They lies to me said it was a full time job but was only a contractor for 3 months and was let go.  Not sure bout company future but they cannot afford phones and say they are worth millions. dont work here it's a horrible environment.
bad,middle management has intense pressure to perform and has often mistreated employees as a result.  focus is much more on hitting predetermined performance goals than on the development & satisfaction of employees.
bad,"A lot of kissing butt and if you're supervisors didn't like you, you dont get hired in. a lot of mandatory overtime. A lot of being on your feet. not a great place to work"
bad,"Negative culture and a very high turnover of employees. They do not acknowledge hard work. Very unorganized company. No direction, no clarity on job duties. It is no wonder the turnover of employees is so high for all kinds of levels from staff to upper management. Horrible management.I would not recommend anyone to work here."
bad,if you dont have connection you can not move forward unfortunately the worse company that i ever work .old team member believe that they own the company
bad,They like the communication there and don't appreciate hard workers they want you to look busy and not actually get a lot of stuff done but have a few seconds of free time
bad,"Stryker has horrible management. They let the drug addicts run things and the management was incompetent. If you like being over worked and under compensated while working, be my guest."
bad,"Simply a huge corp where one hand doesn't know what the other hand is doing. "
bad,Horrible place to work I would not waste your time especially if you are a female.  Its like joining a fraternity.  They will take complete advantage of any and all help you can give them
bad,"Good learning experience, enjoyed the journey in working with such a dynamic organization. Felt excited to be part of such a fast growing company. Company is growing very fast."
bad,"6 days and 50+ hours at $9.70 per hour is in reasonable.  When I was leaving new equipment was being installed, according to a former coworker, this only created more work."
bad,If you ready to give up your life and be treated unfairly then work here. This place is full of favoritism. Management is drama and lack skills to teach you. You work 10 hour days 6 days a week. They write you up when you don't push numbers. People pass out or quit everyday. Kelly service does not back you at all so please be careful. This is not a place for a career.
bad,"Estuve varios años trabajando para está compañía en Buenos Aires y puedo decir que es una empresa con un pésimo ambiente laboral ya que no tiene políticas de beneficios igualitarias para todos los empleados, los Gerentes tienen una pésima formación tanto académica como profesional además tratan muy mal a sus empleados de mando medio y bajo, quienes diariamente se quejan por la cantidad de trabajo y responsabilidad que les dan por un salario pésimo. Recursos humanos no existe, se hace lo que se le ocurra al gerente y si te quejas con Compliance es en vano ya que al contrario, está se aprovecha de tu confianza para cubrir a la compañía de denuncias legales."
bad,i didnt like it here small working area two big machines in such a crowded area. if they were to blow up we would all b goners. the job was tedious and the goals were semmingly impossible.
bad,"A lot of issues (not sure if they are for the entire company or just this site), recommend to stay away.  "
bad,"When you get hired into a department, don’t ever expect to leave that department unless you are Spanish or Caucasian; it’s a plus if you are Spanish—then you have a lot of opportunities."
bad,"Its like working with High School students, that are in their 40's & 50's"
bad,"What can I say , most of the workers were very nice but I worked with some real back stabbers. The management were untrained and lacked a lot of basic people skills like.. ""Common Courtesy"" Some of the managers would step over the line if they did not like you they would find away to fire you. On the up swing there were some very nice people that I worked with which made it easier to stick in there but finally my so called manager gathered enough dirt to fire me. 1830.................JP Stay away"
bad,"My experience there is total mismanagement,the application PLM,Windchill is an absolute mess..No training, never customized the package & the users are left with NO training whatsoever!!..."
bad,Worked at Stryker for over 4 years in the Knee Marketing Department.  Always reorganizing and changing upper management - no stability.  Once Kevin Leach VP Knee Marketing took over the department went DOWN HILL FAST!!  Very unstable company.  Any company that lets employees go after 30 years of service you should really stay clear - no loyalty to their employees.  Stryker there for you - there for who - not their employees.
bad,"Job requirements not worth the money earned and stress. Unable to participate in benefits offered due to time and money. Management very negative, expressing constant negativity."
bad,"Want to apply at Stryker...Don't waste your time........"
bad,"Clean room ISO 8 supervision of environment, engineering of packaging equipment. Purchasing of new equipment and Factory Acceptance Test."
bad,Costs a healthy family $600 a month in insurance minimum.
bad,"This is a ""good 'ol boys"" club. You're either in it or out of it. If your out, you are WAY out. Absolutely no room for advancement.  Management is the absolute worst I have ever experienced."
bad,"The company is a successful company.   The C-level management does not care about their employees,  There are so many opportunities to grow within this company but their culture and core values that they instill, are not what the company gives. "
bad,"Each group blames another group for defects in quality."
bad,I really cannot say anything positive about working for Stryker.
bad,Stryker is great if you want to dedicate your life to your job. They expect constant overtime and complete dedication to the company. They constantly violate human resources laws and agreements.
bad,Terrible salary and no car allowance that doesn’t allow you to keep up with wht other companies offer.  Other companies are around 85k salary and company car
bad,"High turn over due to lack of support from the upper management. Lunch is catered to the upper management and production associates eat left overs. No more lunches for Saturday over time. Environment is very poor. Working with bunch of 10 yr old kids mentality. Can't make production. And the 5 point system, who does that!! Good place to get experience, but that's about it. I wouldn't recommend this place as a work place. TOXIC!!!"
bad,Para ellos es mas importante el que tiene un titulo universitario que la experiencia de la persona. Eso no lo valoran. Deben considerar que pasas casi todo el dia muy mala gerencia de operaciones para ser una empresa americana el desorden y estress de bodega es horrible.
bad,"Overall, I would not have worked here, knowing what I know right now. It's not worth the stress and you are never appreciated. The training definitely sucks!"
bad,"Worked here for over 2years how I lasted that long Is beyond me , long hours , meetings about nothing & if something goes wrong on any level the product builder will always be blamed even if it’s a machine problem .. I quiver every time I pass that building very wasted years of my life !anything is better than working here."
bad,"They lied to me in the interview as to how many hours i would be working as a temp, then when i told them about my handicap and how it was hindering my performance because of being mislead i was fired because I was a temp."
bad,You have to fill your work orders at your work station.  I learned how to assemble to the standard work.  Management had favoritism.  Workplace was tense.  Dealing with shortages of parts.  My friends I made there was my favorite part.
bad,"This company really needs a union bad! The managers can fire you for any lame reason. I've seen people get fired just for looking at someone sideways. They do this because, Stryker wants to cut wages/benefits and hire temps. Once you're hired in, it's very easy to get fired. You're literally walking on egg shells. It's very dangerous in the production and the assembly area, employees get cuts almost every day. This is what happens when your supervisor tells you, ""Work faster! Work faster!"" One of my older co worker had a heart attack. Stryker worked him to death. The wages needs to be much higher for this kind of work. Seriously. It's time to stand up and start a union! Fight for your rights! Unfortunately, Michigan is a right to work state."
bad,"As a former finance department employee at Stryker, I can assure you that the finance department will keep you busy. Hours are long on month end due to unrealistic deadlines set by corporate office. The annual review process has a two strikes and your out approach, if in one year you receive a Developing rating-you get no bonus or raise, then the next if year you receive another Developing rating, there is no bonus or raise, and your put on a probation period, with basically one foot out the door. This approach is designed to ensure employees are pushing as hard as they can in their job. The finance department has historically been known as a sweat shop, and has had very high turnover in the past 5 years. "
bad,"They say Stryker is ""A Great Place to Work"" but the Lakeland location is far from that statement! The culture is all about favoritism. If you are an engineer you will waste your career at the Lakeland facility. They do not provide training or value engineers. All you do is validation documentation, NC's, CAPA's, testing, and procedure updates. You work along side engineering technicians who do the same work as engineers but do not have engineering degrees. It is very demoralizing for engineers who take pride in themselves as professional engineers! They do not believe in career development nor do they want you to advance. They hire managers who have no clue what is going on and upper management is never around. They are always off at other facilities but when they are around they do not help, they only point out the negative in everything! HR is valued very high at Stryker and is always in everyone's business and they act like they run the facility. Do not to trust HR because they talk behind your back and do not keep conversations confidential. Also, all the systems are old at the Lakeland facility and are unable to produce any significant data. Do not expect to use data as a engineer!"
bad,"My experience with Stryker Orthopedics in Mahwah, NJ:"
bad,Never able to catch up. The amount of work given is more than the departments Capacity.
bad,"No hay tiempo para nada, solo llegas temprano te sientas en tu puesto de trabajo y trabajas trabajas y trabajas."
bad,"not good place to be, highly competitive, fire people everyday, no job security, no concern for employees career development, self serving.  harsh and unfriendly"
bad,If your single dont have a family. And you are willing to give your soul. You will fit right in. Alot of eyes on you at all times. If they dont like you forget it.
bad,"The nepotism at this company lends to stress and frustration. "
bad,"Managers that are in the job for more than ten years with an outdated management style that will micromanage you and not give you the opportunity to learn and develop. A business with a military management and communication style while management is absent and all the time sitting in their offices or in long meetings. If you want to just be a minion and do what the manager tells you while getting a pay check, then this is the place for you. If you want to grow, develop, and learn then you need to find a different company. If you want to promote, you need to move to a different site and relocate as this site management promotes ""yes"" people and their friends and acquaintances."
bad,"stryker has  a very poor managment team, they have hard working employees but are always under appreciated! The managment team only focuses on what you did not do, what you could not do, rather than focusing on all of the other areas you did well. Stryker has a very high turn over rate, very month or so they lose 1 to 2 people."
bad,"Stryker is a great company, however they will work you to death, literally.  They pay you well, but don't compensate enough in other areas.  Your work/life balance is usually very biased toward working.  7 day, 12 hour shifts are quite common."
bad,"This company will hire anybody that wants to basically kill him/herself. I heard from many people that they want to leave because they go mad. "
bad,"Too many managers not enough employees. "
bad,"There is not much to say, this manufacturing site has had high leadership turn-over and high exempt employee turnover.  There is not enough employees in each of the support departments and the managers are forced to do without enough support stretching them very thin.  There will never be a great outcome when they do not let you hire the right amount of people to manage the responsibilities.  The new regional level management should go, cost savings alone with this layer eliminated would be outstanding and the absence would probably allow for local decisions to be made more efficiently."
bad,Stryker Sustainability Solutions was the device reprocessing side of Stryker. OEM's started consistently changing products making it hard to reprocess. When we did have products to sell there was always back order making it difficult to get my customers devices that they needed. The process flow was definitely fractured.
bad,Production trying to make there numbers each hour push you to go full pace for little pay very strict attendance frustrating demands for little compensation on feet all day
bad,"Very stressful, insecure environment, great if you like that. "
bad,Management is horrible!! Cant ever count on management getting the job done correctly done without having favoritism. Only way to stay permanent is going to 2nd or 3rd which is distressingly bad.
bad,"Culture is driven entirely on the dollar - make money at all costs."
bad,Most people here are stuck up and not nice to work with. It’s like being back at high school and dealing with mean popular kids.  Plenty of egos going around.  You can make good money here if you don’t mind dealing with conceited people in a toxic culture.
bad,"Written, signed, legal document. They decided not to honor. Excellent worker. 6 months just to get hired from employment agency! Same for most people. Who does that?!"
bad,"Stryker is meant for certain mindsets. They hired a lot of young people and type A personalities. When I was there, did not see much concern for the lower level employees as much emphasis was advancement at the higher level."
bad,Good company with lots of growth opportunities. Young people can come in and build a solid career for themselves if they can get into this company. Good learning environment.
bad,"The culture at Stryker was misleading. There is no Six Sigma, no continual improvement, poor qualkity control, and little to no transparent oversight."
bad,"My department had no local manager. Employees calling off work every week it was not fun trying to maintain customer service when your by yourself. Busy enough that when others decide they don't feel like coming to work the customer suffers. Not talking about occasionally sick, this was week after week for over two years. Two co-workers would call off or just not show up at all. My manager was out of control when they finally brought one in to try and get the two coworkers inline. He over compensated by trying to intimidate people. He would police rather than manage. Discourage instead of encourage. Zero people skills and should have never been given the title as manager."
bad,"Horrible People, Too much Impertinent people.. Very click environment and poor management for employees.Communication can be challenging in such a large organization."
bad,Remedial tasks that take you away from selling. Market is struggling and I am happy to be away from device sales.
bad,"Was laid off after a month. The two sales reps in my area wanted me to learn things overnight so I could take call ASAP. I was out in the field almost every day when I was suppose to be doing the mandatory 8 week at-home/online training which lead into class room training after completing it. The reps did not care and told me to do the training at night. Management made excuses not to back me and stated I did not fit their personality and his hands were tied. Prior to accepting the position, the reps/management advised me it would take several months before I would start understanding and making sense of everything. I feel like i was set up for failure."
bad,Strkyer don't care about nobody.they don't support you for anything. They don't even wants to give us raises.they don't do much for us on the holidays like thanksgiving and Christmas. We work hard and they don't even wants to reward us.they have favoritism. Even the supervisors.they let their friends get away with anything.
bad,"Lakeland is all smoke and mirrors. If you do not drink the HR ""kool aid"" where everyone is forced to put done a 5 on a Q12 Gallup survey then you are looked at negatively.  Open and honest feedback only puts a target on your back. Training does not exist and the only way to get promoted is to become or date someone in HR. For a medical device company operations is awful. No real safety trainings and you have to go faster and faster! The hours are awful and overtime is forced. You are better off going to Amazon down the road. Its a hard job at Amazon but much better pay and room for advancement. Stryker pay is awful and management changes all the time. Management has not clue what they are doing but always knows how to look good. My advice is find a better job in Lakeland with a real company. The plant seems to be doing bad and who knows what will happen."
bad,"Happy for two years, I had no managment for the second part of my career, then I was transfered and recieved no managment, no help, no teamwork, no communication, and spent every day hating my job. The constant backstabbing from individuals. They did not remburse me for my tuition, they didnt pay for my vacation and they didnt allow me to take vacation."
bad,"Multiple meetings in a day with no effective outcome. Lack of accountability from departments. 99% paper based, which is worrying from a document retention and retrieval perspective. No retention policy. Low pay but good bonus and good appreciation awards. No matter how much you work, it’s all about who you know. As a result, people tend to stay within their comfort zones because they don’t see the benefit of going above and beyond. Praise and appreciation from hard work is often taken at management level even though all the work is done by the team. Awful at offering promotions but good opportunity to move horizontally. Lots of exposure, resulting in experience and work that is above the average salary offered by other companies."
bad,Stryker is a very bizarre place of employment.  It is highly influenced by gallup poling for hiring as well as on going assessments of employees and managers.  It is truly a bizarro environment where popularity trumps performance.
bad,Whats good for the Goose is not good for the gander!!  Work life balance does not exist..  To expensive to participate in any of the compensations offered.  Management and CEO need to take the blinders off and focus or listen to the people who make them what they are.  Far to many arrogant people  in one spot.  Work standards are not the same for different divisions. Very petty company!!
bad,"This company apparently used to be a great place to work for, or so I'm told, but since I started I noticed that it's on a rapid downward spiral. Benefits keep getting downgraded or complicated by gotcha rules. "
bad,"Employees hired thru contract are treated very unfair. Managers nly hire people they like, there's lot of favoritism.  People that are Strykers employees are not counted as part of their company success, they avoid talking about hiring opportunities with contracted employees. I worked in the QA dept, and Stryker employees treat workers under contract so rudely."
bad,"Management lacks integrity and consistently fails to live up to its ""core values"".  The culture is rooted with individuals who are completely devoid of any decency."
bad,"I am currently an assembler with high work ethic, integrity, and accountability. I get the job done that is asked stay so many hours and still live paycheck to paycheck with little to NO praise at all. I have been there a year and have pushed for better safety, ethics, and self improvement hoping it will lead to advancement. Everyone gets shut down and told NO ""for the betterment of the company"" they will not offer raise because of course it's not what you know but rather who you blow. "
bad,"I was very excited coming on board with Stryker. I did not know it was going to be so stressful. I have to keep up with my payroll, production. They run a very tight ship."
bad,"Aprendi no dia a dia a lidar com as adversidades. Passei por diversos Diretores no período de quase dois anos e durante esse tempo, tive que lidar com as situações mais inusitadas possíveis, o que me rendeu um bom aprendizado profissional e pessoal."
bad,"super environement de travail"
bad,My Stryker experience is probably not typical. All of my work has been in a recently acquired start up. There is huge disconnect and cultural misalignment between my team and the company leadership.
bad,"Very fast paced but simple work, no focus on employee growth and no work life balance. Frowned upon by management if employees left on time and the management are extremely hypocritical when it comes to many simple things. Decent pay and perks but if you work for Stryker be prepared to learn the job and that's it, no challenges to learn anything new. Additionally the culture is very outdated and poorly structured. within 6 months i knew i would not want to be here past a year."
bad,"Es una gran compañía con buenos productos. Sin embargo, ha sufrido grandes cambios en los últimos años tanto en la Dirección como en la estrategia. Necesita redirigir ambos sentidos para recuperar cuota de mercado e imagen de sus clientes."
bad,"You are shipped all over your region with little to no notice. There are a few perks, but they keep cutting them out when they feel like it. There is no home/work balance whatsoever, just plan on being gone for a long time. The project managers are for the most part unorganized and have no idea what it takes in terms of time or materials to install the equipment."
bad,"Working for Stryker was originally in my long term plan. However, after uprooting my life and moving across the country my position was eliminated at this location. Poor job security."
bad,"At first I thought this was a great place to work and was excited to be part of their 'mission' that they drill into you during a week long classroom orientation... Didn't take long though to find out how wrong I was. I was contracted through a staffing agency and though my pay was good, and most everyone I worked with were great people, management was terrible. After 6 months of working there, the stress and frustration was too much. If you weren't a direct hire Stryker employee, you were nothing more than an accounts payable bill. Temps were not allowed to attend any outside events or functions, like company picnics, but were expected to cooperatively be a fully invested team player. Temps/contract employees are basically brought in to work with no benefits, no time off, and no guarantee of direct hire..using many temps for years.. Overtime is discretionary depending on your department and mandatory overtime can be any hours they tell you..even if it is 8 hrs or less since your last shift ended. They continuously bring on temps and instead of hiring in temps that have been there months to years working in a position, they will advertise for those positions and hire in someone off the street and many times have the a temp train this person.... Demeaning and insulting. For a company listed 16 of 100 best places to work, my experience was they aren't. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone except as a last resort or you have nothing but time to work yourself exhausted trying to prove your worthy to be a Stryker employee. At the time I left, I had been signed off on 6 different"
bad,"Management can’t look past themselves ."
bad,Not a great culture for women to advance. You will work a lo t of hours and you will be compensated fairly.  Quotas double and triple year after year.  If you do not achieve quota you will be put on an improvement agreement.  Be ready to put in a lot of hours and pushed relentlessly.
bad,"The mangaement team has some pretty unreasonable expectations. Everything seems to be in a rush over there. Everything is a crisis."
bad,"They only hire he people they ""like"""
bad,"To be honest, it is very backwards that it is somehow okay for workers to sit around talking at their desks from 2-5 when work is done for the day yet it is not okay to work from home."
bad,The most enjoyable part o my job at stryker was the people I worked with. I loved the atmosphere and the employee's I worked with. Although the job itself was challenging and you are laid off If you make 1 mistake even in training.
bad,"Sao Paulo offices are great located in Itaim neighborhood."
bad,"Very politically correct atmosphere. Keep your mouth shut. Do your job and go home. People here have their own agenda and it may not include you. Management is clueless, constant change. They make great products and the work itself is enjoyable. Many of the employees have little experience before working here and have no idea on how to solve problems. Very tight with the dollar, they are not a healthcare company, the thinking is that of a manufacturing company."
bad,"Well-known and easy to sell, but extremely high expectations with no guidance or support. No product training, no resources for marketing products. Very political, no loyalty. "
bad,"Stryker as a Company is wonderful. Stryker Management however is a joke. They put ""know nothing's"" in charge. Once in place, they form their own alliance. Sales dollars run the company. As long as they're unaffected, no one asks any questions. Management is unprofessional, and turns a blind eye to issues that don't directly effect them. Everyone around me was terminated for questionable reasons. After being left to run the facility for a year, with no promotion, I voiced my opinions. Four months later, after adequate staffing was addressed, I was falsely accused of mistakes made by new employees and immediately terminated. Avoid this company like the plague. The pay was excellent, however the political and vindictive nature of its environment is nothing short of a nightmare. I worked for the company for 23 years."
bad,"I truly wish I could say good things about Stryker Neurovascular. The products are absolutely awesome and life changing/saving. But, while I was there, I saw multiple good people being beaten down by the senior management. The turnover rate was and is still very high. At this time, when the internet, Facebook and LinkedIn keep us very informed - there are almost 20 people within the past 2 years that have been used, politicized and then ""performanced out"" when the organization doesn't need that particular skill or someone in senior management decides that person is ""working against"" them. It is a place where being related to anyone - no matter their qualifications - is the first to be hired and then protected. Stryker NV has the ability to be a great company - but not until they change the management styles and put in some ""rules"" about nepotism. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that our devices were saving people from the ravages of stroke. People that would have previously would have had to live with the results - sometimes in a vegetative state for the rest of their lives - can literally walk out of the hospital with minimal long term affects after a few days. I miss the organization and the products - but I don't miss very many of the people. To be fair, politics are not my strong suit - but this was well beyond politics and that is why I finally left the organization when I had the opportunity."
bad,"Don't be deceived by the best place to work awards in Canada. This company asks a lot from its employees, plus some. If you want a challenging career, with weekend work at no extra pay, then Stryker could be a fit for you however, if you want work / life balance, stay very very far away from this company, as there is no work / life balance at Stryker in Canada. "
bad,"The company is heavily focused on sales.  So much so that infrastructures, standards and processes have not been managed or developed properly for a company this size.  Overall employees are given a lot of exposure to different areas of the company and there is very useful for someone without any experience to get involved in projects because so many areas can be improved.  There is no work/life balance.  They mention is but they really only care about you getting results no matter how much time is needed for that to happen."
bad,No one shoukd join Stryker India Gurgaon office as they dont have sufficient work to do.
bad,"well above average pay and benefits, but treatment of employees is deplorable. seems company is more about profiting, than caring for employees, or handling employee concerns, management did nothing about problems presented to them."
bad,Large company not a bad place to work at. I would work here again for sure.  Great people and good work culture.  Good compensation. Good reputation at company.
bad,"It’s more of who u know then what you know. A lot of favoritism, a lot of brown nosers. Raises are really bad between 20 cents and 40 cents per year. A lot of cool people but managers don’t know much kinda just put in the roles, supervisors also. A lot of time wasted on non productive stuff. They work you really hard and your opinion really doesn’t matter."
bad,Working at Stryker is all about Stryker and not about the customers or more importantly the patients. It’s all about up charging and being deceptive on pricing to the surgeons you call on.
bad,"Great when I started but has slowly been getting worse until I did not want to go to work there at all. If management goes back to basics then it could be amazing, but for now I do not recommend."
bad,Lot's of free lunches and company activities but felt undervalued. But I did learn a lot about the Investigation of returned Product from the field and adverse events.
bad,"Thought Stryker stood for something, perhaps management makes it feel it doesn't.  Regardless, it's all about the popularity and smooching the right ""person"". Very childish people, not kidding, my son is 10 yrs. old and displays more maturity. "
bad,"Fine for some,not others. Best for those new to the work force.  Very political and divisions highly separated. Company does appear to be concerned about its place in the local community."
bad,This review is really only for people that work in the field and travel. Stryker is good to have on your resume but not great for anything more than very basic technical skills. Food allowance is good if you only eat twice a day. Your tools will weight 65+ lbs and you need to travel/fly to every job with most of them. Installs are the most unorganized I have seen with 10+ years of experience in field service. 1/3 of your day will consist of looking for and ordering missing parts and going back to previously installed areas to install parts you didn’t receive on time. 2/3 will be installing equipment. There is also a double standard between policy/training and what you are asked to do when in the field. Not all but it seems as most of the management have only ever been with Stryker in a professional environment and you can tell. The benefits are average for the industry. The 401k looks good on paper but is only matched at the end of the year and has other requirements. I would not recommend working in the field with Stryker but I would if you are looking at in house positions.
bad,"Wake up early, get the hospital and prep for 2-4 cases for the day."
bad,Great company. Very fast paced and competitive. This company allows you to run your own business with the support of a large corporation to back you. The sky is the limit with this job.
bad,Stryker did well to acquire Mako's surgical robot.  It is the most exciting orthopaedics product on the market.  Most non-engineering employees and several key engineers left after the acquisition so one only hopes that the continued improvement of the Mako is maintained.
bad,I honestly feel like the only thing they care about is making the number. It's ok when you first start working but after a while it gets exhausting and aggravating
bad,"Lack of communication between rep and management."
bad,I really don't know what to say but since they brought out Berchtold it seems like everything has went down hill from there.
bad,"When new management took over the company slipped with quality, and quantity became the importance, I was asked to do things that I did not believe was right, but did not question my boss"
bad,Very displeasing experience. Continuosly over worked. Associates stir up conflict and act uncouth on a daily basis. I really wish the management put more into organizing a pleasant enviorment
bad,This company had the potential to be better but was not materialized during the time I worked there due to constant change in management.
bad,"LLegaba a las 07:30 mi horario de entrada era a las 08:30 pero me gustaba llegar pronto por el temido atasco y tomar cafe con mis compañeros, nos cambiabamos y veiamos las prioridades del día y nos repartiamos las tareas, lo mas difícil era que nos pedían materiales que se tenían que revisar muy bien para la siguiente cirugía y a veces sentias que no llegabas a tiempo pero  simepre lo conseguiamos éramos un buen equipo en el que todos nos ayudabamos."
bad,The work is fast paced and rigidly controlled but is not terribly difficult if you can work quickly and follow all of the rules. The problem is the lack of leadership and coordination. The procedures change constantly and there is no clear hierarchy of authority. The company talks a lot about being invested in their employees but they enforce rigid policies and will fire anyone at any time. Probably the hardest part of the job is not knowing from one day to the next what your schedule will be or what you will be doing.
bad,"As an operational support Team Member working in a Branch office, from the minute you walk through the door in the morning until you leave (often times late into the evening), it's non-stop stress. Sales Reps rule the roost and run rampant day in and day out making unreasonable requests and outrageous demands of the support team and no one, from management to HR, seems to care. The verbal abuse suffered by Team Members at the hands of the Sales Reps is inexcusable yet Stryker turns a blind eye. If you bring it up to management or HR, they find a way to get rid of YOU. Been there, done that... was relieved of my position after many years of loyal and dedicated service. Do yourself a favor, if you are insane enough to want to break into this industy, seek out Stryker's competition."
bad,"Management tend to pacify the salespeople without having any accountability, while operations has to suffer for any and everything. It has been that way for the past 9 years. 4 Ops and 3 Branch managers later, it is still the same, with no changes in the near future. Like I stated before, I can't speak for all branches but Dublin OH."
bad,I was there and didn't have any problems.  It was ok I guess.  Hard to get into though.  It just wasn't a good long-term fit for me.  I can't really complain.
bad,The culture has changed and not for the better.  I do not have confidence in the company's integrity and concern over the customer.  I am saddened by the change
bad,"Very on professional training with the company and working with a new job People 0 respect for the new people they are "
bad,"Take as much as they can from you, whatever you give, they will take. Feels like you can never go home. Half the battle is learning how to prioritize all deadlines. Meetings and meetings and more on your plate but you’re in meetings."
bad,Stryker is not what it appears. They have the worst management ever. Inappropriate jokes in hallway.  The company needs to provide more training wrt to professionalism at work. Glad that I left the company.
bad,"Poor management, stressful work environment, constantly changing directions, lack of communication, lack of direction, lots of talk but no actions, favoritism"
bad,"Stryker is a great growth company, but it has grown too fast and senior leadership has lost their way with not understanding the hurdles of delivering on a multitude of manual reporting.  Stryker is top heavy with their leadership and they are not value added.  If they want to keep from destroying the employee's spirit and keep them from leaving Stryker, they need to clean house with non value added directors and a host of finance managers that manage no employees, but only add to the complexity of what the middle management and first line analyst must keep up with.  The whole GQO layer for finance is an unnecessary layer when the selling division finance departments can manage the financials just fine on their own if they add cost accountants to their org.  I have been at Stryker for many years and I'm tired of seeing the way senior leadership behaves with their subordinates."
bad,"to many young people who dont know what they are doing, a lot of back stabbing and not much career advancement as many of the empoyees are there for a while and dont move up"
bad,"When selling for Stryker, my number one competitor was other Stryker reps competing over the same capital budget that I was.  Their quotas are very aggressive and as a result there is high turnover.  Great products, great support from Stryker customer service and product management.  Sales culture needs major help.  Deep organizational issues that manifest in unethical behavior."
bad,"If interest is strong in medical devices, this is a good company to work for.  The Employee Shared Services in corporate location is particularly exceptional:  professional; supportive and provides excellent employee assistance."
bad,"There is a good mission statement at Stryker but it is not always followed by management. Integrity and development of people needs improvement. Overall, colleagues are conscientious."
bad,You're on an island and its sink or swim.  Don't expect much help but definitely expect ridiculous quotas.  Interesting experience being in operating rooms though.
bad,Unless your hired in and not a temp its not a fun place to work they see you as cheap labor
bad,"If your trying to get into stryker its very hard, even as a contractor as they still want to offer jobs to internal candidates its only if they have no internal interest they look outside of the organization. Interviews are hard as the final one is a presentation followed by interviews lasting around 3 to 4 hours."
bad,"The departments I worked in were riddled with drama and rumors.  They keep temps for over a year.  I frequently heard these things were just factory drawbacks, but the severity of these issues should not be merely accepted as typical.  A manager encouraging an individual to tell of coworker misdeeds with promises of advancement and another sleeping with an assembler left me with a foul taste in my mouth.  I prefer not to be the person stating rules and regulations, but this place was the prime example as to why we have them in the first place."
bad,"didn't have a great experience working in Stryker, HR and senior leadership is not that great, believes in hierarchy and not an encouraging environment on openness"
bad,"To sum it it, Stryker Sustainability is where saying ""straight talk"" before you talk to someone gives you permission to bash them and be rude to them. It's basically the same as saying ""no offense"" and then offering up a very rude statement. A company that runs this way is going to run its employees into the ground."
bad,"Work is very unbalanced among the line, management is very disconnected from line level duties."
bad,we had a culture of learning and improving. they really cared about their employees and would act on the yearly gallup survey all employees were asked to take. recently it's more important to get a 100 percent participation then a good score and if your one to give a bad score or question anything your gone. it was a good place and can still be. stay under the radar.
bad,"They want to fire me bc of my education. Excuse me, I have my diploma in my hand, since I was a temp. Definitely hiring a lawyer. This is not right. I’ve been here for almost a year and this is how they treat you."
bad,Didn't pay good enough but the environment was clean and quiet enough to work and get don't the things that needed to be. Staff was responsible and kind
bad,"een typische dag op het werk "
bad,"is a company with a vision, a plan and a strategy, overall Europe and global is a great place to work in, Italy is the one with the lowest cultural standard but still a good place. Workhours are terrible."
bad,"You are surrounded by many motivated ""type A"" people (it's who they recruit). The work is very interesting and there is always something new to work on. People have a ""can do,"" attitude. "
bad,Great place to work for experience but very hard to move. The atmosphere is very numbers driven and results driven like any other place. Great people to work with and great benefits.
bad,Stryker is a beautiful facility with in house cafeteria perks. Certain department managers are very negative and can create uncomfortable working environment with favoritism. I would not confide in manager or HR as it is very high school clique atmosphere. I keep my head down and try to remain neutral. Not staying long!
bad,"I was happy to get hired but it was only for one month, it hurt my hands assembling the beds, unfriendly employees, said I was quiet and shy, bad hours."
bad,"Stryker started off OK but I quickly found that that people were not their priority. It's a disposable commodity, and management are typically Type-A drivers."
bad,"The workforce is energetic, fast paced and competitive, and you do feel like you are part of a larger mission to make healthcare better."
bad,"Political, did not value representative input on strategies. job description not accurate on posting site. All you do is the manual work for rep you work under... pick up used devices..."
bad,"Had a couple of telephone interviews. The first one with HR went well. The second interview with the manager could have been a bit more professional. "
bad,"The make you work really long hours and it takes time away from your family. They work off of a 5 point system, after those 5 points you are out a job. The job was very easy my 5 year old could do it. This is not a job for you if you have a family."
bad,"A typical day at work could range from servicing current customer, case support in the OR, and sales activity through many different methods, but primarily it is a relationship development type sale and role."
bad,used to be Ascent. over half workforce is contract or temp.  lab is not organized yet.  little to no management over lab.  present lab technicians (3 total) were pulled from production and are without degree.  poor communication between lab and engineers.  lab personnel feel slighted resulting in apathy having little to no teamwork attitude.
bad,Great people and environment. Awesome 401K plan. can often times feel like high school (cliques). Inexperience management group and often times only stay with a department for 2 years then move on.
bad,Stryker is a tough place to work at if you have a family if you want to work a 40 hr work week and go home then DONT APLLY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!! A normal work week for a welder is like 60-80 hrs a week and yes it’s good money but I’m sick of the grind I haven’t had a day off in about 3 months that’s not a joke they do pay good and the people there are nice and easy to work with but they want you to live there and I’m done doing that
good,They only hire through a temp agency and then terminate you and lower your salary or terminate you. The company does not want to pay for medical benefits or offer a 401k to save money. They get around this by only hiring through a temp agency.
good,To much politics and preferences not based on your experience or performance but in your ability to socialize and sell yourself. Middle managment not well prepared to handle employees.
good,"I would start at 700am answer the phone take orders handle hot runs until the others came in at 830am. i would deliver implants and intruments to various hospital in ohio. i learned alot about the bussness, where to go in hospitals to drop off implants and inst. for surgery. my coworkers are the best. the hardest part was getting implants and instr. from same day surgery to go to other hospitals. the most enjoyable part was when everything came together and the surgeries came off with out a hitch."
good,I would not recommend this company to any of my friends.  The training was poor up until the day I left.  The employees on the team would tend to talk over the supervisor most of the time!
good,"Not a bad company but poorly managed as far as the production department. Work long hours, 10-14hrs at times and 6-7 days per week, with little or no appriciation. Leaving very little time for family or outside life."
good,I would recommend working here because it looks good on your resume. People don't come to Stryker from other medical device companies but most people leave Stryker to go to other medical device companies. A clear indication of the culture built at Stryker.
good,"Great company with great compensation and benefits, but it comes with a price. It will rob you of your time with your family, because you have to make your number and you'll find yourself chained to your quota even when you're asleep. Like what a lot of sales rep here say,   if you're smart you work in the corporate, if you're stupid you work for the field sales. No job security at all. You could be getting all the accolades this month/year, but if you fail to make your number next month/year, none of them past good performances matter."
good,"Be prepared for a job with unrealistic expectations and a corporate culture of dog eat dog. They will use you until they burn you out or drive you away. Your family life really doesn't matter. Be prepared to go the distance for management with  a ""what have you done for me today ""attitude. Work hard. The best part of my experience there was my first day, and the day after I left."
good,"Great Wages, but poor management and unfair treatment. If the Sales Team and coworkers weren't so great never would of been there as long as i was. Management needs to be replaced with someone qualified with people skills."
good,Like any relationship there were ups and downs. Typically it did not appear that they valued their employees by either paying them their worth or treating them as such.
good,Challenging envirnoment. Communication between sales team and office could be much better. Good benefits but not a great work life balance. No room to advance.
good,"Unrealistic expectations.  You are given a quota without any thought to the territory you cover.  There are managers and reps that are protected and given cupcake quotas while others are given unrealistic numbers."
good,Always buying and consolidating. Careful looking at certain Stryker sites. They may be gone soon and uou may be hired to close it down and eliminate your own job
good,"If you love overtime and working 12 hours a day plus weekends, this is the job for you. The facility is very nice and they have a great cafeteria. Food is cooked on the premises including everything from sushi to pizza. The machine shop is very clean. Middle management can be a bit unruly at times and they demand a lot from you. A very fast paced environment."
good,The company was well maintain an productive just a waste of time going through the temp service to have an assignment end after almost a year and get behind in payments in life thinking its worth my time
good,"Its a good company, but management need to weave out all the non qualified supervisors.  If they can get candidates that qualifies for the supervisory positions and takes pride in their job it would be a perfect place to work.  This company goes through many changes everyday with its production process which can be overwhelming at times.  It is under staffed most of the time and 1 person has to do a 2 or 3 person job.  Work hours are very volatile.  This is a for profit company so they will try to keep the head counts low.  They are also veering away from their purpose as to sustain medical devices from going to the land fills and protect the environment.  I can say more but I'll just leave it here."
good,"Travel 100% for repairs, never know your schedule as this is the nature of the job however, you are typically the boss of your schedule, mostly evening repairs.  Restructure of corporate processes happen frequently, pay minimal compared to other companies, decent benefits."
good,"my first day of joining is me typical because its mostly in operation theatre.but i like to work, i learned some more like how to speak with doctor,its nice management to work but they didnt my salary after one year also,my co workers are very friendly with me,most enjoyable part of my work is we can directly go to operetion theatre ."
good,Work life balance was poor and it was a very competitive environment where people did not work as a team when they could advance.  My manager did not support me.
good,"A great place to save money, avoid wife, or children if you work on the road. "
good,Its a good place for part time but dont expect to pay bills untill the company grows a bit people are great to work for but just not enough hours and no guarantee that you will get enough shifts in a week it is a baby company so they do not provide any health care or benefits to their employees maybe when they mature more as a company they will be able to provide these things I wish that I could continue with them but like I said not enough hours to support myself or pay
good,"There is a lot of autonomy in the Associate Sales Representative role. "
good,I was placed at stryker thru a temp agency. I learned how to manage a small group of people. as for management my supervisor was great but other management was rude and hatful.
good,I did not meet my Manager until 4 month into my job but my existing coworker did a great job training me to a point. The system was similar to my other job but was not trained properly to do my task
good,Great company but lacks management experience. Managers are hired on who they know not what they know unfortunately. Company has little to no base pay.
good,"I worked in Customer Services - the team was truly wonderful. So welcoming. The day to day work was slightly repetitive but i didn't mind that so much because the team really made a positive impact on one another to keep each other going."
good,People are very serious. All are in pressure. No proper recognition of your hard work.
good,"Actively Looking."
good,"A typical day started with a meeting in the morning, followed by working on several projects, with a focus on the ones that were the most urgent"
good,"I'm only a contractor so I'm not at liberty to enjoy the benefits of an employee.  I have, however, added some valuable attributes for future employment."
good,"Management does not listen to employees and could care less about workers on the floor,you are just a number to them.I would not recommend them to anybody unless you are working in the offices."
good,Relocated from SE New Hampshire and never really seems to fit in with the locals.
good,"Some managers make their direct reports' lives miserable."
good,"Most newly hired employees are contractors at Stryker so the position can easily be terminated if necessary. Turnover is gigantic!!  As a contractor you will receive no PTO or Holiday pay, you will only get paid for the time you work. Also you will receive no health benefits as a contractor.  Lastly the permanent employees treat contractors as if they have a social disease.  Not even a simple ‘hello’ or ‘good morning’ because your employee ID says ‘CONTRACTOR!’   Sad!    I left after a year for a better opportunity!!  If you’re looking a second income this might work."
good,Difficult to get used to company structure because it changes constantly. Recently our shifts were changed which results results in exempt employees having to punch in and out for lunch and working an additional 30 minutes at the end of shift.
good,"Very high job productivity demand work place. Company’s policies very strict which not so great if your a father or mother. Yet, very nice people to be around. Advanced with the tools needed to comply with government and customers."
good,A typical day consisted of meeting expected targets to reach daily customer demands. Think of new ideas to reduce waste in our operations. I learned a lot about Lean Manufacturing/Six Sigma concepts to reduce waste in our processes. Morale in the culture was not the best. Good leaders came and went and effected the morale of the workplace. The hardest part of the job was receiving engineering help when you needed it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.
good,"I worked in various departments and always worked with good people! The people make the team and the team pushed the work loads on a daily basis. Like in any company, there are good and bad but I'd like to say I did experience mostly the good. Stryker is a Great company, doing great things, and saving lives in the process."
good,"There is no vision and the workforce is understaffed. Projects are quick fixes, there is no team but just individuals trying to meet deadlines. Programs do not have sustainability."
good,We worked 50 hours a week and some times mandatory Saturdays. they don't care about your home life or if you get sick they're give you 4 days every 6 months and you start to occur points after that anything above 2 points you won't be hired on with the company and points don't drop for a year.
good,"Stryker is a great place to work.  However, if paired up with the wrong manager life maybe a little different than what’s in the handbook.  No set process and little direction from management."
good,"There are a lot of people who are very full of themselves, but there are some pretty cool people in the mix. Don't tell anyone a secret or potential deal, as it will not be for long"
good,"Stryker requires employees take a Gallop personality assessment.  It is a form of discrimination."
good,Stryker India is highly commercial organization where employees doesn't matter to them that is the reason Stryker India always has high attrition rate. Its like typical Indian company under brand of MNC.
good,"It needs an individual who loves driving long distances and good marketer, matured person whom they can call anytime for work."
good,Management can't get it together.  Treat hourly employees like they aren't worth anything.  Salaried employees forced to work excessive overtime.
good,Tough to get hired in. Have to be there long enough and sometimes still go YEARS without getting hired. Apply at your own risk
good,Cons: Political. Minimal room for advancement. Lower than average pay. Changing for the worse. Pros: Many good people. Highly productive environment.
good,"A typical day can be jovial and fun. The wealth of learning gained from working at Stryker is well worth the hard work. Some management is incredible and the best you'll find; some inexperienced and far removed. The hardest parts of the job are: inefficient processes, the expectation to be available regularly outside of working hours (for no overtime) and giving 110% for little recognition or career growth. Regardless, one of the best places to work for learning business and having a fun time at work!"
good,Constant request and phone call. After work you must work from home to keep above water. Food is catered in a couple times a month. Management is highly involved in your success.
good,The diverse culture is not there.  Everyone is not a team player.  The managers do not support you. Seem a lack of training and lack of trust.  The values of the company are not the value I experience on my current team.
good,It’s was good for a while but management keeps on changing and the culture keeps changing but if you the kind of person that doesn’t mind getting barked at go right ahead
good,"The people at Stryker are amazing, but the leadership is unable to adapt to the rapidly changing organization. There is often a push to take the most expedient decisions, resulting in very questionable decisions."
good,Great place to work. great pay. long hours. benefits are a plus. 401k is excellent. vacation time is generous. paid sick time a plus. close to home. security around building
good,"Pay is okay, benefits ok. Work isn’t too hard unless you’re completely lazy. Management could be better but the people are great and easy to get along with"
good,"Cobrança altíssima, poucos recursos, falta sistemas e processos. Ambiente altamente instável."
good,"The company used to be stressful, but I've been told it is a different culture now.  SO I have no clue what the company is currently like.  In many cases these ratings are forced, irrelevant and insignificant."
good,It was a good job with nice benefits. But overall held back by a toxic work environment that management and upper management were very aware of but took no actions to correct. I saw for 3 years as the bad employees and trouble and drama continued to thrive and fester and the good workers leave. It's disappointing because there is a ton of potential but the work culture and lack of caring by most of the management is truly crippling the overall work experience.
good,good company but management is poor. they don't compensate by work done but rather likes. great benefits and you are required to work longer hours per week
good,"Job culture is very bad. Not a happy envirnomant to live, but that all depends on team also. Old people now turned into people manager, they just want to rule the SGTC(India) like anything. If you are from some good company don't join it."
good,"Great company brand, smart people and hard workers. The company definitely stands a head above in terms of quality products, following above and beyond compliance standards and doing the right thing for customers. I will say also that traveling for Stryker is pretty fair, they let you keep airline miles and give a fair per day allowance. They don't pay as much as some other companies to their product managers, and moving up and around in the organization is made difficult by company politics. Tons of weekend work, the definition of a bottomless bucket. You can break your back to never get acknowledged, so sadly its all about favorites and who you know."
good,"helaas te weinig en onstabiele aantal uren. begrijp soms niet welke mensen e wel aanhouden en voldoende uren geven en welke niet."
good,The system that was in place was antiquated for and adp product and they were not utlizing the full spectrum of the original package they paid for. They also were paying for upgrades that did not have to be done as they are not a fortune 500 company and it was way more expensive then it should have been but they were leading this project with hr director who had no know ledge of payroll systems
good,"I am a hard worker i like to learn new things. They change management so quickly there,and have a lot of favorites so it as hard for me to get the opportunity to learn new things."
good,"Once hired into the distribution center, don't expect to ever leave that building. There is no room for advancement unless you know important people or wear a tie. Jobs are posted frequently, but unless you already have every skill necessary, and then some, to do a job, you will get passed over. Management in the distribution center is substandard. The supervisor is non-confrontational and does not address issues in a timely manner. If you are in the ""clique"", you are good. If you don't fit in, you are pretty much ignored."
good,"good place to work and the they give is sufficient enough to grow and perform "
good,If you are looking for a challenge this is the place to be. Great people and excellent products.
good,"Some areas were terrific to work for, some not so much depending on the manager.  Lots of room for improved software system.  Good products, takes pride in quality and growth."
good,"Needs better management. While working there, one manager will tell you to do something while an engineer will try to change it. Very confusing. If there are problems between employees, management will not find a resolution to the issue. Instead, they seem to instigate the problems further."
good,"Work day is busy depends on the situation,"
good,"Work hard, play hard and sink or swim mentality"
good,"Great company,awesome benefits. Management suck no leadership no team work .  No organization ,no structure , working of the sit of their pants. always working under press, are turn-off fires."
good,Its an okay job as long as you have something better in mind. The salary is minimum and you start as a temporary agent to ger your permanence in 1 year.
good,Management is worried about them self. Cutting up the best sales team in the industry. They are trying to make it like every other med device job.  It just isn’t what it used to be.
good,Decent place to work as the money goes. You start inside in MFR at about 24k....ish and after about 4ish years you go up to about 33/34k for a product builder.
good,"Stryker was a great place to work mostly due to its Culture. I have toured / worked any many different companies and none compare to Stryker. This is the only reason i stayed with them as long as i did. Unfortunately Stryker fails in the rest of the category's. "
good,"Looks good on a resume; however, their policy in recent years is to hire contract for approximately 90 days and lay off just before unemployment can be made available.  At least one HR person told me this. VERY IMPORTANT--once you leave, even if after a contracted position--THEIR POLICY IS TO NOT HIRE BACK IN-EVER."
good,Lack of trust in middle management. Many managers are more concern with saying yes to everyone and their teams brands then making decisions that are right for the company. Big level of favoritism and lack of options for career advancement. Benefits are great. Great bonuses and 401K package.
good,"Hit or miss with managers.  If you have a good manager/leader, your experience will be great.  As soon as you're stuck with a person who has no business leading people - it's terrible.  Culture can be great, but it's definitely a place where you have to be liked by all to advance... rock the boat any and you may as well give up."
good,It feels like working in a start up where you are always on your toes. You have a liberty to work at your will. The division of HI in Stryker is full of challenges.
good,"Was a temp at Stryker medical. Not the worst job I've ever had, but a pretty stressful job. The jobs itself is a piece of cake, but the supervisors are horrible and lazy. Almost every position will have you on your feet for 8 hours a day with some of the work being pretty exhausting, but the building is nice and so are the paid breaks."
good,"My experience is probably atypical.  I was hired as a 1099 with the promise of becoming a full-time employee within 2-3 months.  However, shortly after being hired my position was sub-contracted to an outside staffing organization which resulted in a drastic compensation cut."
good,"Great workplace - culture and people are great. Horrible career growth internal mobility process, which is what the company prides itself on. Compensation is also very low for bay area."
good,Company is stale with very little to no advancement.  No belief in upper management as leaders and solid decision making.
good,"A typical day was working with different member of the organization in order to bring the technology to prospective customers. Does not matter the position, you need to be customer service oriented."
good,"The work environment was pretty good at Stryker, as I was surrounded by some good people and made a few friends. The typical day's work was nothing hard at all, and it was easy to get along with the management. The only problems I had were the long term assignment with no indications of hiring in, and the newly implemented rules forbidding communication between temps and management regarding performance and information on how to improve."
good,Great company. Tough to grow business at certain accounts where contracts are negotiated at the corporate level. Management not regularly present in our area. Tough to have a decent job/life balance when you are an on-call trauma rep.
good,Stryker was a good place to work at if you want all of the hours in the world. It has plenty of over time and plenty to do. The management is kind but stern.
good,"love the people however to much overtime which lead to to leave the company. "
good,"Every company is different. Depending on your position and your desire to grow, your options may be limited unless you are willing to relocate."
good,"Good place to work. Like any other , You get out of it what you put in."
good,Part of a small organization acquired by Stryker.  We never achieved full integration with Stryker.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the clients and the data analysis.
good,"A Typical day at work started at 5am. I was on the Rover Team and I learned about the standard operation procedures to assemble the Rover on my station. The management was great, my co-workers even better and the hardest part of my job was getting up at 3am six to sometimes seven days a week.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my team."
good,"Good company and they try to be good at work life balance but they seem to come up lacking in a few departments."
good,Need to improve. Likewise they must improve in the compensation of employees since the current pay is very low for the work done. They should give more opportunities to the internal talent they possess.
good,"I can atleast put food on table n send my kids to school,it hs been a  great experience working for this company as it's well managed even when the money is not satisfying"
good,Not enough pay for work being done. No paid time off. No overtime pay until you pass the 50 hr mark. Work distribution is not equal. Some workers do much less work.
good,What I learned is that as a manufacturer of health care products there are certain rules of operation that must be follow.  The management is friendly but they insist that the rules must be follow.  No horse play of any kind is allow.  I signed an anti-sexual policy that said that I could be terminated for violation of this rule.  I couldn't agreed more!!!!!!!
good,"Working environment can be stressful due to inexperienced team leaders and constant personnel and management turn over. Many new employees who are less experienced and less educated are compensated more than educated and experienced employees who have been there for years, This is leading to a loss of profitability, worker privileges and job security."
good,It's a very good place for experienced candidate not a good place for freshers please try to improve benefits of workers  and also concentrate on their wellness
good,"Une très belle aventure, produits intéressants et valorisants"
good,"Good Learning, good Salary, helpful colleagues and superiors, great brand image, large number of products,"
good,Be ready to work work work. Make sure that your personal life is set to be on hold. Nothing comes before Ortho and the only true way to enjoy a work/life balance depends on your senior rep and your relationship.
good,"Entreprise qui prend de l’expansion. Bonne culture d'entreprise. Dirigeant inspirant, employés motivés."
good,"- different day everyday"
good,"Stryker hires very fun people, but it can tend to get competitive at times.  Also, management doesn't always like to be challenged on ideas.  However, they do let you work from home if you are sick or if you are children are sick, which is really nice."
good,"There is no work life balance with Stryker. However, the products are superior to the competition and the support from Management is second to none. The resources unlimited."
good,"Fast-paced and high stress environment driven by meeting quotas"
good,Stryker purchased Mako Surgical. This purchase advanced Stryker into the Robotic surgery space. Robotic Surgery is expected to be a $20 Billion market. Stryker has a bright future in orthopaedics/spine.
good,It is a company with great products and technology to offer customers and offers its employee a great opportunity to better themselves and gain valuable work experience. Starting salary and benefits are pretty decent. Management however is not very good and the job culture is not the greatest either. There is not a great team atmosphere and there are a lot of employees that are just looking out for themselves. Management did not recognize unique skill sets and did not adjust the pay scale appropriately to accommodate those special skills set.
good,"I enjoy working at this type of job because it makes me interested on going on forward and working at other companies. I really like the vibe around the company, the co-workers are polite and generous. The hardest part of my job is making new friends because I just moved here from Boston Scientific and managing the fiber optic. Finally, the most enjoyable part of my job are the benefits. I personally do not love the job because of manager wise and making new surroundings, but I just like the job in general."
good,Company is very competitive in the industry.  Strong customer focus.
good,"A typical day at Stryker : Monitor construction progress and identify / rectify all NCR’s, CAR’s etc."
good,"Typical 8 to 5 job Starting with a 8:30 production meeting followed by Shortage meeting.  I was training to use Oracle 12R, wrote desk top instructions for Planning, Materials, MRP and Warehouse.  For the most part great group of co-works, very friendly. The hardest part of the job was the lack of stucture. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with Orcle trainers."
good,"People were nice, place was always stressed out. Management left something to be desired. At the time they wanted all type A personalities. Who knows at this point. It's been a while."
good,"The experience was not too good because it was temporary job, but it was ok. And also that was no benefit I did enjoy the time working there as a machine operator."
good,Long hours for demanding quotas. They will push you to the brink sometimes. Its easy to get injured in the sorting room where they with people getting poked by needles and other medical waste products.
good,Stryker was a good company because of its yearly growth in sales.  However I was disappointed that after five years our acquisition still had not been fully integrated.  A lot of politics as well.
good,"Stryker is multi million dollar company that is well known in the health care community. I’ve been here 2 years before Stryker came in and bought out the company and renamed it. They had everyone fooled!!! We thought we were gonna get raises, they would give us these great benefits, more sick/vacation time, better holiday time off. They gave us great benefits, put us on a point system which was up to 5pts and anything over points you get fired!!! No raises worth the amount of time and hard work we put in. No 5min grace period if your late due to traffic, accidents,etc. Everytime they feed us lunch they gave us bad news. Stryker would be a great company if they stuck to their word on what the company actually offered!"
good,"I arrived, I sat in my cube until the end of the working day.  I was not bothered by anyone during my work in progress.  I found the drive to work pleasant."
good,Stressfull enviroment. Lots of work load.  Low salary for loads of work.  Overall good for new coners to gain experience.  Follow the rules and long term job
good,"The initiative is solely on you to move up and advance, as well as seeking additional training. Also, it seems that new management will tend to replace existing representatives with their own team."
good,As an intern I cannot comment on the working conditions as a stryker employee. My experience was limited in scope and not fully encompassing of the full breadth of opportunities available at this company.
good,"Lost Manager to medical reason and was not replaced. Doing the job of 2 people for few years till company closed."
good,The primary issue I had was the lack of leadership when it came to process knowledge at the middle management level. There is a huge risk of major audit findings due to the lack of internal controls mainly because of a lack of inventory controls at the warehouse level.
good,Stryker day to day job varies based on position. Management changes very frequently and solid growth can be hard to achieve. Stryker provides great opportunities to learn and be engaged within the work place. The workplace is very type A and therefore can be competitive and strict. Stryker has a strong commitment to product quality.
good,"This was a short stint thru a staffing agency.  "
good,The job was  great at Stryker a very productive place to work. You have a lot of opportunity for overtime and make lots of money. on the other hand i is long hours and a lot of standing involved.
good,"I started at Stryker through a temp agency called Kelly services. I started out at $10.05/hr and was working 10 hours a day 6 days a week for the first year+ I was there, the money was nice but it felt like i had no time for any of my family or friends anymore. "
good,Great job. You have to sort cords sitting down. It is fun and cool the food is good. The place smells funny but it pays good and it works out o much not good for money
good,Stryker is like any large med device company to work for. It has its strengths and its weaknesses. If you're in the field it is far more challenging and it is where the dysfunctional nature of a very large company is most evident.
good,I do not want to provide a review for this company. The company employed me for several years. There were pros and cons as with any other company so my review will not provide any of those details.
good,Great opportunity to collaborate with committed and passionate people who take pride in their work and their company. Plenty of opportunities to engage and drive improvement with good exposure for future career growth.
good,Nice Culture but need to modify the Talent development department to give us a major opportunity to growth in the company.  We have a lot of poeple prepared with bachelors degree and they can be useful to make a stronger company
good,Absolute great company to work for. Very collaborative work culture and the people in the company are amazing. Very positive workplace and you are allowed to be compensated for outworking people around you.
good,It was a good place to work. I didnt much care for the 4am start time but I learned a lot about the shiipping industry and what goes into it all. But I enjoyed my co workers.
good,Sun up to past dinner. 5-6 days a week. Fun for a short time but no Life. Good job for a young and ambitious stud out of college looking to grind it to the top.
good,"work/life balance difficult due to old ERP and lack of training for junior staff. High pressure, sales oriented culture. Not for the faint of heart. If you adjust to the culture, you will do well."
good,"The employees from product builders to engineers have a close and friend relationship and are very supportive of one another. As with any company you have good and bad managers. "
good,Stryker is a good place to work but there are management issue.Less pay as compared to the work you delivered.Pressure at work and long working hours.
good,Es un trabajo muy ajorado donde tu salud física y emocional se afectan a diario por la presión de los supervisores y el trabajo en general.
good,"ok to work at, friendly co-workers, no room for advancement really in my position with qualifications. Overall, pleasant place to work, benefits could have been better"
good,"I was not employed directly by Stryker. Unfortunately they go through On Staff. Anytime dealing with temp agencies you do not receive benefits and are extremely under paid for the amount of work an employee puts forth."
good,Good place to work. Met many new people. The lines are really easy. The management is great. I worked in three different areas and loved them all. Would recommend it
good,"Though working under pressure and tack time is essential to grow in for any environment, there was a lack of consideration and services for employees."
good,"you plan your day of working"
good,Stryker is such a large corporation you can never expect to be anything more than a number.  The benefits are wonderful and overall that's what helps to retain the majority of their workforce.  Too many tiers of management and poor management causes a large lack in overall moral.
good,"Stryker underpays about 15% relative to market, because they are a Michigan-based company and do not understand California cost of living. There are definitely some bright and hardworking folks here, but workplace politics is a much stronger force for promotions and choice roles within the department."
good,"Good company , but hard to move up. Unrealistic work load at times. I probably would of stated but the location is not convenient."
good,good company. long way to drive. normal work days. 8 hours. big company. alot of good opportunity if you live near by. holiday friendly. extra events for familys
good,Coordinated team and resolved the difficulties which we faced during validating the products and trained the workers about the measurement systems etc.
good,"Entreprise correcte et salaire honnêtes durant ma période en son sein. Entente entre collègues, feed back régulier et excellent dialogue direction-ouvriers, seul inconvénient travail trop routinier."
good,"abwechslungsreiche Arbeit"
good,May days woud typically go by me opening the doors  and starting  to process an order that was shipped to me from one of the sales reps. I was to check the Quantities sent makes sure they sent what they were supose to and that all the product was in good condition. Once finshed I would transfer all the information about the shipment on the comptuer and contact certain Regional Inventory Managers depending on which area the shipment came from. I also pulled orders for sales reps out in the field and did cycle counts when needed.
good,"Young + growing company"
good,"Best suited for young talent.  Fresh ideas encouraged at Stryker, demanding talent to work at brisk pace and keep abreast of the industry."
good,"a typical day consist of boxing containers, at least 1400 containers a day. this job was a very physical job and very fast pace. some days hot and some days cold"
good,"Customer relations, shipping & receiving, Organizational skills, personal car transportation between hospitals. Ordering supplies, restocking shelves, interactions with the customers"
good,"productive, good environment , safe place to work. fast pace of work must be able too work fast and make sure to put quality first. Nice co-worker that you can depend on."
good,"I was only employed for a month and half here, but overall the people I worked with daily were very hard=working and great to be around."
good,"1. Typical day is applying new and latest technologies"
good,need better management. Easy job if you like to constantly do the same routine every day. It is only good when overtime is scheduled
good,"Good place to work, where you get opportunity to do your best everyday. "
good,"stryker is a great job, however i need a job in florida. not nj"
good,"As the CAD administrator I review the company's internal systems and partners with the information technology department to implement engineering-related software and hardware upgrades within corporate operating mechanisms."
good,"It is a very good place to work, management cares about you, easy to work with the coworkers"
good,I learned a professional quality about myself that I did not know was one of my strengths
good,"Good place to start. Hard work, good compensation. Capital equipment is difficult with them though. Too much competition in the market and UPMC, our biggest client, tends to buy from lowest bidder."
good,"For a contract position this was a good place to work, Learned a about the medical equipment industry"
good,Strykers was and enjoyable experience with great co workers.  The bar/restaurant was a great place to work.  The all together atmosphere was such a wonderful experience.
good,"Stryker is a great company to work for, unfortunately the best perks are found at the HQ in Northern NJ. The branch locations are all ran on their own with different rules and management styles. A typical day at work is 10-12 hours, and you leave feeling like you didn't accomplish enough. Every day begins before 7 am and the phone calls/emails do not end just because you left the office. Stryker is more of a lifestyle than a job or career. You give 100% to them and it's just not enough to get the work done. However, Stryker as a company cares about its people and are making advancements in social policies, healthcare benefits, and company performance every year. I just wish the branch locations didn't burn their employees out as much as they do. A lot of people leave due to burnout and stressful environment"
good,Great benefits. Poor management. Entire corporation is very unorganized. So Tom for growth. They hire outside of the company and rarely promote from within. Lots of overtime when needed.
good,C'est une entreprise agréable avec des conditions de travail satisfaisantes
good,"Stryker was never a dull place to work and I learned so much from  the team. You had to love what you do to be successful and always give 110% . They always hired within so everyone had the opportunity to advance their career. I learned every position from warehouse, customer service, operations management in an Orthopaedic industry. Culture of the company was changing, some for the good and some not so good. Work place became strained with not hiring enough employees inside to support the growing sales force which became hard on everyone. The hardest part was leaving and the most enjoyable part was having the best mentors to learn from and made me proud to be part of the team. The relationships that I will always treasure and the learning experience that I was able to take with me and share with others.  That I am thankful for!"
good,"A empresa sempre foi muito boa, mas com a troca do board do Brasil o ambiente de trabalho se tornou mesquinho e um ambiente de fofocas."
good,Société dynamique et innovatrice donnant les moyens à ses salariés pour une qualité de vie professionnelle
good,"the pay is good.however the shifts/hours are long,the job requirements are for you to be on ypur feet for long periods of time.you do get used to it,the work isn't hard,however it can leave you tired at the nights end."
good,Overall Stryker is a great company to work for. Great benefits and career advancement opportunities. As an integration specialist you are required to travel 90% of the time which deny's you a work life balance which can put a strain on your family.
good,Many changes within the company.  Seems like big decisions are not well thought out before implementing. They don't treat the sales reps well with regards to territories.
good,"great CEO that knew where to he wanted to take the business and how to get there.  Great work environment for folks, at times the climate could turn but all in all a good place to work"
good,I did not feel comfortable enough to do work on my own. The type of work required a working knowledge of all implants and instruments. One mistake or one thing missed could be a serious issue for a surgeon. More development and training needed.
good,"no room for growth, and all the management is clueless on whats going on, you never get support and engineers take credit for everything done and look  down on all the people working 7 days a week. so all and all this place is ran very poorly."
good,Stryker is very passionate about being inclusive and diverse which makes it a great place to consider employment. If there isn't a consistent influx of change it wouldn't be Stryker so adaptability is required. Know your goals and where your compass is pointed and the management is willing to mentor and help you obtain your goals.
good,"great people to with enjoying my work everyday. being productive everyday and staying busy, keeping everyday safe and orders in tact and complete everyday. making sure the work is complete correctly"
good,"Excellent benefits and culture but you pay dearly for it working 15 hour days 6 to 7 days a week.  There is literally no time for family, health or well being if you become a Stryker employee."
good,"I greatly enjoyed working for Stryker. I had very pleasant co-workers with daily interactions as we often bounced suggestions back and forth to improve work methods and communication styles with the customer. I unfortunately was unable to get any training due to the Stryker Trainer changing jobs, so I quickly taught myself along with assistance from my co-workers how to assimilate into the customer service coordinator position. I made hundreds of phone calls a day to hospitals and service reps out in the field and generated multiple lists to coordinate our team as well as the sales force. Though the job was the same every day, the nuances were different each time I had to talk to a customer. We developed a system to improve loaner return due to the staggering numbers of delinquent loaners. Our system had drastically improved return rate. The hardest part of the job was having to leave it. After we improved the return rate, the job was completed and I had to leave my co-workers behind, but I at least gained great new experiences."
good,"a very well though company i enjoyed the time that i had at stryker uk i would like to work there again i enjoyed the rma datebase, warehouse & kit dept"
good,"Stryker is a great place to work with a hive mind mentality. Everyone is working towards their prospective cells. Competition within the management fuels the performance of the manufacturing process. However, you will be working as a temp for a very long time with no clear view of when you might be hired full time. Tons of overtime offered, though the hours might be a little wonky from day to day. 12 hr days are not out of the question and depending on demand you will be asked to come in on a Saturday."
good,"He aprendido a auto-formarme en casi todos los ambitos del departamento financiero, he aprendido muchísimo."
good,"Typical work day started at 5 am.  I have learned how to become a lead.  With this responsiblity I got to preform scheduling, training and compliance with all procedures.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the availability to work as much overtime as I wanted."
good,Fast past environment.  Surrounded by smart and ambitious people that push each other to succeed.  Great quality of life and the campus had everything you need in a productive workplace.
good,"Great place to work but very demanding, competitive environment.  The managers I had were either very disengaged or very reactive, not proactive.  Again, very demanding and lack of visibility."
good,"I was a temporary employee, the work was manageable and the building was climate controlled which was nice. The actual hired in employees I felt like were treated better than the temps, which personally I feel like is unprofessional. We were all doing the same jobs we should have all been treated with the same level of respect. Hired in or temp shouldn’t matter were all human."
good,"Third shift management is very poor"
good,"Huge company, feel like a small fish when your company gets acquired. Good benefits. culture and atmosphere for the most part. Fortune 500 company for a reason."
good,"Making Collection stops at local hospitals throughout the state, meeting with Nurses and Staff to increase collection sites, Driving in the comfort of your own vehicle."
good,"Stryker is an a company you have opportunity to work and enjoy the good environment job. "
good,"Outstanding culture and purpose and customer intense focus. You will work with very talented people, in a fast-paced environment."
good,"Demanding work environment, with great benefits, fair salary, and amazing people. Interview process can be lengthy. Solid career potential and mobility."
good,Working with the right boss is great! I think that this is ridiculous you HAVE to leave a review. So I'm just typing this because I have to. Stryker is great when you get hired in.
good,"The days there are fairly normal"
good,"See what department you you wish to work."
good,"Normal work hours were fair no complaints about 10 hours a day."
good,"I wokred with Co-Align for final stage to build prototype for spiral. then Stryker took over the Co-Align, I worked for only a few months to transfer from Co-Align to Stryker"
good,"Great place to work, and lots of opportunities, great benefits, great people to work with. Positive and collaborative working environment. Training opportunities always offered."
good,"Great job for an up and coming sales rep with desires to grow.  Bachelors requirement is a little irrelevant in my opinion, there are many successful reps that don't have the degree. Products offered are top notch and have a good reputation. Work home balance can be achieved if you work hard and strategize."
good,"A typical day at Stryker is fast paced and long. The employees have good work ethic. The managers don't micromanage but expect their direct reports to be responsible for completing tasks and meeting deadlines."
good,"overall good learning, compiling of monthly sales reporting, data generation, MIS"
good,"travail en journée"
good,"Stryker was a fun place to work, it is very fast pace. I learned a lot about sales, training and the medical industry. Stryker is very team oriented. The hardest part about working at Stryker were the hours. The most enjoyable was the enviroment and people."
good,Loved the job but didn't like the mid shift hours.  Very friendly atmosphere.
good,"A very slow paced environment, great work/life balance. Not too good compensation."
good,Highly competitive job must be able to commit self and time in order to have success. Also must be willing to attend a lot of training and spend a lot of social time in order to network.
good,Learned a lot on the medical side and getting into the sales field in this division has helped me with an understanding of how hospitals operate as well as the roles and positions we need to network and connect in each facility.
good,"Cutthroat culture. Technical leads were world class.  Junior resource managers were ineffective in their roles."
good,"I really enjoyed working for the operations team at Stryker. However, there is no job security being a temporary employee and I remained one for 9 months. I was very dedicated, honest, and hard-working employee with a strong drive to succeed."
good,It was a good job but bad hours and always had to work weekends. Working second shift was not good for me. Always had to work overtime just to have a decent check.
good,"Stryker is the marine core of Med device sales.  It is a aggressive forward thinking company that is bases on competitive culture within.  The good:  If in the right role $$$ is great.  (Some reps are know to make more than the surgeons the work for).  The bad: Zero work/life balance, shark tank territories based on the good ol' boys model (only the strong survive).  Lofty unrealistic quota increases."
good,"Workplace culture is overall good but dependent on manager and leaders. People are great to work with. Lots of opportunities to grow, develop and advance within different areas of the business. Management is overall good but has changed recently (for the better). Not your typical 9-5 job. You will work more than 40 hours per week but it will be rewarding."
good,"MPS role is a great role in an emerging market. However, the pay structure relative to the corporate structure leaves a lot to be desired. Training is rigorous but will prepare you for the role. Work/Life balance is difficult. Work days usually start between 5am and 7am, long before kids, family, etc. is up. However, days and weeks are generally flexible depending on your surgeon's schedule."
good,"Es muy bonito, gente trabajadora, te ofrecen el mejor ambiente para laboral. Pude adquirir conocimientos y destrazas para poner en acción en mi futuro."
good,"this was a good place to work at. nice, friendly people. always meet new people and make new friends. it was a temp position so there were no benefits which was horrible. management was ok but could have been much better."
good,"Good company "
good,"Stryker was a good place to work, they deal with hip replacements, knee replacements, the only part that was very unpleasant about this job, is that you have to start through an agency who doesn't provide raises or benefits."
good,"same as above. I loved my job, but my manger was unbearable.  the work experience was great.  I either spent my days in the OR working with surgeons who I loved working with.  Aside from that, Id spend days at my Dr's ofc reviewing films for cases coming up.  I would also spend long days assembling trays for upcoing surgical cases."
good,"Great Place to work...... Very motivating environment, great products, team oriented culture, reasonable objectives, iconic leadership and quite customer focused."
good,Stryker is a great company even with it's pressure and stressful environment. It has a very good salary and benefit's package. The work is fast paced and with lots of monitoring on employees.
good,"Have some common sense. Have knowledge of inventory, shipping/Receiving and customer service. Think ahead and be very detailed. Learn to cope with many personalities."
good,Great people need more opportunities to advance further.  Need more full time employees and less temps.  Temps are treated as less.  Management mismanages time and money.
good,"A typical day begin with my pre call planning. Making a list of doctors that I will see that day, and what product would best suit them in their practice that I carry. I learned a lot about surgeons and performing surgery. I know almost as much as the vertebrae then actual spine doctors. It was more of a secluded position that didn't involve interaction with other employees unless one of us had two surgeries to be present on that day and one of us had to cover. That was a good problem to have at the time.The hardest part of the job was convincing a surgeon that my product was much more effective then the one they have been using for 30 years. In this occupation it had little to no weight having a better product. The surgeon is buying you not the product. Obviously a product that was invented 30 years ago has had upgrades and new products have hit the market. But they trust that rep they have been dealing with and it takes time and patience to get them to trust you and in fact buy you not the product. The same went for Eli Lilly when I sold pharmaceuticals for 6 years. The physicians were buying me not the product. I was lucky because I always believe in what I am selling and know I am carrying the best products that literally change lifes."
good,"good,cool work place , no work pressure , horrible management"
good,"Given the culture at Stryker that you know about, it takes a very, very specific individual to succeed. You are given a ton of freedom but you MUST perform, no questions asked.Management was there when you needed them to help you close business, otherwise they were really not involved. Expect to be on your own from day one; they like to test your will and they will push your limits."
good,Great company. Very good management. Environment is fast paced and competitive. Intra group rivalry exists. Enjoyable part of the job was constant being constantly challenged.
good,I never worked just 40 hours. I always worked a 10 to 14 hours day 6 to 7 days per week. there is no family life when you work for Stryker. they don't give you enough time off to be with your family. they want you there to work when ever they want you to. they are always going on mandatory overtime especially around every holiday.its a great place to work if you need money and have no personal life what so ever.
good,"The job has amazing benefits, great wellness programs, very accommodating for business travel. Great training and development. The only problem is you have to invest all of your time into this job. You are never off. Answering emails at midnight and on vacation. There is Zero tolerance for Error. This is a Type A company with primarily all ""Achievers"" at the forefront. I could not keep up."
good,Stryker gave me the opportunity to work with awesome people and help me advance.   They believe in promoting within and helping you meet your goals.  I was able to help other departments with making their jobs easier by providing excellent customer service.
good,"During my 4 years with Stryker I had 3 sales managers.  The first 2 were high quality, hard working, and positive individuals who valued their team and helped us succeed in a very competitive environment.  One of the best experiences was working with a true full commission sales incentive plan with no ceiling.  The job was physical due to the constant packing and unpacking of video components along with a 300 lb video tower/cart.  Winning deals was never more enjoyable than it was with Stryker!"
good,Fantastic fast paced work environment and clear vision of successful teams and growth in the industry. Lots of turnover and key people departing to go to ConMed.
good,"Being in the warehouse, cross-functional teams work together for a common goal. Everyone helps each other within the department and outside as well if needed. Workload is high the majority of the time, so are the responsibilities but everybody walks around with a smile. Overall, a positive experience."
good,Stryker was a very competitive environment which made it very exciting.  We had some of the most state of the art high tech products in our sales bag.
good,The typical work consist of Managing accounts for sales representatives and hospitals. Researching issues and resolving them.
good,"Stryker was a great first job in the medical device business. Typical day consisted of case coverage at two facilities, a great deal of inventory management and tray shuffling around the city. Constant communication with my senior rep, even on weekend.  Thorough training program, and a lot of existing business. I was a junior rep who had the ability to work with a busy senior representative.  I spent a lot of time driving trays all over New York, and not enough time to be able to begin cultivating a territory for myself in the future.  There wasn't room for growth the way it was promised to me when I was hired. I was able to see cases right away since there was current business, and there was no hassle with product approvals. Great job for an intro position, instilled a great work ethic in me from the get go."
good,Management is great. Have gained many skills. Hardest part of the job is to juggle through multiple task yet I enjoy it because I also learn how to prioritize my task based on time constraints.
good,"While working at Stryker I made some great life-long friends. I was a trainer there. A typical day at Stryker consisted of building on an assembly line. Being on your feet for 10 hours a day can be a little hard to get used to, but the fast paced environment makes things a little easier because time moves faster with the busier that you are."
good,A typical day consisted of planning out the day and week ahead to ensure proper support. Heavy phones and emails were common practice resulting in skills helpful to stay organized and on task.
good,Being that it is the medical field things could get very busy very fast...
good,Azienda con una cura al dipendente fuori dal normale ma allo stesso tempo ad ogni dipendente è richiesto uno sforzo lavorativo non indifferente.
good,Working at a fast past to meet quotas.People are will to help you learn how to make hospital beds correctly when you first start there. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with rate when you first start working there. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work environment.
good,"Stryker is an excellent place to work, but not sustainable for long term. Fast paced, exciting environment, but employees may find it difficult to maintain work-life balance. High expectations."
good,"Stryker was an overall great company to work for. Learning new things, and seekind great experience in a desired position, with a progressive organization."
good,"stryker is a good work place, it was not meant for me, management for a temp is not ok there. they dont know how to treat their temps there at all no motivation to good there is given"
good,"This is a great company to work for. Many times though it is hard to have your voice heard. With a company this size, there are many departments and functions that can create confusion."
good,Overtime was always available almost in every department. Opportunities to be cross trained in different  positions and/or departments but no advancements. Management isn't very great
good,"Nice people, long hours working in the warehouse. Good benefits."
good,Stryker provided opportunities to use and improve skills in the workplace. The benefits were excellent and the employment was study. The company was continually growing and expanding to allow for personal growth.
good,"Review refers to 2002-2005 time-frame -"
good,Loved the position that I held with Stryker.   The hardest part of the job was the long hours and high turn over rate.   I learned alot about the medical device industry.
good,"Excellent company to work for - I have no complaints. If I were in charge, I would make sure there were more operations specialists to cover accounts when technicians need time off."
good,"My work as a CAD technician was enjoyable and balanced.  The office space is well lit and peaceful.  My boss was unqualified.  Our group wasted a lot of time on assignments that we were overqualified for, which is was enjoyable."
good,"Prettig bedrijf wat helaas op korte termijn heeft besloten om te verhuizen naar Amsterdam. Had net een vast dienstverband ondertekend en werd enigszins voor het blok gezet. Heb de keus gemaakt om niet mee te verhuizen maar een andere baan te zoeken."
good,Working in the field of orthopedic trauma requires a team of committed and dedicated members who are available at a moments notice during the time of need for patients and their caregivers.
good,Under new management who are looking to take more market share with the recent products that have been launched as well as those recently acquired from an acquisition.
good,"High value on competence over politics.  Technically challenging assignments, manager very helpful and supportive.  Minimum interference from toxic employees.  Enjoy working here."
good,"Loved working at Stryker, the large company did not lend itself to working on a variety of projects.  I did enjoy working cross functionally."
good,"loved the job and saving the environment, hard to sell same equipment after 5 years with no additional R and D and no new product lines."
good,"I work 24/7 no off and on standby I want to work in bloem because my family is there im currently a Security site manager at Stryker security projects , will appreciate for any other job and willing to start immediately please help.. God Bless.."
good,"It was good experience. I met a lot of very nice people. I would definable work there again. Very good company. Filled with opportunity, growth and chances."

good,Outstanding money with little benefits. 100 % commission. Top reps earn very good living but management needs work as they're playing the politics just as good as anyone else.
good,Good place to work. Sometimes working as an Manufacturing Engineer can be very challenging trying to balance day-to-day tasks with project tasks.
good,Otrhovita was bought by Stryker and the change over was a bit challenging.  many people were transferred of layed off.  Stryker brought in a culture of accountability and oppertunity
good,Busy with multi tasking chores all day there is never an excuse not to get things done as a patients wellbeing is at stake.co-workers strive to do an outstanding job and often go beyond their required duties. Most enjoyable part is seeing the quality livse improved.

good,Good place to work for those with an engineering background interested in developing medical device products or orthopaedic research. Good work/life balance
good,"Working for Styker is great company to have under your belt. As a woman working though in the location I was at, was not ideal. Everyone was so great minus my supervisor, the main reason I needed to move. Although she was a woman as well she was very sexist towards the other woman in the office. Thankfully I'm no longer than, more importantly, neither is she. Hopefully the office is working better and growing now."

good,"Compliance review, intake for failed products to begin investigation process"
good,"There was never a ""typical day at work"" at Stryker Orthopaedics and that is one of the reasons that I found working there so fulfilling. No two surgeries are alike, as every patient is different, so while a routine day may have consisted of scheduling and preparing equipment for surgeries, and receiving equipment back at the warehouse after surgeries, this position required a great deal of flexibility and reacting to changes on a daily, if not hourly basis. My co-workers in the warehouse and our team of drivers were a close knit team, and after several years together we, many times, would think alike when dealing with changes. This position required a great deal of overtime and participation in an on-call rotation to respond to trauma surgeries and other unforeseen surgeries. Although stressful, the aspect of my job I enjoyed the most was the satisfaction of making sure that every surgery was covered, despite the, sometimes, extreme measures and hours required to do so. The hardest part of the job was usually being on call, especially those time when I would be driving home at 2:30 in the morning after responding to one call, just to have the on-call phone ring again and have to drive back to the office. But that was part of the job when I agreed to work there, so I would turn around and head back to office again. While in this position with Stryker, I learned a great deal about orthopedics and the human body. I also continually learned about Stryker products, not only the ones Stryker carried when I started there in 2004 and the new product lines that were introduced during"

good,A very diverse medical device company with products that range from hospital beds to orthopaedic implants
good,"There is a plethora of opportunities within Stryker. I started my career as a technician in the Operating Room making sure the equipment worked to specifications. After proving my capabilities, I was presented opportunities to advance my career.

good,I was working as contract person. I enjoyed working with all department excellent work force. good company to work for. I wish could stay longer due to
good,"I am a field employee, so I usually never have to go to the office and would not say that this is a typical line of work. Stryker is a great place to work, but the reason I am leaving is because advancement is slow and very competitive. Also travel is at about 90% which gets kind of dull after a few years. Communication between the in-house office dwellers and the field employee is actually surprisingly disappointing. All in all the benefits are great and the salary is fair."

good,"environnement de travail propre et sérieux."
good,"In the beginning, I loved working at Stryker. all the overtime I wanted was available. While I was in a trainee position things were perfect. Then as time went on, I was expected to know and do more on same pay chart. Next, I was common to step up my game, or not get a pay increase. The pressure is on now. also, it's my responsibility to do a weekend on call every quarter. For two days phone in hand 24 hours. All day long you are the head person in charge from top to bottom in and out. it was too much stressful work for one person. It makes you sick mentally. It was too much I could no longer keep up, I found myself eating sleeping and living for Stryker. Too many demands and threats to getting rid of me if I did not get fast, do better or make fewer mistakes.   I had to get out. the money and pay were not worth the stress. I loved Stryker, but management wanted a workhorse because it was all about the numbers. If you work fast, work longer, work without mistakes we can keep you. if not we do not want you."
good,"Muy buen clima organizacional, muchos cursos, bien planeados sus procesos."

good,"Excellent place to work but only truly benefits individuals who come in from a advanced position, this is not a place where you can work from the bottom up in a short time. advancement is based of percentages, which is great as you are guaranteed a advancement in pay but the percentage is not significant enough to make a true difference"

Management was continuously changing, culture changed with each. Work hours became a little stressful after so many years, never really  had a good work/life balance."
good,Stryker is a great place to work as a corporation however each division has its own mini culture that differs from corporate guidance at times. I enjoyed my first few years at Stryker however as the company began to grow I noticed that work life balance got much worse and pay didn't increase.

good,"When I got to work at Stryker. It is very fast paced because of the demands of medical devices we receive in from medical companies. I have gained knowledge of all medical devices and what they mean to medical patient's. Management plays favoritism to certain races. Co worker's were a lot of fun, we made if fun by playing singing games while working to make day go fast."

Also, Kalamazoo and the general area is the worst place about it. Wish the company relocated to somewhere where people want to be."
good,"All the staff are great friends and have a lot of fun working together"
good,"Mako hired me prior to the Stryker acquisition for Continuous Improvement. The business and the product design required leading, organizing and planning the execution of the R&D programs for the Partial knee and total Hip segments and the overall Mako installed base for Robot assisted orthopedic surgery. We have since added the total Knee application, marrying Stryker’s #1 total knee implant with robotics and accelerating business growth globally."
good,"Overall solid leadership and direction.  If I were graduating from  college today, I would join this company again.  However, at the moment, it is a hard time to be a middle level manager at the company. Lack of transparency amidst a lot of change and lots of people are being lost in the shuffle of change."

I am disappointed that there is a no rehire policy otherwise I would go back to work there in a heartbeat and make it my goal to stay within the company and make it my career to be part of the enjoyable experience of making a difference in a person's life that need help in hospitals, clinics, etc. The average working hours were 40-50hrs(sometimes more). There were mandatory plus optional overtime available depending on production requirements. Since I am making this review 7yrs later there may have been some changes within the company, but sadly the no rehire policy has not changed(I tried to go back) so I will be looking for a different company to work with medical device technology. Thank you Stryker for the opportunity. I will always be proud to say that I've worked here, but I am sadly disappointed that I can not work with the company again."
good,"Stryker, has changed our lives.  It is 100% commission so it is stressful but when you hit your stride you can make a lot of money.  Unfortunately you can also sell yourself out of your territory.  Once that happens you max out your draw and owe your company money and then it is time to go."

good,"Typically most of the people here at Stryker are very friendly and eager to work with you.  However you do get a few people that has been with the company for many years and do not wish to change.  This is probably the hardest part of my job.

good,"A good and a calm atmosphere to work."
good,"As said above, an incredible place to work.  Amazing people to work with.  The hardest part of working in an engineering and R&D role at Stryker is keeping up with your peers and the market.  It is incredibly fast-paced and very exciting.  The most rewarding aspect of working at Stryker is knowing you are helping to make healthcare better and even save lives.

good,Don't get me wrong this is a great culture for someone starting their career but most don't stay more than 3-5 years as pay is at the low range of the scale.  This is offset by a young and active workforce but there comes a time when supporting a family is more important.

Once hired in there are many opportunities for advancement with in the organization.

They pay approx 15% higher than other companies, give you all of the tools you need to get the job done. But if a due date is missed, for any reason, including death in family(this actually happened to a manager once, because he didn't train his staff to cover for him), have a box ready for packing."
