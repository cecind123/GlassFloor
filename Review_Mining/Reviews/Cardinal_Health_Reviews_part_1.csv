rating,review
bad,"I’m glad I didn’t take the job. The turnover rate there is mind blowing. They are constantly having openings for the same maintenance positions. Something is very wrong with that picture. "
bad,Do not I repeat do not waste your time here. Not even going to bother with details. If you want a job that makes you suicidal this is a great place for you!
bad,stressful place to work. Management does not care for their employee. Bully managers. Work the employees to death. I will not recommend this company to any
bad,"Powers been abuse always. As a result, the employee are victims of it. Manager doesn’t have an idea of present himself to a workers. Extremely rude. Doesn’t have good moral. Cincinnati Ohio"
bad,Upper Management does not care about losing good talent. Management talks to direct reports inappropriately. There was no life balance working there. Only communication was when things were bad never when a good job was done.
bad,Management is horrible and most of your co-workers are just watching everyone so they can move up by trying to tell on someone who may be trying their hardest. Favoritism is always shown to certain people and the ones that work hard get shown no appreciation at all
bad,"I assumed since it is a huge Company, they would value their employees and treat them with respect. I was wrong on all levels. Racist, rude, uncaring."
bad,"Backstabbing management, no support, micromanaged beyond imagination. Pay is horrific, cannot provide for family.  Health benefits was the only positive part of the company."
bad,These people are crazy they let me go because a co-worker was helping me put on towels and she put to many but I was responsible for the mistake. So I was fired and she was not and I couldn't even get my  unemployment.
bad,There is no advancement and they didnt take care of problems With personal. And they never let you know how you was doing the manger did have trust in his people.
bad,What I mean by that is they DON'T treat their worker's right but they are afraid to speak on it. They work you and they don't want to pay you for all the work you do there is no advancement there you have nothing to look forward to just a job..
bad,Worst place to work in IT in Columbus  worse than Huntington and Alliance Data  management is incompetent and purely reactive  reorganization is a way of life and layoffs are numerous
bad,"Director of Operations has his principles printed and hanging outside his door, but they aren’t worth the paper their printed on. He is bias, slanderous and dictates who gets everything based on his liking of the person, this includes raises, who is mandated to work overtime, who is allowed to leave early, who gets written up for things others do not. Not only a dictator but also a liar! Plenty of other jobs out there. Do not work for Cardinal Health Solon"
bad,they gave preference to younger emplyees and latinos the director is the most horrible liar there is. self absorbed.  they micromanage. and company even did a  survey asking sexual preference. illegal question
bad,"Management knows nothing about how to manage.  Only favorites get promoted and you are treated like a kid"
bad,"If you must, plan to work here temporarily until you find something better. Poor management, short staffed, and you can look forward to a 30 cent raise every year."
bad,The job is a simple pick and pack operation.  The problem lies with the management.  There is not planning and the supervisors are constantly overridden by the manager.  It could be a good place to work with a few changes.
bad,"Cardinal is very bad company and they never care about talent people. "
bad,Hours were long and late. Supervisors were aggressive and unappreciative. Did NOT care about your well-being at all. DON'T WORK HERE! YOU WILL COMTOMPLATE SUICIDE.
bad,Not a good place to work at or work for but they have decent pay though they treat their employees like trash and the management/director really is terrible. The Management/Director are bias & toxic. Director don't like you speaking with management or other coworkers. Poor with commication & training. Asking for help would only get you fired. Unless you can work by yourself and figure things out.
bad,This is one of the most unprofessional places I have worked at. Managers could not communicate with each other. So therefore  was an  lack of effective communication  with the warehouse workers. Co-workers were very rude and didn't ever get their job done on time. Only good thing about the company was the amount of PTO they offered. You will be using all your time up because the unprofessional and stressful environment.
bad,Not a good place to work at or work for but they have good benefits though they treat their employees like trash and the management really is terrible.
bad,"Terrible place to work with terrible management. Favoritism is the order of the day. There's no respect for employees by the supervisors. There's no opportunity for growth."
bad,"Management are perverts.  Long hours always at work never see your family, hard back breaking labor, No Structure no one cares about your  your health"
bad,"Long hours, not good pay. Overtime is mandatory everyday. Your humiliated if you don’t make rate on a public board for all of your coworkers to see. Public ally shamed"
bad,They do not care about their employees especially their pregnant ones. That job is terrible and management is trash. They only care about themselves. I hated they trash place. I will never ever recommend anyone to work there ever.
bad,I worked for Cardinal for 3yrs+. During my three years at Cardinal it was stressful as far as the work. The pay wasn’t all that fair but it was a great Company to work for as far as benefits and the vacation time. I was recently one in 150 to get laid off due to company closing down the 2nd shift.
bad,"It was the worst job I've ever had in my life. It caused me stress related high blood pressure, once I was diagnosed Cardinal Health Terminated me. Very evil spirited company."
bad,I started July 29th 2019. During training I had a miscarriage! They treated me like  poorly They Allowed me to come back the next day. Then my team created a group Skype to talk about our calls! I was fired!
bad,They hire anybody due to their high turnover rate. It’s a miserable atmosphere. Literally no one wants to be there. It’s like s prison...they even try to regulate bathroom time.
bad,Consider working smarter and it will cut down on the stressful environment. People (co workers are are great). Non management seem to suffer from cut backs.
bad,The management team are related and love to spread lies on others. No Human Resources at the sure. Training is a joke. They allow “working to do the clock” for training with no pay. Then claim the employee “volunteered”.
bad,Lots of favoritisms super long hours of work. They work us like if we are machines non stop treat us like prisoners we are timed for everything break and they watch us on the cameras.. every time we go to lunch management has to be waiting for us in line like if we are in jail. Honestly I don’t recommend this job after new management took over everything has gone down. We are not appreciative for all the hard work we do for the company
bad,Supervisor favorite the employee. Manager dont know anything. Both of them should be fired. They never their when you need them cause all they do is sit the the office.
bad,"NOTHING AT ALL to say good about this company except for the patients and a few good staff."
bad,Management so poor they pick on their good workers let the bad workers just ride the clock fire good employees over hearsay the site manager was clueless to what was going on at the job cardinal health in tarrant is the worst place to work for
bad,"I was a supervisor for overnight shifts at one of the Medical Supplies Distribution Centers. The Warehouse Manager, HR Business Partner, and Regional Manager were all discriminatory and treated employees terribly. They would lie to employees and ignore the dozens of oral and formal written complaints of harassment, lack of adequate breaks, and discrimination. I filed my own written complaints and submitted numerous written statements from over a half-dozen associates that were ignored and even when brought up directly to the regional manager in group meetings they were quickly and forcefully dismissed. "
bad,Lazy supervisor that has a girl that makes stuff up about you to get special treatment. Way to much pto leaves you short handed daily. They push the best workers harded while paying no attn to the lazy workers. It really is an easy job. Lazy night supervisor!!!
bad,"Horrible and poor management quality due to lack of education. They believe and threat employees as slaves. Employee appreciation = a bagel or Ice cream. In fact, this place is not recommended even for my worse enemy."
bad,"They don't pay enough to risk your health for radiation exposure. Management is antisocial and cut throat. Revolving door do I'm told, apparently traffic or weather is not acceptable and deliveries are timed poorly, they want people to risk their lives because they don't care about anything except the delivery time. 10 mins late because of a torrential downpour is not acceptable. Find another company to work for."
bad,"The money was good as long as you have a clear  understanding they will require 13+ hours easy on a good day. 15+ regularly at 100% effort. Plain and simple, Boy your gonna spend your time building Pyramids for Pharoh and you better smile."
bad,"Supervisors and leads are the best, great listeners they really care about there employees"
bad,At Cardinal Health you will find that there is way too much nepotism and favoritism going on and discipline is nonexistent as well. Certain management level employees allow serious infractions to go unpunished or stopped as long as the guilty party is a friend with certain person or group while others that are not in good graces will find that they are subject to a unfair discipline. So a pay raise will also depend on whether you are in favor with management on a personnel level or not and not on your job performance.
bad,Employee are treated very poorly.we go in work for 5 hours straight with no breaks at all. After the 5 hours we get an hour lunch then work any where from 5 to 9 hours with no breaks at all. I was told even if i wanted to use the restroom i gad to get permission and that was told to me by HR.
bad,"I had over 17 managers in 10 years. They were extremely inconsistent in the ability to provide proper healthcare."
bad,"Don't care to vommit co workers were nice but managers have unreasonable expectations"
bad,Most days when you are done working in your department you have to help the next department. Even if you ready to go home. To they talk to you like you are nothing and the play who can sleep with whoever
bad,Cardinal health upper management plays favorites. They do not go by their policies. Their HR sucks! One of the HR trainers is a pervert. If you werent of their ethnicity they wouldn't believe anything you said. If someone told on you about something stupid that everyone else was doing as well there was no investigation. A bunch of grown adults acting like immature kids. Do not work here it's like your in middle school. You get harassed if your not a favorite.
bad,"Lots of favoritism, backstabbing, and discrimination. No one gets treated the same. Major lack of communication and support. Management often not around.  Lots of upset clients and customers. Only way to even move up is to know people or have friends. Training is very misleading."
bad,Pam West manages based on rumors and gossip. The pharmacy is run poorly and lots of finger pointing goes on. Most of the pharmacist there are poor co-workers.
bad,"Management is the worst I have ever encountered. They lie routinely and accept it as 'part of the culture', use employees for political purposes, threaten employees in private, and then act innocent and grateful for your work in the presence of superiors. The two-faced nature of management, constant bad-mouthing of executives by other executives, lack of accountability (aka blaming others for their poor results) is toxic and horrifically unprofessional. No one should have to work in a 'game of thrones' type of environment, but be prepared for endless gossip, threats, and backstabbing if you join the Lewisville office."
bad,"Cardinal Health recently changed over to a Case based system.  This has increased the call volume as the emails sit for days without response.  Cardinal Health has too many people doing backorders and emails and not enough people taking calls.  This is a ""call center"" however only few people are available to take calls.  The upper management does not appear to care how people feel.  The consensus with employees is the more experienced people can be replaced with people with less experience but at a lesser pay.  The atmosphere is too stressful and people are not happy.  Happy employees mean more productive people.  This company does not care if the people are happy."
bad,I knew it was going to be bad when i was interviewed by a couple of goobers. and then I wasn't their first choice..I think it was age discrimination..
bad,"I worked there for about 4 months and it was okay at first, But every other week an employee is quitting due to long hours and being understaffed. I wouldn't advise no one to work here if you want a life! And they also kept changing my schedule!"
bad,This was the worst job I ever had. Its a cotton place out in camden south carolina and this job made me realize its better things in life than carrying barrels of cotton
bad,A typical day would be dealing with angry customers about their order status and order shipments. Most customers are unhappy and very rude. The hardest part of the job was getting management to realize that the pay for the job is extremely low and micro managing team members is unnecessary if performing good work ethics.
bad,"Work here if you don't mind sacrificing every weekend. The CEO tells us to do things half fast. Cardinal has their problems both internally and externally. Oh, and don't forget about the 350 pending lawsuits against them for opiod problems!"
bad,long hours while management sits in the offices and dont have a clue whats going on in the wharehouse its soooooo hot in there all the time I learned not to trust people that smile in your face while stabbing you in the back nothing enjoyable about this job
bad,"This company is horrible.  Lack of professional, training.   I started working 10-7 after 1 year of this schedule approached management about a possible schedule change and they're replied ""don't ask about any schedule changes"".  Each time you go to management for assistant they run and hide.  After hours  especially!!  I would not recommend anyone to this company.  They start off all good but after training its down hill.  I lasted as long as i could."
bad,every skilled learned is via trial and error method...not invested in training/development. They Fluff there numbers to the Pfizer Client. This is easily the worst company that I have experienced. Management Team is very unprofessional and lack knowledge regarding benefit investigation process. Lack of confidentiality and management team is somewhat perceived as harassing and job threatening
bad,this company was bought out when I worked there so i have no clue if this place even still exists. But I have to write this to continue looking for jobs on this site.
bad,"have not worked at Cardinal since it was sold or under new management with name change since the early 2000's"
bad,This was a company that I would never ever want to work for again. The people that work there and the environment that they create is negative and not something that is good.
bad,"After shipping a good portion of the jobs overseas, they let a lot of employees go. Upon returning from maternity leave there was no support. They expect you to only pump breast milk during lunch breaks."
bad,"Hated every moment of working there. They tell you that hours are 2nd shift but they are really over nights. 7:00pm until whenever you get done. sometimes three, four, or maybe five in the morning."
bad,"I will never recommend anyone to work at Cardinal Health and the way they treated me and other employees was a disgrace. I hope the company shut down and never open again anywhere in the world. work to much hours and they dont have any respect for anybody,so i hope no one will work there because i know i well never go back"
bad,this job is very stressful. you have to work very long hours. you have no life. no time to spend with your family. they do not pay well at all for the amount of work you are doing. nor do they pay well for the long hours spent on the job. management is not fair in their decision making especially if they are friends with some of the employees.
bad,"Good benefits-best part of the position."
bad,it has been a very long time sense I was there I really didn't have many problems only that the pay was really low if it would have been more that would make that company great
bad,NA. They do not care about there employees. I do not recommend this company to anyone. They want you to lie and they also there is no support system from management.
bad,I worked at the Groveport nlc for over a year and in that time I was involved in two crashes not my fault and witnessed other crashes into people driving no safety violations was ever given to no one I knock over a pallet of product no damage however that is a safety violation so many wreckless drivers in there so guess it's ok to crash into others just don't knock over product
bad,"Always understaffed. Management talks down to the employees. Never an 8 hr day. Mandatory Saturdays told to us the week off and if you already have plans, oh well. They have no understanding of people with families and lives outside of work."
bad,"the facility, management, and co workers are a big joke. and they say equality ya right you bust your tail off doing three peoples jobs at once cuz no one else wants to actually do their job and your the one that gets thrown under the bus"
bad,Horrible place to work! No one listens to your thoughts and director is HORRIBLE!!! I would not recommend to anyone that wants any sort of security or work-life balance. There has to be better out there! They can’t handle new clients and new programs are so mismanaged it’s crazy!!! Amazing they are in business still!
bad,"I worked for CardinaHealth DURHAM, NC, 2017/2018..!! Cardinal Health is a horrible company to work for!!! HOURS ARE LONG!! YOU ARE OVERWORKED! 12-8:30 is ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE, they change hours for when to report to work, ON TOP of you NEVER have any idea what time you will leave!!! LONG HOURS, EVERYDAY! THEY WONT TELL YOU THAT IN YOUR INTERVIEW, THEN POINT YOU OUT WHEN YOU CANT STAY HOURS YOU ARE EXPECTING TO WORK!!! 4 POINTS IS ALL YOU CAN HAVE! THEY COME OFF FROM YEAR OF DATE YOU RECEIVE IT!! You have only 1, 45 min lunch break, THATS IT! Unless supervisor feel like you they want to give you one.  Mangers/leads are HORRIBLE, YOUR SUPERVISOR DONT DO HIS JOB! Let SOME people get away with ANYTHING, which makes your job WORSE, you dont get much training maybe few hours then you left alone & expect to maintain 90%. Too much favoritism within warehouse, they dont want you to talk AT ALL!!! CALL YOU IN WHEN YOU CALL-OUT SICK/VACATION! Want you to do company training on your break!! They dont care AT ALL about anything you may occur in your personal life CARDINAL HEALTH IS ALL FOR ITSELF!! Even when you have worked 12-14 hrs SUPERVISOR still wants you to report to them to look for more work!! Unless you are seriously utterly desperate for a job, DONT WORK FOR CARDINAL!!!"
bad,"Very poor management , unorganized and long hours , worked a year and never got pay raise. Very cut throat company . Management shows favoritism and I would never suggest any one to work for them.n"
bad,"Management at Cardinal Health is HORRIBLE.  They treat you like children in elementary school.  You are NOT allowed to talk or leave your seat.  Management could care less if you want to be there or not and has stated that several times.  Training was HORRIBLE, it was about 3 days and the training had nothing to do with your exact role.  Trainers are rude and just throw you out on the floor to fend for yourself."
bad,"Managers are Hired with no experience. Employees are given no guidance. Training is not provided, but they expect you to know what you are doing . Micro-management is at an all time high."
bad,"St. Louis location was forced to use porta potties due to a water main break during the coldest time of the year. The staff is made up of mostly women, so I find these conditions deplorable. Employees are overworked and underpaid"
bad,"We did not have enough personnel to handle the workload which resulted in long hours for everybody,very stressful and extremely exhausting! Plus, I had a long commute to my residence which resulted in a severe lack of sleep!"
bad,not a good work place. if you work they will not pay you for the work you did. I work at cardinal for 2 yrs... My lead hate me because im black. I did putaway
bad,"no advancement, short breaks spread far apart.  never knew what time you would get off work.  management doesnt listen, care, or help the employees when called upon."
bad,"The only good thing about Cardinal is the PTO. Career advancement was darn near impossible unless you fit a ""TYPE"".   Performance reviews mean nothing.  QA-Management stated that they do not care about employee loyalty, which is a huge discouragement."
bad,I would never tell any one to work for them it has poor management and they don't treat there employee fair. they are not listening to the employee when they complain about problem that are happen there
bad,"Production environment. Stressful, not a warm environment. Not a friendly workplace and there isn't room for growth. Don't have a Work Life Balance environment."
bad,"Pay sucks, people are always talking about each other's, no communication, people seems to always be angry. Benefits are ok though. Overall, I wouldn't recommend nobody to work for this company."
bad,very stressful job.  always had to watch your back and too many people out for each other.  Management didn't care what was going on there and didn't reprimand those that needed it.
bad,The Supervisor allows the team leader to run the whole department and when she has personal issues with employees she uses her authority to abuse them. She makes all the decisions and being a temp you have no rights at all.
bad,"When I applied for this job I asked if this was a call center workplace I was assured it was not.  When I started the job it was most definitely a call center.  There were very strict guidelines and there was no leniency under any circumstances.  When I spent my lunch hour getting a cake, gift and plaque for my supervisor (who was leaving) and at the request of his supervisor, I clocked back in 2 minutes past my lunch hour and was given a written warning.  Fortunately, it was about the same time I received the offer from SSA and I did not have to think twice about leaving."
bad,"unorganized, no standard practices.depressing work environment, pay is well below standard in the field. The pharmacy is not run by pharmacist and there is very poor leadership"
bad,Expected to work 12-14 hours a day.  Management/Supervisors didn't monitor employees and drive productivity which created down time and increased hours worked.  The hardest part of the job was seeing management walk around and talk for hours to employees decreasing productivity instead of pushing for quality/productive work.
bad,They are all very busy management that is and do not supervise staff or patients.. And they could clean the building more. They could let people off of work when they have a Doctors note..
bad,"•	Operate standard stand up order picker, reach truck and pallet jack forklifts to pick and put away cases as needed for outbound and inbound customers"
bad,I was micromanaged the very first day that I started managing.  I was not able to learn the culture or give my opinion on how things needed to be ran.  I was emasculated right away and told that I could leave if I did not like it.
bad,"The management SUCKS! Cannot get anything done and there is SO much favoritism. They switch schedules around so if you have an early shift its not guaranteed and they will change it to a late shift if they don't like you or they will give your shift to a ""friend"" of theirs that they hire. They are so unorganized. Horrible and most unwelcoming place I have ever worked at."
bad,"From the manager, supervisor to the QA nothing positive to say. Chaos, no organization total disarray. Work is easy after you learn it but training is horrible. Falsified documents to make right and contradicted work ethic. Manager and supervisor have disregard for individual work/life balance. Erratic third shift work schedule wears you thin leaving you with poor judgment at work and dysfunctional life at home. Work place environment is very hostile from the high exposure of radiation and the daily vexed QA. The radiation effect on this site is  negative attitudes. There is no confidentiality due to gossip amongst each other. Very unfriendly atmosphere."
bad,Management is incompetent they do not care about their employees at all favoritism upper management  is same way they have no clue on whats going on hr is the same way
bad,"The pay is extremely low"
bad,"Too many negative things to list. FAMILY Favoritism is rampant in this building. The same people work in the Specialty areas, the same people are stuck in picking in L1. The occurrence system is designed to keep people from gaining raises. The desperate ""Paid-for-by The-employees"" luncheons are another downfall. Too much overtime. We work from 5 pm - 6 or 7 am. No time to do anything but sleep and work. Will find another job soon."
bad,"You can't get anywhere in this company unless you kiss managements butt!!  Favoritism is huge and if you aren't liked,  you might as well quit. Don't bother complaining to upper management because they just make excuses and turn the blind eye. Turn around is extremely high because of this.  The pay isn't great and you can forget about bonuses. All they care about is how much the company makes and could care less about it's employees. Run away!!"
bad,The wosrt job i have ever had.The pay is a joke and you get treated like garbage..The place isc ompletly dysfunctional. You are completly ignored by managemnet . They talk down to everyone and treat you like children.They have a very high turn over rate because of the way they treat the employees.Dont waste your time because there are much better jobs out their that pay better.I moved on and it was the best move i ever made.
bad,"I started off as a picker, then went directly to being a stocker, than when management realized how focused and quick I was, I was promoted again as a cage/vault clerk for the class II narcotics. I filled narcotic orders for hospitals, pharmacies, and drug stores. I entered narcotic orders into an ordering system database. I checked in the narcotic inventory when shipped in and stocked the inventory. I did daily inventory counts to ensure inventory was correct. I answered phones and did data entry. This job required you do not leave until you are finished, so I was fully dedicated and stayed until everything was completed."
bad,"The worse place to work. The pay is really low for what you are doing 12.65 is nothing. But they act like they are paying people top of the line pay. The managers are the worse, they have the world dumbest mangers I have ever seen. They switch systems so many times you never know what your schedule going to be. If you have kids find something that dont require 16 hour shift and 12 hours shift on a slow day. The enployees are okay people, but very self center and act more like slave robots. In the 2 months I was there 10 people got fired."
bad,"Subjected to high exposure of radiation. Very disorganized site. "
bad,"The location in Aurora, Illinois is not a desirable place to work for. No advancement unless your supervisor likes you. That is the only way you will move up at the facility. It is in need of LSS of the team of management."
bad,"People generally fine"
bad,Overworked underpaid its not good place.Treat employees terrible just a number nto them.New director is a joke.This place needs a union.
bad,"The clean room was either too hot or too cold according to which line you worked at. If you worked at one of the end stations you quite often had so many items to add to the kit that it was almost near impossible to keep up with the speed of the belt. You were written up for just about any flaw in your work."
bad,"A typical day at work involved being berated by the most senior employees for not knowing how to do things you've never been properly trained to do. I learned that most of the adults who work here are more immature than the college-aged kids and have worse work ethics than the millennial employees."
bad,Some of maneger are illiterate they don't have degres some of workers has higher education than managers and supervisors benefits are ok but not good pay to much work
bad,"Coworkers were selfish and not helpful. The hardest part of the job was to stay awake.  I was not given enough work to keep busy, therefore i quit"
bad,"Working for this place screwed me up physically and mentally . Working with the people was awesome just being with the group of people made my day go by . But the management was horrible lies, threats , bullied, harrass and made fun of especially the leads and supervisors. They put you in closed doors aka the blue room and talked down to you fearing your gonna loose your job if you speak the truth they will get you in some sort of way in any way shape or form  . Just work at your own risk."
bad,Poor mamagement.  Manage thru fear and retaliation.  Evidence of quid pro quo and EEOC violations.
bad,"I was told in my interview that starting pay is $17/hr for Tech I in PET but that it would raise as soon as I got AU certified. I asked how long it takes to get AU certified and was told 6 weeks. Do not believe this. The course takes 6 weeks but it takes several months before you can take the course + six weeks + several months to receive the certification. Then you won't actually get promoted when you get certified. They will make you wait until you are on the site license, which takes another several months to apply for and another several months to wait for approval from the state. Then your supervisor will tell you he will promote you, but will not actually do it. You will get strung along. You will wait for your promotion to get announced but it won't happen. When you question him about it, he will tell you that AU certification is only one factor in promotion and it is discretionary based on the manager's assessment of things like ""leadership ability"". But your manager only sees you for anywhere from 5 min to an hour per day because you are a third shift employee (10pm start - when you get AU certified you will work opening for some amount of time) and he is a first shift employee (7am start and he stays in his office outside the lab a majority of the time)."
bad,"Not enough work ,people get "
bad,"I been working for this company for the past six months ( Jan 2014- July 2014) and basically Cardinal is a company that does not care for their employees. In order to get this job you must accept overtime, however, I do not recommend it for part time associates. Here is why:  My situation was that because I was a part time associate they require you to work overtime for everyday that you work. Unfortunately, if you live in the state of California, the law says that if  you work over a period of 30 hours or more per week, the employer has to pay you full time benefits. I was working average of 32 hours per week and because of that, first they send me home for like month temporarily with no pay, no benefits and then two weeks later was fired. I was fired because they were forcing me to go full time and since I go to school to get better, they simply fire me because of that. Unfortunately, they don't explain it but you have no other choice if you want to work or not. Now you know it. :)"
bad,I honestly can't say anything good about this company and I am so glad I was only there for 1 year.  I felt like a warm body in a seat most days.  Truly horrific.
bad,I worked at this place thinking it was a special place to be at but it changed so quickly they treat you like your just a number they enjoy letting people go and putting there picture on the wall after they let you. a lot of lies and mistrust from management you just dont know who to trust.I would not tell anyone about this company .
bad,"I work in the East Hartford location. The pay is low, health benefits are the pits,  The management does not want to give overtime but will pay top dollar for a courier plus if you refuse overtime forget about any raises."
bad,This place is nightmare and set my career back 5yrs. Did not learn anything from the leadership.  Temps and more temps.
bad,"Inventory Management was horrible.  No team work and no diversity.  Horrible management team in inventory.  Prejudice place to work.  I wouldn't recommend a dog to work there.  If they like you, you will get a promotion.  If they don't, you are stuck forever.  Management has no idea what they are doing since they went live with SAP ECC.."
bad,not real great work environment and not a greatly establishment
bad,"Prepare yourself for the world of fear based management, long hours, low wages, and no opportunities for advancement. "
bad,picked cold cases used cherry picker and reach truck.worked long hours never knew what time we were getting done work.
bad,"My experience at Cardinal Health was very positive, enjoyed working with the team and the Management that I supported."
bad,I felt like I was discriminated against for being white at the Sherwood location.
bad,People are barely making the $12 an hr base. No one happy there. Management lies about everything and if you question it you will find yourself without a job (not a bad thing as you probably can make more on unemployment). Accounts are not evenly distributed. Their favorites get several active buying accounts and others get hardly any. Don't buy the line that they do not look at what accounts they give everyone. They know exactly what they are doing. If you take this job you will regret it. Everyone wants out. Don't think you can take this job to get into pharmaceutical sales. This is not your regular pharmaceutical sales job and you will regret it!
bad,"I would advise everyone not to work at the Tampa location on Florida Mining Blvd. It is a very unfriendly, depressing and gestapo-like enviroment."
bad,Worked with customers to build large scale batches of medical products.
bad,"Very unprofessional management. Management is allowed to threaten, intimidate discipline employees without merit. Bring safety, theft intimidation issue to upper management. Well you get to join the unemployment line. Management is allowed to bring purses jackets and bags into a DEA controlled facility against company policy."
bad,Worst Job Ever.
bad,"Work Culture"
bad,If don’t like your life.....work here. Work life balance is nonexistent 12 hour days and you work every weekend. Management is the worse. Coworkers kept me going
bad,The hours are extremely long. You are required to keep up a certain productivity level throughout the entire shift. Normal shifts usually lasts at least 12 hours.
bad,"Management does not run place, staff does. If you are not liked by certain employees, lies and false accusations are made prior to your 3 month probation is up to get you fired. I was warned my my trainer on the 2nd on the job “to fit in or they will get rid of you”. When I asked management?, was told no the staff will. Female staff made several attempts to “trap” me into into several inappropriate conversations, when those failed they fabricated stories and had me fired. Can’t keep staff because of this They had 7-10 job fair in less than a year."
bad,"No work and life balance ,if hired ready to work atleast 14 hours a day ."
bad,"Cardinal used to be a great place to work. Our director was top notch and we felt appreciated even though our pay wasn't amazing. Once that director was replaced, the whole place went downhill. Our current leadership is horrible, and I mean absolutely horrible. I would have given the Management rating a NEGATIVE 5 stars if possible. No communication and shady activity are status quo. Last year, our current director brought in his own nephew for an O3 position over people who were already in house and qualified. To make things worse, the HR rep for our location is complicit in everything that's happening. Now, they're making the paid time off system an accrual based system. So those of us who have been there for a long time are going to be getting hosed because the company's senior leaders and HR can't figure out that in order to stem new hires and short timers from using up all of the fronted PTO and leaving is put a system in place for new hires. No, instead, they'd rather upset their entire employee base and punish everyone for a situation that they created in the first place."
bad,Not a nice place to work grow or advance manager and staff terrible to work with I hate it there the pay was terrible no benefits need uniforms didn’t want to hire people over 40
bad,"Long terrible hours, management doesn't know how to treat people. You could be a hard worker who does well for months but once you do one thing bad they put you down and treat you terribly for the rest of the time your there. Extreme favoritism and nepotism. No job security. And management will through you under the bus to save they're own skin. Probably one of the worst warehouse experiences I had next to Staples. Only be there if you want some overtime money that's it, don't expect more from this place. My  co-workers on the other hand were the best people I've ever worked with, sadly most of them left for better pastures since they couldn't deal with management by the time I chose to leave."
bad,Worst place to ever work. Management from the GM to floor managers are all racist. They have their favorite workers aka friends that get special privileges. While they pick at and use the weak employees that they don't like. They change rules day to day to accommodate themselves. They will do anything in their power to keep from giving raises and will work you to death. I thought it was just the Grand Prairie location but after helping at other facilities and talking to their employees I learned that it is the company as a whole. HR is just as crooked and dirty as the managers. I could go on and on about the cons of this place but anyone who reads this should get the point. I would not send my worst enemy to Cardinal Health.
bad,"Management treats their employees unfairly, has favorites, MESSY MESSY stressful and just not worth it! Great benefits, a lot of PTO and good 401k matching."
bad,"Don’t apply to the location in Fort Worth they will work you like a dog and looking past your work if you are Africa American sooo you know what that mean. The same people get employee of the month,Unfair with the hours you work one shift working 8 hours and the next shift working 10-12 hours. They hire ppl that don’t understand English but you have to work with them now how we suppose to communicate about work like every time you have to have a translator lol.."
bad,"I was a maintenance Mechanic at the Syracuse, NY Branch. The first year I worked there it was amazing BUT general manager changed, as did lower level management. They are condescending, arrogant and do NOT CARe one IOTA about the employees. They are stuck on 5-S and lean management. AVOID them at A N Y  cost!"
bad,This place is a joke! I have worked here for 5 years and this place has gone down. We don't pay raise but they will pay new people coming more money. I worked Monday thru Friday for years and was told that to be I had to work every other weekend. I was fine until the hired new people and gave them Monday thru Friday. They will over work. They are always short staffed. I have had to work weekend on 1st on the hall by myself. Management is a joke they don't care about and they lie about every. They have their picks and some cna and nurse don't have to do anything but give orders. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO MY WORST ENEMY!!!
bad,"I was a Temp there and they treated us horribly. They basically use the temps until they can fill their position with a “Cardinal Health Associate” that they hired from the outside, but clame they only hire from within. It was so bad that the associates who been there for 10+ years felt bad for us and it eventually opened up their eyes and some of them actually left after they got rid of us. The supervisors and managers are all lazy and don’t care about you at all, all they wanna do is work you like a slave and got a nerve to do that as if they were really paying you something, you’d have to work tons of overtime just to get a decent check. And the temps, let’s just say they worked us the hardest and wasn’t even paying us out of pocket, the staffing agencies was. The only time they paid the temps out of pocket was when we worked overtime, but that was nothing like maybe $16 dollars more added to our checks. They basically admitted to us that they didn’t wanna pay us for Overtime either, they would always try to rush the temps out by 3:30pm so that they wouldn’t have to pay us overtime, but yet when the associates were backed up and they were too lazy to help them, they wanted to beg us to stay over our required 8 hours. That job was overall disappointing and I was only a temp there for 4 months, but that’s all I needed to gather all the negativity in that place and walk away to go find a better job."
bad,"Horrible management. Too many favorites. Gossip is  the trend here. If you love drama this is the place for you. Absolutely no advancement, management and others will hold you down. Training is minimal at best. Trained as fast as possible so they don't have to do the work. A lot of housekeeping duties."
bad,"Fast pace environment. Supervisor monitor productivity on their computer but never actually physically supervise. Your individual productivity is based on the “ system “ but the “system” cannot track your every move, like when you are tracking down supplies or talking to management about issues like harassment and discrimination from other employees. You also bounce around a lot from area to area which also affects your productivity but management denies that it happens. The bottom line is if your not a favorite or personal friend of a member of management your not gonna stay their long. The worse place I have ever worked at. The only upside to this company is the amount of paid time off. You need it because you really hate being there."
bad,"I’ve worked in many warehouses in many different positions, Cardinal Health was by far the worst. Management t treated employees as bad as you could imagine. Over time can be a good thing but not when it is mandatory and in excess. Home life will be difficult to balance since you won’t have much time there. If you absolutely need a job apply but keep looking for something better if you can. You deserve better."
bad,"I worked 5 plus years for Cardinal Health Pharmacy out of Holland, Ohio as supplemental to my retirement so the wages were not enough to live off of by itself. During most of my employment the only complaint that I ever had was that we had to deliver their products no mater the weather and road conditions. The last year was much worse when the new pharmacy manager took over the operation. She had absolutely no regard for most of the employees only the upper echelon employees of the pharmacy and her favorites. On the road safety issues never got any consideration as she always said “I have no problem getting from her home to work “ implying that we shouldn’t have any problem driving over 265 miles in all kinds of weather conditions. Basically she didn’t care about her Associate Drivers"
bad,Overworked and underpaid. Too much drama.  Just want a job that I can show my real potential. I only wanted 60 hours weekly and I ended up with 72-84 hours a week
bad,Poor management technology is a joke there new software for the driver's is very unstable and have many glitches in the software. They wanted me to break DOT rules. Very little overtime
bad,Management comes and goes as they please. About 85% of the staff is rude and physically dangerous. Very high turnover rate....no one is willing to stay because of the extremely long hours and because the older people who have been there a long time are hostile. Trainer is unable to do their job because they are too busy undermining the lead. Big boss thinks that everyone is slow no matter how fast you move to get the job done.
bad,"at the time I worked there the culture was that of a kindergarten where  the employees that had been there longer, got paid much more than new employees and did less than half the work"
bad,"Management is horrible and irresponsible. Managers play favorites and give positions to people with less time working there just because they like them and some that sleep with them. Work culture is bad too, everyone is a sheep."
bad,"This job is like a revolving door, since I've worked there there has been many people to leave. The management staff really need to learn how to appreciate their staff considering the reputation that this company has. The hardest part of my job is the staffs communication with employees, they talk to us with no respect."
bad,"people are nice and friendly, work it hard pick up 25lbs all night and plus end of the night we have to pull pallets for 35ft off the ground. Management suck"
bad,"First if all there is obvious favoritism. Workers who have worked here for many years can often do whatever they want. People are always complaining but supervisors dont seem to really care. Machines are always down, there is no order what so ever."
bad,After almost 12 years was let go for performance issues even though my annual reviews did not reflect this.  Very cliquish.  Can't trust anybody.  All management cares about is the bottom dollar and not the people.  Horrible work/life balance.  The only thing I miss is all the vacation time I had each year since I had been with the company over 10 years.
bad,A typical day at work is around information processing. The future employee would learn about new system and business processes within the distribution center.
bad,Horrible management top to bottom and even worse co workers. Better off begging for change on a street corner as that's more profitable then this place
bad,The management team sucks. They have no knowledge to what they are  doing  and  they never go through with their word they tell the employees. I really cant wait to find a better job
bad,"Run don't walk away from MWDC, incompetent management, from the director down to the general manager to the manager and most of the supervisors, they are clueless, they don't care about their employees only themselves."
bad,The only people who succeed at Cardinal Health are friends with their manager.   Favoritism favoritism favoritism.  I wouldn't hire the idiot management team at Cardinal Health to run the local 7-11.  People who work hard get hung out to dry while the lazy people that stand around talking get praised.
bad,"Go to Glassdoor dot com and search The Harvard Drug Group in Livonia, MI. That's the company you will be working for if you accept a position in Livonia or Phoenix. Cardinal bought them last year."
bad,"If you want to work all hours of the day and night  for lower pay than the competition, this place is for you. The manager , who I think is the embodiment of a gorgon ,looks down on the experienced people who run the place , IMO, she doesn't fit in and knows it , steamrolls over employees, encourages advancement while doing nothing to help you advance . As an added bonus for working all hours and doing your best , you get a bad performance review , and a twelve cent raise !   And if you like supervisors who put you down in front of others , I think you will feel at home."
bad,"The worst place to work. working 12+ hours. Because we went home in snow day after working full time, they terminated seven of us immediately the next day."
bad,"I worked there for 2 years, long night , running like a crazy, crazy, worst place on earth, I just leave..."
bad,Cardinal is a good company to work for if you get the right position.  They do no compensate Pharmacy Technicians on a competitive level and have been known to offer full time positions only to cut the hours once an applicant accepts the position.  I had to apply for unemployment benefits until I found another position with another company.  I will never accept another CPhT position with Cardinal.
bad,"Working at Cardinal Health PET Services was the worst experience. Working 3rd shift I'd awful to begin with, but it gets worse. They say you will only work 8 hour days with a break which is a lie. They are telling the employees that starting May 1st the techs will be working 12-16 hours shifts! Starting in 2015 there will be no PPO insurance. The pharmacies are awful to deal with. The management is absolutely incompetent and will throw you under the bus if it means saving their skin. The supervisor rarely even comes to the site, and will lie to your face. No career advancement. It is way more stress than the money is worth. I quit and the other techs are currently trying to escape this place too. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere!"
bad,"• It's a very large company in which you are merely a cog in the wheel.  "
bad,"Ordering, making IV solutions, TPN's, Del. Ptient meds,"
bad,"It depends on who you are working for as well as the department that determines your experiences with Cardinal.  As well, the color of your skin seems to play a big roll as well.  My co-workers were good people to work with, they are what made the day enjoyable.  Typical day was calling or emailing customers daily to make sure payments came in and posted to their accounts to stay current.  The most difficult part of my job was dealing with management only (supervisor) due to personal conflicts.  That is the reason I'm no longer employed there and HR department isn't design to assistant the staff but, for management.  That is a system that should be reviewed and revised.  Not a place where I would suggest anyone of color to apply for work.  Totally, unbalanced when it comes to enforcing company policy."
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for.  Claim to be all about family, family first, etc....nothing but lip service to get caring people in the door.  If you don't mind kissing a few behinds and lying a bit when necessary you will fit in great.  "
bad,Poor management. Very hostile.  Work long hours at the office plus takes time away from home cause you had to work from home.  When on vacation you still had to work so you weren't able to enjoy vacation
bad,We worked a constant night shift starting as early as 9 pm for years.
bad,"They have poor management and supervisors. If you don't have enough money you wont fit in. Once they have decided that they want you gone, then there really is no fixing it. They have favorites. Definitely not a friendly work environment."
bad,work life balance is not an issue for the company - you work very hard without any rewards
bad,Innovative & has well organized educational programs- benefits or comparable to other companies- upper management has no loyalty to their employees on any level- communications are often overwhelming (too many emails to possibly complete in timely fashion)
bad,Not a good job to have for somebody who is a family person you have no life and they don’t care about you they just care to make service and wants the work to be done.
bad,"Their answer to a better culture was putting in a bar!!!! Yes, got a liquor license and serving beer and alcohol is the answer... Have they not seen what they’re in the news for...?????!!!!"
bad,They have to many friends coming in the door that doesn’t know the job but in months they are promoted before even know you have more experience and time sever with the company.
bad,"Basically they fire anyone they don’t like and come up dumb reason as to why they are fired once your out the HR group has no clue to what you do at the job so they lead you on and just go with the company’s decision weather you have proof or not. How the inside of the company is inside of cardinal heath is, is that the staff are over worked underpaid and forced to work 6 day a week yelled at stalked and by leads that break company policy and lied to I wouldn’t recommend this job to any one it’s no worth it and oh yeah management sucks"
bad,If you are willing to give up your whole life for a check this is the best fit for you . You’re working 65+ hours WEEKLY . Management is very poor . Communication is terrible . They don’t care about the wellness of their employees. 0 opportunities for advancement . They base it off favoritism. 0 opportunities for a raise. Will set you up for failure.
bad,The management is very terrible and hostile. Discrimination on the rise. Unrealistic expectations. The company would be better without the hostile and discriminatory management who encourage favoritism.
bad,"Management is not on the same team and they are on there own island."
bad,What a bad place to work at no manger or supervision to many problem at that place work overtime all the time no life no time for your kids and wife life
bad,"They require a lot out of one person! You'll do multiple tasks and be required to do more and you are NOT paid well for everything that you will do at this place. You'll be treated well until the worker's get to know you, then be prepared to be talked about, backstabbed, and micro managed by your Co-workers. Very toxic work environment and not managed well at all!"
bad,"IT at cardinal used to be taken seriously but now laughed at. Hundreds of seasoned, smart IT professionals have been shown the door based only on salary and amount of PTO. Favored are offshore drones, dishonest/dysfunctional contractors, and oblivious ""yes men"".  Management from SVP down could be replaced with monkeys as all the good ones have left "
bad,Worked there for a year as a Nuclear Medicine Driver. When I started there everything was going good and was learning a lot. Towards the end of my tenure at this job. They had a Driver ( who was not management/ supervisor) doing schedules. Our supervisor refused to handle it because she just didn’t feel like doing it anymore. When I wanted to learn QC my supervisor told me oh I’ll put you on the roster because they had other people wanting to do that job. Then I started asking around to the other drivers and she had asked the same thing. Is there anything you want to learn? Everyone said no and when she asked them about QCing everyone said no but me. The Supervisor also plug her stupid e-car in and told everyone that  her boss said it was ok... I highly doubt that... it must be nice to steal money from the company. Also the driver who is doing the schedules is micro managing all the drivers... HELLO you are a Driver too!! I’ve gotten in trouble for taking routes that I thought were safe and the supervisor wanted speed over safety. We are hauling Nuclear Medicine. Now that 7 people are gone the supervisor is threatening to fire people if she doesn’t get her way. This is coming from a co-worker who is currently still there. There is still so many problems there just stay away
bad,"I used to work at 151 Northpark Central Dr. 77073 in Houston, TX. This is the worst location to work for. The operations managers don’t care at all about the well-being of the employees. When I was hired it was said that we work 2pm-2am and we would get off after 4:30 am!! A normal shift was at least 14 hours!!! As well as making us use our PTO if we wanted 1 day off. What they are doing is illegal"
bad,"•Management is a joke, they hire kids right out of college who come in writing people up and firing people to assert their power. They also have no clue how the processes run, and make horrible scheduling decisions at their subordinates misfortune."
bad,"This job started out as a lis about the schedule than they did a whole 360 and throw a later schedule on us, This place has no work like balance if you have a a significant other working here you won’t have one for long"
bad,"Not a good place to work for minorities. Regular layoffs. Poor management. Do have good tuition reimbursement and the main campus is very nice. Also, liked the onsite gym."
bad,"I have been working there for almost two months and I have seen at least ten people quit because they force you to work 10-15 hours a day. You really only get one day a week off so don't expect to have a social life. You will be forced to work every holiday. The favoritism is a joke. You will never be told you are doing a good job. Management are backstabbers and very two faced. I would not recommend this place to anybody, espically anybody with a family."
bad,"Little chance for advancement and all round toxic work environment. There is favoritism, nepotism and almost anything negative you can think of, for the love of God if you the chance to work somewhere else please do."
bad,The place is not the greatest. They hire people in they quit. The trainers don’t properly train people. They don’t have set hours. You leave when the work is complete and they rush you to get the work done.
bad,"Employees treated poorly, pay is not great, high stress environment, overall poor place to work. Would not recommend to others. They need to overhaul their employee compensation plan as well as seriously review how the assess employees and working conditions"
bad,"I had to quit because the pay was $12.00/hr. No wonder they have a very high turnover in delivery services because $12.00 is not a living wage in Atlanta. After taxes you are making $7.00/hr. That $12.00 is okay in Dublin, OH since the cost of living is low compared to Atlanta. Here in Atlanta it should be at least $16.00/hr for employees to stick to there jobs. Cardinal would be well advised to pay based on the cost of living wages in each City. You cannot pay Dublin, OH wage to people in NYC or Atlanta where cost of living is significantly higher. People desperate for job will start working for $12.00 but make no mistake, they are already looking for jobs paying higher. It is surprising Cardinal fails to understand why they have such a high turnover for delivery drivers, Even Amazon pays $15 to $16 to there drivers plus bonus if they can do 20 plus deliveries in an hour which is easily possible. Working as Amazon driver out of Lawrenceville GA now making $16.00/hr and 4 day schedule."
bad,They make you work longer shifts....I did over night...2pm until 5 and 6 in the morning sometimes..they also have a rate you have to keep up with or write ups will be presented....I also worked 9 to 5:30 which lead to .e working from 9 am to 10pm and 11:30 at night....they didn't care if you have a set schedule...they made you worked extra hrs and threaten to fire you
bad,High paced energetic place of business. A typical day at work is 10 to 12 hours a day with some weekend work. The hardest part of the job is the hours while the easiest part of the job is the people you work with.
bad,The new management sucks and dont know what they are doing. The employees thats been there for years should have say so in changes that affect overtime and there lives.
bad,Cardinal health care is not a job i'd recommend. the work life balance was awful. i worked on average 12-16 hours per day and occasionally worked 18 hours or more. All holidays were required to be worked and sometimes i was required to work on my off days. the yearly pay raises were not good. and the hard workers never got advancement opportunities.
bad,they push you BEYOND your physical capabilities on the daily. Care nothing of your well being. Raises offered is literally equal to loose change you can find on the ground. Management is cut throat.
bad,This job is not for no one don’t recommend poor management poor everything so under staffed it’s not even funny it sucks it was like we was there slaves pretty much.
bad,Do not work here if you want to maintain your sanity. It is not worth the radioactive exposure you will receive every day. Coworkers will talk behind your back and supervisors  openly make fun of previous employees as if this is all a game. The manager has a domineering style of running things. You can literally get fired for almost anything so if you have a family that depends on you I wouldn’t do it. There’s no time for breaks or overtime.
bad,"Cardinal Health has changed hands many times over the years. there are people dropping like flies there & retiring early."
bad,"Not recommended. On-boarding consists of reading 146 vague and general standard procedure documents, with no context or examples.  Management knows nothing of the processes and can offer no direction.  Turn over for engineering is extremely high(ask how many people in the department, then what the turn over has been for the last 3 years), but multi-decade employees are common in other departments (engineering is considered a joke by production and maintenance departments).  Main responsibility is writing FDA & QA acceptable reports.  If you're not expert with FDA IQ/OQ/PQ validation procedures, GDP, and Oracle Agile PLM software, don't even consider.  In addition to all that, many other unpleasantries such as, even in the offices, it's very hot and muggy in summer (desk fans against the rules), and cold in the winter (you'll need a sweater or fleece), there's no hot water in the restrooms sinks, desk chair filthy, with mold growing on them."
bad,"Inventory managers showed favoritism!! Overweight lazy sow of a supervisor,alcoholic manager, perverted employees! Messy jealous females who will do and say anything to make you look bad! Terrible communication within the company! Racist white supervisors who only take kind to the black men who they wish to or have already screwed! Unfair treatment and low pay. You only get a raise if you kiss a** and take daily naps at your desk!!!!"
bad,"First Manager i had for 2 years did not manage as if we were children. Then HR changes were made & college educated employees were under same rules & regulations as unskilled (ie warehouse) workers. Given PTO to be used as holiday/sick, but issues when you have to use for doctors appointments or personal issues. New manager horrible about taking time off & it had to be used by end of year or lose it."
bad,Son gente doble cara y las evaluaciones no las hacen
bad,"This place is a joke. They can’t even get Management to stay with them. They make it feel like a corporate daycare, as they watch everything we do. They are firing people left and right and trying to undercut the employees they do have so that they can phase us out. They do not trust their employees to do the jobs they were hired for, and they make the work load so heavy that the reps get burned out quick. The company has reorganized at least 3 times within the last 6 months and are very inconsistent . The Case Managers are doing 3 jobs in one with the same pay, and they have turned what should have been a patient focused role into a full blown call center that only focuses on the metrics."
bad,"Workplace morale depended on the manager at the time.  Under certain managers, work environment less oppressive than under others.  Overall, employees were sacrificed body and mind to save money for the bottom line.  Typical huge corporation mentally."
bad,It was extremely fast paced with cut throat management. They tell you one thing at initial hire and then never fulfill their promises. They will not guarantee you 40 hours after you are hired.
bad,"A large warehouse will organize."
bad,"I've worked at Cardinal Health (warehouse) for over a dozen years plus, I've seen it at it lowest point to it's current state. The position is highly stressed due to metrics and policies to be followed completely however their is a problem with favoritism. A typical day is clocking in, a routine stretch, and then to your work stations to begin. There are metrics you must meet on a daily basis, weekly basis, monthly basis, and a yearly basis. There is no scheduled ""quitting time"". My shift begins at 6:00 am and ends when all the freight is received, stocked- customer returns are processed and stocked. The time can vary depending on how much freight is received, how many employees have called out, and how many are in training. the goal is in 8 hours however it's usually 9-10 hours a day with overtime pay. The Supervisors are not trained properly on how to deal with these issues and creates stress on the employees who are present and working. There are 2 Daytime shifts, Sunday- Thursday and Monday-Friday. There is a Night Shift that has these two shifts as well. The Night Shift is responsible to fill orders for Customers the next morning.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the employees who work there, they are good people."
bad,Don't do it. I worked in Bedford and worked 60 to 70 hrs a week with no support  or training. After asking daily for help from the person who was supposed to be training me I parted company with them after 60 days.
bad,"They Are Very Demanding!Some Of The Staff Are Rude And Downgrading!They Stress You Out Everyday!I Hated Going To Work!They Don't Show Respect To You,Dignity,Bad Attitude!They Would Never Let You Show Them That You Could Do It!They Show Favoritism Toward Staff!"
bad,Training provided.  Fun place to work.  Environment needs more organization. Lead hands and supervisors very friendly and understanding.  Downside is low pay for the quality of work demanded
bad,Too stressful.  Procedure changes on a day to day basis.  Leadership team has bad attitude.  NO proper training. Promise of training was never kept.  Were not given the tools to succeed.
bad,Strict production goals and pronounced favoritism within the work force. Moral typically low and cliques among employees seemed to influence management decisions.
bad,Fun easy job..I would start my shift at 2:30 a.m. I would come in and do the lab work and I had to deal wi th a rude dispatcherPoor management as well
bad,"Being held at work after all work is completed, management is terrible, risk of losing your job if you go against management, lack of care for employees health, lack of training for managers and leads, being treated and talked to like a child, freedom of speech taken away, fear of losing your job if you state something or even ask a question that management doesn't agree with"
bad,work wasn't hard just hours. didn't know what time you would get off and no work life balance. if you have small kids its not the job for you. pay is not good
bad,"Been here for a year. Employees come and go pretty quick. Hard labor, running around like rats being chased by cats all night. I heard from other employees that their medical benefits sucks. Pay is as bad given the tasks assigned. These are all because of the new manager they hired 2 years ago driving the place into the ground. I feel sorry for the people that work here as permanent employees for years and don't have the guts to move on. Can't call in sick - only allowed one sick day and you use your vacation for that."
bad,The most deceiving job I have ever work in my entire life. Nothing is how the said it would be in my interview. Management inexperienced. Lied about pay raise procedure.
bad,"One thing this company has is fair benefits The facility is very clean with a new boiler system. They did get a new Glatt 120. This came after I was employ there."
bad,VERY poor training. Theyare hiring people out of desperation. Current employees are leaving due to new employees  being overly compensated with NO experience.
bad,"This job is the worse! Long hours beyond normal 10 hours they tell you in the interview. 10 cent raises for very little to no pay. You are better off applying someplace else, so many other DC's in Buford, Atlanta, Uline starts off 3.00 more than here. Management doesn't have a clue, always changing things last minute."
bad,The pay at this place is higher than most places because you don't get any opportunities to move around in the company for a different position or location and management is awful.
bad,"I was employed by Cardinal Health for 2 an half MISERABLE years. You are forced to work 14 to 15 hours a day . Management had their favorites. Only 1 45 minute break. If you needed to leave after a 12 hour day management would say you were not a team player. You run all day, not walk but run so you can meet your numbers."
bad,"A typical day at cardinal health would consist of printing an inventory sheet,picking the items on the sheet by locating the various items throughout the warehouse,then transporting the tote containing the items to the shipping department via conveyor belt.I learned that I Have excellent leadership and communication skills.The Cardinal Health management Team needs A lot of work they are very bad at communicating and motivating their employees.My co workers played a very important part in my success at Cardinal they were friendly and very helpful we got along very well.The hardest part of my job was the standing for long strenuous hours.The most enjoyable part of my job was the satifaction of delivering the products to the companies in an orderly and timely fashion."
bad,I had the opportunity to learn a lot from the company especially Lean Six Sigma. The overall environment made it an enjoyable place to work.
bad,"This is the perfect job if you are just starting out and want to get some experience under your belt. When you apply and get the job (which you will because the turnover rate is so high since the job sucks so bad) DO NOT STOP APPLYING ELSEWHERE.  You don't want to get trapped at this job because you will be tried on a daily basis ethically and will have to decide between money or happiness! If you do get sucked in I can tell you from personal experience, trying to go above and beyond for this company is added stress to yourself with little or no reward! Don't....just don't."
bad,"Management is the worst!!  The hours are unbearable. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 hours.  They do not care if you're tired.  All they care about is numbers! The evening manager  has no idea how to do his job.  I hate this place!!"
bad,This is by far the worst place I have ever worked. They expect people to work 12 - 13 hours a day everyday. The turnaround in this place is horrendous. This is the only company I have worked for that laid off a third of their workforce and then a couple of months later is posting jobs to hire new employees. Avoid this place at all costs you will not be happy. Typical example of Corporate America not caring about their employees. They think they own the people that work for them. They use people up and discard them like trash.
bad,They are so dishonest and they do not care about there dedicated employees. many years of faitfulness and hard work what you get in the end is that they set you up to fail and then they fire you. Look out for there big lies and deception. Watch your back.
bad,Cardinal took over a successful medical sales group and over the course of the last 6 years destroyed the business.
bad,you are told when interviewing about all the great perks joining the team which but they don't tell you what to expect.. they give you alot of vacation days but trying to get them off is very hard. training is poor and you are on your feet 8-10 hours daily. i would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,They do very little to help and support their employees. The only way to get ahead is if you kiss someone's butt. If you work in a pharmacy and are not a pharmacist or a pharmacy tech they treat you badly...
bad,Don't waste your time here. Mngt. lies about everything and will throw you under the bus. Most people are unhappy here and looking to get out anyways!
bad,You work long 12hrs+ a day and sometimes on weekends. You will never have no time for your self or family. Management does not know how to run this Warehouse and care nothing about your personal life!!
bad,The CEO and executives take home millions in salaries and bonuses while outsourcing and lying to employees. Don’t apply here if you want stability  They claim they are here for employees and the community but they continue to outsource jobs to Asia and now India   Don’t believe the prepared press releases they push to be published
bad,"They always let you know your expendable if you cant keep your case numbers up regardless if your short handed or not. They will change your shift hours without notice, or choice and your shift can be 12 to 14 hours long. A coworker's pregnant wife had an emergency an and they said he was fired if he left before the job was done. Say anything to employee you in interview."
bad,The atmosphere is that of of controlled chaos which easily shifts out of control. Far too many quality issues which impact the moral of the hourly workforce as well as salaried. You need to be experienced in office politics and be able to cover you back at all times. This is not a company where you can let your guard down. Mid to upper management is weak which exacerbate’s the situation. Be very careful if you choose this company.
bad,Office politics ruled the facility I was working out of. Alot of unmotivated employees that spent time scheming how to get promoted. They promoted an employee to make nuclear medicine without considering her back round or her character. Solely due to her brother working there also.
bad,"Management does not actually encourage or help the employees unless you are one of their favorites. When trucks are on the verge of being behind managers show up so they can hound the pickers to get the job done. "
bad,"The culture is horrible. The stress of the drama between management and peer is worst than a high school. The pay is amazing and more than most spots but the pay is NOT worth the culture. I reported many things and had proof of the issues/drama to management and it just becomes worse. I would recommend not reporting issues if you started working there because you will just cause more problems for yourself. I would keep my head down and not make friends because if you do then you will see the culture issues, lack of management or structure."
bad,"Management  was absolutely awful and inexperienced."
bad,"It’s not a pleasing place to work  not any flexible shifts no job advancement, favoritisms, supervisors are rude and not respectful, work is very easy it’s just management that makes the job very hard"
bad,"You work with really great people. Fun and happy people. That's the only thing that was good about the job was the people you work for. Other then that, that job is the worse. Management don't care about people or the health of people only about the company itself."
bad,"horrible HR and upper management"
bad,Favoritism and unfair treatment galore.  One of the program managers has salacious allegations made against them with multiple people corroborating and history of documented insubordinate behavior with no consequence.  Insubordination is rewarded IF certain members of leadership like the person.  Benefiting from failure and inappropriate conduct have largely been dependent upon skin color.  This location does NOT espouse the values expressed by Cardinal Health corporate.
bad,"Cardinal Health pays good and has benefits but for a certain reason. They overwork employees to the bone. During the the first few weeks it would seem nice doing more than 60 hours of work, but eventually the overwork catches up to your body and it hits it hard and rough. Many employees have had severe lower back pain issues, wrists issues, and other injuries. Once the manager finds that you cannot work heavy no longer (even if you have medical excuse) they will lay you off. They speak about “We want you coming to work healthy normal and leaving healthy normal everyday,” however, the overwork will not allow that at all. Because of such heavy work, most employees tend to find ways to avoid such work and cruise while pretending to look good and end up leaving a lot of heavy work to people with good integrity and work ethics thus leading to severe long term injuries. In summary, if you are young and in good fit health then this is your opportunity to work for good money, but because of the overwork hours you will not have social life anymore. Basically once you get hired at Cardinal Health, you will only look forward to those two days off to either stay in bed or the couch to have as much rest as you can before the process of overwork begins again. Unless you like this sort of thing and love to stack money then by all means, “Have at it.” Oh yeah before I forget, “Temporary hires takes a looong time for permanent stay, after 90 day trial you will not still be hired but will have to wait until after 6 more months.”"
bad,they dont show any appreciation for hard work. it's a production job with subzero incentives. the recently audited and actually took money from their hourly paid employees claiming back taxes on gifts recieved over a 3 year period with NO warning.
bad,"After working here for a little over half a year, I have seen a bad situation become worst. The management is horrible just like the pay. I don't understand stand how a multi billion dollar a year company can only afford to pay it's employees only $13.50 an hour for inbound shift and a dollar more for outbound shift. Which means anyone hired for outbound makes more money than you and you have been there longer.The benefits are not the greatest. I'm trying to hang in there until I get a better employer however its very difficult. If you are not part of the good old boy circle or not in a click at this particular DC you can forget about advancement. Had know that working here would like this I would not have accepted this position."
bad,"At Cardinal Health they have caviar taste on a welfare budget. Small annual increases is the norm for top performers. Once you reach the top of your scale then they try and force you out or just outright give you a package. Management has no clue, it is just silos with cliques inside each of them, non inclusive and hypocritical. It is a great place for some one coming out fresh from College to learn the ropes gather experience so they can move on to greater and better things. Medical benefits are poor no better than Obama care and cost an arm and a leg. There is a good paid time off and leave package and the usual paid holidays but that is where it ends. Cardinal could be a global organization but their leadership holds them back."
bad,Poor management; lack of career advancement. Many unqualified employees who have been there for many years.  These older employees actively work against process improvement.
bad,"company cant keep workers, discriminate, always found a reason to complain. made me feel like skin color was an issue, favoritism with certain employees. management is not interested in keeping good hard workers. poor training."
bad,"Cardinal Health pays $3.50/hr less than a living wage for Asheville, N.C..  They deprive full time workers of any hours on Thursday and Friday when that employee is scheduled to start work on Friday and Saturday nights at 11:30 PM (until 8:30AM).  This was their successful attempt to LIMIT OVERTIME which has cost them multiple employees."
bad,"If you end up at Cardinal Health please do your self a favor and keep putting in applications else where . Management is a complete mess ,but it is a pay check and benefits that is the only thing positive I can say. Mediocre place to work at best . Way better jobs can be found ."
bad,They seem to have problems with employees not following OSHA regulations and driving the PIT equipment in a unsafe manner. Management seems to over look most things just as long as the lines per hour are met.
bad,"The entry salary is really low, once you get into the union the benefits are not that good and it will have to pass a considerable amount of time to received them."
bad,"My biggest issue with Cardinal Health was the information given about the position during my interview and the real day to day life did not match up at all.  We worked 12-15 days, four days a week.  I was told four 10 hour days with overtime ""as needed"".  I guess it wasn't a ""lie"", but it sure felt like it.  Especially after seeing all of the reviews about the long hours.  I mean, for some people, that is fine.  Many people want those hours for a bigger check.  But why not just let people know during the interview process?  Plus, in my case, the interview questions had nothing to do with the actual job I was being interviewed for.  I had another job offer at the same time that Cardinal gave me an offer.  If they had been upfront during the interview process, I would have taken the other offer.  They claim to be Lean and Six Sigma oriented, but I found their technology and processes to be behind the times.  The supervisors were on the floor, wrapping skids, loading trucks, and picking orders.  They did not have time to do the things I needed from my supervisor.  A couple of people mentioned being ""short handed"".  But it felt like that is something that is said whenever there is a complaint.  One of those, ""everything will be fixed when we get fully staffed"".  But at some time most of the crew probably realized that will never happen.  I could be wrong, but all of the other reviews and the fact that they seem to have a year round ad running for jobs makes me think that this is just the culture.  Pay is not good.  The work on the warehouse floor is not exceptionally tough, however."
bad,"those who work are overloaded while half the dept goofs off all day; minimal training; mgmt admits they have ""no idea what you do""; medical products and there are spiders, centipedes & mice running all over the office - absolutely filthy"
bad,"There is no work life balance... Typical work day was arriving at 7 AM and leaving at 6 PM to go home to eat dinner then firing up the laptop to work from 9 PM to midnight. Hundreds of co-workers were online late. It was considered normal. Gave the company 100+ hour weeks for years with no job security."
bad,Bad Job not really family friendly job is more important than anything
bad,"I was hired as a customer service representative for inbound calls and other responsibilities. The training lacks consistency because the office is short staffed so no one really has time to teach the new hire because the metric obsessed supervisor changes the duties of the csr's depending on numbers, and since numbers fluctuate, so does your tasks. Everyone there seems to be ok with being stressed and they do the best they can with the heavy demands of a supervisor that has never done their job. I was the 4th employee within the past year to leave this position and I believe its because of the unstable training. "
bad,"No room for advancement if you are an assistant, management will throw you under the bus when it's their fault, they criticize you but give you no direction. Most of the executives here are so spoiled that they expect to be waited on constantly. You won't get any work that makes you feel validated, it's just printing and scheduling and many other mindless tasks. Don't ever expect to be recognized for anything you do unless it's wrong. You will think that everyone is nice off the bat and be so excited about coming to work here, then you find out how scandalous and secretive everyone is. Do yourself a favor and stay away!"
bad,"Still work here the 2 warehouse managers are so cold unapourchable don't trust them .Very sneaking alot of coverup with their family members working here ,they walk right by you and won't give you the time of day .Do yourself a favor don't work here"
bad,Pay sucks and they work and treat you like a dog.Eyes on you at times.Speed and quanity=mistakes.Potentialy you could be risking lives with the speed.They are electroids used in all hospitals and medical facilities.All they look at is $$$.
bad,"This company is ALL about the mighty profit,  they boast Billion dollar profits, yet  reduce work force all the time to save a dollar or  two.  This sickens me as they are laying off local people who pay taxes to support local economy and they move the jobs to India  to save money.    Would be nice to have a secure job where you can raise a family and just live and be happy on a fair wage instead of constantly worrying when the layoffs will impact you.   Unless you are executive management this is not a good environment.   Middle management and below is very cut throat  and entry level is hard to break out of you are very expendable.    "
bad,poor management bad hours they expect you to come into work even on your day off with out notice poor pay no raises after you have a lot of time with the company not a safe place to work they dont care about there employes would not recomen this company to any body stay away from this company.
bad,"10-14 hour days, unrealistic production goals, no realistic training on day to day operations, poor warehouse conditions for pick and pull, poor communications,"
bad,"Horrible Working hours, they treat you as if you have no life other than working there. Poor management, you never could voice your opinion without suffering consequences. HR rep and rest of management team did not work to make things better. They allow racial comments to be openly made in coming work areas and when they were reported it just got swept under the rug. Violence and drugs has Alabama been in the building. Very unsafe place to work!’"
bad,"The people were very rude and unprofessional.  The managers let people run the departments  how ever they wanted. Management  lied about being able to advance, Hr said it's up to supervisor, supervisor  says it's up the HR."
bad,"Cardinal Health is a stressful working environment full of uncertainty, poor morale and horrible leadership. Can't trust anyone in upper management to be honest and forthright."
bad,"I just quit this job last week for various reasons. I asked if they would switch me to a part-time position because I would be starting school. I was told they would not be offering part-time anymore but it is now listed? There are no opportunities for advancement unless you have a bachelors or masters degree. I am going to school to complete my bachelors.The management here is poor, they have no clue how to manage or talk to people. Supervisors here treat people like robots and numbers.They will give you a set schedule but do not stick to it. You will work long hours with no outside life. There is always a high overturn with employees quitting and therefore you will have to work more than signed up for. This company does not care about their employees, only production numbers.The only good thing is the benefits. Even then, you will have to learn everything for yourself because they do not take the time to inform you of options or how to sign up. When I was finally able to use my paid time off, I was always questioned about why I was using it. On breaks, supervisors will try to intimidate and rush you by standing in the break room until you get back to work. There are better job opportunities than working with this company!"
bad,So much improvement needs to be done. First off management: terrible. Pay: Meh $17 isn't worth enough especially the work you are doing.  They make promises about your growth to move and yet they were lacking on them. I've worked here for almost 2 years and they treated me like garbage. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here. Period.
bad,"If you have a family with kids, this is not the place for you. Tooo many hours. It is very draining. Hours vary per shift, per day. Shortest day is 10 hours. Longest day 15-16 hours. You’re on your feet walking for all those hours. Short breaks with one 30 min lunch. Management is constantly rushing you to work faster. The warehouse is very outdated. You have to do all this extra stuff to accommodate their lack of advanced technology, hindering your productivity. But they still rush you to hit production rate. Turn over rate is crazy. This company cannot retain employees whatsoever. They need to revamp the ENTIRE warehouse but they never listen to ideas."
bad,"The management culture changed withing the past 12 months. Employees were poorly treated, with the manager favoring certain employees with overtime and favorable routes."
bad,"I worked here for 3.5 yrs and only received 1 pay increases. policies were changed constantly with no times for adjustment. no advancement was available unless you were a favorite of the management team. supervisors had lack of training and were micro managers. Training was inconsistent and advancement was very difficult because something was always blamed on you and why you were able to get pay increase, although it was out of your hands. Overall, so glad I finally left the company that didn’t even allow a transfer after the 3.5 years I worked there. horrible company that only cares about the money they made and not on their customers or employees that did all the hard ground work."
bad,"6 year driver in Plainview NY. When you have bad management and supervision it WILL BE A STRESSFUL place to work. Daily radiation exposure for a living is not good for you.no matter what anyone tells you along with low starting salary. Nothing replaces your health. Better jobs out there. You are encouraged to speed to get done fast but this violates company policy..if you get a ticket for speeding you are liable and your insurance goes up.Supervisor will degrade you around other employees. Employees walk out of lab without surveying themselves for contamination possibly spreading contamination that you can take home with you. The job description currently is different when i started. Though it may say associate l The current job description is for associate ll"
bad,"stressful, overworked, lack of communication, lack of good management and sometimes no leadership available the culture is very competitive. The most enjoyable was talking to the customers."
bad,"Cardinal bought out my previous company and drive it into the ground. They lost more than half the clients and changed the business model so no new business came in. They laid off or eliminated most of our jobs and for those remaining employed, the workload was at an unsafe level.  The patients we served were at great risk which is why I left. Thirty-five prescription orders an hour for a 10 hour shift is unsafe.  No breaks scheduled in our shift."
bad,"Management will be their downfall.  They have no idea what to do.  The employees that do the best and know the most scares them because they feel they will take their position.  So, they undermine them and keep them in a regular position.  They never want to promote them.  The individuals that are promoted are lazy, have no knowledge of the system, and would rather yell than pitch in an help with the workload when we are about to miss shipment.  They say they value accountability, but they don’t.  They never want to feel responsible for failing to make shipment night after night.  Management plays around and jokes at the most crucial times of the night when they could be helping with the workload.  The only thing they know how to manage are the number of excuses they come up with for why they keep missing truck."
bad,"Employees act like managers,leads and supervisors are never available to talk to.work/life balance is TERRIBLE!Will never suggest anybody to work here"
bad,"Manament was terrible , it’s all about seniority there , it takes years to officially be in 1st shift . Don’t recommend this place. 401k is a good match and pto that’s it."
bad,"You can't have a life outside of Cardinal. The pay is great, good benefits, but it's just not worth the stress. Way too much favoritism & fraternization within the company. Management is just a mess. Attendance policy is way too strict. So let's hope you have PTO Sick time around flu season, cause if you don't , expect to work a full shift running a fever. I've seen this. I've had to do this. Also expect to work full time, even as a part time employee. And get this, on days that you're not scheduled to work, attendance policy applies if you miss the shift they force you to pick up . Huge turnaround rate with employees. Good workers quit because of how bad management is. It's a great company, this location just isn't run the right way. "
bad,The company used to be great before cardinal health took over. The management team have no idea what they're doing. They can't give you an answer without having to go ask someone else. They hold you back if you're good at a specific job. They waste your time to go take tests for jobs you will never get. I left because I was told not to waste my time to try to advance unless I've been there a year. That's ridiculous!
bad,very difficult place to work because there is no time in between phone calls even when you have a bad call you have to go right to the next one.  Have to keep your call time down
bad,"poor management, back stabbing staff. Would not work there again.  Hardest part of the job was working around the activity director who did not want therapy for her patients."
bad,"Poor management, Very high turn over cause they don't pay good enough for the very demanding work you have to do. Don't care about the safety of its employees. lots of injuries when I was there some major. You do same job everyday so don't expect to be rotated. same people get the best raises cause they are in the same easy spot everyday while others have to suffer throwing IV solution all day while they pick sutures."
bad,I first applied there because it's a well known place started working there they told us there would be overtime but not much then we had it every night 16+ hours on our days off we had to come in very exhausting place.
bad,"Even though it's a Global Corporation, Cardinal operates like a mom's and pop's shop. Management makes decisions based on ego and favoritism. Many are stuck in their ways and refuse to change or refuse to hear other's opinions. Opinions are spoken but never heard  year over year. Turnover is on a rise at all levels and departments which shows instability and  lack of leadership. There sight is further than their reach and with the lack of people managers/directors, they will have a hard time adjusting to the fast pace and technological advancements. I would not recommend this place for employment as it's too easy to get rid of their oldest to newest employees simply based on management disliking them. Every other warehouse company offers better pay, perks, and employee engagement AND most definitely, better management. Sometimes, it takes years to get a desirable shift due to the high tenor of all the day employees. Some employees aren't performance managed due to the fact of age and proximity to retirement which proves the inconsistency throughout."
bad,"Very hateful people, no respect for anyone. No leaderships on production lines. Just a very stressful and depressing place to work. would never tell anyone to work there."
bad,"This place was not a very fun job at all. Very boring and constant long hours. Not very much home time at let all, expect to work 10 hours or more...."
bad,"The location in Columbia, MD is poorly managed. The supervisors act as if there in high school. They have there personal favorites and if they do not like you they will get rid of you. They have no compassion for the employees and they will smile in your face and talk about you behind your back. They do not recognize employees for there accomplishments. I wouldn't bother with this place. They need new management and supervisors that actually have knowledge of the business and employee needs."
bad,"Great pay, Decent Benefits, Poor Management."
bad,"I was hired to do one job and be trained by a more experienced employee. After three months of non-existent training,  which I said things about to my manager and director and they did nothing,  the employee quit and our manager expected me to pick up and do the job of at the next level above where I was hired in at. "
bad,Cardinal health isn't the job for you if you have a family ! You would spend a good majority of your time there you would barely be able to see your family . Also management is not so great . You have some people in there that has no clue how to do their jobs . The only things I could say good about cardinal is the pay but you have to put in a lot of hours over 50+ a week !!
bad,"The job had long terrible hours, 1st shift is treated way better than 2nd shift. Forced to work OT, and they're not really appreciative of their workers. There is A LOT of favoritism amongst some workers and managers. Poor management and everyone was always on a different page, there was no communication."
bad,"I always have a good time at work. My supervisor is helpful to his worker we always get ours work done on time. The management always there for their employees needs, they makes the job easy for us to do. Because every member of the management team work along with the employees so that make the job enjoyable to be part off. I have never have a typical day at work before, and my co-works are people to be around it make happy to go to work everyday I love my job."
bad,Worked there for many years and management would never take care of the problems that needed to be addressed. Way too stressful for a job that shouldn't have been. Wages have a top pay so if you exceeded that on your merit review you were not fairly rewarded for all of your hard work.
bad,"Cardinal Health discounts the wages and health insurance of their employees.  They are more concerned about profits above anything else.  Workers are continually taking concessions, be it in health insurance packages get worse and worse each year, cost of living increases are non-existent and raises are virtually impossible to get."
bad,some days it good and some day it bad. the co-workers was okay management was okay.there wasn't no hard time and I really didn't have a enjoyable part at this job.
bad,"I was employed for 3 months and a full on course of radiation training was required but never given to me. I would go home with double the radiation levels on my extremities. I confronted manager 3 times and he apologized but everything continued on the same path. As far as the scheduling went, for a person whos almost at the level of a doctor, this man did not have a clue in common sense. He would change your schedule CONSTANTLY! If one did not look at the schedule at the end of a work day, one would either miss a shift or come in late. Overall, not worth putting my health in jeopardy."
bad,"Not always fun things to , not always great things to talk about. Fun people very diverse , I learnt a little bit of Spanish. Been introduced to new friends."
bad,"I've been given a raise once in 3+ years due to the fact two former site managers and an area director discriminated against me and it is continuing. I am a white male, 61, married and a Veteran and I am the only person of this type working there. The vast majority of employees are immigrants, some legal, some not but being NJ it is the culture Cardinal is looking for. Our site had to work all Thanksgiving weekend while our new director was in the Caribbean on vacation and all the area supervisors did not show up as well as some of their ""privileged"" favorites. We have had three site managers at this site in less than four years. The first (who began my harassment) was fired for falsifying shipping and other documentation. The second was the first director who was fired for promoting unqualified employees and new hires to positions without allowing current employees the opportunity for the position. The third was fired for fraternizing with female employees at the hotel/motel next door. In addition, the words, ethics, morality and integrity do not mix, much like oil and water. Cardinal health paid over $214 million for contributing to the opioid problem in Ohio."
bad,"Stressful no personal gratification. To many people not working. Never know when shift ends. Co-workers were great, and individually supervisors as well, but every shift was a cluster,  and by the end of the shift too many people had checked out."
bad,"We call this company  "" Modern-day-SLAVERY"" unrealistic expectations that affecting you physically and mentally.   No matter how hard you work, at the end of the day, you still not meeting their goal.   Throughout the day they send out email report informing you how many tasks you completed. This is their way of pushing you to do more and more.  You'll get so burned out that you don't want to go to work the next day.  Every few months your manager goes over your productivity letting you know that you did not meet the goal and your work needs improvement.   We are sick and tired of the games they play.  The managers themselves cannot do half of the task they expect us to do.  Employees leave without giving notice."
bad,"The turnover rate at this place is horrible. People do not stay due to poor management and not knowing how to run a distribution center. I have worked at other places to see the difference. Will not have a life while you work here they expect you to be there 10 plus hours a day. Employees are just numbers to them and truly do not care about employees. If you need time off for a doctors or what have you good luck with that. They take your pto if you leave ""on time"" and everybody else works later. Overall run for the hills and do not work here, it was the worst decision i have ever made."
bad,"Do not wish to review; however, this is a fast-paced distribution operation. Personally feel this  there is a lack of experience and training of new hires; I performed my job on-target to above-average expectations of the company."
bad,"Transporting Radioactive material to hospitals work in lab packing medical doses with a minimum wages 12.50. and little later will ask you to do more task like what pharmacy tech do. you kidding me handling radioactive dealing with hazardous waste for 12.50 an hour this company is a joke and other state had higher hourly rate. Better think about before applying  job for this company. Though it would be more on doing delivery which loading and unloading packages. But I was a little bit surprised when started working  for  the pharmacy. manager  told me  that I’m now an associate service & delivery for this company. I was surprised because when I saw this job opening it says delivery driver,  and later they will lure and put a bait on you for 40 cents pay raise. Poor management they don’t care if your only a driver, so be aware for this company."
bad,"The management expected travel on Sunday afternoon and return on last flight Friday night.  ZERO work-life balance.  Worst leadership I have ever encountered.  I left on my own because I did not need to stay in a culture where they wanted you to worship the company.  In fairness, this pertains to the no longer existing consulting branch.  We were also supposedly executive level but only had one week paid time off until five years of service you got 2 weeks.  HORRIBLE place to work."
bad,working at Cardinal Health is stressful due to management lack of not being well train in how to run the department they are in charge and the way they treat the employees.For example their was one particular supervisor who thought he was still in the army and didn't want the employee questioning him and he would tried to instil fear in the employee by telling them they could lose their job.Everybody got along find and it was good being around the rest of the crew and it made the job more enjoyable to do. The bad part of the job is some of the supervisors lack of professionalism.
bad,It's an ok company. I don't really care to comment but I have to. It's not really my thing to review anything but this is what indeed wants.
bad,"Cardinal health is a good company but methodist medical center is an awful place to work. Management micromanages the place and the techs are by far the laziest people I've ever worked with. People come in just to sit, eat and talk all day. But if your new, Trust me you don't get that privlege you get over worked. These techs that work here would be fired if they worked anywhere else. They can't keep anyone in this position because every new tech quits due to the work environment and being treated like a noBody. Management ignores the fact to change anything. They come up to you to ask what they can do to make you happy, but in actuality they don't care, just as long as they have a body there. Management is a joke. The entire hospital belittles the pharmacy, if you go up to the floors to deliver anything, your public enemy number 1. The IV room is gross, if I was on my dying bed I would absolutely have to make my own before I allow any of those incompetent techs to make it."
bad,"Get there at scheduled time and never know when you are going home. You ask for estimated time and managers just tell you to continue to work. No family time, no social life. The only people you get to see everyday is your coworkers. You don’t get paid extra for overtime. Barely any good benefits."
bad,The management used to care about the employees. They weren't just bodies in seats. But then management changed and they became about the numbers. It was at his point that the environment changed. The employees became down trodden and the atmosphere changed. It became a very difficult environment to work in. They pushed more and more unrealistic standards on their people. As a result a lot of people left. The ones that did not leave were subject to a MASSIVE lay off while they moved operations overseas. The poor people that were left behind were forced to do the job of 3 or 4 people. Then the irony set in and the overseas operation failed and now they are scrambling to fix their mistake. It's really laughable.
bad,"management here do not listen to the employee, never solve issues just let them go on until a employee take matters in their own hands. Supervisors have picks within the departments"
bad,Promises made but not kept. Poor compensation. Unhealthy environment. Backstabbing. Every person for themselves. Cannot trust anyone at any level of the company.
bad,my review says it all. nice place to work if you have no life outside work. management is ok. needs more work flow cohesiveness. more team work. less self patting on back.
bad,"This company says all of the right things, but they do not always translate into reality. Networking is encouraged, but there are many managers who do not really encourage it in reality."
bad,Transporting Radioactive material to hospitals work in lab packing medical doses.
bad,"The culture was great.  Working at a company for over 16 years provided a great ""second"" family amongst the co-workers."
bad,Jacksonville warehouse is a joke people are very unhappy management don't treat people fairly. good . company bad management.
bad,"JUST Terrible! AVOID at all costs, you would enjoy a job shoveling manure all day over selling your soul to this company.  This isnt just as a previous employee but as the SON of a current employee who has heart complications and literally comes home in tears 4 days out of the week after devoting 8 years to the company 5 of which were in "" perfect attendance "" they will use any excuse and any means necessary to get rid of you if you dont leave of your own accord. It will start out great and after your first few paychecks youll begin to notice the vultures flying around the building and the overwhelming sense of foreboding that emanates from the parking lot.  And if you dont believe me just ask the company about the ""incidents"" in Arkansas after they dropped the ball when changing over to a new system. When a company has to bring in massage therapists and real Psychiatrists to help employees you know that its not just ONE thing that happened.  This company makes no exceptions for employees and cares for nothing but the next dollar.  The used to be in the top 25 of the Fortune 500, my how the mighty have fallen."
bad,A hostile work place environment day to day unorganized days. Since day one its been all lies. I was hired as a reach truck operator. The first day I was in in a truck lumping the whole entire truck. Was suppose to get a raise 05/2019 still haven;t receive that raise yet. Keep giving me the BS run around about it.
bad,"You have a turn over of 30 to 35 employees, somethings wrong with the management up top!!!not a great place to work, hours long. To much pressure on completing task. A app call Aims for picking batches is just totally done by a team who’s never worked in a warehouse.."
bad,The pay is fair to the market and at times a bit on the higher end. The work environment is extremely poor. People call each other names and others barely work without being held accountable. I feel sorry for the patients who suffer due to the poor customer service skills. Management is clueless and totally not engaged or aware with how terrible the environment and service has become. It’s very high school and click-ish.
bad,"A typical day was the same thing day in and day out.  I really didn't anything new and exciting.  The was a not professional and more of a joke than leaders they needed to be.  The workplace culture was a ""good ole boy,"" theme.  The most enjoyable part of my job was going home at the end of the day"
bad,"If your a hard worker your taken advantage of you end up doing more work for lazy people that the management seems to cater to"
bad,"If you are looking to work for an organization that values diversity and inclusion, this is not the organization to work for. Ideas are not welcomed and the high school mentality is quite common."
bad,Don't work at the Durham DC. If you have a life this is not for you because the management will work you like a slave and they have no compassion for their employees. The management  only cares about efficency and the employees don't matter. The management is incompitent and they make up policies to force you out of the company. I made a staging error and they used that to force me out of the company because my efficency was not at 95 percent  I worked there a long time and the last three years were a nightmare. Human Resources  literally laughed in my face when I tried to reason with them. You can do a hundred things right for some people and they will always remember the one thing you didn't do. The raises are garbage anyway  this is a Fortune 500 company and they only give you a 25 cent raise a year. You can't plan anything because you never know when you are getting off work on any given day because there is Mandatory overtime. You have to stay or else you get an occurence.  Did I mention the management is incompitent?  They don't care about their employees at all. Don't work here.  This is a great place to work If you have no life.
bad,"Very enjoyable place to work, Coworkers were wonderful and duties were of the capacity of variety.  This job allowed me to interact with external customers as well as internal.  I really did not see this job as having any difficulties and management was a joy to work with. I learned so many things here such as how to set up a Trade Show."
bad,"Safe workplace for assembly job, compensation is OK, the job is not so hard"
bad,is a good company to build a career and move to something else. but i will advice to get trained so you don't do the same thing everyday. I was trained on lean six sigma and i moved up
bad,"I'm interested at any position but I had worked at Cardinal Health; is located at 11 Centenial Driver, Peabody, MA."
bad,"Extremely busy. If you have kids this is not the place to work. your told your job is one way and the next day it changes. They expect you to do everything for a cheap price. The workers are great, but management  is terrible. Your voice never matters."
bad,"Overall the people working there are nice and easy to get along with but management is shifty, dishonest, and not fair with everyone. There are very few Americans compared to foreigners and they get aways with anything and everything."
bad,"First off let me start off by saying this will be a terrible job especially if you are a temp. Temps has more knowledge then the full-time employees. Temps have to work triple time than full time employees, Temps might be ask to get the gum off the bottle of a full-time employee shoe. Don't nobody want to work with a company who has a lady that yells at them in demand that you stop talking you will feel as though you are a slave that you are not a grown person working in a safe environment due to the supervisor and Lead who does not do nothing but unload the truck all day long and that's it the manager and him are drinking buddies they even have a nephew that works there that is the big boss nephew people need to stop lying about cardinalhealth and tell the truth this is definitely not a place to work at they lie to you about the schedule you would think that you are working from 5 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. you might be out all the way there to 5:30 p.m. they better off working the description is sad from 5 a.m. till"
bad,"Take take take no giving back. Always on your back. Very unorganized...the leadership team in place always thinking about themselves. President first ,VP next , managers next all other people, working are pond scum"
bad,I'm an engineer here and its a great job. there isn't any micromanaging so i love the engineering group I work under. My boss is great and helps in any way possible.
bad,"Very unhealthy environment, Manager with no people skills or management skills or training rude and don't appreciate hard work , dimeaning to employees and higher management don't investigate and take manager side .. emotional abuse and HR say they support you but at the end it's you against management and they always win. I would never recommend this company"
bad,"Lots of favoritism, long hours of work we don’t get appreciated to get the job done "
bad,"Most employees seemed to last about 2-4 years before they realize CAH doesn’t ever live up to it’s promises. Poor leadership with no long term plans for success. Management boasts about promoting from within the company, but they continue to hire from outside the company for any leadership position.  Redundant and counterproductive policies with few goals in mind. If you want to pad your resume for office work, this place may be the trick. However, it’s just a stepping stone to better jobs in the area. I've never reunited with a former coworker who missed working there."
bad,"Management sucks"
bad,"Horrible management.  Manager was never present, not clear on expectations.  Did not treat everyone the same.  I used to love my job until new management was put into place.  Did not provide guidance and very rarely met with team members to discuss issues/concerns."
bad,Please be aware. Just go to work and do your job. If you try and get to know hr in Buford you will get burned.  He goes after you if she start to dislike you. If you had someone to go to about issues at Cardinal it would be a great company. She had fired many supervisors and hourly employees just because she started to dislike them. Dublin OH please look into this. You go to work to make money and get product to the customer. But with Hr you have to worry about your job. Look at the turnover rate.
bad,"It was a great job and good experience to have it on a wearhouse,"
bad,Poor management. Manager plays favoritism. Employees does whatever they want and some come to work with hangover. Always short of protective equipment.
bad,During my employment at Cardinal health I was allowed to grow and express my ideas and concerns. The work ethic was great. They had the best health insurance coverage I had ever experienced with any other company. I really enjoyed my time working for this company.
bad,pay is decent but that's about it alot of hours about 60 a week. dont fall on hard times or family issues and need time off because they will give you all the time you need because you will be unemployed
bad,Loading the different  trucks ever load was different. You had to follow the load diagram ever day. Then some day you would have to go and pick the freight. I learned how too load trucks and pick. The hardest part was some times the load was too big to fit in the truck. Then you would have to spin a hole side. As long as you time your time you can do any thing. You put your mind to it.
bad,Really good workers that deserve better treatment period!
bad,The job overall was great in the beginning and it was such a great environment and atmosphere. Then there was a supervisor that was hired and of course things started to go downhill. This supervisor was very sneaky and crooked so the job became worse and worse. Several employees resigned their position just because of this one individual. I did enjoy my coworkers while being there but some days management was just too much to handle.
bad,It was a great place to work until Corporate decided to send our jobs offshore.  I worked there for 17 years and then they made the decision to save money by sending our jobs offshore and making us train our replacements for over a year.  I want to work for a company that cares more about their employees and less about putting money in their corporate leader's pockets.
bad,Management doesn't care about employees to the point where they get rid of people. Every year they let people go around October to keep cost down. They stole overtime from employees (class action lawsuits). Not worth your time.
bad,"Medical benefits has a Huge deductible for such a large company.  Cardinal is the Largest medical sales company I've worked for yet had the Highest Deductible  $1500.  All the others were $500. "
bad,"I would still be there but the hrs are killer, at least 60 hrs in 5 day week. The only reason for hrs is massively understaffed and that goes for all 3 shifts."
bad,"This is not a good place to work for! It's 8 hours of non stop work, the pay it's not good for all the work u have to do, u have to meet your metrics every day or management will get u . There's very little opportunity to move up , management it's horrible and they have their favorites , the leads are always pushing you."
bad,Cardinal Health purchased the previous company I worked for.  I was kept around to assist with the migration of IT into Cardinal Health.  This migration lasted approximately 18 months and then I was let go.
bad,"Work would start a different time every day. They told us in the interview it was 7pm-3am with some overtime. Never started at 7pm while I was there, always earlier."
bad,"Management was not great. They will demand that you stay more than your required time more often than not. For many, you have to reach a quota before going home. It is very difficult to communicate to the supervisors what you want and what is best for you. "
bad,There were too many lazy leads and supervisors that treat work like dating scene. The overall environment was raunchy because even the supervisors and leads were making dirty and inappropriate jokes with the rest of their employees.
bad,"Cardinal could be a good company to work for if you work in certain places. Some site cultures are just plain toxic. I've come across a couple director level individuals that manage through fear and a mob like mentality. There's quite a bit of turnover and the training is basically tribal knowledge with countless hours of reading procedures that you're not going to remember anyway. They also don't make any sense when you're reading them because it's your first experience with Cardinal so you have no idea what you're reading. There tend to be a lot of empty promises when it comes to development. The managers and directors know how to paint a great looking picture with no follow through. The review process is flawed also. If you want a great review you're expected to go above and beyond your duties (makes sense right?) but if you go above and beyond your duties, depending on the manager, you can actually get in trouble."
bad,"Management is not know to backup it's employees unless you are a personal friend of theirs. You can work your heart out and still be overlooked by the less qualified. Jobs are posted for growth but unless you are friends of who's hiring, you won't grow."
bad,"I had a manager that wanted to use his own ideas or to take credit for my work, he was a constant needle in my side and was not a team player. he was a self proclaimed hero."
bad,"very hard to work for ,extensive need for licenses, rotating shift times overnight with no consistency need to be organized, computer literate with multiple systems at the same time"
bad,"They expect you to get 95-100% or more on your picking and packing productivity. If you don't get that the supervisors will ride you and tell you your numbers are down. This place is extremely hot, it literally feels like working in an oven. I now know what a piece of meat feels like being slowly cooked in a crock pot."
bad,"Even though I worked through a temporary service, Cardinal Health is not a good company to work for. Manager is out of order and unfair. They do not care about your home life and have favorites. I would not recommend anyone work here"
bad,"Manager is overtly Homophobic abd Racist , condescending and arrogant. Also pushes religious beliefs into the workplace. For lack of a better description , he is an uptight , overbearing  A-hole.."
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work for Cardinal. When I first started it was a great place to work ,hours were good and management was better put together. As months went by and HR fired management and hired new ones. Since then cardinal went down hill. The hours were long and mandatory. Everything was unorganized and chaotic. The new DC manager is an absolute mess who has no idea what he’s doing so calls to HR for everything so they can tell him what to do. They don’t care for their employees. If an employee doesn’t coaperate they find a excuse to fire you. For the past year or so I have seen so many ppl come and go. Either they let them go or they leave themselves. New hires don’t seem too last more than 4 to 5 months. It was once a great place to work but now it’s not. It is very under payed and raises are rare, when raises are given they are not even worth it. So save yourself the time and stress."
bad,"This job isn’t for ones with lives. Hard work, terrible managers. If your not one of the favorites then be prepared to have a miserable work day experience. I loved the fellow colleagues however."
bad,"Pull reports, make phone calls to other hospitals, create reports, substitute supplies when other supplies were on back order.  Responsible for maintaining a working relationship with hospital suppliers."
bad,"From start to finish it is non stop filling prescription orders for companies. I learned how important pharmaceuticals really are to big businesses. Management is ok, most of them couldn't do a simple task even if the answers was on the back of the paper."
bad,"Where do I begin. The facility in Montgomery used to be a very pleasant place to work for. Unfortunately, due to poor business practices, the warehouse has been in steady decline for many years. Management will tell you otherwise but it's awfully shady when they eliminate many of the perks that associates had to begin with. Upon hire, an associate would be making 12/hour and after two years would be at 16/hour. They did away with that. They used to have a daily catering service in the cafeteria. They deemed that too expensive and did away with it. Eventually they replaced it with a pizza shop, so I guess it was better than nothing. Benefits have steadily gotten worse. In an attempt to save money, they started hiring temps to eliminate paying for benefits altogether. Another management decision was to eliminate all of the conveyors and automated machines because they deemed them too costly to maintenance. Instead of changing with the times, management has decided to return to the stone age. Perhaps since most of their customers are leaving and signing contracts with other distributors, it probably makes sense to save some money when nothing is coming in. And as for the icing on the cake? Almost everybody in upper management is currently in a relationship with associates on the floor. It's against company policy, and THEY TELL YOU THAT, but they still do it and nobody seems to care. "
bad,"If you like long hours very little advancement managers are looking the other way at bad habits"
bad,"Management was not nice and the work hours were not very good either. "
bad,"Constant reorganization.  Management really didn't show that they cared about employees, only the bottom line.   You were expendable.   Management was reviewed and received a very low rating especially in the are of trust."
bad,Always somebody getting hurt due to the violations of safety procedures due to the negligence of management.They have too many young inexperienced managers that would not listen to the constructive feedback given by more seasoned employees who had been with the company for over 5 and 10 years. These mistakes could have been easily avoided if they had given a little more clout to the older employees. Instead they would act like if you said something that went against their new procedure or way of thinking you were not a team player and would try to do a write up for insubordination. I am glad i no longer work in this chaos!
bad,"Very poorly managed. If you are not part of a specific group and have their same mind set as far as their work ethics, you will not be a good fit. If you voice your opinion you are looked down upon. You are not respected. "
bad,"They will have you backing up a coworker when they are not there, you are good enough to do the job! But when that job becomes available, you don't have enough experience for them to give you the job!! JUST SAD!!!"
bad,"While I have a great direct manager ( there are 3) the Operations Management team and above are a nightmare. The work/life balance is horrendous. They switch people around to ""improve"" long hours but refuse to hire enough people to improve the situation. They believe in spread sheets and graphs which are spun to make numbers that make their ideas look good. To get promoted into management you have to be 35 or under and be either in the circle or family. The warehouse workers are treated like second class citizens even though they are the ones that produce the real work so the upper managers can get bonuses and all the accolades. The PTO and the people that work in the warehouse are the only things that gets one through the day. The training one has to complete online is massive and time consuming. They expect you to complete it at home because if you are late finishing it you are penalized at review time. This along with other tasks they want you to complete on your time without pay. The job can be a good spring board to another company with the experience you can gain. Too bad the ""home office"" turns a blind eye to what is happening at one of their warehouses because this could be one of the best jobs for someone that doesn't mind a little hard work."
bad,"No les importa la vida que tengas siempre quieren que trabajes todos los sábados, no son responsables con sus empleados. No ofrecen buenos beneficios  y la paga es mala."
bad,"When they first hire you they’ll tell you the shift goes from 12:30 to 9:00 but in two years I think I’ve only gotten off at/or before 9:00 about 5 times. Morning shift works about 40-42 hours a week while nights works between 50-62 hours a week all of which is mandatory. Most new people don’t last longer than a month due to the workload, we have now gone through about 45 new guys in about 4 years in our shift alone, 26 of which were in the last 2 years. Mind you that might not seem like a lot but considering our shift is only made of 8 people (currently at 5 because of shortages of workers). They are currently limping on temporary work agency workers but we get about two or three new ones every other week, we might be in our 15th temp as of now. Management is clueless, and it’s made up mostly of old college and work buddies show brought each other on, our HR and manager are family as are our Ops supervisor and day shift supervisor who are brother/sister so nepotism is big here at this facility. Benefits are solid as are the PTO (if you can get it approved) you get 21 days of it but most on nights have to ‘give up’ about 3-5 days due to lack of personal, which is lost since the company has a “use it or lose” it policy. Checks are pretty good after 115+hrs EVERY pay period, but most of the time the company that does payroll “assumes” you will only work 80~ hrs so your check will be short about 20-30 hours which don’t get paid until the NEXT check and so on for the next check and so on, so yes getting paid for your work IS a struggle in itself. Overall great place to work if you"
bad,"Very negative workplace culture."
bad,"Exempt and non-exempt employees treated differently; non-exempt looked down upon.  HUGE issue with favoritism.  If you are not liked by management, they won't consider you for advancement and try to push you out by treating you as if you are something on the bottom of their shoes.  No job security unless you are exempt status and management likes you."
bad,"Senior Management do not change with the times. They are not proactive to coming mergers of purchasing groups and are reactive to increasing competition. Being an American Company, working in the Canadian branch is a systems nightmare. Utilize an ancient JDE system to manage day to day operations, with no change in sight. The Canadian Branch looks to be bleeding out and people are leaving on a weekly basis. The future looks bleak at Cardinal Health Canada"
bad,"Highly stressful, and non-engaging management staff. It felt like what I imagine a modern day plantation might feel like. This was a very suffocating place to be."
bad,There are no work life balance. management is poor and there are no room for growth. Since my time there i have had 3 managers and it has been a revolving door.
bad,"cut throat environment, never enough, poor management that never sold a day in their lives."
bad,"There were positions, but no definable job descriptions. Positions only existed so that employees could be slotted into a pay category. Annual reviews were nothing more than a formality. If you had high rating, or low ratings, the annual salary increase was exactly the same. Outside people selected for management positions that they were not qualified for. Most employees spend much time training their leaders, instead of being empowered by them."
bad,"Not a good place to work for.Supervisors are not trained properly and need to treat the employees with more respect.They expect a lot of there employees,but there are no promotions for going beyond what is expected of you."
bad,"unnecessary internal politics, favoritism and discrimination. if yourself into the warehouse high expectation of getting promoted for get it . They only care about themselves and cronies"
bad,"- Typical Day , Going in to Deliver medical supplies to hospital units , I gained a lot of warehouse experience , management was indecisive and stood on there opinion , co - workers were in their own personal groups , the hardest part of the job was working 6 to 7 days a week and being forced to stay over time , the most enjoyable time was when my work was complete."
bad,Not flexible with family time. Constant passive threats from management that you can and will be fired for various reasons. Constant system crashes and upgrades that force double work loads and irate customers.  Working with customers is enjoyable as you are fixing orders and setting up special deliveries and courier orders.
bad,Warehouse associate groveport Ohio. They will work you to death if you allow them to. Just a sweatshop. Nothing matters but production . They don t care about the well being of employees at all. On week end shift you can t leave unless the job is done.Your shift is supposed to be a 12 hr shift but you end up working 13 to 14 hours.
bad,"This company terminated me due to a personal injury. They deemed I was off work too long to recover from it. I enjoyed my job, but pressure was put on employees to have the product delivered by a certain time, regardless to traffic or weather conditions."
bad,Senior Leadership promotes based on who you know not what you know
bad,My experience at Cardinal Health was terrible. The management treated new employees like they did not belong.
bad,"The warehouse supervisor is terrible, he is so indecisive and steadily repeats himself after he told you an task to do;he watches over you like often."
bad,"Very good if you enjoy the corporate lifestyle and are an up and comer. Best if you are young and can live the job, otherwise burns you out. Management is very impersonal, everyone is just a number, everyone is replaceable. Best advice for this company is to always CYA."
bad,"Don't like the company you can't have a life. I don't think you get paid enough for the work you do, you work 12+ hour every day with only a 30 minute lunch."
bad,"Nepotism, bad management, catering to the most toxic and laziest employees. Cannot advance in the company unless you know someone. Hard work will only lead to more hard work while others get to slack off more and more. Supervisor doesn't care nor do their job, but just stay on personal calls all day and try to punish the productive workers. Pay is seven, but there is no work to life balance whatsoever. An extremely hostile workplace!"
bad,"Been at this company a while as a software developer. Managers are slave drivers and expect too much from development teams. IT org is bulky and can't decide on a strategy. My director regularly berates the team for how bad we are at our jobs (we're not, and she wouldn't know if we were because she's never around). I wanted to like this company. I hate my job every day."
bad,Didn't like the culture the company. It was nice working remote. Lots of opportunity for learning new parts of the business. Downside is no growth opportunity for remote employee.
bad,The location and work environment is nice and people are knowledgable.  There is a good work/ life balance and prefer not to review further at this time.
bad,The amount of disrespect from the supervisors and managers is appalling. There is sexism and racism that is swept under the rug. If you try to call the AAC or conduct line they tell your boss and then you are subject to retaliation. Almost no promotion from within and when they hire from outside those quit within months. The turnover rate is ridiculous and there is minimal work/life balance.
bad,"Mandatory overtime which is 2 to 4 hours every single night. Work 5 days a week. Management wants more and more from you each and every day. Work at least 105 hrs every two weeks. Raises are only 3% of your pay, which are very hard to get. Workers have gone year's without receiving a raise due to their high expectations. Believe they don't like to give raises because of all the overtime pay that they pay out"
bad,"Diversity and inclusion is being worked on. WFH life balance out side of a leadership position. "
bad,Extremly bad management. Does not apreciate employees time and effort. If your not need it any more they will find a way to get you terminated from your assigment. HR does not help employes they will not offer help at all and will rather let go people that have been working there for years.
bad,"I personally liked the fact that you could EASILY get 60 hours a week at work! BUT the job is VERY BORING, and it REALLY MADE ME MISS UNIONS! ""WHY"" Because this whole job and what specifically you do is given on  favoritism! I felt like I was going to get fired EVERY single day! This is literally the worst job ever ans havw had some bad ones!"
bad,"The Actual Job it's self is fine, not too hard. But getting supplies like scissors and razor blades and more than one day off a week is impossible. You are scheduled to work every day(12hr) but one, you will have to ask for your day off on your day off. If you call in, you lose 12 hours PTO(they seem to try and burn your PTO up). My main tool was scissors which go dull after about 3 months as you are cutting cotton all the time, took me a year to get a new pair. It seems the management pitts Crew against Crew which lowers production, I have seen one crew sabotage a machine for the next crew just to make themselves look better. And HR is non existent."
bad,"Bad management, and poor pay for the position I had as a nuclear medicine driver. For a fortune 500 company, the structure of the nuclear medicine side be ran a lot better to reflect this."
bad,Cardinal continues to morph through many acquisitions with lack of clear execution plans.  The culture continues to decline as people are fearful of their place within the organization.
bad,"Supervisors/management shows favoritism publicly and you will notice within a short amount of time, little pay for such hard work, no medical benefits for part-timers, MISCOMMUNICATIONS 24/7, unfair annual/quarterly one-on-one reviews, management/leads dont do their jobs and are no help most of the time, all the work is dropped on associates shoulders, Associates know more about the job than management, Office people are a bit snobby, Associates have monthly ""classwork/homework"" at work, you do one thing wrong, you are held accountable, they want you to give more than 100% of your effort in order for you to get a raise, productivity is measured unfairly, you get injured at work then it is counted against you on your review, people come and go due to management and the work, you request for pto, you can get refused for unknown reasons even if you ask the supervisors why, you and other associates will always have to be trained on something, If you dont do your job, other associates will call you out, you have to understand and apply LSS to do your job correctly, annual meetings with people from other districts come and asks associates questions about their job (kind of like a job interview that your district is being graded on based on how much you know about the job and the warehouse and apply LSS into it), no matter how hard you work, there is no recognition,  if you are new, management will only like you for a short period of time, after a few months, they dont even care about you."
bad,The hardest part of the job was literally spending the entire day on the phone with independent pharmacies.  I was/am much more used to talking to people face to face so being on the phone was definitely a challenge.
bad,You have to work very hard.  Typically you stand on your feet 10 hours a day or more. The company does not allow breaks.  Employees are treated like unwelcome house guests. The facility is not safe. Many accidents and it is located in a area with high crime.  There have been a lot of car break-ins lately.
bad,We saw in this workplace a lot of regulatory and documentation process for all of the duties to perform a job.  In Puerto Rico this company doesn't promote a employee to high level or promote to a other position. They don't consider the constant preparation of the employee to performed the company human resources.
bad,Air conditioned and climate controlled warehouse which is great when it's hot and okay when it's cold.  This place has old powered equipment that is slow. Good luck
bad,"New employees (management) are required to figure processes / procedures out on their own; however, I learned a great deal about their products and services offered through research and client visits and business reviews. "
bad,"If looking for a career in Cardinal Health, stick to the corporate office located in Dublin. Cardinal Health has acquired many other companies over the years and the positive company culture did not transcend to the Twinsburg location."
bad,no matter how hard you work as dock associate it doesn't pay off someone always thinks they are better and no one shows any type of respect. everyone is always saying you're bullsh*tting when you're working just as hard.
bad,The account manager position is a joke. It is a telemarketing job. There is no clear compensation plan and you are not allowed to have it in writing. Turnover is extremely high. There really only about 3-5 reps that actually generate commission.
bad,Very silo'ed work enviornment where departments were not willing to work with each other.   There were good people within departments that were willing to work with each other.
bad,New leadership took over in September of 2015. Cardinal also acquired a brand from the Johnson & Johnson company. That new department is all about promoting their own people and people who've been with the company for a while don't stand a chance now.
bad,Known for non diverse corporate culture. Some areas a bit too casual allowing intolerant attitudes to openly pervade workplace. Benefits were drastically cut couple years ago and many workers still vocally complain about that.
bad,Working on a daily basis with the engineering department in a fast-paced company for the service of remanufactured electronic satellite equipment.
bad,"The job is okay. It is stable if that's what you are looking for. However, management does what they want to. There isn't a lot of room for development or ways to move up in the company. They claim to be a Lean Six Sigma company but my particular DC has lost this focus. The hours are not consistent. You work until the job is done. Success each night is contingent on how the senior management forecasts. Typically overtime is required."
bad,"Loved what we did at this company, but Management handled certain matters inappropiately"
bad,Salary is fair but job environment is horrible. It’s not what you know it’s who you know. Most of the people who are in management don’t know ANYTHING. Certain queues are not meant for customer service (56). Calls are non stop. Honestly it’s more work than money. Most people have more than 20 minutes commute. Everybody in the job is basically test dummies.
bad,"No one is replaced, the remaining employees are expected to accept the extra workload ALL within the 8hr  day, 40hr work week, NO OVERTIME "
bad,Facility managers and operations manager showed favoritism to certa3 employees.  Company can get rid of you for anything with no just cause. Biggest concern is no HR representation on site.
bad,"If you are not a kiss-up to management you are not going anywhere.  Never talk back to them or report a bully.  That will cause your exit.  It's a buddy culture and not an honest earned position.  It's like government.  Family, friends, and hispanics first."
bad,"management is really bad. if you like your position there, they will take it from you. if you get close to production, they raise it, so you cant hit it."
bad,"The work here is very hard and extremely repetitive. The training is terrible. Opportunity to gain a full time contract is low unless you lick up to management. Management are liars and will tell you what you want to hear. Pay is decent, it's warm and comfortable but hard to find anymore positives. Breaks are short and you will be worked to the bone. Emigrate or go back to college, do not work here unless you absolutely have to. Oh and temporary staff are looked down on and also not allowed to purchase radio headsets. Good canteen and early finish on a Friday."
bad,"The job itself is okay. The benefits are great but the fact that you are working ""until the job is done"" is ridiculous. Work up to 12 and a half hours. The expectation to hit the high production numbers everyday every hour and continue to work almost 12 and half hours is exhausting. The work slows down after January but picks up quickly during July toward the winter. It has gotten to the point where in order to leave in 8 hours you have to the hit high production numbers. Despite hitting the numbers you are still criticized for cleaning up your station 15 minutes prior as this should be normal to do so. You are still expected to continue working until 6:30. Little to no AC and have seen employees pass out including almost myself due to the heat. This job is perfect for someone who is struggling financially that needs long hours and has nothing but bills to pay. If you have plans on going to school then you are out of luck as you have NO TIME to go to class nor time to eat dinner or do personal tasks. The pay and benefits are decent but due to the long hours and expectations aside from not having a personal life does not justify. There is no official training and learn most on your own. Not even the trainer can hit the expected production. How are new hires able to succeed when the Training/Trainer is not knowledgeable or able to hit the goals? I can recall 2 Supervisors being professional and concerning toward employees but the rest of the management has no knowledge in the function of their departments and lack social skills. The representative in the office has an attitude."
bad,"When I started, Cardinal had purchased Medtronic about a year earlier. They were still in transition and I was told they were about to ramp up production to 24/7. Within eight months that plan was scrapped and they were sending people home regularly with no explanation or plan about what they were going to do with our department. Our direct supervisors had no idea and the plant manager would just deflect. A few weeks after I left, the plant manager was reassigned to somewhere in Florida and most the people I had worked with, (including a handful that had been there 20 years or more) were leaving in droves."
bad,management has no consideration for its employees when it comes to their health or home life. very demanding that you do jobs that are not signed off on and don't commutated  what they want and won't listen to why things don't work the way they want to do things
bad,"no time for life outside of this place and you have to kiss up to management to even have a chance to move up. The management just sends you around in circles and when you ask a question, almost nobody wants to teach you or help."
bad,Supervisor are the worst at cardinal they do not take care of their employees always finding ways to make employees quit lack of support .The only positive side of its that they offer a phenomenal 23 days of PTO
bad,"Management needs replaced.   Back stabbing game that supervisors directors play on their employees.   Placing employees in jobs they were not hired for.  Moving employees with no experience in jobs they were not hired for.   Human Resources needs to investigate all departments.   Favoritism, goofing off is what the directors and supervisors do on a daily basis.   Makes fun and picks on certain employees."
bad,"A typical day at cardinal, you start off in a huddle. You stretch for the day then the supervisor will let you know what is instore for the day. Then you go on to your work area."
bad,"I worked in the IT department of this company for 5 years. The pace was frantic constantly and I spent most of the day in meetings which forced me to either work into the evening to catch up, or work during the meetings and not pay attention."
bad,"No advancement. Incredibly poor work/life balance. Stagnant pay. Little accountability. No concern for employees - lip service only. Morale has been declining for years, even back to the Covidien days."
bad,My position was eliminated despite high performance of sales numbers. There was a restructuring due to acquisition and both companies had to accept a 10% reduction in force
bad,Fortune 500 company that is ran in a clique type atmosphere. Very little job advancement for knowledgeable people who excel at their position. No diversity evident outside of some women in selected positions. Little to no minorities in middle management or higher positions within the division. The management does not value the work of employees and will not aid eligible in career advancement.
bad,Would not recommend to anyone treat employees badly management only looks out for themselves. Worked through lunch a few times and they would still clock me out and take their money for a lunch. Got wrote up for being told we were not hiring no more people and said the job is going to be harder now.
bad,I would not go back to this job. The chance for advancement  was slim unless you were in the right crowd. I felt over worked and under paid. I did not enjoy my time here at all .
bad,Cardinal Health is an okay place to work. No chance for advancement. really needs better management. You get a raise every year but don't expect too much.
bad,It's was a very easy job but nurses  was rude mangers did not back employees up the pay bad wish I stayed with henry ford health system they paid well good benefits fun environment  with plenty of friendly people
bad,"The benefits were good for a company that has over 200 employees, but the downfall there was no job opportunity to grow within the company. You couldn't grow."
bad,"Cardinal Health will work you like a Hebrew Slave and make you like it! Also, Management has no compassion and they don't care if you are pregnant or if you just came back from major surgury. They will still work you like a Hebrew Slave!"
bad,"Low pay, unorganized with communication. PTO and benefits are good. There is no work/life balance, you never know when your work day is over. Very high favoritism throughout the building"
bad,"Company is loosing their core values,  and business.   Management has too many meetings,  confuses lip service to lower paygrade associates as praise.   "
bad,"Pay is terrible compared to local companies in the same industry, people keep quitting to make about 30% more than the same job at cardinal."
bad,"Management doesn't know how to resolve issues in company.  All about the numbers with no care or acknowledgment of employees."
bad,"Extremely poor work/life balance, exacerbated by numerous changes in ownership.  Good place to get some broad experience."
bad,"If you are right out of college this is the company for you.  But if you have any sales experience like 10-15 years stay away!!!  Mgmt. is mediocre at best but this company is more about training on products than on selling.  If you like meetings and doing nothing else, this is your company!  Between the in-house vendor meetings and weekly sales calls with the outside/inside for your region, I do not know how anyone can get anything done.  Uses salesforce.com but only for contact management.  They have not done anything to implement reporting from SF into anything else.  Overall, if your out of college you can learn a ton and it's not bad pay ($50k) for right out of school.  But if you are seasoned veteran salesperson with experience it is tough to dummy-down to a slower pace."
bad,"My experience at Cardinal Health seemed to have the potential to be good, but the way the company was run by our supervisors were horrible.Don't get me wrong, the money was good, and the benefits excellent but when you work in an environment when personal feelings are brought to the establishment, then you will not have a positive and productive, or stable work establishment. The co-workers were beyond excellent but could of worked harder to get rid of the management that was responsible for just doing nothing, yet they still maintained employment there."
bad,"Great company to work for at first, but then regional realignments cost me business base I had worked for during previous years.  Went from first place director to a lower level due to losing accounts I had been working on (someone else got credit).  Compounding to their realignment, company did not exhibit proper compassion after serious health issues effected my job performance."
bad,"Altogether, Cardinal is a great company to work for but you have to get out of the Sherwood facility to experience the benefits. There is no growth in Sherwood and not many people to help you get to where you want to go. It was a dead end street. I learned that its about who LIKES you and not what you can provide to the company (in that building) and it also depends on who you work under. People there don't want to see you excel over them. My co workers were great and very optimistic and that kept us positive, daily. The workload was horrible and no one cared to do anything to adjust and make it more about quality rather than quantity."
bad,"My sons daycare provider let me know that they were not happy about him being there for 18 hours. Brought it to managements attention and they just shrugged it off and said ""What do you want me to do about it?' I got to eat 1 time a day in a 12-16 hour a day non stop labor job."
bad,"You can work 8 hours a day on day shift or 10-12 on Nights, a very unbalanced work load. Co workers at the production level are easy to get along with, as long as you are used to a high school setting. There are Clicks of different groups. Management is not very good, they lack the experience and understanding of how to run a distribution warehouse. Hardest part of the job is to get someone to listen to you, enjoyable part was leaving."
bad,"my personal experience, excessive corporate micromanagement, total lack of front line management when needed."
bad,"This company has taken away all benefits of working for them. PTO time was cut drastically across the board for all that work 7on/7off to a measly 80 hours with no carryover, no cash out, and NO chance to ever gain anymore by staying with the company. At the same time retention bonuses were also cut. So now they have provided no reason to stay with the company and gain seniority because there is no such thing. The management does not answer any questions and handled the cuts in a poor manner (by calling a reading an email over the phone to the employees on speaker phone...). I am very shocked at the lack of care this company gives to their employees in the remote order entry department. Also don't plan on climbing the ladder in this company because they will just deem your position no longer needed and let you go. I would definitely not recommend this job to any respectable pharmacist or pharmacy tech."
bad,"Cardinal Health in theory could be a great place to work. The individual centers lack the structure necessary to be inclusive to all demographics of life. While the company is inclusive to the LGBT community it excludes African- American males from specific segments or roles in the company. Granted headquarters is an entirely different atmosphere, the culture created in the service center discourages individual growth. Majority of the management team members are inadequate and limited an their ability to see beyond their nose."
bad,A work environment where you are there all day and you basically sleep and work. I learned the process of LSS and how to reduce wasted time during processes. Management were all young and wanted to make a name for themselves so they threw authority around to make examples out of everyone. Hardest part of the job was being there until 2 and 3 AM in the mornings. There really wasn't an enjoyable part of the job.
bad,no room for advancement the starting paying is 11.50 with little raise and has a difficult standards to meet
bad,The supervision is horrible. They have some sort of 'fear of god' mentality. They act like they are humanly superior and you are an inferior species. The corporate headquarters should look at the PET drug manufacturing sites because they have no clue what goes on there.
bad,"I really enjoyed my job at Cardinal Health. The job is not hard, it gave me a real sense of pride being able to not only help the customer on the phone but helping the patient laying in the hospital bed as well. Most of the people are easy to get along with. There were several things that the company itself could've changed to make it more employee-friendly. The insurance is awesome and the vacation time is great."
bad,"Manager is not fair. We have two teams that comes in one hour before and after another they get a dollar more and we all help each other first team can not leave until the second team is almost done you never know what time you are going to get off, not fair at all."
bad,"Unless you can work by yourself and figure things out on your own, don’t apply here. Asked supervisor multiple times to help and they acted like they had no idea what I was asking. Also, they move you around to different shifts or crews to train but barely give you any time to adjust to a different schedule. ex, (Nights to Days, Days to Nights)"
bad,This company has a mixed bag of jobs to learn and perform. Personnel are given limited supervision to perform the daily task in an eight hour day  of their department that you work in.
bad,"When starting, the mangers and supervisors made it seem as though overtime was not as common as it truly is. Work weeks are often 55+ hours long. Some of the supervisors are also rather rude and not understanding to things like workplace injuries."
bad,advancement is almost nothing with position and salary. no incentive for advancement. salary offers are ranging between .05-.20 annually. basically almost no light at the end of the tunnel
bad,First off let me say the job pays good with benefits. But the management on down are unfair for the most part. You have one or two that you can talk to and reason with but overall it's not good. Too much turnover which leads to long work nights cause they're short of staff. It's like people don't get suspended for minor infractions they just get shown the door. I understand the point system they have but they should have some disgression in some cases with the point system. It's just too strict and leads to good workers being let go when in some cases they could've fought to keep them or work with them with their issues first. Ignore the 2pm - 10pm  as it's rarely occurs. U will get off at different times depending of the work load and staff. Some nights getting off at 12 or later then others get off around 10:30. Just be prepared to work more than 8 hours daily.
bad,"work day starts at 6pm and runs until 5 a.m most times later."
bad,"I worked as a contractor in an Accounting department 2 times. Everything went very well on my first assignment and I really enjoyed my job: friendly and helpful people, great teamwork support and a respectful manager. But unfortunately, the manager was changed when I received the second assignment. The whole team complained to HR  about the new manager; about his rudeness, talking about people behind their back, lack of knowledge and harassment, but nothing changed. When my supervisor went on medical leave he used it to finish my assignment without notice because I accused him of harassment. Though on paper it was like finishing my assignment, he behaved like I was fired: threatened to call the police when I asked to take my belongings, then did not return all of them at one time, and read my personal information on my flash drive. I believe that the HR department does not do their job and does not protect employees from a manager's harassments at Cardinal Health."
bad,If cardinal health had better hours for they employees people would be happier and want to go to work everyday the is not hard but the hour are much..
bad,i was only a temp employee and hired by Adecco to support Cardinal Health for Alaris products for repair and recalls. I had no great memories from this company.
bad,"The company draws you in with good benefits and a 15.00 an hour starting salary + .75 shift diff for second shift, amd that there’s OT but what they don’t tell you is how much OT. Most days you’re here from 2pm until about 3am -4am (5 or 6am if you’re sent to assist on the shipping docks. It’s very corrupt as management plays favorites with their buddies who are also workers, if you have any concerns you’re told to get over it and “don’t get bent out of shape” you’re co workers are all mostly cool people but it’s managemt and supervisors who make this job a terrible experience. Fat pay checks but at the cost of any life outside of work. Most employees only stay a couple months at most, you may only know someone for a couple weeks here before they leave. VERY HIGH TURNOVER. Constant hiring, begging for new employees, and the company is set to pickup a new contract later this year which will increase the workload more than it already is. Collapsing facility."
bad,"This company is an important part of our local economy.  They hire a lot of generational people here.  Your co-worker probably will have lunch with their uncle, aunt , cousin, father, grandmother, pregnant girlfriend, wife,or daughter.  It is a web of familiarity that is cozy, like a family reunion and high school reunion rolled into one.  Mind your own business, listen to the gossip, and do your job.  Just like anywhere.    The company will train you, so take advantage of that."
bad,"They makes you work more than your earning. The facility has a poor management, putting all the Blame on the employees.I think The company fit more to those close to their retirement because of their good benefit."
bad,"would start at 4 am, and organize pallets and boxes that i would need for that day to do my job, loading and unloading my cart, inventory daily to provide enough supplies"
bad,did the same thing every day at the same time and wore me out mentally. i felt like no matter how hard i worked it didn't make a difference because some of the people worked there on such a slow place i quit caring.
bad,"The people you work with are fine once you get to know them but most everyone thinks local management is out-of-touch and non-responsive. Maybe that changes as CH integrates the facility into their company culture (plant was just purchased mid-2017) but local management has been there for quite awhile and while there are new signs showing and describing CH's corporate culture, the plant seems to be run as a ""satellite facility"" as in not much interaction with corporate representatives so the place seems to be run as the long-term, entrenched, local management sees fit.  Experience is good to have but also leads to stale, old-style thinking and ideas."
bad,"Cardinal Health is a very large corporation that has all of the pro's and con's associated with a large corporation. Lots of job openings and opportunities, lots of poor management decisions."
bad,The work environment over at Cardinal Health where I used to work was pretty horrible. There were a lot of favoritism in the company and lack of management. Management stated that your voice matters but when you explain a point  they do not try and put into consideration and I didn't like that.
bad,"Mediocre leadership promotes mediocre leadership (vicious cycle) leading to poor culture and lack of critical thinking. Management believes that those not in management should not think or make decisions. The company is ranked as female friendly however that is only because of historical female functions such as marketing, human resources, and account management. Finance, information technology and other technical fields are not female friendly in terms of compensation, evaluation, and growth opportunities. I was recently told that my collaborative style indicated I was too friendly and not demonstrating leadership despite exceeding deliverables, timelines, and success metrics."
bad,"-Very fast paced environment"
bad,this job came through a temporary agency and even though I was told it was permanent full time it turned into part time hours and only 2 or 3 days a week and then our temp agency  lost the contract with the company and we were out of jobs
bad,"There is a lot of days where the job consistently gave little to no break during the shift .  As far as management goes, It seemed to me they were careless when it came to looking for the right candidate for the job."
bad,"Great Company to work for...stressful at times due to a change in management...not as family oriented as it used to be ,...again due to the change in management..."
bad,"At Cardinal Health, you will find that there is a lack of a company backbone. every single supervisor goes over each others head, and no one can give a clear answer. If you do not stay in the ""good graces"" of a supervisor, prepare to have a rough road ahead of you. LONG hours, and constant invasion of privacy, i.e. you cant go to the bathroom without someone keeping a timer on you. overall if you just wish to work the rest of your life, by all means enjoy this company."
bad,"When I was there, things were fair. Some of the managers left a lot to be desired but I've been told things have changed so hopefully it was changed for the better."
bad,They could treat there workers a lot better and give better benefits for the temps it’s a competitive position and very stressful and getting appreciated in this company is very hard
bad,"more time spent on the process than the results. Leadership was not particularly interested in development, only its own self-interest. When spun off to CareFusion, things were better in terms of culture, though the organization had significant deficiencies in accounting, often resulting in underpayment and lack of recognition for earned results. Once acquired by BD, things went from bad to worse...horrible actually. It is incredible that BD has lasted over a 120 year with the poor leadership, nepotism, underpaying, under-valuing of employees. I would not recommend it to anyone looking for employment."
bad,KMC is the company I worked for until Cardinal Health took over. KMC made medication machine dispensers for the prison and nursing homes. Cardinal Health bought KMC and moved the fabrication out of USA
bad,"Fast paced environment, knowledgeable and dedicated employees"
bad,I felt i had no real chance for advancement. Even though they claim that they promote from within they would hire outside people with no relevant knowledge of the industry to do jobs that other people were better equipped to do.
bad,"This was one of first jobs out of High School, and it was good for the most part, but I don't know enough to give it a proper review it's been so long."
bad,Very little to no cooperation or communication between departments. Each division is only concerned about their own operations and never take into account how their actions affect the other divisions.
bad,"The Distribution part of the organization has high expectations from Lean Six Sigma.  It seems like it would work better in a manufacturing organization. In distribution there is a lot of variation and that does not fit a standard work model very well.  It seems like they are trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.  LSS Projects are frequently run to produce cost savings, but changes are rarely sustained and often changes are made before it is known if the outcome is really any better than the current process.  At that point, savings are expected, but not realized."
bad,"Cardinal had good insurance,401k plan ,stock, good attendance programs. managers were not very good. Good hours, asked me to be doing to much work"
bad,"Good benefits, interesting work. Co-workers are great and really want to help the customer.  Difficult to advance, only a select few are chosen to be included in the leadership development programs."
bad,The worse place someone would want to work. Ready to jump and beat you down. Pay is terrible. Hours are bad no family life balance. The vericles are always in need of service..
bad,"Terrible work place / life balance. Family came last. Perception is reality, employees with poor work ethics are rewarded as long as they make sure that they talk the talk and walk the walk."
bad,I don't recommend this job to a person who is working paycheck to pay.check.  Its a temporary job for sure. Don't work for this company unless you live close and your not depending on it.
bad,I really enjoyed this position I really liked working here a lot I was able to meet a lot of friendly people the turn around rate was really slow.
bad,I only worked for Cardinal Health through the transitional period after the purchase of F.Dohmen pharmaceutical.  Dohmen was a great place to work where I started in AP and transferred to AR.  I did the billing for customers and researched any problems that came up.  the company had a family type atmosphere that made it enjoyable to work there.
bad,Not a bad place to work if you don't mind dedicating your entire life to your job. Very poor home life/work balance. Very demanding as far as making them your main priority. Work isn't hard. Co-workers are very nice. Don't expect to stay long-term as they are going to a completely part time basis.
bad,"This was a great job with plent of room "
bad,"Site-level leadership is very poor. Clueless sycophants have been promoted to levels where they severely negatively impact the operations of the NLC. Work-to-task means 10-hour shifts become 12-13 hour shifts, due to incompetence of on-site managers and supervisors."
bad,it could've been a good job if the starting salary was more and sometimes the people were sarcastic and tend to come as racist.
bad,The job itself is good but the workers and supervisors have to personally like you in order for you to get ahead. I am also on a contract and they keep extending it instead of converting me to full time without a valid reason
bad,A large company with plenty of potential.  A lack of uniform direction leads to confusing or conflicting job assignments.  Hard to get excited about work while sitting in the breakroom for hours.
bad,"Pros: ok pay with oppurtunity for lots of overtime"
bad,Starting pay is ok but getting a decent raise in unheard of. They pile so much work on you until you're stresses out. You will not be compensated fairly for the extra work you receive.
bad,"This is no daily operations implemented, "
bad,"Call center for pharmacy orders."
bad,Job was good stayed busy Learned to work as a team turn over too high fo management and co workers not stable
bad,"I would not reccomend this company at all.  The hours are very long, there is no training progam, the management doesnt support its supervisor.  Co workers are okay to work with.  The hardest part of the job is the 16 to 17 hours.  Nothing is enjoyable."
bad,Great company to work for. Nationwide company. Room for growth. Learn  new computer systems daily.
bad,"Most enjoyable parts were my coworkers, I gained so much knowledge from my boss. I also enjoyed our regional meetings. We were always treated very well at the meetings. We went to see a show in NY, went out for nice dinners, and stayed in beautiful hotels. The rest of management was not truthful and taking actions which were against our code of conduct. This was one of the main reasons I left."
bad,"I left Cardinal Health for personal reasons, I will never go back there. The people there where very rude and hard to work with."
bad,This company will buy out other company's and hire you for the time only they need you till and then sell the company again or downsize the parts they do not need.
bad,"Very fast paced environment with little time to talk, relax or train. It was not for me. Co-workers were illeterate and unwelcoming."
bad,"I enjoyed my co workers, great benifits. Management needs lots of work. If the management team likes you.. you get to advance,,it doesn't matter how well you work. ITs very clickish. HR is terrible."
bad,"I worked for Cardinal Health for 11 years.  Initially, the leadership was great and helped expand our business model; however, in the past few years, the decision to bring in new leaders, with no experience in distribution, changed the culture and negatively impacted how Cardinal Health is viewed in the market.  Goals are challenging, and the lack of cohesion between business units put the company in a hole.  Very little lack of vision of how the market changes makes this company more reactive instead of proactive, which is different than competitors."
bad,"Clean work environment with good pay & benefits. Unfortunately no work/life balance, no development, high turnover and divide between 1st and off shifts"
bad,Started 6am to 1pm. After 7 years hours went from 3 am to when ever. Keep asking management for my regular hour but those hours were for there special people.
bad,"Some good people  some bad, overall it's a 7. Management not what you would expect it to be. One shift does a large amount of work and cant leave til it's done. Other shifts can leave and next shift completes work. To much complaining by workers who shouldn't be complaining. Focus to much on wrong things when it comes to work ethics. No advancement opportunities at all. Alot of decision are made but employees are not included on their decisions."
bad,"It started out good! But quotas that were impossible to make made people competitive, mean, stressful, and management didn't place people where best used!"
bad,The management didn’t read the application of the person who is applying. They just care of bright math expert. They dont follow the instructions of recruitment .  Power tripping!
bad,"N/A the work is average good breaks although ppl take longer then they should. Not much team work in order picking. Supervisor have favorites, let ppl sit in the office all day while other's work. Supervisor pick on the wrong ppl, , i seen ppl get hurt and the job basically kick them to the curve."
bad,The company has not figured out its identity. There are great people working really hard in an environment that can not see the effort being given. I had some great times and some really bad times while working there. The last 6 months were really bad.
bad,"Management is difficult. There is a lot of pressure for perfection. You will feel overworked immediately. Work from home but you drive all over Charlotte, Huntersville, and almost SC."
bad,Unsafe work place with poor training and a rude staff. They care more about their stupidly high quotas then the happiness of their employees. Constantly bothering the employees with problems that are often caused by their awful inventory system.
bad,a typical day at work is very stressful.  I have learned to be a very fast paced worker because you have to be here.  Management sucks because I don't think they care about their employees like they should and have us work in un-safe work conditions.  The hardest part of the job is that no matter how hard you work you will never be recognized for it.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that I work in the back of the plant where there is not a lot of people to bother me
bad,when I 1st started in 2001 it was for tyco/Kendall. The job was good and fair. since then we've been sold and bought 3 more times. and with each new company things have gotten worse. but now that cardinal health has taken over it's the worse it's ever been.
bad,Extremely long hours for both management and laborers. Labor hours don't seem to be a concern with 3-4 hours of OT required everyday without a plan to reduce them. Issues like this cause moral to be very low.
bad,"Work wasn't hard, but the hours and mandatory overtime will kill you. they expect you to work like a robot and never tire out. Management lacks, it seems as if the company doesn't care about you and your home life."
bad,"I was with RGH Enterprise a Subsidiary of Cardinal, was this acquisition took place, my opinion dramatically change."
bad,If you want life sucked out of you then this is the place to work at. very unprofessional. they don't care about no one but them self and keeping there job. Basically they have an experiment going on hiring and firing left and right. I was one of the ones that kept there job but ended up leaving because of poor management and horrible supervisors. very unfair work place.
bad,Unable to develop and mentor talent. Poor training program and employees are little more than statistics on a page.  Poor vision for future and lack of proactive planning.  Weak and ineffective human resources
bad,"my experience at Cardinal Health was very limited. Shortly after I was brought on, we were informed that all of our Accounts Payable positions were being off-shored to the Philippines or India within 3 months."
bad,started out good. then changed managers of the warehouse and company went down hill quickly. New Management had no idea how to run a company.  bad decisions left and right.
bad,Mother says if you have nothing good to say......So I will say nothing at all.  It is cut throat....Managers are allowed to play favors.  Horrible environment in specialty Rx - SONEXUS.  That is why the GM quit.
bad,"Daily work and tasks are fairly simple and to the point,  each day is rather repetitive. "
bad,"This company is ok to work for.  Strict hours and strict management.  Very little overtime, but can't leave until the work is done.  Hardest part is coming in at 4 am then leaving at 1230 pm."
bad,If you have no family or friends and no life this job is perfect for you. The only reason to work in a warehouse position here is if you have little to no education and enjoy overtime pay.
bad,"Excellent starting point for enhancing leadership skills.  "
bad,"The best part about this place is personal time off,we've worked any where from 12 to 15 hr days and didnt get another break most days after our 3rd. The management team suck balls and forget it if you like to voice your opinion especially if you are smarter than the bosses,its a good way to get thrown under the bus"
bad,the turnover we have had the last 3years really makes it hard to want to stay working here. we do have great pto to start. but the pay and our raises are very poor.
bad,A typical day involved training new hires while helping create the materials needed for the next day activities and staying late to print and test activities. I learned to work quickly. Management was not supportive and very demanding. My co-workers were hard working and supportive. The hardest part of the job was having a work week under 60hrs. The best part of the job were the trainees and the energy they gave back to me to continue the job.
bad,"The people i worked with for the most part are decent people. They all work pretty hard and work as a team for the most part to get the job done in a timely manner. Leadership on the other hand, dose not listen to your concerns and could careless about, about trying to gain your trust."
bad,"Great benefits, little room for career advancement. Management lacks in conflict resolutions and plays favorites. Enjoyed my work."
bad,"Work environment had very limited communication with higher management. Confined to own department. Ideas to be reviewed, where often ignored."
bad,"A typical day is usually a mandatory 10-11 hour day with at most a 45 minute lunch. Usual functions are those of any distribution warehouse: preparing orders, shipping order, receiving product, etc. Due to mandatory overtime every day there is a negative pall surrounding the job every day. In addition, there is added stress due to strict shipping pickup times. While the business continues to grow and solidify job security, human resources can't keep enough people in the warehouses to accommodate the increase volume."
bad,"A typical day at cardinal on night shift is long. You never work an 8 hour shift. No one is happy there, everyone is exhausted and mad. The best part about the job is the pto. The hardest part is you are always tired and it feels like you have no time off. Also in the 3 years I have been there I have went through 2 lay offs. Also, if u want to work for this company you better like change. They are always trying to change how you do something which is frustrating when you are trying to make trucks."
bad,"Within the company, some chosen few are selected as ""on the fast track"". This is well known within the company. These people are elevated throughout the company with various positions of managing people. However, most of these ""managers"" do not understand the department they are managing, because they go from department to department. At first, everything is OK, but as they begin to make decisions on their own, they make poor decisions because they are not in their role long enough to make wise decisions. They always want to put their ""stamp"" on something, so they make changes just for the sake of making changes, and not to improve a process or productivity. The turnover is also very high in this company. They are not afraid to let people go, or have annual reorganization processes."
bad,Not much to say here. Shifts changed frequently. Work-life balance was not important.Two or three loud employees were able to influence management - good or bad.
bad,"A typical day at work: maintain customer's portfolios. Make calls on delinquent accounts to get insight of the possible problems. Management here stinks, because of all the micro-management that goes on. Co-workers are the best. The hardest past of my job is working twice as hard so, i would not make mistakes. The most enjoyable is developing a relationship with customers based on their needs."
bad,Turnover rate is very high. People quit and are rarely replaced. Management is incompetent. They expect less people to be able to do more work. PTO is a joke. It's almost impossible to get vacation days approved yet if you are denied and have to call in you are harshly criticized for doing so because you have an abundance of vacation days.
bad,"Company says one thing and does another. Pretends to listen, but no much follow through increasing the difficulty in obtaining and retaining business. Long hours without the pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was the day I left."
bad,This is a very lean organization with little opportunity for advancement. Fast paced environment with high work demand that makes it very difficult for employees to balance work and life. CEO is very solid and has lead the company to a better fiscal position. Still tends to focus on what gets accomplished vs how things are accomplished. Some teams still foster a very cut-throat culture and rewards those behaviors.
bad,A very fast paced work environment commited to be the best in pharmaceutical and over the counter products.
bad,They provided no clear on boarding or objectives to be allowed to thrive.  Leadership has a lack of vision casing increased cost to process management
bad,The work there is not difficult at all its just the work environment is a hostile. Not much diversity there and some of the people there were racist and got away with things.
bad,Mainly a Call Center which assists patients with getting their medication for a specific chronic illness.  Great new employee training.  Lots of hidden tasks that are a surprise to you once you start on the floor.  Favoritism is evident.
bad,"The job had long hours I work 7 days a week , a lack of communication and leadership played a major roll in me finding something else.I'm trying to better myself and further my career in a more stable environment."
bad,"You never have anything outside of work often working until midnight or later and weekends.  No work life balance at all.  Also, do not pay incentive when they should. You have to check your sales sheets to make sure your incentive is correct and 90% of the time it is not.  Very stressful when you make your numbers and do not get paid."
bad,"Only good thing about the job is the pay, benefits few good employees. If you looking for a team and positive work atmosphere don't apply. They don't train you  Properly and tryin to learn new things are confusing very disorganized hrs are horrible most people work 10+ hrs days and look like zombies from all the workload. QIC department is not as bad but still not a team atmosphere or positive vibes. Best advice if you need experience in warehouse stay for a bit but I wouldnt recommend making it a long term career."
bad,"Poor management hard to deal with a large amount of co workers felt like being in school."
bad,When I started there it was Sherwood medical than it changed hands about Three times before my leaving when I first worked there it was great place to work it Helene’s me raise my two kids at the time now it’s cardinal health I don’t have any good vibes about the place it was a place to just work at the management  had gotten poor
bad,it was ok to work for cardinal health but the paid was not enough for me. i need ed to get extra job to help me survive with all my bill. people are nice to work with.
bad,The environment and management was exceptional as well as the benefits. The issues that I had were low pay for the amount of work and radiation exposure. I started off at $10.93 per hour and received a total of $1.20 in raises in over 4 years of working there. As a driver you are required to help dispose of radioactive material and recycle the shielding used to transport them when you are at the headquarters. Drivers also package the radioactive material to be delivered once the doses are drawn by the pharmacists and techs. The other issue I had was late request for deliveries in which the late day shift person(s) would be responsible even if your schedule was almost up. At the time my daughter's were in day care and had to be picked up by a specific time which was not considered by the pharmacists and management at Cardinal health.
bad,"Organization financially incentivizes leadership to promote based on race, color and any other politically correct diversity label."
bad,"Work-life balance is a struggle for those with families, and most associates resign because of this. Most raises are restricted to 3% the first regardless of how well one performs. HR will almost always reduce someone from a 4 out of 5 to a 3 because it is believed everyone is a 3."
bad,"It was a fast paced job which was not a problem. However, it was a stressful job. Making sure totes were delivered correctly. If they weren’t, it was taken out of our own money."
bad,old computers and hardly working instrument's used to pick/pack. Management would rather install new bathrooms then supply employees with good equipment to work with! 7 paid sick days out of 365 is just ridiculous! Sudden and unavoidable things can happen and if you've used most of them because of inclement whether during beginning of year your screwed!
bad,"I currently work in the Cage/Vault and invoicing and like working with the people that's in there,Fastpaced and can be a productive place to work,lifting can be a hard part of the Job."
bad,"start afternoon shift at 1pm, and if you are full time you stay until the job is done. typically 11:30. the job is hourly. i learned how to ride a forklift. management was good, but the culture was nothing. no talking, no stopping, no music. work and in your head for minimum 8 hrs a day"
bad,"typical was finding out what station you started at and how the flow of the day was going."
bad,"The managers were terrible at organizing people, and had a horrible attitude. The hours were long, which wasn't good for people who couldn't handle being on their feet so long. Training was sparse, and you were told you'd be given raises for new departments you were trained in, but you never got those raises."
bad,Cardinal Health is a poor place to work for anyone who prefers something more interesting during the typical workday.  The management is poor and the job is mundane.
bad,Pay and benefits are great.    Circus-like atmosphere with lots of micromanaging.   Only the real brown-nosers seem to get ahead.  If you were an adult and like working on your own with other adults this company seriously is not for you.
bad,"4 10 hour shifts have become 4 12-15 hour shifts.  Your body starts breaking down after 10hrs.  People are barely walking when it's time to clock out. Benefits and 401K match are amazing and the pay is not bad if you can handle walking for 10 hours at day.  Expect to be home only to sleep during your work week. The 3 days off are a plus but you spend 2 of them resting your body for the next week.  If you are young , physically able to handle the stress on your body this is an excellent opportunity."
bad,Advancement is very difficult.  Career track is pre-selected by management team. Re-org galore...even though they continue to believe this is something employees should learn to adapt to...it is a poor method for retention and morale.
bad,"My individual boss is great but everyone else is a nightmare to work with. Last week I raised a safety concern and got told to ignore it by multiple people. They say they are big into no harassment but the amount of times a day I see it is ridiculous. That being said, the health insurance is very good and pay okay. We are supposed to have 4th of July off but they rather just pay us it and make us work. There are days I'm so over worked I have no time for lunch. But most people put on a I don't care attitude and don't do anything all day and get away with it."
bad,"The job on a daily basis is a very high tempo job, safety is paramount, and accuracy is a must o ensure client safety in their orders."
bad,"This company is not very well managed.  Let's see the schedule people who have been there the least amount of time to some of the worst schedules.  I normally started at 5am, which was very hard to get to work at that hour, however after a couple months they started moving me to 4am, and on my days off and after I was off work in the evenings they would call me into work.  It got to the point were I checked caller I.D before I answer the phone, especially when I was trying to get to sleep to make that early start time.  Right before I left the company management was about to pull the stunt of making on call (Nights) Mandatory, while still expecting you to work your early morning shift.  If you been there a long time with the company you are likely to get late morning shifts.  If you want any time off during the holidays you can forget that, because the most senior people get off, and your left covering their shifts.  In addition I felt lied to about the position because I was hired as a driver, but instead I was working in the Lab breaking down containers. A fellow coworker started the same time as myself, but after two week he got tired of their bait and switch which came from the job posting .Once you leave the company that is things get very dicey.  Ive been trying to get my W2's to do my taxes, but every time it is just excuses by their human resource customer service line.  It is at the point were I am going to have to contact the IRS and have them bring down the hammer on them, until they get into compliance with the law.  If your expecting a decent raise, you can forget"
bad,"Average work week of about 55-60 hours. Management or lack of management did not help us to reach any goals that needed to be set forth. co workers were great considering the long hours, we were more of a family due to the hours and constantly helping of one another."
bad,Typical day at work involves coming in the afternoon to find out it's gonna be a late night (every night) and well you're already behind. You actually learn quite a lot about how hospitals are shifting to a new supply chain and just the general workings of the healthcare industry. Management is very obstinate and will lash out towards any signs of speaking up. Coworkers are usually moody probably because it's night shift and everyone always works long hours. Hardest part of the job is favoritism and the long hours. The enjoyable part of the job was how two days out of the week you didn't work much but boy did you make up for it on the other days.
bad,"when work on the charlotte location I thought I found the right company. When working as an associate for couple of months I was promise to be move up when learning the process to a leading position and then realized that because of my nationality I was turned down by my Supervisor. I have years of experience in the management field/operations and recently graduated from college obtaining a bachelors degree in business and I still didn't qualify for a ""leading position"". They hired someone else from outside ( not hispanic ) and I was forced to leave. Now I am working for a well diversified organization, and bigger company that promote opportunities for hispanics like my."
bad,I have learned different names of medicine and what they do.My co-workers are great and fun to work with it.The hardest part of my job is the hours i work.
bad,"The employees are alright and I learned to get along with everyone even with their different types of personalities.  It wasn't difficult to meet or exceed my quotas for the day, everyday.  Best part of the job is the friends I've made during my time with the company.  They helped me get through the workdays."
bad,"They are good to work for better than most I'd say. They offer good benefits for full time employees and an annual raise which is nice if you happen to get along and like your coworkers. When I started as a pharmacy technician part time I was making 14 dollars and hour when hired in as full time I made 15 and after the annual raise I was making 16 dollars a hour. Overall I was satisfied with the company but not happy. My location When I first started wasn't doing deliveries and then eventually started doing them while they did reimburse mileage it was a lot of wear and tear on my old vehicle and once my vehicle went out I got written up for my car not working which I didn't think was fair (in essence you're writing me up for not having enough money for a new car). Cardinal Health is a billion dollar company I think the least they should do is offer a company vehicle for us to do deliveries in and that goes to show you how much effort they put into their employees if it's that serious to write me up for not having a working car. At my specific location I was very dissatisfied and that's why this review has two stars. I'm sure Cardinal would be great if you actually got a long with the people you work with."
bad,Cant advance in the company if you not liked it was the buddy system there . Supervisor had their picks. The pay didnt match the hours had to struggle to get 8 a day
bad,I took the job understanding what I was going to be paid $12.00 Per Hour with commission and bonuses but what I didn't understand is that it averages takes at least 8 months to a year to get to a particular teir level in order to start earning commission and I couldn't afford to wait for that long to earn a decent living.
bad,"I enjoy working here,  but I feel underappreciated and underpaid seeing as I can close, open, and work the middle shift. I don't like how my schedule is constantly changing either."
bad,The company could be so great if they ever got management that understood the big picture and not the micromanagement picture!! Management has a lot of favoritism and sleep around with his supervisors and representatives!! Although they do have minority leadership; they do not have any say-so in how things go!! They also have no issues lying to cover their tracks and will terminate anyone who disagrees with their tactics! Cocky managers that worked at supervisors to the bone and take all the credit and then gets rid of them when they are used up!
bad,Was a diver for for meds was ok but graveyards were a killer the bosses dont care they just want the product out the door not cool. The boss is always gone hard to get time off cause the people who have been there forever get it first .
bad,This job pays well and schedule options are great. You don't work past 3 on Saturday's and you have the option to come off Saturday 's after 6 months. The downside to this company is the Managers!!!! My last Manager had no clue how to do his job and I was new to the department and barely had training so he was no help at all!! Only way to survive this job is to become friends with the Managers who have been there for years that actually know what there doing!! Management was never on the same page.
bad,it was a lot of hard work co workers were ignorant and lazy management were slow and lazy they really didnt care for their employees ive had issues with my co workers because they didnt want to work
bad,"its is mandatory to work overtime and yes they tell you when  you start but they sugarcoat it they dont really tell you how you really dont have a life once you start working, they always mandate you to work on sundays even when you had already worked 60-70 hours it is really exhausting to work more than 12 hours a day and it never seems to be enough to them management really sucks, the great thing about this place is that they pay you 24 days of time off total but  really this days is the only life you gonna get in your whole year so use it wisely"
bad,Cardinal health is hard for any single parent. Going in at 9am and getting off at 10pm is stressful within itself. I recommend that people with small children do not work at the facility.
bad,I have been at this company a long time and so much as changed through the years and not for the better.  A lot of new faces and the first thing that they strive to do is make changes without understanding the needs of the business.
bad,Job wasn't for me long term but it helped out at that time. Coworkers were helpful with all the day to day work. I didn't see any room for growth in my time working there.
bad,Not enough people to do the work but they talk about work/life balance all the time - actions speak louder than words.   Not being in Dublin allows things to be a bit less stressful but you are pretty much ignored as well..
bad,I worked her for more then the year within the time i worked there i had 3 different supervisor and 2 different managers . There was no structure and organizations. The communications skills with the employee was very poor.
bad,"Being a part of Cardinal is like buying your first car.  You just need a car to get you from point A to point B.  Nothing really fancy for the time being. Too much micromanaging and the supervisor that was currently there was pretty petty about small stuff that was unrelated to the job.  She actually got into a screaming match with another employee at the office while everyone watched. If the management would not focus solely on profit but educating and building a better team in a more professional work environment, the company would be successful .  But like some company's they focus solely on profit and less on building a solid team with highly trained professional staff."
bad,I have leaned how to organize route schedules for loading product. I am not impressed with the new system Cardinal Health is trying to conduct as far as selecting orders for various Medical Facilities. However I do enjoy and appreciate the teamwork my co-workers have shown and conducted.
bad,"Major lay-offs. Upper management lie left and right. Never worked for a company with so many changes and confusion. Pay is good, very heavy work load."
bad,management was very helpful and taught the basics to learn the job. Co-workers did not like each other and were very racist towards each other. The best part about the job was the pay and benefits.
bad,"Successfully manage, develop and launch laboratory products.  Defined the go to market strategy for private brand portfolio.  Evaluate new market trends and understand how they impact our current/future business.  Manage the lifecycle of all products.  Design and conduct sales force training programs."
bad,"Working at Cardinal Health Pet Manufacturing is mixed.  There are parts that are bad and there are parts that are good.  The bad parts have to deal with the amount of hours you are expected to work.  People work 50 to 60 hours a week, sometimes more. Management makes people feel bad when they only want to work a normal 40 hours.  Time off and vacations are hard to get approved."
bad,A typical day at work is getting in for morning stretches on time. I learned a lot about different medical products and how important Lot Numbers and Expiration dates are when working in the medical warehouse field. Any supervisor I had was very good and caring for their employees. Co workers were good but some were out for themselves as far as advancement. The hardest part of the job was some lifting involved. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction I received knowing I was helping people to receive sanitized proper surgical kits the hospitals used.
bad,"a typical day at work go though goals for that day,management was very poor because he would be off some were doing his school work.my co workers were great we all got a long,but the hardest part of the job was not knowing what time your going to come in and what time you were going to get off."
bad,"Answer phones, ship medication, Verify Insurance. Verry good company but I am a temp and I need a more stable position."
bad,"I do not know where to start with this place, how it is legal what they do. Please note, that when I speak down on management, I am speaking about the upper management I.E. corporate, operations managers, etc. First off, favoritism, favoritism, favoritism. I think enough has been said on this in other posts. Basically, your raise and growing within depends on who likes you. Also, favorites can not show up to work countless times a year, making your day terrible and they get away with it. The moment a good worker that is not a favorite is 5 minutes late, they are down your back. There is ABSOLUTELY NO WORK / LIFE BALANCE. If you are told you work 8 hour shifts, you are there for 10-11 when you are told you work 10 hour shifts, you can be there from 12-14. Here's where it really gets dirty, they force you to work overtime, but if you used PTO that week, you are being forced to work straight time! How that is legal is beyond me, but if you use PTO, get in a car accident, or get sick that week you get no overtime pay. You will be forced to work holidays while the favorites that work in the office enjoy them off with family. I worked in the MN location and the current operations manager there is a complete know it all who thinks he's better than anyone. He does not even take the input from your supervisor, he looks at your numbers and judges you 100% off of that. He just started last year and thinks he knows it all! I spent 7 years of my life there, this is just the beginning. I could write a blog just on this place, go to school and get treated how you deserve to be!"
bad,This job dsnt care about you or your families. They over work you.No time spent with your loved ones. No life here. Wouldnt recommend to any one with a family. I spoke up my opinion they just listened but dnt change anything
bad,"Very Long, uncontrollable work hours that fluctuate weekly. Makes it difficult to maintain a balanced work life ratio. Local management is in need of restructure to continue focused objectives."
bad,The job is decent the pay can be better. Some of the policies are not very fair to the employee. The new manager is to full of himself to listen to the concerns of the employee. Quick to get rid of you if you disagree with him.
bad,"While I was glad to be working, the hourly wage was very low for the speed of work expected.  The team supervisors belittled workers often."
bad,Les directeurs ne sont jamais vraiment honnêtes avec les employés. Par manque de compétence envers leur statut
bad,Very difficult to find help even when asking a superior. No one will help you unless you are there superior. They like to play favorites. No one really genuinley cares for you.
bad,the benefits are the best part of working for this company. the management is not up to par and the pay is not worth the long hours
bad,"My typical day at work would be keeping up with product activity try to hit the gold of picking per hour."
bad,"The management team have their favorite. They will give some people first shift as they walk through the door. Yet, others have to stay on second or third forever.  The work hours are very odd.  You always have to watch your back. They will plot on you."
bad,Going downhill with a toxic culture.  Prioritize financial savings at all costs in order to pay off the Opiod settlement.  Employees come last and the benefits are poor for a company the size of CAH.
bad,"Working there was hard but the people there made it easier for me to work there cause they were very friendly, and they fire people all the time they don’t give second chances."
bad,"No comment at this time. "
bad,I've  been with this company now for about two weeks I can definitely say i am not enjoying my experience here so far the communication  at this company is very poor and the new employees get treated like cr** and get blamed for everything the training is very poor and you get reprimanded for things you wasn't trained on the work load is outrages every task you do at this company has 10 different things to it i can understand why the turnover is so high the machines do not run on a human level they are ran on a robot level  and you half to keep up with it the benefits are ok but nothing to brag about and low pay
bad,"Large department was gutted to have technical call center moved to Malaysia. New flagship product has never met expectations, and the grapevine indicates that a once significant lead in market share has vanished, with Omnicell the leader."
bad,It helped out a lot it’s automatically organizes everything I need for me it’s much easier being one touch away . Appreciate the fact all I have to do is fill in the boxes and it puts it right together for me
bad,I loved working there. Did not care for management. The pay was great. The hours were great as well. I would recommend this company to a friend or family memeber
bad,"The pay is horrible but where they suck you in is that the benefits start the day you start,managers want drivers to do the pharmacy tech jobs plus make deliveries and MICROMANAGING is terrible, all  for an unlivable wage."
bad,Cardinal use to be a great place to work until the new management came in.They don't appreciate there employees. Hard work and lot a demanded overtime.
bad,Company lost a 10 million dollar acct. I was helpful in getting funding for the patients for their Makena injections. great locations and the patients were great to assistant they were so grateful to get the drug approve so they wouldn't go into preterm labor
bad,Worst place to work manager doesn't know what he is doing sits in his office all day.Lets the supervisors do all the decisions even if they don't make sense at all
bad,"My experience here wasn't the best, but you learn from everything. The job is great but it was the leaders that weren't to pleasant they don't communicate with you to well and its like the people that work their for a while come off a little rude to the other new workers. Overall I did like the job cause it did challenge me in ways to help me improve my attitude with working with different people and how to handle most situations."
bad,sometimes it feels like they value some people over others.  they let some employees get away with almost anything with out action.
bad,"good management learned a lot lots of experts teaching hospital, motivating, good pay, excellent enviorment crowded parking garage"
bad,"great for person looking to break into medical sales field"
bad,"Well some days where good and some not.  I learned how respect people how you want to be treated by others.  Management was horrible only talked with the people they liked, but I had a good supervisor that new I could do my job, whatever was asked from him I did it with know problem."
bad,I learned advanced Microsoft Excel skills and how to create customized financial reports
bad,"* A typical day at Cardinal Health would consist of morning meeting, afterward an associate is assigned a task for the day. Once your task has been completed for the day you would be assigned and area of Compliance to which you would have finish housekeeping. "
bad,The typical work day involves picking orders and processing them for medical facilities around Jacksonville. We ship medical supplies for surgeons and other doctors who may need them.
bad,"Very hard labor. Work hour vary from 10 hours to 13 hours a day. start time always different. No holiday off. Schedule is Sun-Thurs. Short break, short lunch and lunch schedule always changes up everyday. But the peoples that work there is great. Also lots of meeting causing a lots of down time in productivity. "
bad,"The Job was great, but the pay and yearly increase were not that goo"
bad,Cardinal Health give one the Idea what it is like to work in Hospitals and Clinics  to serve doctors who really need our help to diagnose customers ailment and conditons
bad,"Easy job but hard working job! no down time constantly working your whole shift doing the same thing which gets veryyyy boring also your work activity is monitored and you have to keep track of how many items you stock you are expected to stock about 200 items a hour which (nobody ever is where they are supposed to be)  and management will tell you, you are behind and your work activity is low and you can be fired, the hardest part of the job is you never know when your gonna go home EVERYDAY! no one leaves until all the work is done! regular shift is 6am -2:30am (expect to leave around 4 or 5pm with no 3rd break) If you enjoy constantly lifting, bending, and having to move fast ALL day then this is the job for you"
bad,My time there wasn't a bad experience at all I meet some really good friends there. It being a graveyard job really can mess with mentally and physically if your not that kinda person. Management doesn't seem to realize that it is different to actually do the job then to just see it as numbers on a piece of paper.
bad,"Typical day at work easy at first then get hit toward the end with work load, short help and unprofessional management not putting help where needed. Co workers work well together and communicate well. Hardest part of the job when thiers short staff and you have to pull others work load, most enjoyable part of the job is when we finish the job on time or early then expected."
bad,"Management is a joke. I was on time everyday never late..Did my job. The position I was trained to do was very unorganized, but still was top performer. I was bullied by another employee and was let go."
bad,enjoyed my days and evening working always. over all I liked working there and loving the residents and some of there employees. liked very much the management
bad,"very good benefits ,clean enviorment aot of walking ,good for your health.make reaaly good money. you work long hours.sometimes until 5 oclock in the morning"
bad,"picking and packing customers orders, making sure orders are correct and the right amount there suppose to get.its a pretty much good place to work for great healthcare 401k benefits paid time off."
bad,"Handle incoming calls from customer responsible for expediting orders. Take and process orders by telephone, internet correspondence from customers and reps. Provides order status and pricing information to the customers. Resolving problems with the customer account with adjustments and inventory. Finish shipping and tracking information at the customer request."
bad,Salary should be more based on the type of work. Need better insurance. Should have more opportunities for advancement. Should be able to cross train more on other jobs
good,Good company just no work/life balance. Great benefits decent pay but 50+ hours a week learned a lot from the company. Looking to move on to better things for my family and I.
good,"Overloaded with work, which multitasking is not an issue but when there's 21 calls and queue and you still have 4 other tasks to complete it can be very overwhelming and stressful. Not to mention you can only have one person off during the day, which makes it  hard to schedule anything outside of work to get done. MICROMANAGEMENT, upper management doesn't take accountability for their mistakes. There's no type of work/life balance. Don't expect any praise or recognition for your good work, you won't get it.   The work isn't hard at all, its actually too easy, need something more challenging and purposeful."
good,If you are not trying to have a life work here . You have to be a robot no feelings no life . Management trash and unorganized. Stuff is never consistent. Mandatory 6days also at random days ahead of time .not enough money for how they treat you and ask for . If you’re tired they’ll tell you cry in the bathroom.
good,"Poor management, on contract with them there was no benefits, paid vacation time, or 401k. They are very strict with call ins and don't accept doctors notes, after 2 call ins I have seen people become terminated. Management is willing to sort of help you but otherwise you are left on your own."
good,"All in all it's a ok company to work for if you want to gain experience, the company has a high turn over rate do to on site human resource just listens to the VP of that location no matter the severity of the problem. Alot of racism at that location and the victims are the ones that get let go. They have a training program that's a joke the 3 trainers dont know what they are doing. Anyone over a couple years of knowledge I wouldn't recommend this place for you because your only going to get told that your wrong with whatever comes out of your mouth. Work injurys are taken as a joke as well people are afraid to report injuries do to hr and management treat you completely different which makes fellow coworkers that get special treatment have the opportunity to go run and tell everyone that is going o. With you which makes other coworkers treat you differently. But if you want to be I. High school all over again then go right ahead and join."
good,Culture & moral is horrible. Turnover is terrible. Sups & managers work against each other causing division between employees. Constant change with little or no warning. No work/life balance for second shift employees. It used to be a very nice facility & culture. Not anymore.
good,"They are always change start time, and get out so late in the morning. Poor management. disrespectful to employee. the supervisor does not tread all the employee equally. right now, they have 2 starts time for 2nd shift. one starts at 3:30pm and the other shift start at 6:00 pm. But the most disappointed me is we get the same pay per hour and with more job and the end of the shift for the employee that starts at 6:00pm."
good,Typical day at work included Picking Orders to fill and packing them as fast as possible with quality care. I learned to pack sensitive medical supplies in such a way as to make sure they arrived in quality condition in a timely manner. Management was non-existent. The culture of the environment was quality care for the customers in need for their medical supplies. Hardest part of the job was to meet deadlines during peak season with an inadequate amount of team members. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of beating the odds on a daily basis as a team.
good,"Unplanned long hours where the company had you stay would interfere with home and family. Many workers where not certified to use power equipment due to them waiting too long for training, or manager never around to get trained."
good,"The job is kinda hard and the supervisor wanted me to learn the machines fast the machines are very raggedy so they break down a lot. And you have to be fast to troubleshoot, because you will be running about 10 machines by yourself! Very stressful"
good,Just as the title say. Plus the managers won’t do anything about immigrants that work there but treat everyone else like dirt.For example an immigrant just stands there not doing their job . They don’t say a thing but anybody else gets yelled at.
good,They are very unprofessional...……….terrible...they just want cheap labor and they will work you to death. They will tell you anything you want to hear just to get the labor.
good,"If you did not go to ""The Ohio State"" and do not play ""A"" level workplace politics you will not make it there.  They are currently on a diversity kick and discriminate against heteronormative cisgender white males."
good,"I'm looking for a new job for a reason. While the benefits are nice, the hours are awful, and the management could definitely use additional training."
good,Lots of work in the buffalo market not enough help to handle it without working around the clock at the busy times. Asked to work on vacations all the time.
good,"orem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
good,"We all used to worked collaboratively, but the culture changed.  You were no longer encourage to improve upon production even if you had GREAT ideas to share."
good,A lot of work...overtime great.. management not so great.  As the company goes through changes in time I feel it will be a great place to work.  It lacks motivation and company moral...
good,Its an or job but there's a lot of childishness that happens there. So you should just keep to yourself.
good,It was cool just never knew when you would be going home. Constant overtime every night. Sleeping schedule all messed up. Nice pay checks every 2 weeks though. Thats all I miss from there.
good,Working at cardinal health was one of the most stressful jobs I have ever had. There was absolutely no leadership or direction with high expectations.
good,"You were assigned several rows to have to pick your items from, once done - push the tote to the next picker. At the end of the night everyone would pack all the orders, and put them on pallets to be shipped the next day. Never getting out on time. Enjoyable was the fast pace."
good,"Poor work life balance"
good,"Cardinal Health is a Fortune 500 Company but their Houston facility is poorly ran, I was an employee for several years and there were multi supervisors managers turn over. Employees usually work long hours because of the bad management and not using the personnel correctly."
good,This was a fast paced job and I enjoyed it. Like my other jobs it was temporary. Just need a permanent job would be great so I know I have a steady income.
good,I wouldn't tell my family or friends to work at Cardinal Health they aren't a good company at all.  They don't understand you at all when your ill which sucks
good,"-stressful"
good,"typical day was easy, this was a overnight job so you had to get use to being up all night and sleeping in the day. the management was very unprofessional and belittled and disrespected alot of their employers not me per say but ive witness women crying because this was the only job they could work at the time and they felt stuck because they had to tolerate the rudeness of the higher staff workers"
good,I enjoyed my job in the beginning until my manager retired and a new one was hired. She made coming to work uncomfortable and she mistreated the employees.
good,"Work life balance doesn't exist. When you get hired on they'll tell you ""yeah we can work with you if you eventually want to go"". Well they won't they'd rather fore you first. The work it's a warehouse you come in and move boxes and merchandise. On the positive side we have air-conditioning and heat, also if you come in with two years or less of experience you make more than people who have been here for 5 or more years. This is the only job me and a few other people have ever received a penny raise."
good,"You will work with some of the best people ever! On the flip-side, the management - supervisors and up - are not good at all. It makes you wonder HOW these people made it to where the are."
good,"I worked overnights and it was very hard getting into the rhythm of things but the first few days you are being cross-trained in different areas of the work place and where you perform the best at they just may put you there but don't bank on it. "
good,Fast paced work environment. I left company for the east coast of Canada as my wife retired and we relocated. Looking for work in similar field...
good,"This was a good place to work, sometimes stressful but over all good. management was ok and team work was not so great. hardest part of the job was getting management to try new ideas. the benefit was good and pay rate was ok"
good,Its all about the money and customers. Employees dont matter.
good,"Is a good company the benefits are fine, commodity product is estable."
good,"Management has its own culture somewhat favoring one over others, but I guess that is everywhere.  Work as teams make the job experience more efficient and productive. The scary part was the large downsizing and dismissal of personnel.  It was explained with becoming lean and more profitable."
good,Very unprofessional and the pay is very bad for all that they ask of their employees. Very high turn over rate they can't seem to keep quality workers. Very toxic environment.
good,"They only care about certain people here at this location. The Pharmacist only care about not working at midnight on weekends, so they send the drivers to Charlotte, to bring doses back to Asheville and deliver them. A 4 hour trip, to deliver to hospitals here in Asheville, for a total of 2 1/2 hours. Favoritism, and a toxic environment, and a supervisor with a bad attitude, anger and ego problem which isencouraged  by the manager"
good,"there is no technical or skills trainings (they say is for economic reasons)"
good,"Clocking in and having a meeting first thing in the morning. then getting dressed in PPE for our daily tasks."
good,Cardinal health is an extremely competitive business with more focus on stockholders and bottom lines than employees. It is limited as far as opportunity available for career advancement.
good,you never know how the day will be especially with alot of employees calling of i learned how to ship hazards to other states i also can pick and pack use a reach truck
good,"The people were great. Some of the management not all would micro-manage. They had a point system that created a high turn over rate. While I was there, management terminated some of the best workers."
good,"Management in Cardinal Health has a Mexican mentality. As long as"
good,"Your typical day was to expect the unexpected. Management"
good,"It started out as a great place to work, but then as Sales continued to increase year over year, there were consistent changes which seemed almost every month.  It made it continuously harder for us to attempt to meet sales goals."
good,"The work environment at its worst. Leadership is pitiful, the people who work overnight / good luck to work with them. The company is good but everything else you better hold on tight.. Bunch of back stabbing people. If you work during the day you may want to think twice about doing that.."
good,"Very hard to move up in positions at Cardinal Health, a lot of favoritism goes on in this company. The only way to move up within the company is to kiss up to the supervisors/leads. Also, the pay offered sucks considering the amount of work load you must do. Cardinal Health is terrible at giving back to it's employees, I worked there for almost 3 years and we only received one bonus in the three years I was there and the raises suck. They give no recognition to the workers that bust their butt every night and nothing gets told to those that don't work hard at all. The only good things that I can say about Cardinal Health is they do offer good PTO (paid time off) and the only good thing I can say about the MWDC is the people that work there are really cool and easy to get along with. Make some pretty good friendships with some of the people there."
good,"Company culture was based upon upward mobility and training programs."
good,"It's a busy company. Alot of overtime and even if you have the morning shift you still don't have time for family and friends. Days can go by fast, and sometimes can seem forever."
good,"Hours are different weekly. Mostly worked 35 hours a week, low pay."
good,"I love the people I work with and I what i do because we deliver products to hospitals, but the running Cardinal Health at this moment are not fair with their employees time or money."
good,"My everyday at cardinal health was to pick drugs, store them into tots, put them on a pallet with hundreds of more tots, rapping them up tight with shrink wrap to be delivered.."
good,"Its a good place to work, the Salt lake branch is not as large as other locations and does not have as many resources.  The day shift does managerial work like adding new sku's and receiving.  The night shift is the work horse and pulls most orders.  They stay until the job is done."
good,"A typical day starts at one am in the morning. At this time, set up QC work station, chem boxes and cyclotron. It was a small crew of five and we worked efficiently to get the ready for a production run each day on time."
good,Overall not a bad place to work.the hours are long but also have a long weekend.
good,People tend to work alone in their own pace. Management plays around with favoritism.
good,Loading and Unloading trucks as well as truck scheduling. 10 hour days were very common. Not a great team environment which is a shame. Very rare that hard work was rewarded in this company.
good,"Management is poor.  Extreme favoritism. Not much opportunity for advancement."
good,IT PMO was HIGH stress for Project Managers. Most contract PMs don't stay for more thann 6 months. Management is hands-on and can be very critical.
good,"Good company, bad management. Excellent benefits. Long hours. Radiation environment. Third shift. Good resources, good vacation time."
good,"Work was very micro managed, · Answer Pharmaceutical calls; accurately process orders for Retail Chain pharmacies"
good,It was a great place when I first started but there's No H.R to help you.
good,"its a call center, where you take incoming calls. its hard to promote from within, and the management shows favortism to certain reps. the hardest part is learning the rx names for medicine"
good,"Let me start by saying I worked for a subsidiary of CHAH, not the actual company itself. Things were great before the full acquisition, but then you became a literal workhorse. The Dynamic of the culture changed so drastically. The pay is subpar,  but time-off was great. The 401K Match was also a plus. They really do allow you to stack and save for your retirement."
good,CAH does an excellent creating a welcoming environment and does extremely well with their diversity and inclusion program and their women’s initiative program. CAH Does not do well prioritizing it’s customer service programs. They need to lift some of the red tape and make it easier to get work done.  They have too many approval levels.
good,"The training was very poor, the expectations were unable to meet from the managers position.  There was a lot of back stabbing issues, family issues were not taken to human resource to find an acceptable process, but thrown in the garbage."
good,Ok place to work. minimal advancement from within. Good benefits but a bad work life balance. Opportunities do not come up often enough and upper management changes every year.
good,Great company that has many different opportunities all over the world. If you are willing to work hard you will do well. In my position work/life balance has been a challenge.
good,"As a current employee at Cardinal I can say coming in at first is very overwhelming. The older employees do not do much to assist newer workers. As for the management, you never see them unless it’s a poor effort to convince the workers that they care. You will always feel tired, sore, and stressed, especially if you are on the black line. You’d be better off working somewhere else."
good,Picking product at a fast pace. Heavy nights mean over time. Light nights could also mean over time. It’s great for someone who wants to be able to move up in the company.
good,Very large company with a variety of products and numerous contract manufacturing partners. A lot of lab work of research and development required. Cannot speak to benefits as I was a contract engineer.
good,"Some employees were able to get away with not having to work as much as others, and hard working employees are not rewarded. Advancement is all about who you know."
good,Pros and Cons about this company. Great employees but management changes frequently and has little involvement with employees. Many free luches and snacks.
good,"My site was a Medtronic site prior to the acquisition by Cardinal Health."
good,"worked there for  six and a half years, managers changed and they were never helpful, with any personal issues. They had there favorites as long as they did not have to do the work themselves, and kept everyone busy, they were  not interested in our problems, I was personally threatened on more than one occasion. by the bullys that they like.  everyone was busy as long as mgrs were around, once they left it was a free for all. they did not like when i brought anything to their attention,that includes the pharmacy heads, everyone is a boss of some kind and they love to back stab and talk about the other co workers I Had to leave . mgrs against magrs. The corporate office needs to see and be aware of what is really going on but they are in dublin ohio and don t care."
good,Really wasn't well organized was very hard because they would change shift and hours all the time. The management staff didn't put a good schedule for anyone and changed it all the times.
good,"Nothing much to shout about,"
good,culture and company are shifting low comp and low bonus plenty of opportunity to work and gain experience but it is a changing culture lots of major leadership changes and industry news
good,"Smart, professional employees in a fast paced environment. `The volume, complexity, and difficulty of work as well as career advancement options varies significantly between business units and divisions. Hires mostly recent graduates, former consulting firm staff, finance, those who are familiar with systems (such as SAP), and established executives  Regular leadership turnover and pockets of restructuring contributes to reactive and competitive environment. Alignment (being liked by) manager who hand picks employees for important cross functional projects is key to success. Limited diversity. Convenient main campus state of the art fitness center, pharmacy,wellness center and great cafeterias. Enjoy working here but looking outside because of significant changes and poor market performance."
good,"ok place to work good benefits"
good,It was fast paced and full of hard work. Not a lot of recognition for certain departments. The benefits are good. Training incomplete. Seem desperate for people regardless of quality of work.
good,If you were not on the favorite list you got humiliated and called out in a very high school manner instead of a professional manner. The Supervisors were very clear about who they preffered and would get away with not actuallly working.
good,"Good work environment, company is not in tuned with device sales however.  This is a good stepping stone for a younger manager but for someone wiith tenure it could be frustrating"
good,Very stressful. Associates struggled to get along. Management changed frequently. Never gave raises. People on the floor in lead roles walked around talking during shift.
good,Managment does not seem to care about employees. Overtime was mandated only for specific shifts while others were welcome to continue their normal 40 hours. Supervisors are not helpful solving problems.
good,"was there for 14 years. When new supervisors came in and started changing things around. they didn't want your input, just get it done. when I started there were maybe 2 late trucks a month. When I left there were at least 5 late trucks a week, mostly more. Employee turn around was so bad they had to start hiring temps to work. Lazy people with bad attitude (most of them ) Regular employees getting so frustrated at changes they stopped caring . Job got harder instead of easier despite having a kaizen program .Management and supervisors didn't want to listen to anybody but the boot lickers."
good,"a lot of walking, picking product. Always there to help when needed meet new people. very high turn over. able to joke around with management and others"
good,"good benefits, except for health coverage..poor health ins. carrier. Employee personnel was diversified. Some language barriers exist in communication. The work tasks were not hard. The hours varried, no one was released from the shift until everyone had their work load complete for the night and truck trailers were loaded. Good pay."
good,"Equipment behind the times, safety issues. Sometimes rules were Topsy tervy.  You never quite knew what they would dig up on you next to get you out. Expected to run the place if no one else was around and have some kind of Jedi mind set to get corrections made"
good,"The Health insurance is so bad it  is forcing me to look for another job.  If you are okay with only 1 health care option and it being a High Deductible plan then this might be the place for you.  Time off is pretty good, but have had better.  No discounted stocks for employees and no annual bonuses unless you are Director or above.  The good thing about Cardinal is there are a lot of remote positions."
good,"The workplace is hard, it's all about work and no outside life. Management is hard to work with but overall good people to work with. It's a basic entry-level warehouse facility so what you see is what you get."
good,"Not very stable, decent company to work for.  Great benefits.  I like the culture but the management doesn't seem to care about anything other then numbers."
good,"Great Benefits and No weekends.  Management does not know what there doing.  Your watched constantly from breaks, lunches and bathroom breaks. This used to be a good place to work but with the new management its going down hill fast."
good,"I stared with the company April of 2016 until December 2016. Within that time to my knowledge I went through 4 schedule changes that I know of. Sadly to say I didn't learn a lot from management. Workplace culture was very clickish, we did not assist one another as a team. Fellow employees would only assist those they consider themselves friends with. The hardest part of my job was that it didn't have to be hard. When I would suggest things to my coordinators that would make the job flow better they could never listen or either felt their solutions were the best solutions. The most enjoyable part was knowing what I did on the job was literally part of the process of saving someone's life."
good,"Being a small division of a Fortune 50 company, shareholder expectations was the main driver of operations.  It would restructure for cost savings about every two years."
good,"Job entails lots of driving, in all types of weather, very little growth in company. Higher Management not very helpful."
good,"Cardinal Health PET is a tough business to work in. If you're willing to put in the time, effort and sleep deprivation you can do well relatively quickly."
good,"for most of the17 years that I worked at the NLC, overtime was par for the course. a schedule of 4 10 hour days ended up being 4 12 hour days- 3 12 hour day ended up being 3 14/15 hour days, they claim to be working on correcting that issue - the problem was the company did not to correct it by hiring more people. That meant they needed more work from fewer people- some times that works - other times it doesn't. The benefits were ok - they were in line with other employers. Management was attempting to employ lean six-sigma program - getting buy in was the hard part. The warehouse workers in the area I was employed in were for the most part long term dedicated workers, over all good people. The hardest part of the job was also what I considered the most enjoyable - tracking down overages and shortages in inventory, it made me think outside of myself in order to figure out where and when things went."
good,"Only thing good about working there its steady work. Long hours mediocre pay, lots of turn over especially in management."
good,"Driving for Cardinal Nuclear pharmacy was a good job. I liked it. I made a mistake with a customer and they gave me another chance. Not many companies will do that. I would go back to work for them in an instant if I could. I left in June 2015."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance: "
good,Collaborate with hospital personnel and Cardinal management on a daily basis.  On the phone all day in order to leave an impression on decision makers.
good,"a typical day at work, you never know how many hours your going to work or he time your shift ends. i learned never get to comfortable on a job your not happy with. management is not how it should be. i will miss my co-workers. carrying your load and someone else. knowing that i had a job to go to. its a good place to work but the pay could be better."
good,A typical day would require paying attention to details and getting medicine ready to be delivered.
good,typical fragmented mismanaged enterprise IT environment where the left hand doesnt know what the right hand is doing.
good,Compensation needs to increase. There is a lot of work required or than drivering for $10 an hour
good,"I learned to multi task between selling, servicing, and team leading. A very intense environment."
good,"it a decent place to work. Equipment is outdated. Good place for college students to work, save money and move on."
good,"A typical day consist of checking daily maintenance reports of all SAP systems, working on active projects, handling Service Now trouble tickets, and addressing production and non-production issues."
good,"Unload delivery trucks and devise timely fashion of distributing product to receivers. After the product is received, assist in stocking it in the proper locations. I learned which items are priorities and to receive and stock product in timely and convenient areas. I am counted on by management and team-members to be flexible and multi-tasked, which sometimes can be very stressful. The benefit is the respect that I've garnered."
good,The pay was okay but the hours were not good and Ghost picking was a problem. Management turn a blind eye unless you were caught in the act
good,"On some of the things I was given to do there was little explanation and with others the person that was doing the training didn't know and had to ask someone else claimed this was hard, even though I was understanding it, walked away and there was no more training."
good,"Horrible management and jobs going to India. Fun place if your job isn't being out sourced. Paid time at Isleta Family Center, Tramway Park."
good,"If you enjoy sitting 8 hours a day, then this job is for you. Extremely boring."
good,Was not impressed when during trainings investers were mentioned just as much as customers
good,At the Milwaukee location we were a family who worked hard together and also had fun.
good,"Superlative management and staff. Wholly unpredictable demand. Saw a company with fantastic internal control and abilitiy to eliminate waste and reduce costs. Co-workers harmonious and strong--some committed for 25 years. Some bodies require regular restoration of blood glucose; but sometimes impossible. Wonderful chance to enjoy Arizona, singing o'er the hills."
good,Good benefits but no advancement. Management is not at all understanding of personal health. It is a very rigid and sometimes cruel atmosphere.
good,This is a decent place to work that provides job security. Decent pay but could be better. Typical day at work is very standard.
good,"This is a company currently undergoing a radical transformation,and will be cutting close to 1200 finance/accounting jobs.  Be wary when applying to roles.  Don't expect the company to maintain any type of strategy either."
good,"Its filled with good people trying to do the right thing, but often times its incredibly slow to change, the company prioritizes cost-savings over investment and there are clear pathways for development"
good,"The micro managing is killing the work atmosphere. Your getting email after email about nonsense stuff, which can be a big distraction from your work. Management show a lot of favoritism and then tries to act like your crazy. Drama is everywhere, half the people don’t like each other."
good,this company has good benefits. Managers don't care about employees. All they care about is making money. They take forever to hire new employees and training is horrible. Most departments are under staffed so current employees have to work twice as hard with no compensation.
good,"Highest leadership is all about automation, not understanding that it is a wrong fit for the business process."
good,When I started at Cardinal Health everything was great 8 to 9 hours a day over time was at a minimum until the new general manager came in a year and 1/2 later.  overtime went to 12 hours a day we never had a life outside of work the job moral  went downhill after that.
good,CAH would be a great place to work if there were more opportunities for growth; good employees are being forced to move on because all of the Customer Supported positions are being outsourced to Manilla.
good,"Management has no clue on how to manage employees nor do they have the experience to handle large groups. I find that most of the management there discuss other employees business which should be considered HIPA violations due to the nature of some employees situations. Management is young and lack maturity. "
good,"The company was always under staff , a lot of people leaving the company because under paid for what we are doing. Also there is always asking for more productivity and it was a tiring job by always on your feet the whole night, there are not too many jobseekers who wants to work here that is why we are always shorthanded."
good,There was absolutely no loyalty on their part. As well as no trust with management. There were bad changes to the work environment. They have very few long-term employees that stay there.
good,"They strive to be an employer of choice, but are not paying in line with other organizations. Very high turnaround. Organization does not promote within."
good,"I would have continued to work at this company until my retirement, if my job wasn't outsourced. It is a good working environment, somewhat quiet but that doesn't bother me."
good,"It is now day 13 of a partial government shutdown, and neither side looks willing to budge on the main sticking point of money for a border wall.  my experience there was great"
good,Long hard hours that seemed little appreciated. While I worked there for 13 years it was a time when it was difficult to find another job for equal pay.
good,"Let go from the company without any active support of relocation to another spot. Very disappointed. Large turn over, especially in management. The ability to promote is there, but there is a heavy emphasis on moving most of the work from the United States, to over seas. As a result, the customers are being given poor service, all to save money."
good,"The pay is excellent, but the overall moral of the company could use some improvement. Training is 3 weeks and after that, your left to fend for yourself and learn on your own. If you don't ask, you wont know but supervisors expect you to know everything."
good,Hourly pay with overtime.  Small chance of advancement despite what was promised.  Very physical work with possible long hours each night.  No set end of shift time.
good,"it's a good place to work for, I have learned a lot of things as leading a group of people to be ready to perform the task easier "
good,None to comment about. The best I can comment of this job are the amazing people I worked with. The company was just in a very remote location with no cafe.
good,Alright place to work if you needed a job that gives you pay raises twice a year. Staff was cut down a while ago because they loss a big customer. And management was not put together very well but things still got done one way or another.
good,"I work for ParMed, a subsidiary of Cardinal Health, and unfortunatly being that way made it difficult to attain sales goals as CH made it impossible to compete."
good,start time changes daily as well as finish time. there never seems to be enough people working on a daily basis to get the job done without creating a very stressful environment.
good,"The best thing about working for Cardinal Health is the benefits and the pay.  If you like overtime this is the place for you.  I have learned a lot working there,"
good,"Day starts early and usually end late."
good,Night shift did the most work and even when morning shift came in they still didn’t allow night shift to leave.  Work was no fun it was just only pressure and nothing that you did was good enough.
good,"It's an easy job just no where near as easy to advance in a company that doesn't promote unless someone leaves the company and that doesn't happen often and sometimes they'll hire out of the company for higher positions. Also training is like being thrown to the wolves.. you're basically training yourself or someone who has been there less than 6 months will be mentoring you. On the upside they are team-oriented, no one is done until everyone is done."
good,I don't think I would recommend Health Care sales to anyone in the present day atmosphere. The Federal Government is making changes to the whole healthcare industry so that our healthcare will become more ran like a Socialist Government.
good,We had to work 8 hour days and they turned into 10+. It was always for the #'s. Nobody knew how the day was going to last. It was always on your feet.
good,"Cardinal Health seems to be drying up in Northern IL.  The amount of jobs and facilities in this area have gone away.  They are all about being lean and eliminating headcount.  This makes life rough for those that remain and there are fewer opportunities for advancement due to the smaller footprint.  Unless you want to move your family to Dublin Ohio, you might want to look to work somewhere else."
good,"Cardinal Health is the ideal job for someone who is looking to make a lot of money, and is not afraid to be working constantly. The shifts are long, but the benefits and pay are good, depending on your position. "
good,"Steady hours, heavy workload, average compensation, average management, artificial culture. benefits, 401k, unsatisfied coworkers, high turnover. great for someone just out of college."
good,"I love the environment and people, but no benefits for part timers. My the immediate supervisor did not seem to be fair. "
good,"The company was good to work for, but they didn't really respect their employees and there was no advancement. Every time you tried to move up with them, it was always a no because of the simplest reason. Raises could have been better as well."
good,"This is a corporate driven company, servicing many hospitals and pharmacys. The product is good. The pay and benifits are good, if you can deal with high pressure and OT."
good,lack of training is the biggest issue. No leadership and management expects you to be perfect and read their minds. they talk to you like you are stupid.
good,Cardinal Health pays a low salary but gives you a lot of PTO even walking in the door your first year.  The tail wags the dog at this company and they are always changing strategies to market multiple times per year.
good,"The work itself can be challenging with opportunities to acquire new skills."
good,I was having to pick up other's Slack while doing my job. Too much talking and not enough working. co-worker were friendly. Got to many people that also set around an did nothing half the time.
good,Management is poor on the PET side. After a while it becomes muscle memory and mundane. Working third shift is very hard on social life and health. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing micro analysis.
good,after working overtime for 3months straight the building was expanded the weekend of the move we worked on it  3 weekends straight and that lead to new management who came in and turned everyone against each other So the trust as far as leadership was destroyed and Hours were cut from 12+ to 8 a day without notice
good,"would be a good job for anyone young and limber with lots of energy. the management is sub-standard and impersonal at this location, however."
good,"Taking incoming phonecalls,resolving customer issues with orders,placing and tracking orders. Average number of phone calls in an 8 hour day is 35 or more. The best part of the job  is getting to talk to people in all different states and problem solving."
good,When I worked there i got a lot of hours working there but the management wasn't up to point always missing work or not out setting the picks.
good,Not bad fast pace to work. A lot a different equipment to work with. Great place to gain experience. Co-workers are great.
good,"the job could be a whole lot better, but the upper management treat you like you're nothing. no raises like you suppose to get every year. based on performance and attendance. need a better system."
good,i learned alot at cardinal health and a value my time there.  but in resent years there the management that's in place right now have they're on agenda.  they talk about the employees with the most years like we didn't earn our salaries at least that's what the manager  told one of the employees and so he has been picking us off one by one with me being the latest on his list.  other than management the company itself is a good overall company and the benefits were great. I loved being a lead and i loved working the people and i will miss the friendships there and i loved helping our customers and knowing that the medicine i was sending out was getting to people who really needed it.
good,need a major change in management a strategy. want results but doesnt do the homework to get results. not very flexible and losing great market share to competitors
good,"Typical day is quite hectic with the mentality of ""Do More with Less"".  The non-management work-force is great with wonderful caring employees.  The hardest part is the work-life balance disappearing more and more."
good,Packaging Coordinators took over Catalent which took over Cardinal Health at the time. The workload remained the same if not increased once Catalent took over Cardinal. Cardinal's upper management knew the business.
good,"when I came on this job I was overly excited about the position because I really needed the money. But about 6mos I started to get burned out because I worked the 5pm-1:30am shift but we was so understaffed that the shift became 5pm- finished (which was usually 5am). I was an air picker so, I was required to 35 picks per hour.... Simple, right? Wrong! Try grabbing 25 cases of 50lb saltine water 15 ft in the air, for 15mins! That's one pick! They used to have team huddle to try to fire the workers up before our shift but we knew that it was going to be a long night. They have so many foreigners that work there, and they work them to the bone. And upper management gets mad when you say that they need a culture change and a union. I got along with all of my co worker that I hung out with most of the foreigners and they knew that the company was killing them. So we planned a strike, and they went up on the pay. But I would honestly take the more man power over the money. But hey everyone's different. I almost lost my mind working for the company but I was never broke but never had time to spend and flunked out of school. The Curtis bay location is the worst"
good,We worked very long hours management was inconsistent and inexperienced. Employees were great working together and had pretty good relationships.
good,All in all a good place to work. The people I work with are the reason the job is great. The performance reviews and advancement opportunities are poor at best.
good,"was a nice place to work, we all got along, never had problems until then end of my time there."
good,long hours co-workers make it fun to be their learn to work in the freezer in -17 weather love the long hours help me to get what I wanted in life
good,"Great place to learn about nuclear pharmacy, not currently investing in current interns."
good,"I enjoyed working in this position, but I realized that the overnight shift was no longer the best option for me."
good,I have nothing nice to say about managment..good company..
good,The company is well known for being one of the top who sellers to hospitals for the formulary list. Since drug companies can not sell directly to hospitals themselves the middle mans job is to give hospitals discounted price for being a legitimate hospital meaning having an Emergency Room / Operative ready. I was stationed at a hospital that lost its accreditation so there budget was none at all. As I looked on the systems I was to use for medical documentation I  noticed a lot of issues with keeping the important data organized. The people I worked with were great but they had a inputting system that had so many glitches that it was erasing the vital parts.
good,It was too many hoodrats that worked in the call center but it was still a fun place to work. It was like a soap opera everyday.
good,"Business unit is still far from the parent company core abilities.  Unfortunately, business unit is misunderstood and not generating expected revenue."
good,"High rate of employment turnover. "
good,Cardinal is a very middle to good warehouse job. Nothing to fancy but they will train and give you tons of good opportunity's that will help you with a future job with them or somewhere else.
good,"I clock in at !:00pm in the work area. we get our work radios, and work supplys. We go to our station , get our orders , scan then to our lables.then start picking. once I have picked my order . I pack it out lable it and send it not the convarer.We some times have a meeting to talk about any problems. at the end of the day we help clean area to get ready for the next day. Or we go to help another area in the company."
good,On calls everyday with employees who need technical support and application support. Pleasant interactions with peers and callers.  
good,"The hours are terrible. YOU WORK 9 -12 HOURS DAILY, When you walk through the doors, everyday , you haven't a clue when you're gonna get off. Several supervisors don't know how to talk to you. I've caught several in a lie. "" NO REALLY, IN A LIE."" The head people in charge, haven't a clue, of whom they have working for them. The disbelief is amazing..........................They need to secretly install more cameras and take a look. ""SERIOUSLY"" DON'T TELL A SOLE, and see what you find out."
good,Never really a bad day. I learned how to pack up medicine. Management was to unorganized. Great co-workers. No hard position in the job. The co-workers make the place.
good,"Working weekends is nice. But, the management team is a little too relaxed."
good,"While with Cardinal Health, I became familiar with the medical industry while finely tuning my customer service, multi-task operational, and organizational skills. I had the pleasure of working with a well- organized and motivated team, working together to ensure that every retail pharmacy chain we serviced was able to meet the needs of their customers with increased productivity and proficiency."
good,Long hours. Low pay. Not really somewhere you can grow professional.
good,"Just go in and do your job and go home.  It is an average place to work.  The more you know how to do, the larger the work load will be.  You will not get substantial pay for your knowledge.  If your co-worker is entered as the same job title, it doesn't necessarily mean you will carry the same work load.  The best thing to do is keep everything as professional as possible and leave all personal feelings at the door."
good,"If you are located in Dublin or in the DC's or the plants, fairly good place to work. Fast paced with lots of opportunities. Good luck on your search."
good,"Always working long hours , don't really have days off to rest your body up. Managers that control the departments are unorganized, don't get enough breaks ."
good,Too much work with not enough employees. Forced OT and weekends. Most employees are great to work with but employees are too much in a rush. Constantly short staffed.
good,"Senior leadership burdened by the needs of wall street. Continually make decisions to impact current performance, jeopardizing the long term. Numerous positions being sent offshore or outsourced."
good,Very intense place to work especially with the board of directors and the assistant secretary.  Mistakes were not forgiven.  The culture was very old thinking and not wanting to make changes.
good,"Overall it seemed ok to me but not sure how much I would recommend it to anyone.   The facility I worked at still has the same problems.  I left and came back hoping to advance my career there and help them be better but did not get anywhere, therefore I had to move on which was too bad because there is so much opportunity to improve the place."
good,Good place to work.  Good work life balance and benefits.  Pay is not great and it can be difficult to advance without the right organizational allies
good,Not a great place to work. The culture is lazy and leadership lacks vision. The company built a business around a loophole and is not very innovative.
good,I have been working here for going on three years now and at first it was good. Lead switches and managers lying to get people written up leads to bad blood between regular employees and their supervisors. Job turnover rate is high also because the us alot of temps and just get ride of them whenever they want to.
good,Pay is way to low for what you do there and responsibility that are put on you. Sick oay and vacation time is nice but I'd rather have a week off and make more money.
good,"Worked in quality, cardinal went to 12 hours, that is when all their problems started. From recalls, customer complaints, fda right up, product mistakes on prod. Floor. Enjoyed working in r+d from other customers. Management not supportive/enjoyed people+days off."
good,"Worked from 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. which was really, really long, I learned how to use a order picker even though we were up in the warehouse 20 plus feet, Loved management until my boss ended up leaving"
good,"Cardinal health is one of the more difficult places I have worked for. They expect a lot out of their employees, but if you are up for the challenge you can learn a lot."
good,"In my case, my supervisor gave me the flexibility to work on my projects and since I was a college student, working hours were also flexible. Sadly, I wasn't paid and HR never asked or offered."
good,This company used to be a wonderful place to work but they have done so much restructuring and adding of responsibilities on employees that it is very difficult to perform your job on a daily basis. One minute your safe in your role and the next minute they pull the rug out from under you.
good,"If you want a life outside of work, then this place is not for you..."
good,This company seems to be ran by a sinking ship full of rats. Communication between management and associates is often poor. Associate training isn't always completed in a timely fashion.
good,"The job overall has great benefits, for there employees, the job can be very stressful at times. Company attends to not treat there employees very nice, demands a lot of hours, not allowing for much of a life outside of work"
good,A good place if you are interested in PTO but not a good place if you do not like working harder than others and getting paid the same with no acknowledgement. Limited advancement opportunities and limited disciplinary actions for unmotivated employees.
good,This is a nice job with opportunity to advance but with the commute I don't get to see my kids. Being a divorcee I need something that allows me to see them.
good,"The Director of the Facility was very benevolent.  Lots of on-site celebrations including BBQs in the summer, Thanksgiving feast that including deep fried turkey and Christmas luncheon.  Great luncheon provided on inventory days (2 per year)."
good,Found myself in a management job with no decision making Many layers of decision makers Deals stalled because of the layers and the red tape. Not very flexible or nimble. Good programs but poor execution
good,"The upper management portrays that they care for the employees. They cater food for the employees on special occasions. Superbowl, Thanksgiving, and other holidays. However, when the volume of orders are overwhelming, workers don't get the chance to take a break or being reprimanded if they don't get back to their station right away."
good,"We offer a great product, and employees are professional and experienced. Regretfully, our leadership is not able to make decisions. The communication we have needs significant improvement instead."
good,"high turn around rate, that usually mean long hours most day you are working 10 plus hours a day. The one positive thing about this job is the do have good benefits and great PTO. you start of with at least 24 days of when you start."
good,This company is focused on staying in the position it has held as a supplier. Long hours can be expected with a relaxed working environment. Employees develop personal relationships and give the workplace a family atmosphere.
good,es una gran empresa con puntos a mejorar como lo son los lideres y supervisores
good,"Cardinal Health in McDonough, Ga work was not bad"
good,"Management was poor and often absent in meetings. You had to rely on co-workers for any help. If you made a mistake, it was pinned on you and could hinder from any advancement."
good,"work load was very hard.  there production system was very outdated.  The work load was terrible,  they need to develop a work flow schedule that would allow there staffs body to recover and not burn out so many employees."
good,"Each day we downloaded trailers to separate the product and put it in the designated area, I learned how to operate the cherry picker, and also how to be more productive, management was poor because they did not have enough experience. the culture there was good, everybody was almost Mexicans so we get along with everybody. the hardest part of the job was that everyone was looking for an excuse to report. the most enjoyable part of the job was that it was easy to learn and to talk with some other co-workers."
good,"Unfair to employees. Management dished out a pay raise to 2nd shift and said forget 1st shift. If you're going to dish out a pay raise to 2nd shift, you should be fair and give it to everyone! Inventory manager sits on her behind all day either texting or on Facebook. Horrible communication Skills if any."
good,"I used to work night shift there, which explains my low score on work/life balance. It was mediocre. A couple of the managers there were a little bit too interested in micromanaging. The picking system is severely flawed because one pick location counts as one pick, no matter how many items you have to pick from that location. They're timing your picks and they take issue with you taking too long, never mind that you had to pick 70 or 80 cases from a single location. But it's 1 pick so they expect it to be picked within a minute or two. The place is extremely dusty and dirty too for a medical warehouse. I ended up with staph infection in my ear piercing due to all of the dust."
good,"Cardinal Health doesn't reward you with a competitive package, not a good place for career advancement unless you're willing to work at the corporate office."
good,I've been employed  with this company since it brought out y formal company Medtronic and since then i have nothing but good thing to say about it. It's a joy to be apart of the team.
good,It's a fast-pace environment. The work isn't hard. I didn't like not know what time I was getting off work. The vacation time was good. Second shift just became very hectic for me.
good,"A typical workday consists of setting up routes for the day and then setting up QC station to test samples of medicine to leave the building. Putting in stops into the computer program Cheetah for each driver to perform routes that are driven to be done efficiently. Along the way I have learned how to perform QC, shipping/packaging, and dispatching while using the computer program Isotrac to complete these tasks. It can sometimes be a challenge with all of the different personalities that are within the location in which I am based out of but it makes for a great way to learn and understand one another. The most enjoyable part of my job is the teamwork that I have with my co-workers and the fun that we can have all while accomplishing one goal of satisfying the consumer"
good,mandatory overtime daily. they turn over rate is very high. the pay is good but u will never have time to spend it. the management is not for the people. they are very cold hearted & mean
good,"I enjoy my department, receiving. It's sort of laid back but at the same time challenging. It tests your physical abilities and some mental also. I enjoy my day to day."
good,Stressful and bad hours but fun at times. There seems to be a very high turnover with the sales department. Upper management is not consistent. Negative sales people
good,"I liked what the company stood for, but the management at the facility I worked at had very poor communication skills and did not treat us equal. If you have a family, then don't even bother applying. They work you 12 hours a day with a lot of overtime."
good,"this company is a huge corporate conglomerate that has bought other companies and taken over with their corporate politics.  your work/life balance and happiness are greatly impacted by the specific region you work in.  the same job title at 2 different locations, can have either a 1 star or 5 star experience."
good,In the past management has been great. They have since retired and the young managers do not hold people accountable for the work they should be doing
good,"nice place to work, poor management. very good people to work with, lot of ot work life balance not good..............................................."
good,The work environment was always fast paced and there was always something to do. Many of the work environment was managed by good supervisors. The job is intense if there are not many people working in an area.
good,"The pay is not as great, but the work environment was decent. The management is not overbearing and only wants you to reach your production goals. Benefits were subpar."
good,"worked there for 24yrs, has its ups and downs work life balance not good ,hours are long 10 to 13hr days, people are nice built long term relationships."
good,A healthcare facility in Olive Branch that is a completely different environment from the day I was offered a position with the company.
good,Cardinal is good place to work but I just did not feel it was for me. I did not see much chance to advance and I did not feel like the management team was very involved in working with me to better myself. I just wanted a more upbeat environment that I can make a larger impact with.
good,Cardinal Health is very customer driven and always changing. The operation is up to date with LSS practices and the growth rate for an individual is there if the person is willing to relocate with every advancement.
good,Tremendous opportunity to grow and develop with an expanding pharmacy. The team of Certified Pharmacy Technicians and Pharmacists are very committed to excellent patient service.
good,"Ok work place, but very busy and high work load, employees are good people. The days go by very quickly .Management although is disconnected from the needs of the business. Therefore company and employees raises are neglected ."
good,"Can be a great starter job but there is no room to grow unless you are a favorite, only .40 cent a year raises make it hard to make any real money"
good,Working for Cardinal Health has been a great experience. I enjoy my co workers and helping out the customers and sales team.
good,"Cardinal Health is divided into Pharmacy and Medical segments, each with it's own CEO, with a Chairman and CEO at the top.  The two segments are vastly different in management style, market strategy, commitment to customers, innovation, and mission clarity."
good,"They look for ""yes"" men.  They do not embrace change and ideas unless it comes from the top.  They do not listen to their employees."
good,"Great people to work with, really exciting products."
good,"Typical work day included either day light or night shift rotations. "
good,"Fast pace, working as a team, and helping as a team effort.  Little help from management.  Do workers all worked well with me, was very well accepted  Hardest part of job really wasn't any.  Very fast and busy, long hours. Dinners, meeting, prizes and good pay.  Only difficult part, was they were slowly screening out older workers, not letting them work till retirement age.  Using increased timing and production which did not suit the associate, at that point in time."
good,Hard to advance within company unless you have a degree no matter experience or tenure. Layoffs and reorganization constantly.  Insurance increases each year but raises remain the same very minimal.
good,"Cold calling, being a one stop shop sales representative, selling Cardinal brand products/services, scheduling visits/meeting with material managers, and being a problem solver/customer service contact were my daily responsibilities."
good,The people are lovely to work with. The management was always a money first people second environment however.
good,a positive upbeat environment just job stability is not guaranteed
good,Interact with many people on a daily basis. Provide a logistics to different locations within the company. Learn about Regulatory Req for aNDA and products. Great management team.
good,"My co-workers were very friendly, the job was very easy and I learned it fast."
good,Learned a great deal of information about healthcare environment and how to apply yourself in sales.  Taught to be very organized with such a large workload of administrative work.
good,A day at cardinal health was very much the same thing daily punch in and immediately start working. Everything was repetitive so once you learn the process it was easy. The job was pretty easy and self explanatory.
good,"Started working 8 hour days, but after a warehouse was closed the hours moved to 12 to 15 hour days a little long if you have a family. Co -workers are good but there is a big turn over due to hours and shift changes. Hardest part of the job is keeping your numbers up but if you can balance your work load you will be ok. I enjoyed working with the people I met there are a lot of good people there."
good,learning new things as the years went by. Management not practice what he says. wont say hi to employees unless he likes them.
good,The pay is low and the hours unpredictable; at least it is on night shift. You work till completion which varies greatly. High burnout from excessive overtime.
good,easy job expects to much out of you when they give so little. management is nice to work with. but silent slave drivers.
good,The job itself was stressful at times but fun and ever changing. The co workers were great and lower management was amazing. The pay wasn`t very good considering one mistake could get you fired and ruin hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of product in one second.
good,"Too incoming calls in high call environment, my immediate supervisor was great, the benefits package was awesome"
good,"a typical day consist of warehouse worker( floor picking) workng there i learned to be consistant and most acurrate as possible. Co-workers easy going and friendly...i would say the hardest part of the job was picking thousands of material for each order to complete for assembly line and if one or two pieces missing, we as the pickers would have stop what order we currently worked on and get those materials that were missing. the most enjoyable part was be able to work alone at your on paste. also able to work hands on to complete job and being able to interact with employees while completing work."
good,Team work environment setting. As well as fast paced. Production hours are mostly made every day and night. Very repetative
good,Cardinal Health is a good place to work and they have good benefits.
good,Working for Cardinal Health was quite an experience especially it being my first warehouse job. The benefits were phenomenal indeed which lessened the aggrevation of the work hours length.
good,"Due to the opiate lawsuits, many employees are being laid off. I feel they could have done better than that and retained values employees. Other positions were not offered unless you applied for something."
good,"Came in a few months before the restructure. Was excited to start working and welcomed by everyone and team. During training the company began to restructure, this affected the general happiness and overall morale of the environment."
good,managed reports. answered emails and phone calls. placed orders by phone and emails. responded back to any questions co workers and customers had. enjoyable part were some of my co workers.
good,Flexible working hours and provide some relaxing environment in work place. company is reduce cost and outsourcing jobs in order for higher management to get bonus.
good,"The company (my location at least) is seriously held back by management. They've hired only external candidates for our leadership positions which creates a lot of internal problems. While the pay is ok starting out,a decent amount other companies in the industry pay more."
good,"The company gives you plenty of holiday time (23 paid days) and benefits, but you have no room to grow in the company, and the finance dept is severely understaffed. They also started shifting jobs from the US to Manilla, so there are less hands on deck here to help resolve issues as a team."
good,typical day is the same as always some heavier and some lighter days. they took out the conveyors and automation which is now all manual. you learn how to use a RF device and possibly power equipment. Management sucked always go over each others head. Does not know how to manage and sits back in the desk or socialized more than anything. Hardest is dealing with management when they think they are always right and knows what's best. people did not care and took as much time which makes everyone stay until orders are completed. enjoying sometimes is probably some people at the time.
good,In less you feel like working your life away do not I repeat do not work at cardinal health some of the supervisors are awesome some are not so much we are mandatory 16 hours of over time so you have decent checks but standing for 12 hours or more sucks
good,"Cardinal Health is a great place to work temporarily, short term, or even long term if you are okay with low opportunity for advancement. This company, like many others, tells folks that they love to promote from within. This statement is mostly true, but in their larger facilities, you have to keep in mind that there may be hundreds of other bottom-level associates, most of which are going for the same promotions an ambitious person will be going for."
good,If you get stuck with a bad manager they can have a negative impact on your career because no one will want to hire you for another role at the company.
good,"They have great benefits as far as health and dental insurance, 401k, but very poor salary. Not very good chance that you can grow with in the company."
good,"Cardinal Health offers a great benefit package and I was very impressed with it.  Opportunities for advancement are slim and management really plays the ""favorites"" game. Hourly pay rate is low and seems to seldom or never adjust.  The job itself was interesting and the folks I worked with very supportive and fun."
good,I was blessed to work for Cardinal as they allowed me to transfer back up to Oregon. I was in charge of helping to open up a new distribution center where I thought I was going to have the option to go into management but was quickly denied once I made the move from Cali to Oregon
good,The only thing with working here is that you have no time off the phones and the pay is low. They have a ceiling that you reach and that is it. Hard to get better paying jobs within the company.
good,"They teach you how to use many different type forklift  and                                                                 "
good,"Could definitely improve on communication from chain of command, Need more resources so management can focus on managing but besides those little things its an overall great company! Everyone has room for improvement so its a stepping stone to success!"
good,"If you are in a medical field, give it a try. Nuclear Medicine is fascinating and exciting work. It all depends on you manager and the people at your location whether your job experience is positive or negative."
good,La empresa en PR no valora los años de servivios y la gerencia ea povo confiable. Los jefes no se comunican efectivamentr con los empleados
good,"company is well established, shipping and receiving of pharmaceutical products, hours are very long strenuous, work is available, overtime is available"
good,"A good place to work, management is fine, pay could be better.  The medical is lousy and you pay mostly out of pocket even though a lot of your check goes into paying for it."
good,"was a great place to work at, now theirs a new plant manager there he doesn't care about the employees like our old manger.i guessing with the new start times for everybody he think he can cut down on the over time."
good,"Involved in daily production of rapid use nuclear medicine, dose drawing, radiation safety, and dispatch of time critical nuclear medicine for area hospitals.  Worked closely with pharmacists in dose procurement, quick response dose production, automated quality control, computerized inventory and set up for as needed drug products. Worked with the radiation safety officer to check, correct, standardize and record the daily quality and production logs, contamination control and the onsite waste tracking system."
good,I enjoyed working with Cardinal Health it was a good company. The people I worked with were team players and we were able to meet our deadlines when required as a team. My manager was easy to talk to when I needed help or had an issue.
good,"I developed my skills and acquired all of the knowledge to become a supervisor, but was denied the opportunity. All of this after Managing the shift through out the year. All employees reported to me, I allocated all of the work and resources. Manifested all of the bills, set up freight trucks, as well as all closing managerial responsibilities."
good,"Company offers good paid time off.  The most enjoyable part of my work is getting to know different cultures, since there is around 42 different nationalities."
good,"Overall, Cardinal is a good company.  Currently restructuring, and I happen to get caught up in the integration transition.  Good benefits and a global operation."
good,"very stressful work atmosphere, you are working with doctors and selling medical equipment that are saving peoples lives and its very critical that orders are correct."
good,"Although it was an interesting place to work, it was also undergoing a change from SP Pharmaceutical, LLC to Cardinal Health.  People were nervous about staying on after the change."
good,The job isn't difficult. The benefits and time off are a plus. Using the time off isn't easy. The hours are tough. There is plenty of overtime offered.
good,Good hours but not much family time unless you are in management. Lets you do your job without to much overseeing. Nice eqiupment to work with. Fellow coworkers were very nice.
good,"The less you interact with some of the people there, the better.  Favoritism with this place is heavy.  The good people get laid off, while the people with write ups and final warnings are still working there who have been milking the clock."
good,"Pretty cool place to work, a lot of good people. Management was good for the most part, other than one bad seed which I've heard doesn't work there anymore so that's good."
good,Things were getting better and more organized when Lean six sigma was introduced.  dock out times were almost always on time when LSS was introduced.  good morale
good,"the day starts with stretches and roll call then the supervisors talk about productivity and company events."
good,Nice place to work.But people do work until task.And you my end up working a 15 hours shift.Compensation is really low.And the raise are yearly.Job security wise a place to be.
good,The hours are long many on call days but overall the experience was very good.  I learned a lot and was a great foundation that led to my current position with another accompany.  All and All I cannot complain.  Working for Cardinal Health I learn that I work well under pressure.  Job was very challenging but it had its rewards to.
good,"hard work but good co-workers. strict attendance policy. They feed you very often.  some good managers, some bad. High turnover on night shift due to attendance policy"
good,"Cardinal Health is a company driven by productivity and is not a company that promotes a friendly atmosphere. The management is a hands off type of management, they leave you to your job and do not supply direction."
good,"I've worked in a few departments at Cardinal Health and each is very different. Some are very relaxed and easy going with taking time off, others stifle your upward mobility and won't let you cross train. Get a feel for the specific department before applying to a position."
good,"Great working environment.  No opportunity for any real advancement.  But I work with some of the coolest and most diverse group of people. I sell around $15,000 day, but the compensation plan is below market."
good,"Cardinal Health is a great company to work for, there are a few areas that good be improved,the benefits are great from day one, however, the compensation plan is not the greatest. The most you can possibly get is 3%. They give you a flexible work schedule and for some departments you get a good life balance."
good,"Easy job "
good,They do not work with you in any way what's so ever. They have no pitty on there employees. I will never work for them again.
good,To start out it was ok. Worked 4 days a week 10 hour shifts. The two shifts would have huddle together. Then they stopped that.  Always making changes to our schedule. Now 5 days a week 8 or more hours a day. Between 1st and 2nd shift there is a 1 hour and 30 minutes of no one working. If your out of high school good job to start out if you have no kids or not married. No work life balance at all. Lots of overtime. Lean Management. They have a hard time keeping people to stay working there. Need to pay your employees more for all the heavy lifting and walking around you do. Be prepared to walk an average of 5 or more miles a day.
good,its not what they describe in the ad and they use old metal carts people push around.. they get in a hurry and you can get hit by someone else's cart.
good,Employees great to work with. Management sloppy. Very disorganized. Management doesn't listen to complaints/ideas.
good,"Very long hours, work/life balance is extremely complicated. Opportunities to promote yourself within. Alot of physical work. You learn alot of new things. The management could be better"
good,Safe working environment.  Production is stressed but there in no incentive pay for how many lines that are getting picked. Long hours in steel-toe boots but you get 3 days off. Management only cares about numbers. I left because I was being harassed by one of their supervisors who I believe is know longer with the company Compensation is decent.
good,company has outstanding training. Lots of products. Always something to learn and do. Many different divisions for those who wish to transfer between divisions.
good,I enjoy helping our customers getting recalled items removed from their inventory. The information contained in our notifications are very important and avoids any harm or danger to our customers.
good,Processing orders as well as doing them. There was never a duel moment here at Cardinal Health for the fact we helped one another achieve goals and set records. The whole job was a new experience to me because it was my first warehouse job out of high school. The upper management treated me with respect and encouragement. The coworkers were very reasonable and or helpful but till this day we keep in contact. Hardest part of the job was leaving to experience a new area to live. Enjoyed the company and coworkers.
good,"The company has no structure"
good,No room for advancement and the management played favorites and didn't offer a friendly atmophere for diversity in my department.
good,"Would rather not work there. Dublin, OH headquarters do not understand the work loads and all the hard work the employees put in everyday."
good,I absolutely love my job and you won't find a better place to send your loved ones. However it's the compensation that sucks! Cardinal is the lowest paid skilled nursing facility in all of NC! No 90 day review and no annual review.
good,Pay is very good.  Excellent 401k and stock incentives.  Also have a very good tuition reimbursement program.  Would go back.
good,"Working in the morning shift we starting around 1:30 am. This is the time where Techs will clean pharmacy work spaces before dispensing pharmaceuticals.by 2:00 am the pharmacist on duty will have made kits in which the techs will dispense the pharmaceuticals from. By around 4:00 depending on the speed a courier will deliver PET the techs will then begin dispensing PET. If needed during dispensing techs will package doses, process incoming packages, processing and shipping out going packages. After deliveries techs will do a list of daily duties along with handing returning packages of empty doses."
good,"There wasn't really much of a work/life balance, we were always working 10 to 12 hours daily. It seems as though management was very unorganized. There was always a lot of drama and management didn't know how to handle it. It takes a long time to move up in any position or to learn new things."
good,"I used to enjoy coming in to work. Everyone for the most part is very friendly. Management was very good when I first started working for cardinal health. I am only supposed to work 10 hour days (four days a week). In the beginning there was over-time an hour or hour and a half daily which I did not mind. Now there is excessive overtime we are working 13-14 hours daily. It is getting out of hand. There has been a lot of changes in the company from when I started to now. It is not the same people in management, my supervisors left. We are always having new staff in our department. People do not last long in the department I work in. I always see new faces. Our department works all holidays. One thing that I don't like about where I work is that they do not want to work something out with you're schedule if you go to school. It is really tough having to work 14 hour days and then waking up early to go to school and getting you're homework done. Also where is the time to study? I have been wanting to go to school, but i have not gone because i am scared I will not be able to handle both. The hardest part of my job is dealing with all the favoritism there is at work between the supervisors and associates. Also managing you're job and personal life outside of work."
good,If you like long hours and working night shift this is the job for you. The work wasn't hard to learn and it is a nice company to work for.
good,its a medical supply warehouse with multiple hospitals requirements and needs being satisfied is the ultimate goal. there is a satisfaction to being involved in the healthcare sector.
good,"The job was not hard, but they made it a habit to lie for absolutely no reason. mistreated and constantly belittled you if it seemed fit."
good,"The company has provided me with valuable work experience and contacts/networking. It is a typical large corporate culture which can lead to decisions being made without considering how they will affect employees. Most employees are hard working and help out when needed. Team building is a little lacking in some business units. Scheduling is flexible, but the road time is getting too much."
good,This is a team oriented work place. It is a good place to work.
good,"It's a great company that adheres stringently to the rules, for the most part.  The benefits are fantastic.  The main downside is that it is a typical corporate situation where the biggest brown nose gets promoted to a managerial position.  The further you are from the corporate office, the more the management fails."
good,Theres no where to go in the company. The management doesn't listen. It pays well but wasn't worth it.
good,"Typical day could range from 10-15 hours start to finish."
good,"I did stock checks, order entry, product returns, complaints, and quality assurance over the phone.  It was a great place to work for until our health prememiums started skyrocketing and we started losing benefits and finally the job was outsouced to the Phillippines."
good,Work is work. They always ask employees for feedback on making the company better.
good,Does not seem to attract the best and brightest. Mid level management has very little power to do much of anything.
good,"The environment was extremely fast paced to the point were software applications and products were rushed to implementation at times and therefore caused more work. Emphasis was more on ""big wins"" to display to upper management than it was on taking the time to deliver a quality product."
good,"I'd like to begin by saying that I did enjoy the job that I was performing and the oppertunity to expand my knowlegde on the operation of machines in a warehouse setting. I was unfortunately a ""temp"" and was unable to recieve benefits and was primarily working the night shift (would much prefer morning and afternoon shifts). Due to the fact that I am a temp, management does not offer much assitance when a problem arises."
good,"A typical day at work would be doing kronos, write ups, doing customer complaints. I had to expadite work to ensure that work got done on time. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, we helped each other and discussed things that we were doing in our prospective areas. This allowed us to calaboraite and come up with thing that may help each other suceed. The hardest part of the job would be the amount of people that I was over (70-80) and the amount of paper work that was required. This didn't allow a lot of time for me to be able to mentor, coach, and be on the producion floor as much as I wanted to be. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to be on the floor so that I could observe the process and help make changes."
good,"The first two levels of employees get it.  The C Suite seems to get it.  Those ""people"" in between seem to have gotten stuck in self colo-rectal examinations."
good,Putting together Medical Kits demands constant attention to detail. At all times we must complete our work without mistake. Lives depend upon it. Thus it makes the job both complex and enjoyable to see the end result.
good,"The start of shift begins with a group meeting to discuss any challenges of the shift. There are many areas of that require attn. to detail that you may be trained in on the fly to finish the days work. Breaks are staggered to keep peoples on the floor as much as needed for drivers or direction. Supervisors show up if there is a problem,otherwise your left to work. Some co-workers will work hard to get things done on time while other will take time to get overtime as they see fit. The most enjoyable part is knowing that your helping people get what they need to stay alive ."
good,I worked a very flexible schedule. My manager was very knowledgeable. I was laid off so job security was always a risk. 
good,It's a great place to work if you work for the right people. Working out of corporate headquarters in Ohio is a must if you want to continue to move up in the organization. Worked with a lot of great people.
good,"Nice place to work, fun people great benefit package. Cardinal Health offers a qualified canidate a stable source of income, but you will earn it."
good,"I would have to say it was a fun & exciting. my learning experiances were great & somewhat challenging, training the new hires and still doin my job duties as a picker."
good,Its usally a long day with little to learn. The hours constantly change and dont allow you to have a personal life. The co workers for the most part all good people.
good,"Well my jobs changed. It was cool but managment was not very nice. When asked for your opion and you give yours their came a penalty with it. Thats just not right. I had an idea to make things in shipping smoother and they tried to remove me from that department. My supervisor stood up and told them I was his MIP and I was not going anywhere!! He was a good man. The co-workers where alright, but they never lasted long. We always had a big turn over because no one would stick around."
good,"very regimented, cookbook work atmosphere. good company."
good,"Typical work day is 8 to 10 hrs. Co-workers are great they actually make the day go by faster. My job isn't hard at all, i work in the refrigerator off to myself which gives me peace of mind and time to think."
good,"Daily reports were done. Management was decent at not micro-managing. Not stringent to be tied down to specific break times. Learned a lot about the pharmaceutical distribution industry and inventory management/control. Also, exposed to systems that were new to me. The training I received was average. However, I was able to learn much on my own and then was able to train others on my discoveries. Co-workers were overall eficient, friendly and knowledgeable. I really enjoyed all of the learning experiences presented to me with this company. The hardest part was every 6 months when we did physical inventory (PI) of all warehouse merchandise."
good,The employees whom I had the pleasure of working for were very kind and sincere. I liked my co-workers. I was most impressed by how well I was able to adapt to their surroundings. It was an experience that I will never forget. I think they will remember me. That is what I found very nice.
good,Cardinal Health as a whole does not really know what is going on in the different business units in controls. NPS was a great place to work with numerous talented and motivated employees. The management to VP level of NPS doesnt grasp the reality of the day to day sales operations due to the fact it is a very ops driven business unit with very little respect to the sales teams ability and road blocks
good,Would have liked to have a lot more overtime. Need to look for part-time weekend job hopefully 6 hours like to work at grocery stores that are close midnight shift
good,Just stick to yourself an no one will tell you anything. Even sometimes if the place feels like its secured and ran properly it isnt just do what you usually do and leave.
good,"Good culture, good management, willing to train for better job positions, drug free work environment, plenty of hours, work activities, work get togethers."
good,They know how to work life balance. They  have awesome benefits. Have quiet rooms for meditation. They have one hour  lunch breaks. They dont have micromanagement.
good,I came into this place for a certain job and there was 2 new guys myself included the other guy went on to do the job i applied for and i got thrown in the back which i did not appreciatebit was pretty hard work considering what i was getting paid wasnt the average for box stackers it was well below.
good,I don’t work there anymore it’s a fast pace walking standing lifting kind of job management they’re not good they promise you so many stuff and you could be there two years and you’re still stuck doing the same thing they always give you bad valuation too much gossip problems and you tell management and they don’t do nothing about it that’s why I gave my two weeks notice They don’t have to my choices thundering there
good,My experience at Cardinal Health is like a roller coaster. Management is always changing and you go in at a certain time but your out time depends on when the work is completed. They may implement something but they are not consistent with it. You don't have much of work/home life balance because we work long hours.
good,The people are nice and great to work with everyday. The pay is not competitive when I check other comparable positions.  Second shift is hard to get used to.
good,"New leadership, eroding culture, low job security especially as you age. Move towards increased outsourcing. Business volatility due to ongoing litigation."
good,Company allows for opportunity to grow and opportunity to shadow the department of your choice to familiarize yourself with the process and expectations of the desired department of interest.
good,"Great benefits, Great location, Well known company, Nice company car to use when delivery to hospitals. Flexible work hours, a lot of PTO time, and team work."
good,didnt care to have this job. they were very picky about clocking in.  worked six seven days a week but wasn't paid for some of those days. i would not have anybody work for this place
good,Great benefits and time off.  Company is changing and evolving with the healthcare industry.  Numerous groups to join and extremely inclusive culture.
good,Cardinal is a very diverse company. Very busy and productive day in and day out. It is very fulfilling when we accommodate our customer without any issue. The hardest part is when we don't meet the customer's expectations due to shortage of products. The most enjoyable part is when we deliver and accomplished our task in time and that makes customer very happy. \
good,"If you are looking for a decent job, the Cardinal health isnt bad. You work 10 hour shifts, but have to stay over and help the other side of the warehouse if they are not finished, causing you to get over time. The benefits are pretty decent."
good,"Would be great if they allowed you to do your work. Management does not make decisions in a timely manner, usually affects the outcome to your day to day."
good,The management team makes it harder and uncomfortable to work and they show a lot of favoritism and can come off as racist.the job itself is real easy
good,"Overall a good company, lot of daily challenges due to the size of the company. Benefits are good and the culture is good - based on location. The only drawback would be pay."
good,If you a pay attention to ur work and safety but don't mind the overtime u will enjoy the place. Just remember why u are there keep ur personal business to urself.
good,The environment is comfortable and the culture is excellent.Everyone tries as much as possible to work as a team. A growing organization with lots of change! You must love change!
good,Not to bad in training but after you get on the floor it very different your on the phone all day you can’t even go the bathroom if your over your break you get 2 10 and a lunch to me it was model day salary the manager are slow and not good enough trained you just on the phone all day so please get water they very serious about politics so use your pto wisely and it to strict.
good,"Hard to rate this employer as I only worked relief. The employees I did work with I loved. Great group of nurses,etc. The nurses are great and miss working with them on a daily basis."
good,Cardinal Health is a good place to work for trial and error. They're currently working on internal customer service and treating their employees fair. I've learned and taken on a lot of roles and I am ready to move forward to better opportunities.
good,Shift manager have his favorite employees...some people can get away with things..good workers seem to be treated badly while favorite can talk n not do their work while other pull up the slack..
good,Worked as a Pharmacy Associate/Driver for 8 months and I learned alot about the company. It's definitely a great place to learn about medicine and radioactive medicine but pay and hours were not worth it.
good,It is a great working experience that I have obtained at Cardinal health. I worked here as a pricing analyst in pharm department. Working environment in my team was great.
good,Don't get involved with all the drama that happens there and mind your own business you should be okay .they  have some nice people that work there.they also have snobs.
good,"Cardinal caters to their local customer but often times the local Cardinal teams are unable, or unwilling, to address issues on behalf of the customer to the corporate decision makers.  "
good,"I left Cardinal Health in 2013 due to favoritism poor management and the heavy workload the one thing that I did miss is the people that I worked with I got very close to the girls I worked with and we would eat lunch every day and we had a good rapport ."
good,Nice place to work at.  Company I worked for spun off from cardinal health.  Cardinal Health was okay to work for but its definitely a bog corporate monster company.
good,"•	elaxed and productive atmosphere. ..."
good,worked in the companies warehouse to check inventory of the medical products being shipped to other locations. worked on gaining knowledge on how shipping was completed that I use now at my current employers.
good,As a contractor the balance between departments did not exist unless you enforced it. Management did not enforce the collaboration even when you provided proof of the need. Although I had push back I showed the importance by being consistent.
good,"strict about matrix results."
good,"OK company to work for. Depending on your position, there could be little home life. Plenty of opportunity to grow, and advance within the company, with or without a degree."
good,"The company is not so bad only for a couple of managers that  runied the place by making changes that in my opinion made the company how backwards. The pay was also not good for a family that is trying to progress, but for a single person it's a great place to start."
good,"For the most part a good place to work, pay is ok for the area, management leaves a bit to be desired. Overtime is forced and can be excessive with short or no notice with threat of repercussions if not worked. Forced to use PTO sick time to cover overtime if not able to work. Two weeks PTO consumed each year for plant shut down. Cheaper health insurance through Obamacare then using company health plan. High level of PTO for new hires."
good,"Worked to enhance IT security company wide.  The company took IT security seriously worked constantly to improve security for the company, vendors and employees."
good,"If you grew up in Cardinal, you were in a good spot. If you were a part of an acquisition, things could be difficult once the transition honeymoon was over."
good,No advancement opportunity. Working at too fast paced . Have to wait too long for advancement . Pay was too little for amount of work to be done . Have too work nights for a long time before going to days.
good,"good job its long hours and no reguards to your home life, its benefits are not that good and benefits are not good. The aisle are long and hard on your feet"
good,"There motto ""if you got time to lean then you have time to clean"". Even though everything was clean and spotless and the work day was practically over if there was 10mins left in your day they wanted you to pretend to work on something to look busy. Most enjoyable part was some of the friends I made. I covered many departments everyday on a normal workday but wasn't paid accordingly and was never made full time. And seemed like they wanted to clear the lunch room out 5 mins before your 30min lunch was over."
good,"No work life/personal life balance. Warehouse job. Fast paced. You had a quota to meet as expected in a warehouse, if you didn't meet it you didn't move up. Its been a long time."
good,"Work at yourself velocity , with no supervisory,  for as long as your route last, with a not good paying but with a long list of exigencies on insurances,  certificates and vehicle conditions."
good,I dont wish to do a review but I am feeling forced and I don't like that as well. I literally have nothing to say other then try the place for yourself.
good,Very easy work second shift hours is hard to work if you have a family everyone is welcoming when you start and they push you to do your best job security is good
good,"I have worked for Cardinal Health for several years.  As a pharmacist, I have learned so much including different pharmacy systems. My coworkers are very hard working and knowledgeable.  We all help each other and build each other as a team."
good,Tough quotas and always worrying about losing your job if you didn't hit your monthly sales goals.  The bonus structure was a joke and it only benefited the organization not the individual who worked to achievement goals and expect a nice monthly bonus on top of the commission.
good,Cardinal bought Medtronic with a vision to take this new company to the top.  They push to get orders out on time with minimal quality issues.  Accountability and teamwork is a must.
good,It is okay company  to work for. Been there 3 years just need well looking for something better.just in need of a change. They do not go by sonority . They go by who best fits the position
good,"The company is great overall, but as you get through the layers of management, the culture gets lost and changed.  It is difficult to advance unless you are at a manager level or above.  Although the culture states they want engagement, your metrics will suffer if you engage and do anything but your job.  pay is decent although not equitable.  work schedule can be flexible.  we are always told we have no money as a department and as a company."
good,a typical workday is never knowing what time you are going to get off work. Management needs managing as well because they can be unorganized at times.
good,overall this a great company that offers entrepreneurial opportunities for employees to venture into broader roles and responsibilities. There are inherent challenges here as in any organization but overall a great place to work.
good,Pull orders in fast pace timely manner. How to operate different machine equipment. Management was ok I guess. Work place was a decent place to work. Picking orders for 12 to 14 hrs. a day can be a pain. Me and some of my employees making it through the day and still smiling was enjoyable.
good,My old site was a nice place to work for the most of it but I was wrongfully discharged after 6 years from corporate eve. Thou I was never late always early and never called off
good,"Although I enjoyed the actual work that I did at cardinal, there was a very competitive work environment encouraged there, which at times, bordered on hostile. I understand that some people thrive in these kinds of environments, but it just wasn't a good fit for me personally, They do wonderful, interesting work there, but I don't want to have to put down my co-workers in order to move ahead. I also found the health benefits to be lacking. Incredibly high deductibles, especially for the premiums I paid, and I was forced to fill prescriptions at CVS or pay much higher copays. I don't think that's fair."
good,productive and it was fast paced you had to pick the oders by a certain times so the trucks wouldn't be late the management was ok the hardest part of the job was tryna to get caught up if we got behind and the most enjoyable part of the job was working in different departments
good,"a typical work day started off with management, sorting orders but not being aware if there was enough work for the entire shift. Employees were moved constantly."
good,"No comment, no comments about the company when i work there the guys amd ladies i work with was supportive of us as temps they were kind and cool folks"
good,"-A typical day at work is to be busy in the morning, busy in the afternoon and busy at night."
good,When I first started in 2011 i loved it and within the past yr or so managers were changing which clearly were not manager material. The benefits were great and hourly pay was good too.
good,The company is continually growing and currently is struggling with finding good candidates to fill the open positions. Cardinal strives to make sure that they provide the best service to our customers. It can be a struggle for the employees when there are many new hires to get them up st speed and this causes overtime which is hard on balancing life and work.
good,has no advancement or benefits to grow with the company. Manager Micromanages workers to the point of making a stressful work environment. low moral between workrs.
good,"Very fast paced continuous inbound calls, Just wanted to get in and assist as many customers as possible. The better assistance provided to the customer makes the atmosphere better to adhere. Be supportive and open minded to learning"
good,Was a nice work environment up until there was talk of relocation and information was withheld from employees.  The work itself is simple if you are willing to learn and retain information well.
good,"You stay until the work is completed."
good,Good scope for learning. Lot of meetings all day. Everyone is helpful. Some product owners do not know what they want. Less experienced people are part of main projects.
good,This was a temporary position.  The employee's are great to work with.  If you are looking for temporary work this is a great place.  They don't have a lot of full time positions.
good,Overall a good Company to work for. Opportunity for advancement. Company was sold several times and that created some management confusion. Job advancement goals were often replaced after new management was introduced and forward path were not offer clear defined
good,"A typical day would begin with helping clients in a one on one environment where any internal employee can walk in with an IT related issue and get assistance.  While there I learned many things about different IT branches.  The management at the direct level was very good, higher up management had a real disconnect with the needs of the work force.  The culture was very open.  The hardest part of working there was dealing with the slow pivots of the IT management as they were not tech savvy and did not understand the importance the problems that needed to be dealt with in a timely manner.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting some great people that have become my long time friends."
good,Days were typically filled with actual work and meetings. There is a workplace culture. No part of the work is any more or less challenging than at any other company.
good,Cardinal Health is a good workplace. Friendly environment to work in. A lot of work in a growing billion dollar company. There is always work and will always be work.
good,It was relaxed and both slow and quick paced at times. I liked the lounge we had. The people were nice majority of the time but sometimes drama becomes an issue that will spiral out of control.
good,What's a machine operator moving at a fast place but in this case they was overworking us 7 days a week some days 12 hour shift. Poor management job was unorganized.
good,There were many perks working at Cardinal Health. Typically the days were involved. A lot of customer service with internal and external customers. Required precision and knowledge.
good,Now Catalent Pharma Solutions. Good experience and work atmosphere.  Learned a lot and meet friends for life. Management was okay.  Fast paced and good employees.
good,"Very fast pace competitive high intense environment. I loved the competition, the daily quotas along with the interaction with the clients.  I learned a great deal from this company and truly value the management and overall business structure."
good,Networking plays an important role if you want to stay for a long time with the company. You can move around and establish your network and help your career in the long term.
good,Monitors safety and health regulations and provides technical support to plant and corporate personnel to ensure compliance with federal and state safety and...
good,"fast paced environment"
good,A good business to learn about healthcare and to receive a broad exposure of the Canadian system and the demands of the marketplace. The competition is fierce now.
good,"Poor management and supervision lead to poor service and cooperation between employees. Mostly divided groups and too many leaders not enough authority. Average day consist of a lot of technical difficulties such as computer failure, system failure, system freezing. Unnecessary down time and low preparation for errors. Cardinal health was a good place to work for considering the fact that the workers were great when it comes to asking questions and trying to get information when needed. Great group of personalities, approachable supervisors and leads. At times most people would say that not enough information is being shared in the group meetings or huddles because a lot of changes are made daily and they update individuals instead of as a whole. Overall my time with the company was a great learning experience, from meeting great minds, and adapting to a consistent flow of operation with little to no rest and always putting quality before quantity. Main lesson i walked away with was how to lead and not follow."
good,"This was a good place to work. Fast paced, typical call center environment. Consistent manger/supervisor. No advancement. Good pay and benefits with this employer."
good,"no review needed just a delivery driver  drove from richmond to williamsburg, to virginia beach,to hampton  and back to richmond daily. Very strict on delivery of product."
good,"shift starts at 6am,we exercise and the lead/supervisor make the announcements.Afterwards the lead then tells use where w will be working for the day."
good,"I worked with Cardinal Health for a number of years and while compensation was not competitive with the marketplace, I worked with amazing people that put their heart and soul into the job.  Recently the organization underwent a dramatic change in senior leadership in the acute pharmaceutical sales division, and they have set up a culture that is losing business at an alarming rate.  They need to get their feet under them and it's going to take a number of years before the pendulum swings back and Cardinal Health becomes a decent place to work again."
good,Work short hours strictly part time gained a numerous amount of knowledge about shipping here at this job. I would have been willing to stay but the commute an change of shifts caused problems.
good,"Fast paced environment, long hours. Overall mission of organization makes the hard work worth the effort. Work/life balance can be hard to achieve. Inclusive workplace."
good,"My time at Cardinal Health has been filled with many highs and lows. Average management team, does not balance work/life well at all, but advancement opportunities are a plenty."
good,"This Fortune 25 company is very strong in its distribution practices, but much less so in its support of product innovation and disruptive technology.  Its number one product is its stock.  Emphasis is first on stockholders, then customers, then employees. It is a big proponent of promoting internally, which is great for advancement of new people to their career.  Internal advancement is also good for the company because navigating the company is extremely complex. For seasoned veterans with experience, they have a tendency to add new Director positions and above, and then eliminate the positions regularly when financial pressure is on (poor market conditions, stock price is lowering). The company tends to reorganize its rank every two years. Very good ethical/personal value system and can-do attitude among personnel.  Helpful co-workers and fairly good work/life balance.  Runs typically 25-40% lower in salary than other competitors, but justifies that by offering higher PTO and stock options for higher positions. The people are great, but secure advancement to Director and above is for only the chosen few.  ""Midwest nice"" culture."
good,"HR very nice, work environment very fun and challenging security spot on! A lot of wrongful activities after 5:00 p.m. in the warehouse department Do not apply for second shift."
good,"Great team, Good place to work, fast moving environment the place is room controlled temperature and the administration is very attentive of employees progress."
good,The ability to working at fast pace and very stressful cause you pick the product with fast pace using push cart  and time frame also set how many need to pick for hours and the pay is low compared with the job . Low raised every yrs and no bonus .
good,"Enjoyed my tenor with Cardinal. Allowed breaks. In house café, actually two in the main building. Many chances to move within the company for advancement."
good,"Receptionist/Facilities Administrator"
good,"Great company. overworked at time and hard to reach your bonus.  you can advance quick if you show that you are a hard worker.  You need to ask many question to learn the job style, and very stressful at times"
good,pay and benefits were great. management was too quick to fire valuable employees when a mistake was made but seemed like the lackluster employees stuck around and were given more chances then other
good,"overall Cardinal health is a great starting place for those looking for a job to pay bills, but after a few years it can be hard for those looking to advance"
good,"Caring for Residents with their daily activities is challenge.  Learned lots about dementia and how to redirect, positive approaches and providing a trust relationship. Managed by American Senior Communities now.  Urban, inner city feel both Residents and staff. The hardest part was the decline and death of Residents.  The enjoyable part was getting to know all the different people Residents and staff."
good,fast pace RF gun medical supplies customers orders shipping lables hardest part of job working long hours with only one break one lunch . working early morning hours
good,"I don't really remember working here for long.  I know I didn't hate it, so it must have been okay.  I really don't think it would be fair for me to try to give them a review."
good,"Good environment to work in overall. "
good,It was a good place to work at and make money while you are trying to find your passion. Not to say that it's not a place you can't stay long term just takes a toll on your body with that type of work . I learned working there that warehouse work never really stops and there is always something to do
good,"Job was agreeable, atmosphere was friendly, and inviting. Management staff was friendly, but not always available when needed. The benefits were very good."
good,this is a great company to work for. The supervisors were very understanding and the training improved greatly. The HR was very supportive and reached out to help in any way they could.
good,Between the teams that are made at cardinal there is loyalty and help but amongst the senior workers and favorites work was never given evenly. some had more than others while the workers with seniority could stand around and talk and relax. made it a very stressful work environment
good,This job is nothing more then a stepping stone. The pay is competitive and only competitive. They should compensate more for the amount of hours you have to work and the complete lack of work life balance.
good,"my work day consist of pick or packing orders that costumers put in, I start my day off by building ice carts for the orders to be packed. then I pick or pack the orders"
good,"This is a great way to get into a technical field with little to no experience.  You will be trained and given a fair amount of responsibility.  It is up to the individual to stay current on their training since some positions are FDA regulated.  Furthermore, it is up to the individual for their career development which is limitless."
good,its ok the job environment is ok. don't see a future or advancement in the job. ive learned how to do other areas in the job very fast. they change things a lot without testing things out
good,"Good and nice place to work manager and supervisor are great too. But tha salary is not that big, the things is a little bit far from my apartment on that time."
good,Fast paced environment. You learn a lot about prescription medications and OTC items. Plenty of overtime. They let you learn all types of positions and duties in operations.
good,"When I first thought of picking medical supplies I didn't think that I would get a daily workout. I loved the environment, the people and the management was cool."
good,The job is very easy to do. Its just that there is a lot of work to be done. When applying for this job understand that there is always overtime (mandatory) everyday. I come in at 2pm and leave when the work is finished. That could be anywhere form 11:30pm-3:00am. This job is ideal for those who might want to build leadership and communication skills. As of lately the morale has been kind of high. Which means maintaining a positive mindset through the long hours might not be as hard as it used to. The great thing about management is that most of them started from the bottom. So its easy for them to resolve any issues that you may have.
good,"I enjoy working at Cardinal Health.  My role within my team is customer focused and time sensitive."
good,As a driver i drive around and deliver packages to different locations for customer needs. I also help out around the office whenever i am needed to complete tasks.
good,"There are many who supply the medical community their trade tools, Cardinal Health is a company who strives to provide the options needed at the best savings to them to allow more affordable health care with the highest quality service and tools available."
good,work duties were always discussed ahead of time and working together made the day go by smoothly. Everyone always looked out for one another.
good,"Packed hot and cold packs in boxes all day. Worked 4 10 hour days. The people there was not the friendliess people. The management was pretty good,."
good,It was a good job but I was always tired from school and working ten hours overnight.Also a lot of physical work.. . But overall it was a decent job..
good,"Great company. #2 in the World."
good,"Cardinal Health benefits are awesome 4 weeks PTO, health insurance, matching 401k. Available day one of hire. That's what I like about Cardinal Health."
good,"busy, must be able to learn new things to cross train to support other departments."
good,Cardinal Health is a great place to work to start your career. I would recommend cardinal health to anyone looking for a starter career in healthcare operations.
good,Good environment to work in. Great team and people. clear vision of the future. very stable company. very focus on servicing the customer and safety of the employees
good,Company business segments are not aligned causing friction amongst staff and ultimately patients. Management has a serious systemic problem on how they treat their workforce. Company management engages in unfair business practices and fails to treat their staff with dignity and respect. Senior management disregards claims and engages in employee favoritism.
good,"Friendly atmosphere that makes people happy. Always greeted when arrive. Never a dull moment. Management is nice, but they think they know the warehouse processes and actually do not. They make decisions directly affecting the warehouse without consulting the people that actually do the work."
good,Good company with great benefits and mediocre compensation. Company is agile and has shown they can adapt to a constant changing market
good,"This place is a trip. They lure you in with great benefits ( which they do have) but all around would not recommend this place. Training is not good. They reprimanded me for being late from break and being a very punctual person, but with no way to gain access to the building, was an insult. You work until the work is done. One day was a 16 hour shift then reporting on time the next day just for more uncertainty. Management was good but tended to be unprofessional. I just don't understand how they don't adhere to labor laws. Again, the training was a total insult with what access you have and the hours are unstable. They wonder why morale is low."
good,good place to work with good benefits but it was minimal room for advancement. Opportunities were already pre-determined.
good,"Great company culture."
good,"Cardinal Health is a fast-growing, patient-focused company that encourages employees to work hard and contribute to the growth and success of the business."
good,Not a lot of hands on training from management kinda had to learn as i went had the opportunity to learn different receiving equipment.
good,nice place to work clean environment pay is pretty good benefits were average vacation and sick time was great management was really concerned about keeping the plant open
good,"Handled calls from hospitals placing orders, checking orders, and reporting problems.  Provided assistance in problem solving.  Worked within a team to accomplish department goals."
good,"Fun place to work, high stress and lower range pay were moderately made up for by the decent benefit package."
good,"This is your typical pharmacy, with tons of business. You will work a 40 hour week, but for avg. pay and little benefits. Give it a try"
good,Every day was a good and productive day . I learned a lot about the business and the culture . My coworkers were great no problems . The hardest thing about the job was getting everything out on time .
good,"Nice place to work, co-workers are cool and friendly. Management is good not to heavy for a work environment. You meet a lot of good people working their."
good,My daily responsibilities consist of providing the best customer service in an expeditious and safe manner.  The work our were desirable and policies implemented were fair.
good,the on thing that really bothered me were the hours that you were given. you had to work mostly night hours and it was something that affected me a lot
good,Got along with people great! good place to work. Great people. They helped me out with everything that i needed to get started.
good,I think Cardinal Health is a ok place to work.They are trying very hard to be an inclusive company. The company believes in trying to build on teamwork for their employees.
good,"It's okay. Just like everywhere else, if you do your job you say, if you don't, you go. They seem to promote good workers pretty fast."
good,I learned to cooperate as a team being able to assist one another with merchandise. It is not just an individual task but a task as a team to get the job done. I could say the hardest part was to look rebuild the boxes taking out the damaged material. If you overlooked the damage products and add them with the good products then the whole shipment would be no good. It takes a good eye and patience to really accomplish a good package for shipment. The enjoyable part was working together as a team because everyone would mess up but you have others to help correct your mistakes
good,"What I learned at Cardinal Health is different medical products. The hardest part at this job was waiting on the nurse's to check it in. The most enjoyable part of this job was dealing with very educational doctor's and nurse's. The co-workers were very, very good."
good,I am new to the company. Overall seems to have many employees that have been with the company for many years  - promoted throughout their tenure; and others content in same position. National company in different segments of business. Still to new to give full opinion on company.
good,You get a lot of overtime. I came in at 3pm and left around 4 in the morning everyday. Working with this company you soon realize that you have no life outside of the company but the pay is good.
good,"Cardinal Health is one of the largest medical distributors in the world and an amazing company."
good,"Management believes that any idea that pops into their head is correct and will create massive upheaval to make that idea happen, regardless of who it affects and how.  Very little assistance with advancing one's career."
good,"Ok Company, management heavy and slow to move. management structure not accessible and sow to innovate. Good benefits, pay is average"
good,"Decent work place that was steady for a considerable period of time."
good,Selling to established acute care hospitals; fierce competition; competitors always have a better product and cheaper than your offerings (so they say); large territory sometimes unmanageable
good,"a lot of travel, stayed in nice hotels and had very good rental cars.  the training was o.k., but the guys on the team were great guys.  overall good experience."
good,"staff very good to work with, learned a lot the 10 years I was employed there met a lot of good people, I enjoyed the friendships that I had when I worked there"
good,"The hours are difficult because they are not set, and vary by day.  Generally understaffed because of constant turnover."
good,No hovering bosses. Learned about how medical supply stocking and distribution is executed. Timely deliveries are vital. Great coworkers. Family oriented environment.
good,"Too involved in LRTS Lean Road To Success, LRTS is a good thing to a degree, but it has gotten to the point where it’s just to look good and get a score. Being more focused on LRTS than the customer and lines per hour itself! Great benefits though but hard work for little pay. I have worked for Cardinal Health for 5 years and only received more responsibility with no extra pay. No bonuses, no commission, and only one raise a year, you’re lucky if you get a raise of 25 cents!"
good,"heavy lifting pretty much all night, occasionally may be asked to assist other areas. supervisor and team are very knowledgeable and helpful. typical co-workers in that they all have opinions on issues that come up. best part of job is when im asked to help with a problem."
good,There is some inherent goodness in the job know that you are making sure patients receive the medication they need to live a better life.
good,A typical work day at Cardinal Health was very fast paced with high production of productivity demand. I have learned to stay focused and continue to improve. Management makes job easier. Co-workers are the best. The hardest part of the job knowing that the products you process are for sick patients but also feeling good about you are apart of the healing process.
good,The management was helpful at times and reliable. They were very much a part of the teams they lead and held everyone accountable for their work.
good,"Worked until orders were completed, stressful at times"
good,"Overall an OK Place to work, no work life balance, the people that work there are great."
good,"	Manage and monitor inventory supply orders for University Of Texas Galveston and UTMD Anderson Cancer center.  Prepare status reports regarding no move inventory and outage reports related to inventory.  Assist the customer with securing new product and set up in the designated location.  "
good,Everyday new challenges to implement and good chance to communicate with clients
good,A nice place to work..very busy and very clean..team leads were rude and no concern to members
good,Reputable company with strong work ethics. Great people to work with. Recently went through major shift in management style and culture.
good,"My typical day at work is fast-paced, constantly problem-solving and making quick decisions.  I have learned how to navigate through the government system and effectively train others to be successful.  I have the best manager anyone could ask for and a great team of co-workers who are supportive.  The hardest part of my job is navigating through the government system and creating a sense of urgency to get things done.  The most enjoyable part of my job is finding ways to save my customer money."
good,"a typical day was coming in and setting up the work areas on the assembly line. i learned a lot of different supplies that hospitals use to perform surgeries. My co workers were mostly women. the hardest part of my job was making sure to not make any mistakes. "
good,"typical day at work consists of fast pace multi-tasking."
good,"Diverse business model allows for many career paths."
good,Cardinal Health is a great place to work lots of growth and advancement in the company
good,Set up warehouse and inventory process.  Wrote the procedures and trained employees on inventory processes.  Plan raw materials to meet customer requirements and production schedule.  Worked closely with vendors to improve cost and quality of raw materials.
good,"day starts with reviews from the day before, each individual's work performance is explained, the goal of the day is addressed by the supervisor. any improvement for a fluent work is assessed by the supervisor, new ideas are asked during meetings."
good,"A typical work day consisted of building and wrapping surgical kits to be sent off to hospitals. I learned what components were used in certain surgeries and how to sterilize items within the kits. Management was hands on, and very thorough. My co workers were hard working and worked at a fast but detailed pace. The hardest part of the job was standing for 12 hours straight 6 days a week. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was always busy and our jobs varied from day to day."
good,"I loved this job, unfortunately I injured myself while working there"
good,We only had 3 people on our night crew. While filling orders for the in house patients we would constantly get interrupted for emergency patients. Never a dull moment in pharmacy.
good,Coach and Mentor employees. Puchasing of supplies. Review daily headcount and goals. Attend daily manager production meetings. Lead project teams. Work with all my leads daily to ensure they are on task.
good,"Work starts at 10:30. We go to our areas and pick! We pick things like needles, gauze, scaples, gowns, ect There is really nothing hard about the job and the easiest part is the picking!"
good,I learned how to work with other people.  I also learned how to perform under pressure.
good,"lots of potential but too dysfunctional."
good,"I have been with this company for a year now and the pay has really helped me have a sense of who I am, but if you are not on the same page with them you will never move up. Differences in opinion mean that you are not a team player no matter how much they want you to believe that your opinions are valued. "
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working with a great group of people at Cardinal Health.
good,Productive and Accomplished Workplace very important and needed for saving lives for necessary surgeries knowing we helped save lives every day was a new experience
good,"Cardinal Health is a diverse and interesting place to work.  Customer Service is a challanging job that requires patience and understanding. I am always putting myself in the customer's shoes.  How would I wanted to be treated if I called in with a problem.  "
good,"I learned a lot trying out different roles in this company. They made me a sealer, a material handler, assembler, packer and assigned me to routing. I had fun learning each role and interacting with my co-workers."
good,"a great company to work parttime while earning a degree while "
good,"Supervising the unloading of trucks and various other duties.  Was good company unfornately they moved to Aurora, IL."
good,"Responsible for all phases of warehouse operations, including staffing, scheduling, and  resource movement to accomplish building objectives. Responsibilities also include equipment training, as well as training associates to perform all aspects of Hazardous material handling. Responsible for data analysis in order to meet Pick/Pack and Ship MBOs. Developed metrics and tracking mechanisms to increase productivity and quality. Led  several Lean Six Sigma process improvement projects resulting in over $100,000 in annual savings. Created development plans for over 30 associates to assist them in fulfilling their growth objectives, both personal and professional."
good,"A typical day at work will be answering alot of calls assisting clients, doing what i have to do to get the job done. I learned when working in a call center to be well organized. My management and co-workers team always made me feel comfortable, very nice people. The hardest part of my job i dont believe there's one but the enjoyable part is getting the job done and making clients happy."
good,Distribution Sales Representative:  Responsible for taking orders within territory from POL's within the Portland territory.
good,There is not to much about this job I don't like other than working nights on it . Don't do it . Your in early and you stay late until the jobs finished. Other than that good money but my opinion geared toward a workaholic type personality in which I don't have.
good,"A typical work day consist of picking orders manually or with powered industrial machinery. My job requires accuracy, speed and absolute safety for myself and fellow co-workers because this is a very fast moving environment with frequent interaction of people and powered industrial machinery. The hardest part of my day would be the sometimes mild to heavy lifting opposed to the most enjyoyable part of my day being interaction with fellow co-workers."
good,Working directly with customers (internal and external) on a daily basis has helped me to learn and understand their needs and how to satisfy those needs. Management is always focused on sales and customer service and that sometimes that makes it harder to manage collections for high risk accounts.
good,"Leadership is important because without direction an organization can flounder despite the best intentions."
good,"-work daily with customer service to ensure that issues are researched and esclated"
good,work 7 pm to 5 am running carts scanning product. The late hours I dont like I like the work but not the hours
good,Large corporation with all the pros & cons.  Ability to access a lot of great benefits and people.  With a large company comes lots of red tape.
good,Nice office setting and environment. I always gained a sense of satisfaction knowing that we were promoting treatments to better the lives of others.
good,Its a nice place to work. There really isn't a hard part to my job. A typical day is that you come in do your job and when you finish you move to another department and help them. So overall its a nice place to work.
good,"I had a great relation with my co-workers. We were like a family. Even when my position required sometimes to be hard with them, there was a lot of respect. What i loved of my job was the opportunity to know people from other parts of the states and interact with them. My typical day at work was making claims and investigations most part of the day. "
good,"Calling on current Cardinal customers in the retail independant and acute care facilities.  Management was great.  Unfortunately, Cardinal is going through a reduction of force and I was laid off.  The best part about the job was my customers and interacting with potential customers each day. "
good,Fantastic place to work. Senior associates with so much knowledge made the days go easy. Learned so much from them and was able to pass onto the junior associates. Best part of the job was knowing at the end of the day. The Hospital/Patients received what they needed. We always went over and above to accomplish this. It was never asked. We did this knowing at any time someone we know could be at the receiving end. So we treated all as if it was our own.
good,"great environment, great people, it was a good job supervisiors were cool. i just wish cardnial would hire more temps into there company. that was the only con that i had with the company once i got in comfortably they laid me off just cause i was a temp bt i loved my postion in the company"
good,They can fix this... and it is likely confined to specific groups/locations/teams. Talk about EXclusion and a devaluing of talent and contributions based on personal opinions and clique-ish behaviors by leadership at levels that should know MUCH better. It's unfortunate -- otherwise a great mission and lots of nice people.
good,"Set up station ,pick out a reach turck ,pick program on computer and start working.I don't consider my job or and job to be hard,the most enjoyable is lunch."
good,it was an ok job for it being part time and all the work was very slow and there were days we had no work.
good,Cardinal Health is a typical organization that has a lot of good going for it and some opportunities that are hindering it's growth. The organization needs an injection of outsiders to really challenge the status quo and help the organization become more effective.
good,"The orders from the day before were sent out and needed to be placed in their designated location. I learned product recognition so that the items can be placed faster as well as if the staff or nurses ask for certain material, that they can be found. The management was ok, the only problems were that there was a lack of communication and a shortage on individuals that knew the other hospitals."
good,"I did a lot of counting and stocking,I learned how a pharmiceutical warehouse operates,I had a good supervisor and co-workers.The worst part was the repetiton and the best part was the inventory days."
good,"Responsible for picking, verification, and packaging catalogs and brochures for shipment to customers via common and express carriers."
good,"easy going and very busy. multiple breaks, good paying company with great beneifits."
good,Cardinal Health has been good place to work providing some good experience within Healthcare & Med/Surg sales. The downside of the position is being spread thin amoungst several different areas in medicine creating little time to focus fully on one item.
good,Fortune 50 company that has embarked on new initiatives in different areas.
good,"Overall it was a good learnig experience, there was alot of team work. All of the employees came to do there job and gave 100% every night to get the job done in a timely matter. I enjoyed working for Cardinal Health Inc. There was outstanding mangement there. I learned how t work in an fast-pace work enviorment"
good,Work place with a secure environment. I like working with people with positive attitudes and people who work together as one.
good,Good inside work with many different departments to work in. Each department helps you to understand the next one easier. They keep you moving all day even when the equiptment does not. The hardest thing would be balancing quality and output. It would be nice to send off each pallet the way you would like to receive it but you also have to hit your numbers. The best part of the day would be at the end of the shift when we all pull together to get done and go home real team work.
good,"Able to utilize aseptic skills, metrology skills."
good,Further integration work required to improve customer focus; multiple sales people call be calling on the same account
good,Inspect and sign out order pickers for the day. Pick and pack orders for hospitals and load them on the trucks for delivery. Also some dock management.We had a great team of guys which was the most enjoyable part of the job because we all got along.
good,"The start times would vary throughout the days, and not to mention how long your day was going be. We would clock in and then I would get order ready to be shipped."
good,"I think Cardinal Health has a company is a good company company but, the call center is a mess. poor management supervisor feel they are better then the CSR The new system we can not service our customer's like we use to. We do more then answer the phones. We process returns, debits and credits, We have to say on the phones at all times and do the rest of any issues the customer's may have. Credits and debits along with returns are behind because they will not allow us time off the phone to work any issues. Their concern is our phone stat if we get below 80% the supervisors are IM you like you are just sitting at your desk doing nothing when you are working on issues for your customer each call can be an issue you need to work for the customer"
good,Cardinal Health was an ok place to work. They just let people go when the economy started going down hill.
good,It was your average company to work for. They have a very strict attendance policy that they follow to a T
good,The security is amazing here. This job can be draining after awhile and hard on your body. I did feel pushed hard but that was part of the job. Supervisors were great.
good,"Cardinal Health is overall a great company. But, depending on your department and management, you might have a good or bad experience. The company is not too forward thinking (due to older leadership) and that can feel like it's a more slow paced and slower to improve. It's currently going through many changes, so it might feel unstable and even hard to accomplish things due to complexities in the structure and competing priorities across different departments. It's a good company with good values, but if you're looking for a more exciting and fast paced job you might want to look somewhere else."
good,The hours are hard but worth the pay and experience. The management Is very good if you have an issue they take care of it in a speedy way and are very friendly.
good,"Cardinal Health is under no circumstance a bad job. It's 80% of a good job. There's flexibility, and not too much a hardworking. Management is good, high safety measures, team work etc. The only problem I think is the employees can be paid more. It's a good place to work and will always recommend for a friend."
good,"the pay is ok, but the best thing Cardinal has going is their benefits package. The day you get hired, you have benefits. Your first year there you get around 20 days of paid time off and it starts the day you get hired."
good,"Benefits are great."
good,"Cardinal health is a great company with rewarding benefits. The culture and employee engagement  needs a complete overhaul in my opinion.Some of the programs have a culture that lacks in employee accountability and  responsibility. Also team memebers  feel entitled to do the bare minimum oppose dot going above and beyond. The company pays above the industry standard, which is great but the benefits oackage should be re-evaluated as well."
good,Nights worked extremely long hours.  Micro manage the employee. Co-workers very nice.  Pay sub-standard.  Plenty of time off but not always able to take when needed.
good,"Local Facility great staff, work varied from day to day kept things interesting, great opportunity very appreciative.  A very self motivated job but good work and life balance."
good,"The job overall is okay but the management isn't the best.There is alot of playing favorites over other people,and on certain days have to work past your time you should be off"
good,"I loved my job there, but there was no advancement."
good,Picking items needed for surgeries. Calls from Nurses when needing extra items. Very fast pace. Restocking shelves when trucks come in. Hours are not the best.
good,The culture was pretty awful and I literally had a senior executive throw F-bombs at me.  Tons of RIF work and lift and shift work. No clear strategy or direction.
good,"When I started at CAH it was a great place to work. In the years there benefits got slowly peeled away and more political. They have great career development, but that too recently seems to be failing. The ability to move around internally and grow is getting harder and harder. "
good,"The company always strives to outperform the previous year, but not always willing to provide the appropriate resource to adequately accommodate this drive."
good,Like I said Cardinal Health is a great place to work until something better comes along with more pay more PTO time more vacation pay and at least match my 401k and more family-friendly.
good,"Cardinal Health at the location I was employed is not necessarily indicative of Cardinal Health overall. When I investigated the company I was impressed with the overall philosophy."
good,I am responsible for managing several physical security projects per day. This includes designing and installing of security devices at locations in the US.
good,"Cardinal Health is a fast paced company that promotes well from within. However, recent acquisitions have hurt Company performance. Cardinal has recently sent 500+ Accounting, Finance, IT, and Customer Service jobs overseas."
good,Fast paced. Hazmat and osha training. Management was not as attentive as they needed to be. Long hours some days. Overtime expected. Company celebrated holidays and special days
good,Cardinal Health has potential for one to grow. There is room for you to shadow other employees and cross train. This company has trained my how to problem solve and has shown me how to become a leader.
good,Cardinal Health was a good place to work and the company has good values.  I came in too low on the totem pole and the position wast suitable for my skills.  The advancement opportunities were kinda of lacking.  The rules for advancement are not conducive to career opportunities.
good,"A typical day starts at 8 a.m and ends at 4:30 p.m.  There is always something changing as it relates to policy and regulations and of course staff.  The culture was totally different from any I had experienced before and this made all the difference to how people felt  and treated each other. Management had an open door policy, where employees were encouraged to approach the management at any time needed."
good,I enjoyed being part of Cardinal Health . I liked that we were part of the hospital setting so I got to learn so much about working for a hospital and what goes on in one. I got to meet all sorts of people in this field.
good,Management changes several times per year.
good,"Very fast pace work environment you can work more then and 8 hours day."
good,"This is a high paced, very stressful company to work for. Within the company it is every man / woman for themselves and you must CYOA at all times. Management and co-workers will throw you under the bus in a split second."
good,Worked with customers (hospitals) on a daily basis and held my own conference calls to go over pricing accuracy.  Had goals set to bring numbers down.  Called/emailed vendors to verify conrtracts were correct.
good,I would recommend this job to someone who is looking to grow in the Pharmacy side of heath care. I had great support by supervisors and some management as well.
good,"Cardinal Health was a fast paced work environment. You would come in, do your job, and go home tired. I suppose that's the American Dream. There were occasional problems with rotating management, but nothing major."
good,"Overall good place to work, great coworkers, company is doing some reorganizing, decent paid time off, casual office, many people have been with the company for a long time"
good,I enjoyed the workplace and coworkers. I was excited about the different learning programs and training available. It was however disappointing at the lack of advancement opportunities for employees that showed willingness to learn other areas of different departments. I also saw favoritism.
good,"I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere there and the freedom to learn multiple job functions while i was there. the only problem there was the management turnover wasn't very stable, other than that it was a good place to work for me at the time."
good,"Cardinal health offers a lot of great benefits and perks for employees, but for a healthcare company cares little for employees well being day to day. The long days and mandatory overtime make it hard to balance work and life, as well as even just have the time to do anything without sacrificing a good night's sleep for the entire work week. It can also be highly competitive and stressful if you are falling behind the workload. It is not a job for everyone, but some will definitely make the most of it and thrive here regardless."
good,"-Es un trabajo muy activo, donde tienes que permanecer de pie por largo tiempo."
good,"Cardinal Health is a great place to work for. From the moment I started working there, I had a great time connecting with fellow colleagues and building relationships. The work environment is relaxed and balanced. The company does a lot to promote a healthy work environment for its employees. Nevertheless, like most big corporations, business will always trump employees' and their security in the end. As a result, my employment came to an end as a result of a business decision to outsource my position and many others like myself."
good,"gossip, backstabbing, promises left unfilled.   good pay, benefits for health cost more than $200 per month for a family to just say they have insurance."
good,As far as hours and compensation goes it's great. But sometimes it is way too many hours making it hard to have a life. The only negative thing i have to say is about management. One can't complain because you immediately get punished for doing so.
good,"Although the pay is not as high as others in the industry and raises are not high even with great reviews, the benefits are really good.  there is a great work and home life balance, hours are good.  a typical day at work is very busy but time flies by so that is good.  there is a great mix of culture!"
good,If you love overtime there is plenty of it in this warehouse. The plus side is there is plenty of room for growth within job titles as well as departments. Temp to hire is within 6 months sometimes less.
good,This is a pretty good company as long as your not int he call center. Every other dept allows you to move within the company but not The cal lcenter; it's like a gang... once your in they don't let you out.
good,"Pros"
good,"At first I really enjoyed my job at Cardinal health.  It was engaging and interesting.  Very fast paced with lots to learn in a very unique working environment.  It looked like I had places to move up and advance but no matter how much I tried to advance it felt like a could never really make an progress."
good,"It is a comfortable place to work the staff was easy to get along with always had what I needed to do my job.   My typical day started out with getting things organized for the physicians or Nurse practioners who were coming in to see their residents. Then going to Morning Meeting with the staff and back to work filing charts and getting the information people needed."
good,Okay company. Pay too low. Company needs to pay better wages for the work that is expected. Benefits are okay but high. Just another corporation concerned about the bottom dollar.
good,I work with a close knit team within finance. We work close together to makes sure all payments are processed in a timely manner while working continuously to improve exception rate. Including our reporting processes.
good,This company bought out my previous company and we were told that nothing would change but in the end they really never told us the entire truth and most of us were let go do to down sizing
good,"The pay was great for the area. However the lower level management was horrible. Some had no clue how to be effective and efficient at the same time therefore the customers suffered tremendously. The call center left very little room for growth. "
good,This is a physically demanding job picking orders of medical supplies on a forklift to be delivered to the different hospitals.  We came to work and did not leave until the job was finished.  It was rewarding to do this work because of all the people that depended on us to deliver the right product the first time.
good,The shift requires long hours with intensive labor. It is a fast paced environment that requires employees to stay whenever the work is completed. A typical shift could last between 8 to 12 hours a day. The hardest part of the job would be the physical requirements especially in a semi-air conditioned warehouse.
good,"pick and stage customer orders"
good,"A daily routine of Inventory Management and support to operations of warehouse shipping and receiving team. Communicating with customer service for individual products returned to confirm specific statuses, and referring to department supervisors and Sr. management and Sr. Techs. backing up profilers and cycle counters in their abscence and performing as a water spider"
good,Moderately paced. Creative work environment. Management has an open door policy. Performance reviews stress teamwork ability. Hardest part of job is meeting deadlines. most enjoyable part of job is that management listens to its employees and act and develop. Creativity is enouraged
good,"On a daily day, I help the team manage 8 to 9 assemblers building surgical kits for hospitals. I set up the orders in stations for the assemblers, I make sure every order is built how customers requested and make sure the special are correct in each order. I've learned to be a good assistant for my line, my assemblers and my team lead. The hardest part of this job is the different personality I have to deal with daily. The most enjoyable part of this job is that my line accomplish our daily goal and we all go home with a smile on our face."
good,company wasnt what I thought it would be. wasnt ata all productive and was always behind on schedule
good,Delivered nuclear medicine to hospitals and clinics as well as supported pharmacy techs in their daily tasks.
good,"Ok place to work. advancement based on personality not work ethic or experience, and revolving door atmosphere. Very focused on production goals like most businesses."
good,"And other great experience to learn new thing and explore a new campus like Medical, really interesting and full of satisfactions."
good,•Lead maintenance tech and repairs for the Witron Logistics Automated Storage and Retrieval System.
good,"If management truly cared, Cardinal would be a great place to retire from. Too many responsibilities without covering salary is one of the companies biggest setback."
good,"they give you too much overtime and you need to work fast peace, is not bad if you do it only because you need the money, they Also retain you until they drop more work"
good,Its a good company it's just the ppl the run that make it bad but benefits and overtime it's there if you need to make money it's there and the culture is good too
good,"Productivity workplace."
good,"It's an average workplace, very busy and stressful place to work because of the high volume of work. *************************************************"
good,"Great place to work. Average day is not the same all the time, challenging environment, but feels great to know we serve our patients and make a difference."
good,"It’s a easy job but the working hours are horrible and poor management. A typical day will be more than 13 hours walking and standing in steel toes, co workers where very helpful and friendly"
good,Very hard to move up within the company. Work place culture is great. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and speaking with different cultures inside the work place and outside.
good,Great place to meet people and be involved with new things but the lack of structure and communication between employee and management should be something that they should practice on..
good,They are learning on what it's like to be a medical manufacturing business.  The company is having growing pains with the new type of business they purchased.
good,"The employees there are all amazing to work with,They fun and helpful,definitely makes the time go by a lot faster,the management isn't really all that helpful and is very lazy."
good,the work was W-S 3 am to 1130 am. you get your pto up front 120 for the year the pay is next to none thing for the hours you have work. know no hazardous pay for dealing with radiation hazards. no night time differential and you can't use your sick time for 90 days after start date
good,"we pick pack and ship medical products.... I've learned  great work ethic, the Management was very good, the hardest part of the job was the hours could get long and the pay wasn't high enough for the cost of living. the most enjoyable part of the job as he people I worked around with."
good,"Cardinal is a very professional company with goal driven results. It is an enjoyable place to work, however under recent re-structuring has become a bit more restrictive with benefits and opportunities for promotion with."
good,"We used to be the Harvard Drug Group, but Cardinal Health bought us last year."
good,"Worked there in 2003/2004.  At that time, they were an average place to work.  I left to pursue a better opportunity elsewhere.  I believe they went through management changes and no longer operate as Cardinal Health."
good,"Having the ability to work from home helped with work life balance.  That being said the hours were longer, but you got more done."
good,Cardinal Health is a good place to work. Their focus on engagement and high morale within teams make you look forward to the challenges that each day may bring!
good,"Work is decent, handling of radioactive materials and lots of traffic."
good,"Everything within the building was run very well. The team was organized and the building manager knew what he was doing. However, corperate didn't seem to understand how things worked at my location. They did not take our advice and it led to many difficult situations ultimately ending with the building closing down."
good,Management team shows favoritism. Unnecessary and childish write ups that will put your job on the line.Need to hire more help to complete daily assignments.
good,This was a rough place to work.  No tolerance for being even one second late.  Most of my coworkers were good people but there were some toxic people I had to work around which only strained the already straining days. Stay organized with your work and keep a good level of communication with the assembly line you are providing material for if you plan on succeeding here.
good,"I fulfilled my tasks everyday somehow with the management.But, Great experience working here and learned lot about subject and life values as well, Management is good. fun to work and sometimes you need to be patience when working with other team members and create a good situation from worst and move on."
good,"The hours changed and at that time I had a young child and couldn't find childcare for those hours.I picked orders and packed them for UPS. At the end of the night we stocked and cleaned our areas.  On Fridays we had group dinners, I liked that."
good,"CAH has some disconnect between management and upper management but overall, a nice place to work. They seem to hire based on who knows someone vs. qualifications. They don't seem to  random drug test their sales people. They should."
good,"Selection of medicines, fast pace but enough employees. I only left to try to better myself. Employers were good . Work / home balance good . Overall a good job"
good,"Its one of the great place to work with good spirit and nice people ,learnt lots of things ,good management and not that hard to accomplish your object on your duties."
good,"I liked working for this company beacuse the workers were all kind and good people to  work with and the management also was not bad , you are mostly challenged to do your work."
good,"Your typical office setting job that's a call center. The management is poor and lacks communication. Staffing comes and goes a lot, which means there is a high turnover rate, which is not good for a company."
good,"A typical day at work is all employees are expected to work in a safe manner 100%of the time. The management talk to you with respect and very understanding, and what i like about the job its very diverese and everybody gets along. The hardest part about my job is not knowing what time you're going to get out, so once a month our job feeds us a big meal."
good,"I enjoyed my experience with Cardinal Health.  It is a friendly environment and family oriented. It had great benefits and plenty of overtime opportunity,"
good,Generally a nice and clean working environment. Co-workers were great to work with. Upper Management needs to find out the Truth. Then really truly appreciate the Employees .
good,"If you are looking for a very chill place to work with a low pay range, this is the place to be. It does have many advantages such as the different certifications they offer. Extremely difficult to grow professionally since not many opportunities are available."
good,"get to work and start right away with a walkie to pick up boxes and ship stuff to companies. Learned how to be organized. management was a little tight because of numbers but laid back. co-workers were very friendly and helpful. Hardest part was reaching numbers. most enjoyable was doing clean up, so easy."
good,"IS the stress and dealing with the conflict and drama that now circles that place. Most of the people their are great  to work with with, but due to the stress environment it makes it hard to accomplish your job"
good,"A typical day at my job is we have 2 physicians in our office that is around a total of 45 patients a day. My job duties are I do check in and check out, answer multi-lines phones, referrals, prior authorizations, customer services and handle any management phone calls.  I have learned a lot in the medical field by doing all jobs listed and cpt/icd-10 coding. "
good,Arrive at work at 4 a.m. and unload the inbound truck around 5a.m. Replenishments are usually done by 6 or 6:30 a.m. Product is received and put away until it is finished. Good management and co-workers are hard working willing to get the job done. The hardest part of the day is getting product put away in the available space and locations given. The most enjoyable part is getting the work load complete with everyone's help and cooperation.
good,"A typical day at Cardinal Health consist of me dispensing radioactive isotopes for our clients as well as performing quality control and dispatching our drivers. Diversity is has definitely become one of my strongest traits because of all the responsibility I have. My co-workers are probably the best bunch of guys I've ever worked for, as well as management. I would say the hardest part of the job is when people call out of work and we find ourselves short staffed. that being said we always get the job done."
good,"Nice co workers always wanting to get the job done .Only we most of the time do not close on time "
good,"plenty of over time offered, good pay, great benefits offered but a childish atmosphere i would not recomend anyone getting a job there"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Cardinal Health. The people were great and I was excited to go to work everyday. I ended up getting laid off after only 9 months due to budget cuts. It was a business decision and I understood as I have been in the game long enough to know that certain things have to happen."
good,Good relationship with supervisors and fellow employees. Worked expediently with excellence
good,"Time is price less!!, Everyday learn something different,  pay attention with every detail, work with difference culture."
good,High volume call center environment. Company going through system upgrades to meet the demands of medical trends. Transition to new system caused employee increased turn-over rate.
good,"some days where longer then others "
good,forklift work 6 out of 8 hrs. several great management teams company wide.
good,"You walk in, clock in, and then off to the grind, it was a facility based on production. Goals were set and you had to meet them but its because of the fact it is a medical sales and supply facility. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the demand and goals set. The best part of the job was the Christmas parties and family gathering days."
good,My work at Cardinal Health includes all warehouse function. I do order picking using voice command radios and RF scanners. I also do replenishment duties as well as put away jobs. I do some shipping tasks. I have no problem lifting 50 to 70 lbs consistently. the hardest part of my job is double checking the orders to make sure that the products comes out of the warehouse 100% correct. The most enjoyable part of my job is its fast phase environment. I like working fast and efficient at the same time.
good,"Have to improve on their benefits to the employee."
good,Was good and loved the job until recently found out I'm being laid off. Everyone was amazing to work with. Enjoyed my supervisors. The always gave me the positive and negative feedback needed to make me a better employee.
good,"A typical work day at the management level is fast paced and stressfull."
good,This job would start off by me picking the order then putting it together then send it off to be palletized and then repeat and also get anything the assembly line workers would need and clean at the end of the day.  
good,"Cardinal is a great company, but with any company they do have some area's that could use improvement."
good,Hard working folks.
good,Opportunities are endless. Incentives are beyond any job i ever had. learned more sales skills there than any other company i have worked for .
good,"As far as the work itself it's not hard, but the management can be fustrating; especially when it comes to advancement, there is a lot of favoritism and there is not a lot of flexibilty when it comes to disagreement with supervisors and managers (retaliation is a big problem). Co-workers are pretty typical of any job there's always gossip, I would recommend keeping to yourself and just do your job. The hardest part of my job is knowing who in management you can trust (no one). The most enjoyble part of my job is that the people there work hard and help out each other"
good,they did lots of internal re-structuralization and would had client sales marketing issues
good,"Looong hours, at the time I was employed there was alot of favoritism, those managers have since been replaced. Rather hard for female employees to gain respect."
good,Forklift operator
good,had a difficult time moving up in the company. personal life would have to be completely separate. if it affects your work it will be noticed immediately and issues will ensue. pay was great for part time and full time. benefits are fantastic as well.
good,Great place to work at they had one manager that was horrible but after i left he got fired i believe
good,"Cardinal Health is a great place to work, with plenty of job security and room for advancement. They give a lot of vacation/sick time to their employees, and encourage you to use it. They constantly ask for feedback and have open eyes and ears to the problems people elevate."
good,"A good company to work.  Big on work life balance."
good,"Rudderless ship....the current environment requires clearly articulating a vision, aligning resources to the critical few initiatives elemental to achieving that vision, and focused execution.  There is a tremendous opportunity to improve."
good,"Very learning experience driving"
good,This company is a very simple job that gives you a really good pay as well as time off and benefits. The managers are very kind and want to help you improve your performance monthly. My only complaint would be the other employees and higher management problems.
good,It’s was a nice place to work climate controlled team atmosphere and most of the time the work wasn’t hard they had a good safety record if there was a equipment accident they took u off the equipment till ur test results came back for drugs in your system
good,Clean working environments. Easy to connect with the people you work with. Lack of communication between management and production. Very long hours. Benifits a great and pension plan is good.
good,"The company will work you year round, no off time around the holidays and it hard to take PTO. Employees are looped into scheduling with two other states."
good,Cardinal Health is going through a restructuring so limited opportunity at this time. My position was contracted and they decided to terminate my project do to financial constraints.
good,Great place to earn good money.Good benefits. 401K work alot of hours. Have two caterers to serve food in cafeteria..life insurance. Team work in factory. Earn full time.
good,"They was ok they were organized in a way fair. Needed more of a chance to go through training. Some people were rude and mean. As far as the benefits, they were great."
good,Cardinal Health is a good company to work for when you are figuring out what do to with your future career goals. Cardinal offers great employee benefits.
good,"Customer Service Representative. Responsible for solving customer's request via phone and email. Basic customer service duty's including order placement, returns and credit."
good,Picked up to 1500 pieces of  pharmaceutical products daily. Worked the fasted line where the most production was required. Worked individually & as a team to meet the required daily goals for production.
good,"This company has taught me a lot and has engaged me intellectually  "
good,I enjoyed the job great people I worked with but too much overly worked and not enough pay. the money was good but this company at this hospital wasn't organized enough for me.
good,I work eight hours at a desktop computer typing and scanning. I enter patients into our system. Working this job has been beneficial for me in multiple waysprofessionally. I've learned how to use the Sales Logix system that is used for keeping record of patient information. I've also learned how to search doctor and facility informatiuon using different medical resourceful sites. Another thing that i've learned is medical product information and different medical terminology. Msanagement at Casrdinal Health was great and very easy to work with. It is a very ecofriendly environment at this workplace.Working with my fellow colleagues was like having another family outside of home. I enjoyed the position that I was given.
good,"A productive place to work with good benefits, in my time working through the company I advanced to different positions, there are always forever changes depending on the management, with all of the changes throughout the years there were some good changes and challenges that made sense, but there were a lot of challenges whenever there was a change in management which made the workplace environment a little different but sometimes change is good. The hardest part of the job was whenever management would put different rules and regulations and several name changes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that I even had a job with the same company for such a long amount of time."
good,"Cardinal is mostly a good place to work, there are just a few kinks that could be worked out to make the environment a better place to be."
good,"I learned a lot about the difference of operations of the warehouse business, such as shipping, receiving and different forklift operations. Accomplishment celebrations was great and also my peers and environment. The hardest part was to adapt to the overnight shift."
good,"Many hard working individuals. Good products."
good,Cardinal Health hires great people. The compensation should be higher because of the severity of the job. I loved the hours of operation and the availability to work in different areas of the facility.
good,Cardinal Health is a great place to work if you are hired on as an employee. But if you are a contractor then you must always wonder if tomorrow will be your last day no matter how good you are doing. If they have a budget cut and there is no open positions for you to get flipped then you are as good as good
good,Cardinal Health is a place where you can say that they can save a life day in and day out. They do whatever its takes to get the medical products to the customers.
good,My typical day consists of data entry.  I enter 3rd party refunds into the AS400 system.  The Management team communicates very well with the team to keep us updated on any changes.
good,Managed reports for hospitals and clinics worked with several Area Sales Managers. Learned about the pricing industry for the healthcare industry. Hardest part about the job was keeping up with the work overload. The best part was the challenges the job had to offer.
good,"Compensation was weak, but a good company to work for.  Headed in the right direction."
good,"My position as a level 3 support specialist involved working with customers via phone, e-mail or dialing into our server onsite. I learned networking, working with medical devices, time management, SQL, DOS. I had great co-workers. The hardest part of the job is that we were working with hospitals, so the sense of urgency had to be maintained for every call. Helping to resolve issues and making sure the pharmacy and nursing staff could access the medicines they needed."
good,Management is very considerate of employees and allows the time to learn other duties. Too bad they laid off 150 people in Albuquerque NM.
good,"For the work we do around here we need to pay way more money inside and out. The driver need more money and better vehicle for the snow."
good,"They have great benefits and 401K. They have a little to much favoritism among at least one of the supervisor. They ended my shift quickly. They told us about it, but on a Friday we were told where we were going."
good,A great place to start a career. People are kind and fun relaxed atmosphere. Learning opportunities and growth. You have to be in your position for a year before you can move.
good,"El trabajo es inenso y es necesario quedarse horas como en cualquier empresa, depende del area en el que se encuentren"
good,A good place to work. Proactive management concerned with meeting the customer's needs. Striving each day to improve processes. The company is in the process of restructuring to stay competitive in today's market.
good,The company itself is a great company to work for. The problem is with the employees and the management lacking discipline. You have a select few working while others bust the tales to get things done. Overall great company to work for.
good,You would be in inbound or outbound all day. Inbound you would put boxes away on the shelves at the designated location. In outbound you would go and pick boxes at the location given to you.
good,"Very nice work environment and place to work.   Compensation/Benefits could be better, Job Security/Advancement. career planning is very limited as well."
good,"A typical workday is filled with joy but it is demanding."
good,Very professional workplace with specific operating guidelines and policies due to the nature of the business.  The Pharmacist in the labs are very dedicated.
good,"Manufacturing is a small aspect of Cardinal Health, but that doesn't mean it isn't important. Financial drivers and metrics abound, to the point that I believed that Quality was less important than money - which explains why I left."
good,"Overall, Cardinal Health is a fair place to work. I would recommend a friend or friends to work here. Even though the pay is average, the benefits are good."
good,"Great place to be promoted, rewarded for the work and production of the work you produced. "
good,Productive and continuous flow of work. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment. Management was informative. Coworkers were multicultural  and friendly. Making sure customers orders were filled in a timely manner. Having an opportunity to advance and be successful.
good,"each day is filled with new challenges in production, always trying to hit assembly hours and efficiency for management. coworkers are relatively friendly, which is also one of the hardest parts of the job; dealing with people. the company teaches you leadership, in hopes of you running your own team"
good,i have learned alot about the industry. they cut our sales support which sucks. the culture is great very diverse.you can move up in the company if you work hard. great national meeting trips!
good,"Enjoyed working for Cardinal.  A few ""bad apples"" ruined the whole bunch.  Generally good folks.  Entrepreneurial spirit.  Able to set own schedule; however, expectations are high and everyone is guarding their own back.  Sometimes to the detriment of the company."
good,Work environment is full of energy and motivation and varies in certain departments.Good benefits and rewards employees for good job which varies in departments.Staying focus and keeping composure may be the hardest part of job based on the different personality in the workplace.Good management that really listens to what employees have to say.Communication meetings and fun gatherings are the most enjoyable part of the job..
good,Cardinal health is a very paced work facility. A lot of friendly people and a great place to work.
good,A typical day at work is working with Pharmacy Business Consultants and Pharmacies to make sure that reimbursement is being paid out according to the market place is being paid out accordingly.
good,"A typical day consisted of firstly, clocking in and joining in a shift huddle then off to filling orders. I learned how to use different M.H.E. devices including, Multi-level Order picker, and Electric Pallet Jack (single & double). Management was very laid back and sociable, and my co-workers were fun and supportive and always offered help if needed. The most enjoyable part of this job was the interactions with co-workers in which made everyday enjoyable."
good,"Company is largest medical supplier, Good benefits anf family oriented witjh good chance of advancement."
good,It’s a great place to work and if I had a choice to go back I would. I was the dock general I unloaded and loaded trucks. I kept up with the paper work
good,I enjoyed working with Cardinal Health I would of still be employed if the company would've moved quality department to another Cardinal Health. The worst part of the job as a team leader is dealing with attitudes but I got through the day.
good,"Complicated manager.Poor training and management."
good,"This was an interesting adventure, we had become accustomed to being a small company, now we were once again becoming a division of a huge corporation with a similar company within. Many new processes, systems had to be learned always concerned our location would some day be consolidated."
good,"Job was great, always offered 40 hours per week and at times overtime. Was able learn how to perform different task when needed. Management very friendly and listen to our concerns. Really disliked the idea when they told us that they were moving more then half of the company out of the country. Other then that job and company were great to worked for."
good,"The people, management and job wasnt that bad at all. the shift hours of 4pm-2:30am (At the earliest typically more around 4-5am) was the part that killed me."
good,I would pack orders for pharmacies all over the united states and send them out ups or by mail . We would use computers to scan the orders and pack them plus use the computers to make the shipping labels to mail the orders .I  also have team leadership job experience I worked as the night lead for my shift .We also used rf guns for picking the orders and used them for inventory of stock
good,I've worked at cardinal for nine months as a temp. very good company and good benifits but the cant keep a GM present to run it. The hours are inconsistent also so you have to work overtime everyday.
good,That it was very challenging and awarded for meeting goals i felt that it was a dead end job
good,"There was alot off favoritism in that place. And I understand that's in all company's,  but I started seeing the line leads favoring friends and hiring people on that were related. Though I was from a temp service. And did my job and didn't miss a day while I was there. Even though I told my temp service but they said will look into it and didn't. Even my sister worked there and was noticed it. Jusrbecause I would tell them to not just throw the rack"
good,amazing job. no  complaints......I've always came to work on time. never had a issue with working here....i learned alot working here... im better on my packing skills
good,"Work life balance is good, "
good,"very stressful place to work for. "
good,It a very nice company. Very nice and respectful people. I learned how to manage other people on the line with telling them their dily duties. The hardest thing about the job is getting there second shift. The most enjoyable thing is being able to be around other people and know we are doing something to save lives.
good,Great co-workers. Most enjoyable part of my job was achieving my goals.
good,"Great culture. Very clean atomosphere. The managers always found ways to thank you for doing a great job. The work isn't hard, you just have to be willing to go the extra mile to learn the job."
good,I look forwarded to going to work everyday. The benefits being the day you start.
good,"Not a lot of room for advancement, but it is a call center. This was great for a part time job, though. Supervisors were typically chosen because they were squeaky wheels that needed to be hushed versus choosing qualified candidates."
good,"Like any where the job was centered around how much and how fast .Employees were not treated as human beings in this work enviornment and was consisstantly told that if you dont like it go home so that we can find someone else, after trying to help the work conditions."
good,"This job was very challenging in the beginning but after getting the hang of it, it wasn't bad at all. I don't think management appreciated how hard the warehouse worked as the pay or raises didn't reflect that."
good,"It was a good experience , it's had great health insurance and I learned alot. Cardinal Health can be a great place to work if management would listen"
good,this company isn't worth my time to review as the way that workers are treated
good,Bad training. They expected too much from the employees for the salary they were paying. Coworkers were allowed to criticize new employees on their mistakes. Too much drama for me.
good,After working for Cardinal Health for a while now I love all of the perks but in terms of compensation and recognition there is little to nothing given. All managers have nice stories of places they have been on vacations while I am barely able to afford baby food for my child every week. Perks are great but I am worth so much more
good,"The production work was fun and easy and i like the work i was doing and was always ready for the next chalanges, hospital device and wire tubes and ventilators for hospital preparations for use on or with patience. it was easy but be alert with certain  guidelines."
good,"I worked here for 6 years and I loved the first 3. Then, they made a lot of bad changes and now employees and managers alike are in and out like a revolving door. The company itself offers great benefits and pay fairly, but the Montgomery DC is a mess and I wouldn't recommend a job at this facility."
good,I have nothing to say that is bad that may come back on me in the near future.  This company as with any other expects you to do the job that your hired to do.  keep your complaints to a minimum and follow company policies.
good,I love what this company stands for culturally and I am very inspired to work for the CEO and Executive Leadership team.  I enjoy what I do and my team is amazing.
good,"I haven't worked at all the warehouse but out of the ones where I was employed this is, in comparison, one of the better ones. As a company they are making changes to expand but they don't compensate their workers for the extra work that 'expansion' ensues. ."
good,Great place to work and get experience  - but management makes it hard to advance. Depending how you report to - if your boss believes in advancement then you can strive.
good,"Good company to work for with great benefit package."
good,Hours were long and work was hectic but the pay made it worth it all.  Company worried about the work not the people aspects.
good,The company is not great on policies that positively impact women in workplace.  Work from home is very negatively viewed.  Advancement is rare with somewhat of an boy's club atmosphere.
good,"it is a very strict and demanding company; not good not bad. it can stress you and medical appointments are not looked at positively. sick people cannot work there. "
good,"I have been with Cardinal Health since 1999.  I have held a number of positions in several departments and teams.  As with any place of employment there have been many challenges, but overall it is a good place to work."
good,"On a normal work day, it used to be clock in at 8:00pm and work you're own spur and drop the entire runs, wrap and load and be out of work by 4:30am, and everyone used to enjoy coming to work."
good,"•	Project manager for multiple simultaneous projects implementing new medication dispensing equipment into hospitals, including creating and managing project plans; leading a number of project teams from various departments i.e., pharmacists, nursing staff, IT, facilities management, etc.; managing issues and conflict resolution; serving as the software and product expert; working with internal and external technical resources on delivery issues/solutions; leading all project meetings; and reviewing and creating project status reports."
good,"picking, packing, stocking, qc"
good,the people there become more than co-workers they become your family. Feels like home workin there. overall nice place to work. 
good,I really like the job and knowing my hard work and dedication on hte job is saving someones life
good,Good clean environment. Ok management. Typical work consists of 9 to 10 hours. Thrive on on the job training. Good place for increasing knowledge.....
good,"I was hired as a part time employee with the promise of full time within 4 months and full medical benefits from day one. I work there a year and still never got a pay raise, a full time job, or benefits. I was given the run around so many times I simply got fed up and left."
good,My time at Cardinal Health was only temporary. I chose this job because it was recommended ot me. I worked here because the pay was good and i needed plenty of money before I went back to school in the fall.
good,"More and more the organization is focusing on cutting costs, regardless of the workload absorbed by the remaining work force. "
good,"Initial Manager was awful and unreliable making the new start experience stressful. My colleagues were awesome and supportive. There was no defined training but a sink or swim approach. Only certain folks were set-up for success. Internal political alliances effected those not part of the ""in"" crowd which made growth challenging and job security constantly in question."
good,pay raise was insufficent for the year being a fortune 500 company youd think they would be able to afford more than a 1% raise for their hard working dedicated employees it will make you discouraged and not want to work there
good,"large company, offers many mentoring programs to help obtain other positions."
good,"good place to work, just no opportunity for advancement and they don't help you grow.  Classes are not offered nor is enhancement training. Benefits are really good.  PTO is amazing.. but I want to grow with a company."
good,"I learned a lot in this job and got tons of experience. It was very challenging and fast pace environment, the business was a bit convoluted,, but overall I had a great time working for this company"
good,"Cardinal may tout it's stellar reviews from it's people at all levels regarding it's superior culture. When asking about compensation levels the culture is also referenced as an ""intangible"" benefit to offset the relatively low levels to companies in the area. "
good,A typical is constantly reviewing emails and calling clients. Also releasing orders. Some days can be stressful but people will tell you to leave it at work
good,"Cut-throat working environment. The training is horrible but they expect you to be an expert once you get out of training. Leadership show favoritism, don't trust them."
good,Not a bad place to work if not looking for advancement.  Manager creates distrust among underlings and doesn't trust supervisors to handle the job.  Workplace is unfairly managed in the warehouse.
good,In this location has very little advancement opportunities unless you are willing to move to the corporate office in Dublin Ohio.
good,I began with Cardinal health as a warehouse associate and progressed to an Operations Supervisor. It's a very fast paste environment. Work life balance is not very balanced we work until the job is complete.
good,"Good people there but are not valued by Management Changes are made without  throughly thinking them through. When expansion happens, people are then let go just as quickly because the next change is to reduce the original plan. Many people have left jobs for Cardinal and then just as quickly, lose them."
good,"Cardinal has was a great company to work for over the past 15 years. I have hire many employees over the years, and mentored many young men and women during those years to become better employees, and productive member of society. I have worked with some of the most talented sales reps that the industry has to offer, and have many fond memories of satisfying the needs of the hospitals and clinics that we supported. I will miss all of my co-workers, drivers, sales reps, office staff, Baxter employees, LTL drivers, and the many friends at all levels that I had the pleasure of working with the last 15 years."
good,A great place to work. The company has an expansive diversity with people from many countries and cultures showing great team work.
good,"Lots of good things going on.  Being a big company, your experience will vary by department."
good,"typical day would be project management, testing, writing technical reports, project updates"
good,the hardest part of this position being up on your feet for 10-12 hrs a day
good,"Cardinal Health was a very great company to work for, a lot of benefits and the pay is very well. It is a fast pace job with a very supporting environment."
good,"Currently I work for our finance function in the field supporting our sales team.  Unfortunately, finance has been essentially outsourced beginning in February 2020. There will be few opportunities within the finance function going forward."
good,Recently has gone downhill due to years of mismanagement. Has also started cutting peoples hours and making any sort of adjustment to save enough money to make their quarterly review look good.
good,If you work in inbound it’s easy as long as you pay attention while receiving.. Inbound does not do as much overtime maybe 5 to 10 extra hours in a two week span. Outbound however work a lot of overtime mean 13-15 hours daily. The pay sucks they should pay way more than they do even raises suck.. The benefits are great though.
good,"I enjoyed working for cardinal health. It was challenging and you were constantly learning. However, after the new site director took over, the culture was turning into a hostile work environment situation. There was always a need to blame someone for issues the site was having. Not a culture I want to be a part of. But, when I say this, I'm not talking about the company as a whole, I am referring to the site only. The company as a whole, has a great culture and management is usually very helpful in helping to develop you and get to the next level."
good,Job was satisfying. Good to do something for people who has a illness.  Paying forward. But management lets Supervisor to bully and cussing at employees. Was so disappointed in them.
good,"(wrked for Sonexus through Cardinal Health)  okay job but management needs major improvement. micro managing, favoritism and rude at times. They should offer surveys to the contract employees to do on the superviser instead of asking everyone about the job in front of others."
good,"Cardinal is a great company to work for! Excellent benefits, and amazing people to work with. I've learned so much from each area I've worked in within the company."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, the free lunch every Thursday,smal group of employee.the hard part of job, the hours, but the manager very nice, always helping us.."
good,"work days were okay,importance of my making quality product, stressful sometim yet pleasant, when machines run terrible and you are trying to make production."
good,"If you just want to spend 8 hours and go home with money that covers some of your bills and expenses then this is the place to work. But I find it not fun all, very few chance of advancement and a management that is hard to understand."
good,"This is a fast paced job where they expect you to work very hard and basically no talking. You are pretty much like robots. Long hours, not good on your feet."
good,"Micro managed and they give you a script to use when talking to customers on the phone. You get written up for certain things you say and don't say while on the phone,"
good,"Good salary but not enough, location of work place is too far."
good,"Job security is a problem at Cardinal. You never know when your job will be eliminated. Decent management, poor health benefits, liked the corporate work environment, but salaries are low and job security is nonexistent."
good,"Hi everyone,Am very happy to write this review today.This is very great company and surrounded by the good staff.its a good place to work............................"
good,"Fast paced, challenging, extremely customer focused.. Currently going thru some financial challenges that has led to cost cutting, career advancement is a challenge,"
good,"stretching then people being placed in area."
good,"Good environment, but not good job stability.  Our job changed on a daily basis and hard to tell what would happen from one day to another.  Management was not very straight forward which made it hard to determine if we will have a job from one day to the next."
good,Workplace and culture of work place was ok coworkers motivated one another. Management was helpful when needed. No schedule adjustments if you wanted to go back to school or advance.  Weather guidelines where based in northern states not southern states.
good,Carding as a whole is a great company.  From a IT Infrastructure it is a high stress get stuff done as fast as possible with minimal budget.  With soloed management style there is minimal collaboration that adds more stress to the environment.
good,Fast paced family/privately owned practice. Great job for someone just graduating. Experience with Internal and Pediatric medicine.
good,"Es un lindo Lugar de Trabajo,muchos Dias de vacaiones Buenos beneficios"
good,Great place to work and to learn how to do order picking. Very easy job to do takes alot of time. Poor organization and poor management. Not enough employees for in each department
good,Great innovative culture from top leadership down through all layers of the organization. Great people to work with.  Provides a fun environment.  Minimal leadership layers.
good,"- Cardinal is a great place to work for it's benefits and people.  Management speaks of Work/Life balance being important but, do not demonstrate this in day to day work environment.  This job requires 90 percent travel and when hired it was told to me it would be 70 percent.  Management input is limited to remote users."
good,"The management team is create at facilitating an inclusive work environment. They always look to find innovative ways to make the job easier, but the they fall short on the knowledge portion from the employee's point of view. Decisions are made with little input from the base employees, and getting management to actually stick around for their entire shift is tough as well."
good,"The job is extremely demanding not just physically, but mentally as well. Besides tremendous responsibility, there is almost unrealistic expectations from the management. I witnessed just too much nepotism and favoritism instead of a respect for hard working employees. That kind of atmosphere kills drive to build a better team and even retain employees."
good,"Site team is excellent; corporate involvement is very minimal. Good compensation/benefit; hectic schedule, good learning environment for pharmaceutical/aseptic process."
good,Because there was a lack of training for the specific job.  Many employees were unsure of their goals and responsibilities.  Manager was verbally abusive.  Chose not to hear employees concerns and required them to meet unreasonable expectations.
good,Good pay and benefits. Very diverse positions available picking and packing for a medical distributer. The bummer is that you never know what time you are leaving. Can be hard on families.
good,At the time of employment corporate was in a restructuring phase to find the sweet spot to run the business. After a year and a half of employment corporate reorganized again and over 20 employees were laid off; from shift supervisors to directors.
good,"Overall Cardinal Health is great company to work for. I don't agree with most of my supervisors ways, but do enjoy working at the pharmacy that we are contracted at."
good,Very comfortable place to work but limited in growth professionally.  Management lacks ownership of the pharmacy.  Outstanding Pharmacists on duty.  Workers are hard workers but lack the compensation.
good,"Good place to work with decent wages and benefits. Co workers were like family and all worked well together. Stayed busy the entire work day with plenty of duties. Nothing hard about my job. The most enjoyable part was my day shift hours and my ability to do the job with little or no supervision."
good,Great place to learn about compounding and nuclear pharmacy. Not a lot of advancement opportunity and not currently investing in pharmacy interns.
good,Cardinal was a great job. Unfortunately its a contract job which puts limits on job security.
good,"As the account manager for hospital accounts in the tri-state area, I was the primary contact for the sales representative and hospital purchasing agents. I manged hospital accounts in excess of 14 million dollars doing anything from order placement and making sure deliveries were received on time. I handled the account receivables and payment of the accounts making sure the hospital paid bills and stayed in good financial standing with Cardinal Health. I maintained strong working relationships with my sale representatives and clients ensuring they received the best service and that all their service needs were met. The most difficult part of the job was neutralized difficult customers while maintaining a great rapport with your customers. The most enjoyable part was the great relationships I built and the wonderful people I met. I also enjoyed working in a team and the team of professionals I had the priviledge to work with."
good,PRN assigments. I was sent to different facilities to work. It's been many years since working there. The most enjoyable part was experiencing work in different pharmacy settings and meeting new people. Working in high volume pharmacies and under deadlines.
good,"The company is very large, giving many opportunities to learn about the healthcare industry and many opportunities to move around the company.  Everyday is a new opportunity for growth."
good,"good starting point for just graduating individual there is always room for improvement"
good,This is a good place to work. Great benefits for the employee. Moving up is limited based on the positions offered at this location. Day to day operation make it a good place to work
good,"Learned new technologies like Python, Docker, Git. Nice team to work and learn from each other. Regular stand-up and code reviews. Pair programming.Weekly technical review sessions."
good,"I had a wonderful opportunity to work for Cardinal Health over 17 years, when my position was eliminated they still treated me fairly.  I would work there again if the opportunity presented itself."
good,Receptionist and HR manager for cardinal health. Individually helped HR director with work projects and files  as well as my receptionist job on a day to day basis
good,Productive and fun working environment. Lots of high character people who value who you are as a person and work itself. Lots of changes due to turnover but a fun place.
good,"It was a great company to work for but left no opportunity for career advancement.  Management changes often with never giving enough time to truly know who you are working under.  No room for error even with life events, only allowed so many occurrences before you where disciplined"
good,"Cardinal Health is a good place to work.  The business model is under pressure as healthcare is evolving.  However, the management team is actively working to position Cardinal for success in the longer term."
good,"I walk into the building, get signed in then walked to the front of the plant to see where I am assigned for the day. I go to my assigned area then see where I am placed for the start of the day. I learned that in the place is the job your doing doesn't have to be boring. the hardest part of the job is that you have to check every single bag that's comes off the machine and then count all the bags then place them in a box which go into a bigger box.. you have to quick look at every single bag because you don't get to thoroughly check them. the most enjoyable part of the job is going on break and being able to talk to your friends and socialize"
good,"Cardinal Health is a challenging and exciting environment.  Lots of really smart people, working really hard.  Competitive and energizing work environment.  A company with a really great mission and purpose in healthcare!"
good,Mandatory overtime sometimes travel to other states medical benefits were okay coworkers were friendly also very helpful hours were early and convenient for me vehicles supplied by company were generally new 19 days pto each year salary increases once a year
good,"Overall, Cardinal Health is a good company with a positive corporate culture.  However, the silos of the business units can have a large impact on the employees' experience... such as compensation, growth opportunities, and schedule flexibility.  For example, employees who live near the corporate campus in Dublin typically have more chances for advancement... but tend to be compensated less than some of the satellite locations such as Houston.  Some business units embrace working remotely, while others all but prohibit working from home.  These are questions you should consider asking if you find yourself deep in the interview process."
good,I spent one year to the day at Cardinal Health in Dublin Ohio.  It was a Contractor role and very enjoyable.  When my contract ended I was rolled-off at the company.  My managers during my tenure will gladly provide references and discuss my background.
good,"I had a great experience at Cardinal but it is what you make it. The hours can be long and but the pay is decent. If you start the shift expecting it to be awful and with a bad attitude, it will be a long day. But if you approach the day with a positive attitude and with a good work ethic, it is worth it!"
good,Everyone is working at a fast pace and the work place environment is comfortable. People are there to get stuff done and go home. Easy money. Recommend
good,Temporary position with UMass to assist prescription advantage members with Medicare part D.  Very nice and supportive management. Loved working with elderly.
good,Great opportunity to gain valuable people and leadership experience. Methodologies are always in flux and driving work is a challenge with much of the personnel being in a matrixed environment.
good,"good experience working with them. Got opportunity to interact and collaborate with senior leadership. Good learning on QA tool set like HP ALM, Performance Center, UFT with SAP implementation from QA/testing prospective."
good,"I was a QA Analyst, and my job every day was just that: create QA tests and analyze the results. I did my job, and they kept me on, "
good,"Cardinal Health is a great place to work with many opportunities for growth, development, and upward movement. The industry is currently in a volatile situation given the prices of healthcare in the US."
good,"Required by Indeed. Typical work day. I go to work and do my job. I have learned many different computer systems since working there. Management is light. The work requires little coordination with other team members. When coordination is needed most of the time the staff can work it out without involving supervisor, because of the nature of the job and the professionalism of the staff."
good,"The workplace culture was very crude, lots of dirty jokes etc. They were otherwise friendly and professional. The staff meets regularly to assign special products and identify potential risks."
good,I enjoyed working at Cardinal Health. I started as an executive assistant and was promoted into the HR field.Benefits were good and I had great coworkers and management!
good,"It was a temporary job for me because I was waiting to try to get into Saint Alexius which is now Amita ,  my task at hand was to get to take stuff off the conveyor belt product of a conveyor belt and put them in a box and ship them out ."
good,"I spent over 15 years at the company and worked in about 4 different job capacities. Lots of good employees that care about doing a good job each and every day, Management - not so good. Leadership- missing in some areas. Hard to do a good job when there's no one showing you what the expectation is...."
good,"Great place to work, especially in the corporate offices. Pay quit well."
good,"Productivity  was  always  good, I  went  there  to  give  them  a  lot  but,  they  did  not  give  me  nothing  back. They  promised  a  lot  but,  did  not  keep  their  promise.  A  lot  of  class  struggle,  back "
good,I was to deliver nuclear medicine on a timely basis. Represented Cardinal health in a professional quality service manner.  During my time I learn much about the process and procedures on the nuclear medicine industry.
good,This is a good company to work for.  Good benefits and has taken care of my family for the last 17 years. The leadership team is very accommodating and understands work life balance.
good,positive and upbeat work environment with opportunity for advancement. Learned helpful computer skills. My work day consisted of data entry and problem solving. My tenure ended with company shipping jobs of to India.
good,"Good Place to work "
good,You had to work hard but not alway seen for it. sometimes judgemental personality wise. A lot of favoritism. but still a decent place to work there some good people there.
good,"I was signing up for indeed. After uploading my resume I was prompted to take a survey for cardinal health, probably because "
good,Job wasn't physically exhausting but pretty repetitive. Got along with all my colleagues but not something I Would personally look into as a career option great experience though
good,People are always leaving. They do train you but the compensation for what you work is not feasible. I'm only supposed to work 8 hours a day and end up working a full 12 hours. Can't call off or take off on Sundays or you get penalized. People with seniority get away with whatever. Can't maintain a family of 5 off this salary.
good,"Cardinal Health offers so many solutions to a clinical facilities that it's an honor to work there.  The connection with the patient is amazing.  In order to do this, long hours and lots of pressure from senior leaders is expected."
good,"Based on the sale of Alaris  to Cardinal Health, the overall approach and specifics of working at Cardinal Heath were no different. In fact the same CEO and board remained the same."
good,Good benefits but you start night shift and opportunity to transfer to day shift is almost non-existent.  I worked with people who had been there for 7 years and were still unable to move to day shift.  Opportunities for promotion are equally non-existent.
good,"Laid back, great team work, well organized, great pay, plenty of overtime whenever you want. good amount of PTO and sick days, open floor for better production ideas"
good,"Come in, type C2 orders, help pick, QC, and pack the orders. Make and corrections needed. I learned how to work in almost all departments in the business minus a few. Management was hard to work with because it kept changing. Fast paced and difficult to keep up with at times. Doing my job and someone else at the same time and being expected to stay on schedule with both and not getting praised, compensated, or acknowledged for being able to do so. Going home."
good,cardinal health is a great company overall. but I would have wish management was more organized and notify their employees when they make changes. we all work as a team. and we all get affected mby decisions they make on their own without having the rest of the employers make decisions as well. we do work as hard as they do and are the reason patients receive their products. the company is very good. people their are friendly staffs. what will help the company grow is if we all were on the same page.
good,"Learned a lot about different products, business to business marketing, segmentation and detailed information about health care and over the counter products"
good,"Cardinal health is a very nice to place to work at, people are friendly, work environment is decent. Gained a lot of health care knowledge got a fair idea how the business works."
good,"Cardinal Health is a great place to start a career. There is so much opportunity... to a point. Once you get to middle management, the opportunities begin to dry up and there are fewer places to grow your career. Great benefits and work-life balance varies depending on role. All in all, I would still recommend!"
good,"Great place to work. Learned cloud integrations."
good,"Nice place to work,my co workers were helpful and the whole everyday job functions were easy going.But the salary was too small especially for the delivery drivers there."
good,The pay is not enough o be a medical supply company. The managers don't have any idea about what is going on. the regular employees are more informed than they are
good,A lot of great people worked there.  When a hospital doesn't know how to run a hospital pharmacy they would pay Cardinal to manage the hospital.  Pay was lower than competitors.
good,"Mandatory OT was a pain, but very worth it."
good,typical day is working with Doctors and nurses. You should be detailed oriented because they will make you feel like someone could die if you mess anything up. Management is good and always for you.
good,"Local team great, overall to slow and burocratic, not ready for International expansion yet and to US focused."
good,"Cardinal is a good place to work, but it depends on your manager. Some are good and some are not. Career development is mediocre as well. It is very nice having an on-site doctor, pharmacy, fitness center, and credit union."
good,long hard days with travel. lots of windshield time. customers most often happy to see you as the systems offered worked well. reasonable travel expenses.
good,Great people diverse company. Enjoyable days. Comfortable motivational atmosphere. Even those the shutdown of the warehouse facility was ill favored by its employees great company.
good,Overall company culture is good. Cardinal allows for good opportunity for networking through the various segments of the internal business as well as all the company group events that are provided there.
good,Good company to work for. Job skills need better training.  Large corporation type of management.  Supervisor needed management skill training. Office culture was wonderful and many benefits.
good,I very much enjoyed working at Cardinal Health. There was good communication between management and staff. Management consistently recognized the efforts of rank and file to meet deadlines and other work related goals.
good,Experiences and knowledge gained here is an excellent stepping stone into the Healthcare industry.  Compensation is on the low side for the industry but will provide the experience to move into a higher paid position outside the company.
good,Overall it is a good place to work.  The only negative is there appears to be a difference in procedures within a department where certain things are more streamlined than others.  Work life balance can be a challenge.
good,Environnement stressant mais bien encadré. Salaire et avantage sociaux intéressant.
good,"Monday - Friday, regular work hours, 4 weeks training before learning their applications. credit card payments, find missing monies for unapplied checks. write offs, off sets, statements that take a lot of detail to submit, management were very understanding in difficult situations for complex customers. coworkers were fantastic, learning how to do macros and how they can make your work easier and faster. was learning how to take on a new skill that I had never done before."
good,"To be able to help patients in need is an incredible feeling .Any job you work will be what you make it, and Cardinal Health has taught me a lot, not just about the workplace but about life as well."
good,I've been able to work in different departments within Cardinal which allowed me to explore my career options as well as different places to live.  I worked in 4 different states while employed with Cardinal.  A very enjoyable experience.
good,Awesome Company to work for. I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to lead a team of 40 and it has been great thus far.
good,"Offer many benefits and enjoy working along side a great team of people. "
good,"I worked here from 2009 until the plant was shut down and our jobs were outsourced out of the country in 2014. While there, I grew as a team lead in a work cell manufacturing surgical draperies. I also took on many other tasks such as new employee orientation, quality assurance tasks, and office tasks that involved updating manufacturing procedures."
good,Fast paced and ever changing work environment and rising to the challenge to do a great job every time to build strong customer relationships so that they will continue to renew their contracts with Cardinal Health. The best part was building relationships with the customers and the coworkers.
good,Cardinal Health is experiencing growing pains.  The organization of labor often seems inefficient.  The work hours make it difficult to have valuable time off.  The days are long.
good,"had very nice co workers,hardest part not making mistakes,most enjoyable part was having a job,i learned how to be wise in life from the older women i worked with"
good,Worked in shop facility. Teamed with experienced person who was responsible for training and overseeing the quality of my work.
good,i work forklift machine pick box and put way box work so hard but i love my a job and really great compnay i work here since 10 month so great

good,Vast sales and management experience in a complex industry and fast paced environment selling solutions to advance healthcare.
good,"The company continues to grow and it seems upper management has a concrete plan to solidify Cardinal as a top contender in everything ""Healthcare""."
good,Cardinal Health is a good company to work for.  The provide a relaxed work environment.  They also provide reasonable pay rates.
good,"Great Company, but a lot of politics."
good,"This job was long and tiring. Even though I had something to ride around the warehouse with, everyone had to lift very heavy boxes and stack them very high. Cardinal Health was more physical than mental but don't think you don't have to think! ... Ha!"
good,"Worked on new product development. A respirator that reputed to be smaller and having more functional modes than comparable products."
good,"Cardinal Health is a Health Care Institution with several groups within the organization."
good,It is a good place to work in. Good work-life balance and flexible working time. Great benefit and excellent working environment.
good,a great company and culture definetly looks after the interest of the employees. great opportunities to grow. must be able to work indepdedly and efficiently
good,Very tight and positive workplace environment.  Enjoyed going to work everyday.  The company gave me a large variety daily.
good,"Job variety which included STD leave and daily reporting, processing payroll cases involving taxes, STD, earnings, timecard hours, manual check or direct deposit processing. New in-house system was utilized on 1-1-2015, ADP was payroll system utilized until 1-1-2015."
good,Prospecting and calling on endocrinologist and doctors to build relationships to further the business in the territory. Build relationships with patients to further their ongoing reordering of supplies and other devices. Work together with other counterparts in the territory for great success.
good,"Worked with a team, Got along well with co-workers."
good,AT work would we start by signing in and then mounting the scanners on our arms. After mounting them we would scan the items and grab the necessary medicine items needed.
good,The access to networking with peers all over the United States.  The ability to share experiences and idea.  Had an executive focused in my area of expertise to provide guidance and feedback.
good,Cardinal Health is a company where as you work you are saving lives of there citizen by send out medicine and medical supplies to hospitals.
good,"Late shifts, organized, great leadership, great colleagues. Cardinal Standard rules is an easy goal anyone can accomplish."

good,"o	Assist with the development of program plans which include: Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Organization, Communication, Staffing, Risk and Issue management"
good,"this place needs better management to distribute work evenly to all employees and if you are not familiar with fast paced environments this is not the place for you."
good,"Normal corporate work atmosphere. "
good,Worked in a independent endoscope lab. Received great support from management. Sales team worked hard in a tough market to procure repairs away from the OEM.
good,"Print Room Operations is a very fast paced job and learning the new system on printing invoices was fun. The management team wasn't very good; yelling at employees, cursing at the employees, I worked by my self but my co-workers made it fun to be there. The hardest part of my job was speaking with management the best part of my job was working by myself."
good,"Cardinal Health is a great company. The company's mission statement and values are very motivating, and the benefits are great."
good,I enjoyed working at Cardinal Health. I learned so much about nuclear medicine. I had the chance to meet many people from all over the place. I enjoyed this company.
good,"Easy going environment"
good,Really simple job to do as long as you're comfortable driving for long periods of time. Co-workers were nice and easy to get along with and helpful in case you need help with something. Management was great in the beginning but once you've been there awhile they don't really listen to you if it comes to schedule changes or if somethings not working out for you.
good,"Taking customer orders, complaints, and at times cooking the food. Great employees!"
good,"Day consist of answering multiple calls per day in reference to customer's accounts, orders, and etc."
good,"Making sure each floor and each patient were getting supplies they needed kept us running at all times. There were several on our day shift so things flowed somewhat. When I switched to 3rd shift the actual orders of supplies slowed down but then we had to take supplies each night to each floor, after filling those orders. Our end of night shift would consist of restocking the shelves with product from the warehouse."
good,Co workers were the best part of job. major improvements to be made at this company.
good,"A typical day was working with department heads on contracts, preparing for supplier visits, arranging staff training as well as staff lunches, while making sure all FDA regulations were being followed in the labs."
good,deals with a lot of customers specials identify components by computer image and assembles kit to customers specifications
good,"Go into work, have a team meeting, ans start the orders for the day and maintain an hourly goal.  The people were very nice and the management was okay for the most part.  Hardest part was meeting hourly goal once it started to increase tremendously.  The most enjoyable was how fast paced it was made the time go by."
good,When you start your treated like a machine. You need to keep a outrageous quota to stay working there.
good,I would clock in get to my desk and check emails and my calendar for any appointment happing that day.  Research and respond to any urgent emails.  The day is filled with researching proof of deliveries issuing credit if necessary and contacting the supplier when credit was due to the company.  I really enjoyed the time I spent there.
good,Cardinal has a great position in the marketplace. Strong LSS culture. Bad people can hide behind good performing people. Good people stand out. Easy to network and people are willing to help others learn.
good,Learned a lot at Cardinal Health. Good opportunities to work in different departments.
good,Cardinal Health is a large corporation that is becoming the leader in the medical supply industry at a very fast pace
good,Working here has taught me how evan a big corporation can lack organization and procedure. I gained experience here by learning how to adapt and how to voice my opinion by requesting implentation of certain procedures which helped my distribution center overall. The company itself is a great company however it seems not all distribution centers are run the same hence creating friction with the employees vs the employers. It is something the company attempts to resolve quickly and satisfactory.
good,"When you work at Cardinal, you get out of it what you put into it.  "
good,I loved working machines. Like the people that I worked with.
good,"Good to work in this company."
good,team work was great learned that do the best job you can that day and everyone on same page make job more easy for everyone.
good,I held a position that included some of the following duties:
good,Great place to work for a Fortune 25 company. Good opportunities for entry-level employees and recent college graduates.
good,"Swing-shift, rotating schedule that has different job duties in each rotation from compounding to DOT regulations to managing and directing technicians to prescription input and monitoring. The hardest part of this job is dealing with a constantly changing work time, from overnights to early mornings to closing shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is the challenging compounding and the wonderful co-workers."
good,Had the opportunity to launch a first-in-class gastrointestinal antibiotic.
good,Productive and fun loving place. Nice people to work with. Learn't the Underlying Business process.
good,"Professional atmosphere,competitive,productive workplace"
good,Great place to work but when company started to down size it was a different situation.
good,every team member would have gold /doing above and be on by working over and helping other do what ever neads to be done /the boss give out t shirts red sox tickets that is not the hole team any body wants to go .
good,"i keep place as clean as i can can get it , bout the cleanest as i can get it,"
good,Must always be on your toes. Work fast yet accurately. Decent Pay and benefits
good,It was a good place to work.
good,"We handle nuclear medicine on a daily basis. Personally since I am a Tech I, I draw the doses for hospitals and doctors offices for there patients. I also help dispatch the runs that go out to the hospitals and doctor offices. I learned a lot about nuclear medicine and radiation from being employed here. I enjoy the people I work with we all get along great."
good,"Cardinal Health is and was a Good Company, when we Split off as CareFusion it changed and became a more difficult company to work for and Management became Impersonal and less Knowledgable."
good,"pleasent place to work fast pace, good enviroment, good place to learn if you want self improvment. they promote from within and reconize hard work. management has a ear willing to listen. company bbq days, weekly meetings always keep you informed."
good,It was great experience working in Cardinal Health which is Fortune 17 company. I had completed the FLC which is an upgrade from R/3 to ECC.
good,Like the job and assisting patients and healthcare providers. Cardnial is a good company overall. Must have attention to detail. I would recommend Cardinal Health
good,I thoroughly enjoy my job at Cardinal Health because I get to interact with all of our new employees. I'm trusted to train anyone on anything needed for upper management.
good,The company has definitely taught me alot. I learned alot of business & mechanical skills & training from the company . The process has changed but for the most part it is a good company
good,If you work for Outbound just be prepared for lots of overtime. It could be a great place to work for but the pay is the issue. Great benefits and PTO
good,Dedicated staff.  Caring managers.  Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with great co-workers and business partners.  There is definitely an opportunity to learn a lot here as long as you are willing to step up and volunteer for special projects.
good,"my experience being with cardinal health for 14 years.  I have to data entry, quality check, being precise and analysis medical kits. I have also learn how to be a leader with my team."
good,Gave me a job and benefits while i was employed. Sad to leave but ready to start a new adventure in life. I will miss this place and the friendships that i made.
good,"The companies culture strives for excellence in a competitive market."
good,"Cardinal Health is a fast pace working environment, the challenging part for the leaders on the line is having to train new employees, that are not willing to hustle or challenge themselves. Having leadership skills is a plus. But they get overused and in return their is no benefits."
good,"laid back at times, more of a cooler environment, simple work and easy to catch on, very long hours and days, sometimes seven days a week. overtime was mandatory so you had to work 12 hours pretty much everday."
good,"while walking a lot during the shift it was a good company to work for.  "
good,"It was a fun place to work. I got along with management and co workers. Every one was very friendly. It’s very fast paced and you’ll work on average 10+ hours. You don’t really have a social life outside of work because you technically work 6 days a week if you work nights. The pay was decent, but varied every week because one week you’ll have 50 hours and the next week, you’ll have 55-58 hours. Overall it was a great experience. I would recommend to anyone."
good,"Time management "
good,"I love cardinal health and what they stands for and represent. just that the location where I work is completely managed by people who think being a leader is all about being a dictatorship and never follow up the company policy on discrimination and behavioral attitude. too much of favoritism that has turned to ethnicity problem."
good,This company allowed me the time to finish school and achieve my degree as a BSN-RN. I can not advance with this company in my current location. I am considering a move to Mississippi and would like to transfer within the company if able.
good,The company is friendly but it needs to be improved in terms of the job process. Some of the managers looks not very well experienced how to handle the job.
good,I loved working great benefits and good people. I learned to operate severl different types of forklifts. The hardest part about the job was the hours.
good,Very interesting place to work very good mix of culture and differences and huge break room was a plus. but team leads need to get it together because there is to much drama between them
good,"A typical day at work can be filled with back to back non-stop phone calls. Most calls consist of new customer orders but a mixture of calls from the pleasant customer to the angry customer can lead to a stressful day."
good,Typical day includes helping fulfill customer orders and making deliveries. Management is hands off for the most part. Everyone seems to get along with one another. The hardest part for me was performing QC on customer orders. The most enjoyable was making deliveries and the alone time out on route.
good,"Cardinal is an awesome company based on the PTO, Benefits and pay. I would recommend this company there are many opportunities and the atomsphere is fabulous."
good,"great place to work if your not worried about making much money."
good,"If you're looking to become well rounded and capable of working in any industry (successfully), then Cardinal Health is an amazing launching point for your career!"
good,"Working at Cardinal Health is demanding. Constantly shifting priorities. Friendly people focused on doing a good job but not always held accountable for delivering on commitments. Better benefits, resources, and work life balance needed"
good,"This was my first phone center job. I had to learn really quickly. Its just like any other job, you come in get your work done and go home. Nothing spectacular."
good,Cardinal Health is a place where we can enhance our technical skills es. I have learned on how to gather the requirements and communicate on Issues with business analyst and project manager. The hardest part of the job is to cope up with the quick approaching deadlines.
good,Typical Day I would take Back to Back phone calls from Hospitals all around the United States Processing orders whether they be rush orders or returns or process shortages and reorders. What I learned was how important it was to process orders or any of the requests from the hospitals in a timely manner. Management was good if you had an issue or concern you could go talk to your supervisor. Colleagues made it fun to come in everyday very team oriented. Hardest part was probably just taking back to back phone calls.
good,"CAH is an okay company but the management can definitely use some improvement. The benefits have their highlights but definitely disappointing with some of the pending changes starting next year and with what was removed for retirees this year (no retiree insurance options),"
good,Good company. Competitive pay. Worked there for many years. Can be challenging but also rewarding. No job security and can be demanding but offer decent benefits. Very fair in their pay scale.
good,it was an ok job the money was nice but the management sucked we would work 12-13 hours monday- friday and sometimes even the weekends the people were nice thats about it
good,"na bad hours and very uncomfortable working conditions in the lab. the head dispatcher was so unfair to so many employees it is unreal."
good,Management isn't all that good.  It pays well but the health insurance isn't all idea like.  It's a new program as well so everyone is running around all confused like.
good,"First pharmaceutical sales opportunity.  Esablished positive client relationships in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island.  Opportunity to grow experience in the pharmaceutical industry"
good,"Lots of overtime, not great days off you work most weekends, two shifts the 2nd works long hours. Pay depends on your working career so you could have a nice starting salary if you work and had steady employment. $.75 extra per hour for starting your work day after 12pm"
good,"I enjoyed working there, they do a lot to let employees know they are appreciated for their hard work.  Managers are hands on & always trying to finding new solutions & streamlining the work load."
good,"You have to meet up with several workers at different organization levels, to ensure the information summits meet the standards and managements goals to report on time the financial data to the headquarters."
good,"Normal day working at Cardinal Health Care was prepared and completed warehouse orders for delivery or pickup according to schedule.  Plus, received and processed warehouse stock products. "
good,"I liked working for the company.  Good benefits.  Good work hours. Morale could have used some help. Some areas needed specialized training,  that could have been better."
good,People there where nice to work with and very helpful on training me. I didnt work there long but in the time i did work there i enjoyed it and would highly recommend.
good,The employees are all very nice and friendly. The managers don't always seem to know what they are doing and often can pull you in many different direction to the detriment of the team. Work is easy and not too stressful.
good,"Learned all about medical manufacturing and gained experience in the medical field.  Cardinal Health was a good place to work, however, was employed by the temporary agency."
good,"Long hours, lots of overtime, good when everyone does their job and works hard. I suggest keeping to yourself and doing your job and not worrying about any troublemakers"
good,"When one has worked for a company for 6+ years, one finds a niche.  I settled in to my getting in, making sure it was available and scrapping of inventory for my sites like it was second nature.  However, when you are short 2 technicians, you have to leave that inventory alone, and you have to do quality control on production."
good,Great company with excellent resources for work-life balance. The best part about working for Cardinal Health was the work culture. I enjoyed the team I worked with.
good,Hardest part of the job was dealing with job security. Overall the company is very good and strives to provide customers with the best quality of products and solutions.
good,"a great place to work, except for the fact the supervisor on the over night shift was a mean and not professional. Nuclear Medicine and the delivery to Hospitals in the Denver area."
good,"I worked in an experimental Crossdock branch of Cardinal Health. It was a part of a seperate logistics network, but ultimately has to be dissipated for business reasons."
good,"Typically the day would begin with answering emails and voice mails from vendors, FDA and customers. My job was a critical position and I regularly dealt with vendor defects or FDA recalls.   Many times throughout the day we would check products for lot numbers or expiration date tracked product that may be affected by a certain defect or recall.  I would remove these affected products from stock and Isolate it for returns to vendors or destruction. . There were many documents that had to be filled our and retained for every incident."
good,"Working for Cardinal Health has some great benefits. They do have a large amount of advancement opportunities, although my area does not have as many as I wish."
good,"Excellent company to work for. Cardinal Health had excellent benefits.  Cardinal Health was very fast pace company.  Company excelled in life and work balance,"
good,It matters not what the culture is or how good the stock price. People make the difference in the day to day at Cardinal Health.  I was fortunate to work with a great group in the PET side of the house.
good,My typical day at work starts at 6:30. Between 6:30 and 10:30 I work out in the picker/packer section. Between 11:00 and 2:00 I help in inventory area. At my last hour there I go back to picker /packer. Sometimes there is overtime.
good,"Wether I was working from my home office, or on the road visiting customers face to face. My job was to insure the customer was receiving correct contract pricing by working closely with manufacture. Also, making sure we delivered to the right place and on time. "
good,Cardinal is a very large company with many different entities and opportunities.  Compensation is very good by work/life balance is not always a concern of the company.
good,Very Culturally diverse workplace. Management has a servant based mindset. The most positive work environment that I have been in.
good,"This trade can be a tough racket, because of the work hours. However, if you love the work, you will be just fine. GMP is no joke. I loved my co-workers!"
good,"its a fast paced environment, learning new things everyday so i am  glad to be apart of this company. i work on the night shift; starting 5:30pm up to the job ends which is  more than 8hrs a day for five days a week. good benefit and a lot of overtime, which is making my life easier, beside the supervisors are ABUSING there power i enjoyed working to this company."
good,"Cardinal is a very productive company, I do feel that they could interact with they're employee's a little bit more offer reviews, raises, goals, etc. The time spent throughout my workday is very busy but with the help of co-workers it makes the day run smoother."
good,"A typical day at work was very fast and intense. We completed order picks and palletized product. You would learn about how the logistics worked in receiving and distributing correct product in a timely manner. You learned how to use various warehouse equipment, about hazardous materials, safety, etc. My co-workers were excellent people that brought a great work ethic and selfless attitude to work. The hardest part of the job was the AIMS system. Not user friendly. The most enjoyable part was the comradery with my co-workers."
good,"Great company and place to work.  For second year in a row, the company held the title of one of the best Puerto Rico employers."
good,"My experiences at CAH varied as much as the night from the day. I had various roles within the organization, my last being in the Radcliff Contract and Pricing department as an Advocate. My day consisted of working with the Lab sales reps and the customers at the facilities ensuring the pricing in the customer's database and ours matched as much as possible, This presented a proactive approach to reducing invoicing discrepancies. Most of the time, my co-workers tried their best to do their jobs to the best of their abilities. Other times, the inevitable messiness of a call center environment took control. "
good,"A typical day at work is to open the envelopes that the Dea 222 forms come in. I seperate them and then check to make sure pertinent information is there (Name, Date, Address, LLC, and Signature). From there i type the order completely and then someone else verifies it. I then check a report and assess ordering patterns for varios hospitals/pharmacies."
good,"Average company in terms of IT professional. Salary are not upto the mark. Work life balance is below average."
good,I am currently employed at Cardinal Health and have been so since 2002.  I am looking for a new opportunity within the Healthcare and PBM industry.  I have spent the last few years working with pharmacy retail independents on ways to improve their revenue steam and overall business model.  I have worked within our third party contracting group (Managed Care-LeaderNET) since 2008 and would be very interested in learning more from the PBM perspective.
good,If left alone you can do this job good.  Leads are sometimes on you  to do 200 lines an hour.  Some people aren't able to do that but still get thier work done.
good,Cardinal Health is a great company to work for. There are great opportunities for advancement with the company.
good,drive around Indiana and Michigan pre-dawn hours delivering nuclear pharmacy to hospitals/clinics
good,"Keep up to date the building , doing all maintenances . I was working nights and benefits was not great  and pay ,"
good,Rewarding if you seek out new opportunities.  I advanced pretty quickly here but getting compensation for what I did was not too much.  Performance reviews were unclear for new job titles so it was hard to meet all goals.
good,"Great place to work but less projects."
good,"Cardinal Health is a distribution/manufacturing company who specializes in medical supplies etc. Cardinal Health has been contracted out by the Detroit Medical Center and various other hospital chains for the last 20 years. I had the privilege off managing and maintaining inventory for Sinai Grace Hospital of Detroit O.r. department (operating room areas), for 13+ years. I loved working with Cardinal Health staff as well as Sinai Grace staff."
good,Picking orders pulling orders part time full time day and night shifts. Lots of places to move around and train in different areas. Lots of vacation time
good,"8 hour workday."
good,Good organization that allowed employees to create for the customers. They are challenged with growth in trying to put customers into defined segments. Organization taught a lot about learn about the shipping habits of customers and allowed employees to help customers to improve their shipping costs.
good,I have many good experiences in that company. Learn everything new everyday. It could be a good place to start your first experience in life.
good,"Management in the different departments was a little disjointed, great people t work with, good balance between work & life."
good,"I enjoy working in the hospital and had the privilege of calling on several major teaching institutions in the region. My primary focus was to find, develop , and cultivate business and business relationships. I was responsible for selling IV infusion pumps with an IT safety software. This clinical enterprise offered true safety and value to both caregivers and their patients!"
good,Cardinal was a great place to work and had great benefits. My days were different on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of my job was training employees and not knowing what to expect the day to be like.
good,"fast pace getting the product to the right hospital. co-workers was very team work orientated.getting the trucks out on time, was hard but getting them out on time, was most enjoyable."
good,Friendly atmosphere.
good,The work environment allows to work in interaction with other departments and increase your knowledge in areas linked to your job.
good,"The contract pharmaceutical sales division was a small division of Cardinal Health, Inc. I had the opportunity to work on a contract and launch a first-in-class gastrointestinal antibiotic."
good,Cardinal was a very great place to work sometime little demanding but part of the job . I learned a lot about hospital supplies and I realy learned how to drive heavy machines forklifts tsp reach trucks order pickers . Mangers was ok some of them . Co -workers a great group of guys and gals. At the end of the day a felling of something was done.
good,"I work with Cardinal Health through a temp service, I enjoyed coming to work everyday working in the workplace, management and co-workers, The job was not stressful always something to do, the work place was very organized and what I really like about the job is I work in different department, Something I like cause I had experience in different department, order puller, packing, wrapping merchandise pallets and etc."
good,"a typical day at work had all employees pick, pack and ship medical supplies."
good,I worked for this company for four years and contributed a great deal but the down fall was a manager who was there two days a month and would not solve any issues that came up I love the company
good,"Cardinal Healthcare was a very good facility, but like most places that take care of our elderly could use a lot of improvement. The residents there were wonderful teachers if you took the time to listen.There was certainly a life lesson to be learned from every person there and I will carry that with me always."
good,Implement bulk medication replacement as apart of a new pharmacy model. Most enjoyable part of the job was the amount of money we actually saved the healthcare facility. 6.7 millions dollars. Negotiating skills
good,working happy
good,"If you are a good employee, and willing to do the work, CAH will keep you for as long as you'll have them."
good,Customer centric organization with high tenured workforce.
good,"Más motivación a los colaboradores en todo sentido, salario, clima Organizacional, etc."
good,"Exceptional place to learn warehouse equipment operations. Shift Lead duties include order distribution processes, and quality control, assisting in other areas of warehouse to assure departure times are met."
good,Good not great. Better than most. Will pay overtime and while they do push kpi s and sometimes push you too hard the pay is good with the overtime! If you don’t have a job this is a great place to work and opportunity is their to move up and advance. I liked working here but it does depend on you and ur relationship with supervisor but the company is more than fair
good,I had a good experience with Cardinal Health and I liked the people a lot.  It was very hard to move up in the company's corporate departments if you were a sales rep.
good,"Good employer, good working environment, safe place to work and good benefits. Good amount of paid time off. Cardinal health provides you the tools to succeed in your job."
good,"Each day I go into work happy knowing that the people there are all in it together, and there to help you. No one is going to take you down, or make you feel less than regardless of title / reporting structure. On that note if the situation calls for authority to be used, then it is used properly."
good,Buford location has Horrible management. Go to work ! don’t make acquaintance ! And you’ll make good money and they’ll leave you alone . Remember don’t do anything extra . Clock in . Work . Clock out .
good,"Very supportive of your career! Great culture to succeed in and can be fun at times. What I liked most about Cardinal was our mission, Our mission was to save lives and we are essential to care."
good,"The job itself was fine, you would show up put your 10 hours in and head out, half an hour for dinner and another half hour break later on in the night. People working were alright, joked around, but its bascially just showing up and do your job."
good,"If you want to work at a company that really is about growth, development and exceeding customer expectations, this is the place for you.  You have to be willing to invest both yourself and your time, though.  You cant expect to grow with the company if you are unwilling to invest yourself.  This may mean coming in off shift to perform necessary work, working from home if and when needed and really, quite basically, being willing to do whatever is needed to please our customers."
good,"Great place to work. Smart people. Great work life balance. "
good,(Individual Contributor working Remote) Tough to advance your career across different business units and corporate opportunities due to the siloed nature of the organizational frameworks.
good,It was crazy when I left bc of Management couldn’t get things right but after I left they sorted it out. Less hours and work ethics. The reason why I left there it was do to Management and choosing a lead. Everyone wanted it and it was total drama!!
good,"Excellent choice for chem students and backgrounds that would need to get necessary experience under their wings "
good,A typical day at Cardinal Health  would be go in do your job efficiently and correctly.Management has its good and bad as any other company the work culture is ok.
good,At first job very great I was working Third shift and watching a one year old during the day so got a little tired at end of shift and my number started going down so you will have to keep number high to stay management will help you but you still have to put in the work in order to stay employed but work with some great people
good,"Overall good"
good,"10 hour shift "
good,Did not know from day to day how long would be at work.  Was very difficult to plan.  Many opportunities for overtime.  Very secure working facility and enjoyed co-workers
good,Great group to work with but management likes to take forever to answer any questions.  Like to hire temporary workers and work them like full time people but give them no recognition even though you work just as hard as the full timers do
good,"Good place to work if your retired, job is very repetitive. The job is very lax and you are on the road most of the time. Job is not just limited to driving you will be in lab preparing and cleaning equipment."
good,"Employees who have been with Cardinal Health over a year don't have much to worry about.  New Hires and temporary hires are subject to performance assessments which determine long term employment.  Generally managers are collaborative, yet they don't practice retaining employees.  About 50% of warehouse associate staff change on a regular basis."
good,This was a good place to work for the years that I was an employee.  Process improvement was a top priority for Cardinal Health and the department that I was a part of.
good,Great place to try innovative approaches to operations and business practices.  Cardinal Health challenges its employees to think outside the box and do things as always done before.
good,"pays well, work too much at times, not pleasant atmosphere, don't like working second shift, good vacation policy, many days off but hard to get the ones you want."
good,"Client Relations meetings, to develop processes and workflows. Investigate and resolve customer inquiries and escalated concerns, monitor productivity and adherence to Key Performance Indicators for the assigned program. Scheduling and workforce management. Motivate and engage employees."
good,"Very easy picking but at first confusing"
good,"The environment is very professional, but management knows when and how to make the office more fun.  Cardinal is good at setting up networking opportunities."
good,Management generally cares about the employees well being. Cardinal Health is a growing company that has taken on a larger role in the support of the health care industry.
good,Working for Cardinal Health has been a rewarding experience and I have learned valuable skills along the way. I would recommend Cardinal Health to anyone starting out in the workforce. There are varied opportunities for entry level and tenured positions.
good,Good company to work for.  Lots of great benefits.  Because the company is big there are lots of opportunities to move and grow your career in the company.
good,"The company promotes employee recognition and is very good at communicating accomplishments.  Employees may work well with little or no supervision,empowerment of employees."
good,I would recommend working for Cardinal Health to all persons. They offer great career development and learning opportunities for all levels including mentorships.
good,"It was an okay place to work, back to back calls but they always had fun activities from time to time to keep things different. Cardinal Health is also great with local charities"
good,Physically demanding environment with potential for long days.  Rewarding feeling that comes from knowing the product going out will help people get better.
good,"Great small atmosphere for being part of a large corporation. Communication could vastly improve, specifically during critical operations during manufacturing."
good,"Management didnt hire enough people for 2nd shift so we were always on OT. "
good,Some problems with management. Good work/life balance. Company does promote from within frequently. Benefits are exceptional compared to most companies today.
good,"It's an OK place to work if you are an employee I suppose. I know that contractors are not employees, but at Cardinal I was ultimately  treated as an outsiders and disposable. I never felt like I had job security and after two stints with them I don't think I would ever consider a third."
good,"Overall, it's worth it to work here, monetarily. It's actually difficult to find an employer that pays better in the surrounding 100 miles. The cost to personal life is pretty high though. There's very little work-life balance with mandatory Saturday overtime for almost all employees. Even salaried employees are required to show up and walk around the production floor for no other reason than to show the hourly folks they're not alone in suffering. Management has no real plans to end the overtime as they they keep saying if enough people are hired and trained, they'll drop the overtime. Ironically, the mandatory overtime is what is driving the high turnover. Very few town hall meetings don't have employees bringing up the lack of work-life balance. Aside from that, the work is straightforward, it's simple to do. There's never a dull moment as there's always a production line or piece of equipment needing immediate attention to get working again. It's a pretty safe place to work."
good,"Great place to work. Generous benefits and employee centered management. Reasonable job training and opportunity for advancement. A ""Fortune 17"" company that betrayed hundreds of its employees by shipping jobs overseas."
good,It was a temporary job (2 months).  It started out as day shifts (10-6:30) then it switched to graveyards (11PM-7:30AM) which they told me would happen. I liked the people that I worked with.
good,"Hourly employees can expect  a lot of overtime and a very fast paced work environment. "
good,It's a great place to work! It offers great benefits and and the people there are very professional. I would recommend working at Cardinal Health !!!!!
good,"Great job just not for people with families. Small children or children at all. The job is completion based, so you work til the job is done. Money is good."
good,"Cardinal health is a traditional workplace culture and environment.  The people are by and large great and make working at Cardinal enjoyable.  The industry is competitive and cutthroat.  Sometimes Cardinal is slow to innovate and change, but by and large the people are always willing to do right by our customers and are respectful of their co-workers.  The pay at Cardinal Health isn't as great as other companies in the industry, but the benefits (i.e. PTO, Health Benefits, 401K) are very strong"
good,"For the type of work required, the compensation was too low.  Good overall company and the local management was great, but that wasn't enough to compensate for the low wages."
good,Worked here part time while in school.  Nice place to make some money and they have flexible hours for students.  Fairly easy work and they give you paid time off so you can keep your job through exam week.
good,"A management is no have experience like management. and management is a difficult to management situation. Work is not have structural, I contraction a SOP but is difficult because a culture of  company is a not follow SOP. I work all manual, example : expiration of SOP and all document review."
good,Great company to work in but CEO Meg is out of touch with the employees. Cardinal is in the midst of change in their strategy moving from a low margin distributorship to a Data and biotech company.
good,"Safe work environment.  Career advandement, great benefits, starting pay was mediocre. Management were knowledgeable and helpful toward staff. Company transportation and managers were available on site."
good,"Standard 40hrs/week, workload was manageable."
good,"A typical day started with taking care of damaged/defectives goods. I had to dispose of or return the products per company guidelines. Detailed reports had to be filled out, ( product code, batch number, quantity, and expiration date ) which then had to be signed and witnessed. I would spend the next two to three hours completing the daily cycle counts, researching discrepancies, and making the appropriate adjustments. Most of the rest of the day was spent finding  appropriate locations for new inventory items, deleting products that were no longer stocked and assigning these locations to new products. I enjoyed my short tenure at Cardinal Health and learned a number of new processes, worked with new equipment, ( handheld computers, lift trucks, reach trucks  etc.)and had an excellent experience with the all the personnel there.  They had a very solid management team and a great team of dedicated and hard working employees."
good,"Good company to work for, promotions came from within and continued growth opportunities were given. In management I learned to balance the companies business needs and direction with employee needs and issues. I promoted culture change and prided myself in managing employee up within the company. I also learned that weekly or bi- weekly employee meetings were a great source of communication and development for change."
good,"A Nuclear Medicine courier is a physically demanding job. I would not recommend this job to women as the transport of the medicine can be very heavy and taxing on upper body strength. I truly enjoyed the people I worked with and the pharmacy environment is laid back but productive. One downfall is the compensation. If you need just pocket money this is the job for you. However, what lacks in compensation is made up for with PTO."
good,I worked a twelve hour shift 3 days followed by a 6 hour shift on day four. The management was good and the employees were great. it was a really satisfying job.

good,"we have a lot of over time, the only thing that I do not like is that the persons who work second shift  do not have a social life for the hours of work.  But if you do not mind that I think that the rest it is okay."
good,"Working remotely was nice, no pressure, did my tasks, participated in ""standup"" meetings over Skype, performed deployment almost every 2 weeks."
good,It's a great place to work for but I would like to expand my work experience I would like to apply myself to other jobs to one day becoming a maintenance manager myself
good,"Cardinal Health is a great place to work and since it is so large, it has many opportunities to move around.  Every group I have ever worked in was always a great team and everyone generally cared about the well being of each other."
good,A great company to work for good pay and benefits.  401k clean warehouse and  team work is a must.  My job require to drive a Hilo or to handle a fork lift depend on the job that day if I was picking AI drove a Hilo to fill hospital orders   picked and packed them in a tote which would be a pallet on back of the high-low

good,Great company with great benefits and lots of internal opportunities for current employees. They offer a lot of flexibility and stability.
good,"This was a great company to work for, and if you are an individual who is technically inclined, there was always room for advancement."
good,"If your all about your money, then this is the place for you but if you have to attend a life outside of work like college,& work/life balancing then This is not the place for you. Due to 1st shift being on lockdown and only employees with seniority (5+ yrs) get to ""transfer"" to the 1st shift. Leaving 2nd & 3rd shift available only. When your new u work mandatory on holidays. On a work day is really hard to get there and get straight to work because there is not enough equipment(pallet jacks,order pickers). Finding a good machine is the hardest part of the job and the actual work is easy getting around the warehouse. New manager is trying to fix alot problems though."
good,"My job started at 2:30am and ended at 10:30am Monday through Friday. I came in and performed the constancies on the equipment and got my station ready to work. For the first 3 to 4 hours I drew the radionuclear injectables. Then help the drivers wrap and pack their boxes if needed. Next I would spend the next 45 minutes I would draw the second set injectables for the 2nd run. I then would close the doses, wipe,  and have ready for packing for delivery. Then do the lab sterilization procedures. "
good,"I worked for 20 years. I love my job but the department was moved to another State. Our jobs were eliminated. This Company invests for the best system out there. Once the defects and flaws are resolved, they have the best system to do our job. They have the best and hard workers with a common goal to service the customer."
good,"When I was there it was great. Due to off-shoring, however, there is little security anymore. Great people to work with, good pay, good benefits. Overall a good company to work for."
good,"Friendly environment"
good,Its a very easy job. The benefits in this job is great.  You get your own car.  As long as you do what you do the boss wont bother you.  You get freedom and trust in this job.
good,"check the headcounts, make sure all employees are in their designated locations, keeping the workflow thru all entire day, dealing with receiving employees to make sure we have the components that we need for the orders. dealing with production issues. multitask thru the entire day.Everything I know I learn it so I could grow with the company.  My supervisor and manager were excellent cooworkers, and the group of people that worked together for 20 years we were like family it was a good team work.  When they let it us know that the company was closing down.  working those extra hours of overtime for months and look at your check and knowing that your bill were going to be paid."
good,"My day at work consist of confirming all orders that come in the warehouse to ensure all product being sent out is correct and safe. I learned how to keep my workplace clean, build orders, and verify quantities and components being shipped. My co-workers all worked at a steady and fast paste completing the numbered amount of orders that needed to be sent out. The hardest part of the job was making sure nothing was missing in the orders that were being sent out. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing the kits that were sent out helped save a lot of people in all hospitals in the U.S."
good,"General Maintenance of building, Machinery, an Equipment. Use of Hand tools, Power Tools, Blueprints Schematics is required"
good,"•Initiated and implemented $40MM in new sales to a major national grocery chain"
good,"Cardinal Health compensates its employees very well. They have wonderful customers to work with on a daily basis. Team work is essential to manage the daily work load. Benefits were wonderful. Not sure what the new package looked like for 2015. Overall, a great company to work for."
good,"Big, but not too bureaucratized. I was only there a little over a year before they sold off our division to Advogent."
good,complete 8 to 9 orders shipping 300 or more item within order. Key in daily production.
good,Not a bad company but they go throught too many restructures that displaces a lot of people.
good,"Any day would be summarized as break/fix for this position. While the staff were wonderful to support the IT team had terrible management that lead to infighting and negative competition among the technicians. As a result the experience with co-workers would be described as poor. It was difficult to keep individuals for more than a year due to this issue."
good,"Working for an industry leader has its ups and downs. The environment in the office is a no walls community, with great co-workers and a job structure that leads to great relationship building skills and sales experience."
good,"The most enjoyable thing is employees."
good,"A typically day consist of checking product labels, and making sure products are in there correct place for pickers. I learned how important inventory control is for a corporation to function properly. We are in close quarters with our team leads and supervisors. But we are left unsupervised on semi-regular basis. My co-workers are mostly team players. Many of them go out the way to help each other. The hardest part of my job is having to is dealing with a lot different personally. It can be difficult at times. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a task through til the end. It's a rewarding feeling."
good,Overall a great company!!!! Very long demanding hours. Excellent Benefits and vacation package! co-workers are nice. Management is very personable. Hardest part of the job is the ever changing am shift hours.
good,great people to work with. good company to work for .good management
good,Spent the day on the phone and computer talking with Customer Representatives that needed new contracts connected to medical facilities for the products used for patient care.  Contacted the distributors of the products which medical facilities may have had elligible contract for best pricing available and had contracts team load any elligible contract to customer.  Co-workers were for the most part enjoyable to work with and as a general worked together to achieve customers expectations. Hardest part of the job was the expectations the company placed on quantity of completed emails opposed to feeling that quality was more valuable.  Management spent much of their day monitoring the flow of completed emails but didn't seem to place much value on the quality of the completed emails.
good,Cardinal Health like any other place was full of changes always for the better of the employee as well to enhance the customer experience.  This company relied on the employee or subject matter expert to help make it a better place to work.
good,Even I was layoff due to the loss of a major client. a great place to work and will recommend
good,"Cardinal Health is a wonderful company and although I was recently laid off due to budget cuts, I truly enjoyed my 2 years of employment with them. I enjoyed my co-workers very much and am grateful for all I learned about the healthcare industry. The most enjoyable part of my job was working in the healthcare field with a great team of people. The hardest part of my job was knowing about the lay offs, which lead to an unstable sense of job security. Overall it was a great place to work."
good,"hours can be long and taxing"
good,assemble medical kits
good,"Daily compounding and dispensing nuclear medicine unit dose, supervise technicians and drivers."
good,CE presentations for Molecular Imaging Technologist as well assisting the sales team in closing and supporting existing customers.
good,"Cardinal Health Nuclear Pharmacy was a great place to work with many hard-working and dedicated technician/support staff. No experience necessary; Cardinal Health provides training to obtain Authorized User Status from the NRC. Hours of operation were from 12:30am to 6:00pm, so overnight shifts are required. A rapid pace is required on the early morning production run, and adequate assistance is usually available. It was a very fun place to work; employees were generally very easy-going, but they were dedicated to their individual task assignments."
good,good job management is very biased towards their own kind and extreme favortism is shown towards many of the wokers there.
good,Cardinal health is a good work environment most of the people are good workers and friendly pay is not that good they start u of at 10.25 and it only goes up from 1 to 2 percent every year. management is not that great the van nuys lab has the worst rating and more complains more then any other lab about management by employees but over all it was a good place to work for excellent benefits and 401k plan...
good,"everything is very good, except for the early hours that you must start"
good,Cardinal Health is a workplace full of productivity and many opportunities for advancement and promotion.
good,A made alot friend working there. I had fun working there. I would tell my friends who don't have jobs to go apply there.
good,Great people who are caring and helpful to there coworkers.  Innovation is a major driver with the employer and has a large support base from leadership.
good,A good company that because of their size forces a lot of the HR duties on you. You have to pay for your own parking that can be a long way from where you work.
good,"This company will usually hire in terms of warehousing. The only trouble with that is that it's a big place and they will keep you overtime than the normal eight hours. However, if you work for them other than being warehouse clerks, it might just be a bit more easier for you than most."
good,I really enjoy working in such a diverse culture.It is great meeting people from all over the world and learning new things constantly. It really makes work more interesting!
good,"Cardinal Health is an overall good place to work. Good benefits, flexible to work with your schedule, helps you to get where you want to go. Not necessarily compensated appropriately or proportionally to your job duties"
good,"Great place, had so much fun and experience. Everyday we had to go to daily group activity where we sat, and tell what we did and what we are planing to do. Learned a lot how is it inportant to work together as a team to compleate a work."
good,I have worked at Cardinal Health for many years.  I really like working at this company and believe in their mission.  It is currently going through some industry challenges like many other companies in medical/pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution which is impacting employees in both IT and the business.
good,"Great people to work with at Cardinal.  The company is very large and has grown rapidly in the past 50 years.  Because of its size, however, it has become quite inefficient.  Hard and rewarding work."
good,"very intense and competitive work environment. high production expectations, co workers not very friendly. you basically have a sink or swim mentality"
good,"its a really nice place to work, people are nice and help full, the hardest part of the job is the working hours, too many hours for those that only like to work 8 hrs a day"
good,The managment is ok but amazing other tenders and cell techs. Not my first choice of a company to work for although. There's a lot favoritism within the company.
good,"Cardinal Health is a great company that is huge on promoting from within. I worked in every dept and was promoted soley on proven abilities. The management was fantastic as were the rest of the crew. Highly recommend it, but be aware it's manual labor in a warehouse that is not temperature controlled. Easy work though."
good,I can effectively use my background and skills in a relaxed work environment. I've learned and expanded my knowledge greatly in the years I've been here.
good,"At the heart if my job is taking care of my customer. From fielding questions through process improvements, and meeting contract compliance. Work with all areas i.e. inventory, AP, pricing, ordering, to insure smooth process flow."
good,I am having an opportunity to help with a hospital project with Cardinal Health and it has proven to be a great experience although the working hours are limited.
good,Cardinal Health is an excellent place to work and they really do what they can to take care of their own. I did my internship with them and I learned a lot that will benefit me in my career. Their culture promotes improvement with all of their employees and they pride themselves in the work they do.
good,"Fast paced daily routing, lots of computer work, handling multiple databases for inventory transfers and scheduling of deliveries; also employee compliance reading is required."
good,Good benefits and work life balance. Investing in training and development of employees but growth options was very slim in lot of areas.  Management needs to invest more on internal employee development and growth.
good,"I am a contractor employee, therefore I could not add more information about benefits or other details of what the company could offer to the employees"
good,"Routine days usually consisted of same day, same work task deadlines. I was trained well by colleagues and management in supply planning and EDI's. Management was hands-off. Work environment was easy going with work a from home option for most work staff."
good,I enjoyed working for Cardinal Health and my director.  I met great people and built long lasting relationships.  I enjoyed the culture and leadership.
good,Cardinal Health is a decent warehouse to work at. It could be better but a lot of people quit as there is a lot of walking. If everyone works together the job can be done. Management is alright but can be strict if we fall behind. Overall there can be a lot of improvements in the work we do.
good,"I worked for the company Pyxis which was acquired by Cardinal while I was working there. When they started to incorporate their own culture things changed and people left."
good,"I have enjoyed my time here. The culture is very relaxed and my work schedule is flexible, which is great for me because I tend to do superior work when I have more control."
good,"A place where peers are always available to assist and go the extra mile when needed. Flexibility from management when needed, and guidance when asked."
good,"very productive and somewhat fast paced. We worked together as a team always helping each other out. Management was always helping if we fell behind or employees called out sick. The culture was the best part, we were a small group so we were very team oriented."
good,I really do not feel like writing a review for my current employer at this time. I am just doing this because it appears Indeed requires it to be done.
good,"I can say a had a fair experience with Cardinal, it just depends what department or organization you are in.  I would recommend working there.  I think the pay was ok but the time off offered was more then fair."
good,"I had fun working in Cardinal Health International Philippines, especially all of the happy memories they gave us won’t be forgoten. I love all my collegues there that actually one of the reasons why i enjoyed workibg there. They provide a lot of activities for their employee and always think of something to help them."
good,Loved the people I worked with. Love the opportunities I was given. Learned a lot. Crummy work hours though because it was a graveyard shift so somehwhat hard to have a work life balance.
good,"Cardinal is a good company to work for but like many companies there are great areas and other areas that are just great for real-time  exposure to the healthcare industry."
good,Great place to work!  Plant team bonded well and was very committed to the goals at hand. Team completed significant process improvement and obtained complete buy-in from the associates.
good,Extreme level of teamwork required for successful release of multiple batches of injectable radio-pharmaceuticals on a 7day /18 hr per day basis. Stressful periodic FDA Site Reviews.
good,Nice place to work. Advancement/movement is very aggressive.  Large place and lots of people.  Can get lost at times if yo don't manage appropriately.
good,"Competitive, energetic culture. Becoming less baby boomer oriented and focused on millennials.  Opportunity for advancement exists, however it is usually necessary to ""know"" someone in other areas to promote."
good,The beginning of the job can be stressful but once everything is done it can be laid back but also there are some bad management there. I would just complete my shift and leave.
good,"Worked for Cardinal Health  for most of my career and would highly recommend.  Cardinal Health is both a pharmaceutical distribution and medical products company that provides essential solutions to patients and care providers throughout the care continuum.   "
good,I learned about acceptable/non-acceptable licenses for pharmacies. The hardest part of my job was not being in the same city as the rest of my department.
good,"Cardinal Health is a great place to work, my direct Supervisor is phenomenal! The opportunity for advancement is tough though, and the new organizational layout is not what I would like to work with. Benefits are great and the people are extraordinary."
good,"This was a great place to work for entry level customer service agents. They always offered over time work and advancement for employees. Managers were hard to keep as the job was very stressful. We had a new manager it seemed every 6 months or so. "
good,"Great place to work, with internal career advancement . Opportunity to help in the heathcare industry. Not much over time availiable.  Be ready to rack your brain biy rep the benefits of knowledge you will gain to further your career"
good,I enjoyed working for Cardinal Health. My co-workers were like family. My manager was great and always supported our team during the stressful times. Training was always a challenge!!
good,Shift starts at 2am for 8 hours.  Job consists of compounding radio pharmaceuticals and dispensing individual doses.  Became certified as an Authorized User for a nuclear pharmacy.  Excellent teamwork environment.  Medium to poor management.  Enjoy the shift.  Do not enjoy when we do not have enough radioactivity to supply all customers
good,Challenging but rewarding culture which allowed for career growth if desired.  My understanding is this could vary widely based on which team you were on.
good,"good job, great benefits but management needs work. the night supervisors and leads were pretty good and were much better than days. Its a good company if you keep your head sown and work though. it can easily be a lifetime and profitable job."
good,"I had previously worked for Cardinal for 5 years with no negative feedback. I was recruited by the Operations Manager. Was put on probation due to problems with meeting keying matrix requirements consistently. I keyed 95%-99% with an accuracy of 100%. During the probation, every stroke keyed was scrutinized and reviewed weekly for progress. With that kind of pressure, anyone would be bound to make errors."
good,Cardinal Health is a hospital equipment place. There job is to pull orders for the night drivers to deliver in the morning. So the Motivation is to get the orders pulled and out by the end of your shift. And there was a lot of orders that needed to be pulled and shipped
good,Good company to work for with room for advancement. I have learned a lot from my employment there. I would encourage folks to work there as they have a very inclusive Culture.
good,"A more stiff corporate environment. Margins for this industry are thin, so everything relies on perfect execution and maximized efficiency. I only worked in the technical support call center, so exposure to the rest of the company was limited. It's a behemoth, you'll be a tiny fish in a huge ocean. It's a rock solid business in a growth industry. You couldn't go wrong if you're looking to get your feet wet."
good,"The teams I have worked with have been exceptional at what they do, encouraging risk taking and innovation. There is a high level of flexibility among all levels."
good,"There nothing really bad can be said about this company. As a fortune 16 company, they are one of the big three pharma distribution organizations, with numerous ancillary business offerings to assist the Healthcare organizations navigate through the government compliance and pay for services model."
good,My 1st office job out of college and i moved up in my role within a few months. All employees seemed nice and to care about each other. Good work environment
good,The job is easy driving to hospitals around the Alabama area delivering radioactive medicine mangers are nice have to know how to use a smart phone driver a suv
good,"Good job if you do what you need to and mind your own business."
good,It is a fast paced company but it is overall fun atmosphere and good company to work for. The mangers are fair yet they expect a lot from you and give a lot in return.
good,Great Place to work although not a lot of room for advancement.I worked there for two years waiting for a spot to open in the Nuclear Pharmacy Department...never happened.
good,"I have enjoyed working for Cardinal Health; its been primarily a positive experience for me. Pay would be my biggest gripe but this place has pulled me out of a tight spot so I can't really complain."
good,"As a director in headquarters, a typical day is packed with meetings with employees of a variety of levels from the front line to senior executives. The ""work"" has to be done before 8 am and after 5 pm at this level."
good,Cardinal Health is a great company and a great place to work. In the Accounting department the month end process can lack organization at times and cause late hours.
good,"To load and unload inventory for staging in the warehouse. I learned the many different procedures used for the different trucking companies. Being a lead was a good role for me to be able to showcase my management skills. It was a cold hard labor job, not easy at all."
good,Overall decent workplace. Plenty of OT available depending on department. Lack of communication among departments sometimes leads to unwanted overtime and long work hours. Must be physically fit and have a strong mental focus to be successful at this job.
good,"Very robust programs with supportive management teams."
good,typical day at work I come in get on the forklift pick orders after load the line with picked orders . I've learned how to pick orders and read tickets as far as where the product is located. Management I didn't have a problem with they weren't over your shoulder they give you room to make mistakes and learn on job. hardest part of the job was working in a hot trailer stacking boxes and what I enjoyed about the job was my co-workers.
good,I have worked there for over two years and have to leave do to my daughter were starting school and couldn't find a suitable person to care for my children so i have given them one day short of two week notice.
good,"High pace, high demand job environment."
good,"Nice place to work , everyone works great together , management is down to earth they have many activities throughout the year very clean for being a warehouse."
good,If I didn't move to Florida would probably still be working at Cardinal Health.  Benefits were outstanding and company was close to home.  Supervisors were always there should you have a problem.
good,"My typical day including working at least 300 lines from various orders to correct in order for customers to receive product. Run reports for over 50 accounts. Work emails from hospitals in Hawaii and Guam. Help others on the team whenever needed and to make sure that when an employee was out of the office, that their reports got distributed to remaining team members to make sure all reports went out. Prior to this job structure, November 2014, I would answer customer phone calls, work emails and customer orders for accuracy and send out customer reports. I got along fairly well with all of my co workers."
good,"Cardinal Health is a great company to work for; however, once you are an employee promotions don't come with much financial reward as they are percentages based off your current salary. Therefore, be sure to negotiate a fair salary when joining the company."
good,"Fun place to work some supervisors are not supportive. I enjoy working and communicating with my co workers,enjoy speaking and gaining a relationship with customer. Overall Cardinal is a good company to work for always room for improvement."
good,"Great benefits,,pay, work life balance. Needs more job openings in local area and room for advancement. Stuck to a strict schedule and sometimes hard to get vacations days off."
good,"Working for the technical service department of the laboratory division  is very challenging and every day is unpredictable. At our department, we service over 350 laboratory equipment,  in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, at hospitals and community labs.  Those equipments need to be operating at the highest standards because based on the results they provide, patient treatment will be diagnose. Every day we need to think that a life depends on the results of our equipments.  "
good,It is a very fast past job and work dose not stop till the last order is picked and put on the truck. But they buy us food all the time and benefits and vacation on first day and start out at 12.00 an hour. Every year they do employee appreciation week and give away a gift every day you work and buy food just about every day for that week.
good,"Overall, Cardinal Health is a great place to work. They have great benefits and a great leadership team. I would recommend taking a job with Cardinal Health if you have an opportunity to do so."
good,great entry level position. have to be self motivated and wiling to ask many questions because the position will pigeon hole you if your not motivated for more.
good,"We log in, and have  list of incoming and outgoing shipments. print list, search boxes within the warehouse for proper codes, verify tags and enter in our system as per what we have at location. MUST confirm the status of box, whether damaged, torn or ripped. We then verify the destination of package and must be sure to include it on the proper truck going towards proper route. and update the status of shipment when it has been sent out. Over all it is a pretty fast paced working environment which makes it challenging therefore strong attention to detail is an absolute must or it will cause much confusion and we must reroute package which costs the company money. Also, a great team that's works together makes everything operate pretty smoothly. I've learned that communicating and working together brings a good team with great work ethics. the most enjoyable moment would have to be when challenges do come about (which happens often within multiple shipments of products) the team worked together to make sure the consignee receives their shipment as entailed. Amongst the laughter while we work, I feel that when you enjoy what you do, makes all the difference on top of being part of a great team."
good,"Cardinal Health will work hard to achieve a diverse working environment.  Networking is very important so it is important to take advantage of the different opportunities provided to meet new people."
good,"Cardinal has many cultures depending on which segment you work in. All of them however, tend to have very high expectations, but Cardinal has endless resources so if you can make a business case solutions can get implemented."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was making the residents happy by cooking good, nutritious food. Co-workers were easy to work with; as well as the CDM. Laid back environment."
good,I was privileged to work for a supportive manager that trusted me to do my job well and was not afraid to perform the tasks of her team when needed.
good,"Now this might be because I worked with my best friend but this was just a fun job. Working overnights with only 8 people on our shift, it was very personal so we made a lot of connections. We were able to open up, talk, and just overall enjoy ourselves as long as we were working the whole time."
good,"I worked several years in Cardinal Heath, good experience!, i learned a lot about medical supplies."
good,excellent company and co-workers whom listen to your ideas.
good,Interesting and complicated organization that gave me some great experience and opportunity for continuous growth.
good,"Cardinal Health is a very fast pace call center handling inbound calls for their customers medical supply needs."
good,"On a typical work day I make over 50 calls to hospital Accounting and Billing departments inquiring about payment on there past due invoice's.  I provide hundreds of invoice's and billing statements to customers Accounting/Billing department.  I work on SAP, I create invoice spread sheet statements and etc. I work hand and hand with management.  There really isn't a hard area of my position but at times it's stressful.  I really enjoy the fast pace and the opportunity to coach and train others."
good,it pays well but they dont seem to care much for the employees
good,"Cardinal is overall a very good place to work. The work-life balance is decent and pay and benefits are fair. Management, like anywhere, has its issues. Things change very quickly, which makes it hard to know whether or not you'll have a job at the end of the year. Cardinal does like to promote from within, but don't expect big raises unless you're an external hire."
good,It's a nice place to work but company is centralizing so job security is limited.
good,"Great company with good compensation and benefits.  Plenty of advancement opportunities.  Amazing coworkers who made coming to work a pleasure.  Most difficult part of job was meeting incredibly high expectations, often without support of executive leadership.  Intentions were usually good, just lacking vision and strategy for specific teams within the organization.  Would still highly recommend this company to others."
good,"large data-center environment consisting of 2000+ servers (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Tru 64 and SUSE) maintained by only 8 server engineers. Heavy workload and on-call schedule. High level management did not engage ""troops"" when making environmental decisions resulting in performance degradation in server environment."
good,"Great company with an awesome executive management team"
good,"Great place, great team! I enjoyed working at Cardinal Health. The benefits were good as well as the compensation."
good,"Decent people to work with."
good,"Opportunités de promotion et changement très limité."
good,"a company that supplies health products, very solid with good working environment and very clean, trains staff and provides opportunities"
good,Not bad ith the exception of the occurrence system they were all over with you with your time. Good people that worked there decent benefits
good,"I was an on call 24/7 field tech working in a home office setting. I repaired and did preventive maintainence of all equipment in my territory. I learned how to provide excellent customer service to my customers. There was always online courses you could take to further your knowledge and skills.The management team always mentored and assisted the employees with training and new opportunities. The employees all worked together to ensure the customer was happy and the work was completed. The hardest part of the job was the long hours we had to sometimes work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to travel to other territories to assist with either coverage for another tech or to help with a major project,     "
good,"Motivated to reach your goal but so much pressure because they always watch what you do."
good,a day at work for me is always trying to do the best job I can and help others any way that I can.I have learned that is I love helping people a lot and being part of a team helps u be more succesfull in your work.My co-workers were nice people helping me learn the things I didn't know wen I first started.
good,"my typical day at work consist of saftey inspections of the PIT equiptment and PIT batteries at the start of my day following any PM work or maintneance work to be done on the conveyor systems.I also change out bad lighting make other forms of repairs to the building followed by some cleaning,parts ordering as well as maintaining our many banders."
good,Cardinal Health was a career building place to work. Excellent training program and solid fundamentals on building skill set.
good,work was the same everyday depending how much supplies the hospitals or clinics needed would predict how long of a day it would be but overall the work wasn't hard. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment moving product with forklifts and loading then into a trailer. I got along with everyone in the building and made a lot of friends.
good,good balance - standard hours expected.  benefits were good.
good,"In the beginning fast pace, But then it slows down."
good,"I am grateful for what I have learned in data analysis and the experience I have gained with MS Access.  I have also learned far more Lean Six Sigma techniques working at Cardinal that can be applied in many different aspects both at work and in my home life."
good,A typical day was checking and verifying work orders. The most enjoyable working with my co-workers and training the newly hired so we would have a awesome team. The hardest part of the job trying to get the job order done within a timely matter.

good,I enjoy working for Cardinal Health.  Not a big fan of letting attrition driving workload.  When people would leave everyone was expected to pick up the slack and work harder even if we were all stretched thin.
good,"Interesting work and overall great work place culture. They did a good job of offering opportunities to learn new skills, and to give input about processes."
good,This is a climate controlled warehouse. The benefits are great and pay is decent. There are not many things that are heavy in warehouse. Employees definitely have a chance to advance. Cardinal facilities differ according to what umbrella they fall under. At the one I am at inventory team and Forklift operators receive the same pay as everyone else. I think that’s ridiculous. That’s the worst thing I can say about this job because the other problems are typical warehouse problems. Communication could be a lot better but overall it’s a good place for employees. If they stick around it’s a great place to retire from in the future.
good,"Even though cardinal is a large organization, they are very culture oriented. Ability to move around for new opportunities, groups and communities for employees from all parts of the business to get involved. Only left to relocate closer to family."
good,I worked part time for 5 years. There was never any down time meaning the days never dragged. It did require extensive physical labor that I felt was a positive aspect as it helped keep me in shape. The workers there were all nice and I really liked all of my bosses.

good,"Worked with a group of people all doing different target jobs. I had my own territory and contacted pharmacists throughout and created rapport with them. This in turn paved the way for relationships and even a healthy dose of sales on my part. THe compensation was great however management was being moved around and by the end of my tenure at Cardinal Health, things had changed so much that my job was worth about half as what it once was with more the work. Overall I very much enjoyed working at this company."
good,"receipt of inbound receipts "
good,"a typical day at work:fast paced"
good,"This was one of the most profitable divisions in the Cardinal organization for many years.  High market share, high profitability, low associate  turnover, etc.  Division was closed in a consolidation plan when a larger regional facility was opened in the Tacoma area."
good,"Cardinal Health has presented me with amazing growth opportunities, challenged me to be a better leader and presented me with the opportunity to learn new critical thinking skills and analytic skills."

good,"Fast pace, customer focus environment from beginning of the day to end of the day handling clients and customer needs. Also entailed an intensived amount of data request and entry. I learned how to multitask and make efficient use of available time. Most managentment listen to their workers concerns. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the high demand and fast pace environment. I enjoyed getting alone with my coworkers."
good,"Was a good company to work for. I loved running the print room during the day. The people were friendly and helpful. They gave you an annual review and raise on a point system that was very fair. I was there for 6 years.  I started as a temp, they bought my contract after just 3 weeks. I started making $9.00 hr when they bought my contract out they gave me $1.00 hr raise. After just 6 years there I was making $15.18 hr. If I hadn't had medical issues that forced me to leave, I think I would still be there."
good,I loved my job. Wish I could've stayed. Unfortunately there's no flexibility in work schedule. I don't think they consider work life balance when hiring people.
good,Cardinal health works diligently to improve quality of life and take care of patients. Cardinal offers many opportunities for advancement and professional development.
good,"Outstanding PTO and benefits.  Advancement opportunities are available and you have a better chance of promotion if you are willing to relocate.  Many opportunities in Columbus, Ohio."
good,I learned so much during my time at Cardinal Health and was blessed to be a part of the company for so many years. The role I held was challenging almost every day but that was great always learning something new.  The Company does like to give back to the community and encourages employees to volunteer which is something that is very dear to me and I was thankful to be able to volunteer without the fear of condemnation.

good,"Worked 7-330 M-F"
good,"Great Company to work for. They give you a lot of benefits and they really care about their workers, but management isn't always on your side or realistic. There was a lot of change and the work is easy but boring. Nights are really long depending on how the workload is for the day sometimes we were doing 12-13 hours shifts. The pay if great and there Is always room for growth."
good,"Each work day is not always the same, lots to learn if you are diverse. Good company to work for, and will reward you if you work hard, constant training."
good,"As a Senior Workforce Analyst, I am tasked to do daily and monthly reports of the operations to be communicated to the whole leadership team of the company. And part of my duty is to take in calls of the onshore partners whenever they will be on unplanned time/day off."
good,I managed the accounts for Cardinal for the Midwest region.  I was a fairly easy job with little challenge.  The people and office environment were great.  Small office with a family type of atmosphere
good,"A typical week started with Monday as an administrative day - planning, researching and creating agendas and proposals for customers during the week."
good,Progressive organization always looking to improve.  Tools and training were plentiful.  Teams were very collaborative and management supported diversity from every angle.
good,Cardinal Healthcare was a friendly fun and fast paced environment of many different cultures. The entire shift including the Manager and Supervisor worked with us as a solid team to fill time sensitive orders and ship them to their locations. A typical day of work started with the team picking freight to fill orders per location and staging them in an area to be properly packed and shipped to their locations. When 60% of the freight was picked the team then split up to finish picking freight and start to pack the freight. The hardest part of the job was packing the freight. (It was not hard at all but the least easiest to say) The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of doing an honest days work and being a part of a team with a goal to produce the medical supplies that many hospitals needed for their patients knowing that you made a difference.
good,Should pay more for all the hours and holidays you have to work. The job it self is ok the hours are hectic. You have to work holidays based on the customers demand. They have workers that barely do their work but gets back. Meaning its more on the next person.
good,Cardinal Health was a great company to work for. Becoming connected with the clients that you serve and knowing that the job you were doing could potentially save a life. Work environment was great. We were a family of workers and we all got along well.

good,"You will love to work here."
good,I have enjoyed working at Cardinal however the company is downsizing and there will no longer be a position for me.  Great people with  a goal to help the end user receive the products needed to help people live.  I enjoy knowing I have helped someone live another day.
good,Was a good place to work.  For me I like doing new things but I mostly got stuck working on old tech.  Though I presented a lot of new things it was tough to get them to do them....
good,"The job is ok as a starting job if you are looking to get into the medical field.  A typical day for me starts out by going to the receiving dock and getting the orders I placed the night before and putting them on their respective carts.  Then, I take each individual cart up to the correct floor and place the medical products in the nurse server drawers for the nurses.  At the end of the day, I make lists of products that the carts are low on for the next day."
good,"Great pay, great benefits, paid time off, holiday pay, flexible schedule. You cannot beat the perks that this job includes. They have been outsourcing the last couple of years but have not impacted many on shore jobs."
good,"A typical day started out with the sorting and entering of purchase orders.  This was followed by a review of the previous days orders.  This review also involved contacting customers regarding items they had or had not received on their orders.  i learned to multi-task and to thing on my feet.  My manager was very hands-off, but she was also very resistant to suggestions regarding the changing of the process. The work place culture was face paced and the emphasis was more on the individual manager's accomplishments then is was on keeping the customers (internal and external} happy. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up-to-date while performing the daily order audits. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with my fellow associates and knowing that what we did helped people in hospitals and pharmacies get the medications and items they needed to get and stay well."
good,"The work culture has completely changed with the new manager of our team.  It has completely changed the culture of our business unit. "

good,Es una empresa en crecimiento y brinda la oportinidad de trabajar libremente.
good,The job I had at Cardinal Health was a very good job working with a team.  I learned that if you do your job 100% there would be management jobs to move up.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers/hospitals that we talked to on a daily basis.  The hardest part of the job were making the reports at the end of the day for each hospital that ordered which in many cases could be up to 5-10 a day.  I would rate this job a 4 for all around rating.  Job security and advancement  would be a 5.

good,Cardinal Health had it's ups and downs. I loved my job when I first started. I took inbound phone calls from pharmacies and placed orders for medications. Absolutely loved speaking with my customers and enjoyed knowing that I made a difference. Management wasn't the greatest I felt as though they picked favorites and hated the fact that I felt as though one little mistake could end your job.
good,Great place to work at. Spent 4 years as a temp to get hired. Supervisors are generally great but issues do not get solved quickly.
good,"In my brief time at Cardinal Health I learned and grew a lot as a person and employee.  In the beginning I faced a lot of challenges because this was my first role as a Sales Representative.  The majority of the team was supportive and understanding while others demanded very high standards but did not provide the tools and training required.  "
good,"A typical day at work with Cardinal Health was being on conference calls with the field team, GPO's and customer's.  Always learning how to deal with different personalities and being able to accomodate them all.  Dealing with management I've learned to quickly adapt to an ever changing environment.

Knowing that my internal and external teams are satified and have everything that they need to provide excellent customer service."

We accomplished every challenge thrown at us regardless of being down 4 pickers nearly everyday. Management seemed to be our biggest stepping stone in getting our jobs done. Pay was decent to start but they did offer a great vacation package that you could use immediately.
good,A typical workday would consist of managing job functions of a 6 man crew. Provide support for customers and fill their requests.

It was a pleasure to watch the organization embrace Splunk and recognize it's potential immediately and would have enjoyed staying there to continue to drive adoption within the organization. There are some very talented solution architects, dbas, engineers and developers working here."
good,I enjoyed my time at Cardinal Health. I moved from the Virginia office to the New Jersey office.  This work experience and relationships offered me the opportunity to obtain a position with AHM.  The knowledge that I gained from Cardinal Health was crucial in my position and advancement at AHM
good,good perks for warehouse job.  Outdated system makes it more difficult than necessary.  Mostly repetitive light lifting.  Clean facility.  Good supervisors.
good,"Typical day stared with maintenance on forklift, breakdown of material  for production. Learned the production of the routine work. Management have giving me the opportunity to work with numerous employees to meet the quota of the day."
good,"In addition to the 10+ years of logistics experience, I've also gained different kind of aspects in the healthcare industry. The management is average, co-workers were friendly and helpful. Employees have the chance to get cross-trained in different areas which is really good."
good,The team is very solid and team members are willing to help intern to learn new work. I strongly recommend working at here if you would like to know about medical device packaging engineer's job.
good,Corporate culture is inclusive and the work life balance is very flexible. Company encourages employees to move around and acquire a diverse set of skills within the organization.
good,"Working at Cardinal will hip you to the corporate culture. You'll experience everything you should experience working for a big corporation including lots of change, good and bad managers, visionary leadership, and the good old boys club."

good,"As it has been several years since I worked for Cardinal Health, I cannot provide a review of this company that would be relevant to anyone currently looking to work for them."
good,"Very good management. Relaxed workplace culture. Nice coworkers. Good job for retired person, or close to retirement. Lower pay, but decent benefits and lots of paid time off. Hardest part of job is the early start times for full timers."

good,Ran my own department with little pressure.  I am a self starter and can plan my day as well as the activities for my staff.  There was no interference on the changes that I incorporated.  Cardinal was pleased as was I with the resultant work environment and outcomes.
good,"The job itself is very self sufficient, you are your own boss. You travel throughout the city delivering Nuclear Medicine to various hospital's. Most of the stops are Time Managed the deliveries are set day to day by time brackets. Once done with delivery that's it, you head back to Lab for next delivery."
good,Good workplace great training classes and room to grow. However they work off contracts so the job is based on renewal of contracts. Work life balance was ok.
good,"When I first came to PMOD it was a google sort of culture. Fun events during work propelled me to work even harder because it recharged me. The people used to be so amazing we would laugh until our sides hurt once a day. Management used to teach you the basics then give you room to fly allowing room for tons of process improvement and awarded people no matter what level. They used to promote within also, motivating everyone to work hard. The politics of the building used to be non existent also until the new PMO management arrived. PMOD was my favorite job ever and I would have stayed there forever had management not changed and the project didn't cut everyone"
good,This Is A Really Great Career Opportunity! I Started Out As A Pharmaceutical Delivery Driver. After Only 12 Months I Was Eligible For Advancement To Pharmacy Technician. The Company Paid For My Travel And Education To Become A Licensed Nuclear Pharmacy Technician!!!
good,"People are good just to stressful, Seems be unorganized and big lack of communication. People there are good to work with. Grunted 40 hours week plus over time but never notified until last minute."
good,"Great place to start if you plan on a steady pay check. I worked at Cardinal health for more than 5 years. I got great experience and skills needed to pursue more goals and while i was there i maintained a professional attitude. I needed a better career, wanted to provide more for my family."
good,"Pull orders at customers  request.  Great p[lace to work for. The hardest part of the job is the shift.The shift can be twelve hours or more. Management were always willing to help you  in any way that they could, and would step in and work along with you just to help out the team. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers because I got to meet a lot of people of different  cultures  and backgrounds."
good,Cardinal Health is an excellent place to work. Benefits are good and pay is comparable to technicians that work for a hospital. PTO is a huge benefit for working at Cardinal Health.
good,"A majority of my professional career was spent with Cardinal Health.  Due to my role they allowed me to be flexible with my work environment, both in the office and at home.  The work environment was fast paced and occasionally stressful."
good,Great place to work. Laid-back environment. Good work/life balance. Management is personable and understanding. Would recommend to anyone. Calls can range from constant to few and far in between.
good,"Very good company, stable, fun and good working environment. They are accommodating from staff to higher management. Everyone is treated fairly. Good compensation and benefits."
good,"a nice place to work friendly people. the pay is great, clean place to work. management is friendly. the hardest part of the job was wearing all the ppe"
good,"Cardinal Health was a great place to work. Being there taught me discipline, gave me better work ethics.  Knowing the decisions I made effected someone's life, as far as knowing what the customer needed and providing that service in order to improve their quality of life.  This was very rewarding. Then after all the hard work of getting our orders out on time, we would all come together and  have a pot-luck dinner in the break room (fellowshipping). Our main focus was to always put the customers first."
good,working with Cardinal Health was okay. the work was not easy and you always was watching the time hoping it was time to go but the people I worked with for very helpful. it was sad when my build relocate to another state
good,a typical day is 8 hours. it's nothing hard about the job. The company has a lot of days they reward you for what the company have achieved. my job consist of a lot of walking(picker). One thing I don't like about the job management make rules and don't stick to them. The benefits are great but the pay isn't. I wished they would pay more.
good,"I was part of customer services and I have to say that from my personal experience, like in many cases, the love and hate you have for the job comes with the manager. My manager was GREAT. He was understanding, but always stayed on top of things. I would follow him to fire."
good,"The place is fun and they often provide food for the employees. The pace can be stressful if you are not used to the environment, but people adjust and learn to work at the pace."
good,"You would be at the assembly line then be packing, then wrapping pallets. You never had a title of what you where. Moving up was hard because it required more schooling and money."
good,"Great salary and benefits. Lots of ""red tape"" making it very difficult to get the simplest things done. Lots of people that refused to share knowledge due to ""job security"" issues. Some ""back stabbing"" and theft of intellectual property of others."
good,"it was a very good environment to be in and it was very close to my home,where by i only had to drive for only 15 minutes to get there and plus the machines we used were taken good care of"
good,"Cardinal Health is a great company to work for. If you are going to work in their Service Center beware they like to move their support offshores. Also, the Service Center is the lowest paying area within Cardinal Health. They use to provide top level support to customers and clients but that has since declined. They, like many big corporations, choose to save money over quality. Years ago all tech support was domestic mainly, now you will more than likely be working with the Philippines."
good,"The company has changed over the last 10 years.  It was extremely fast pace and intense and it seems to become less so.  Management quality is variable from department to department, some really good and some that doesn't understand the business or industry.  Overall, I loved working there but became increasing frustrated with the ability to affect the bottom line directly."
good,"Good company. Great workplace to work. Great coworkers, multi culture environment. Little slow on management. Hard part of the job was overnight schedule."
good,"This job was enjoyable for me because it was so fast paced. We worked as a team through quality and production. I loved working from 6pm to 6am, my nights went by so fast. The hardest part of the job was taking on too much over time and not giving myself a break before I worked myself sick. Great job, loved all of the jobs which I moved up in. I loved that it was at times a physical job and I felt it helped keep me in shape."
good,I had a lot of fun and was pleased with the overall experience. The team really showed me the importance of team work. If they had not showed me this the project will not be completed
good,"I worked at cardinal for a year and a half, management is good people are all friendly and work can become something of a competition if you enjoy a competative work environment."
good,Very supportive supervisor who fights for you but it was a temp job that I wished was permanent. Internal and external partners made the job intriguing.
good,I have not worked at Cardinal in 8 years so I am sure there have been numerous changes. They had great paid time off and benefits. Sexism was still prevalent when I was there. Female upper management are expected to work through any maternity leave. It depends on your boss.
good,"Job was interesting and rarely boring.  Employees were close knit.  When company decided to upgrade our system, we were able to work the kinks out of it, and then they decided to close our campus and move our jobs overseas or out of state."
good,"Cardinal has a professional atmosphere. The Internal Help Desk is amazing to help employee's with any issue. Cardinal is a Global Company company. There are plenty of chances for advancement."

good,"team work people very helpfull it was owner operator no hours its rout your day end when you finish route and wright your report"
good,"When I left Cardinal Health we were a Fortune 25 company. Our facility in Denver had an annual revenue of $500 million. Cardinal was a great company that vested in their employees with exceptional benefits, training, communication and vision. The only reason I left was to help a good friend of mine's father with his company."
good,"Pros"
good,Working at cardinal health was good. I left because I needed more money since I had a baby. They have a good work environment. You get great benefits and good people to work with.
good,"Cardinal Health is a challenging and reward place to work.  They encourage personal and professional growth, as well as constant process improvements.  The environment is very inclusive and strong relationships are developed.  The campus is beautiful with many amenities, such as a gym, wellness center, pharmacy, bank, and two cafeterias."
good,Cardinal health was overall a good place to work. This job was fast paced but the work load wasnt very hard. Most of the employees and management were very nice and friendly.
good,"Although training was not the best, you had team leads that were great. The benefits were on the expensive side, but you had vacation and sick days from day one. The days alwayswent quick and if your lucky you will meet a lot of great people."
good,It was a very busy work place. I learned how to make Iodine surgery scrub packs and also bottled Iodine. Management is very hands on with production making sure no rework on product is needed. There are all different cultures working together. You never want to fall behind in production. They give nice Christmas parties.
good,"I enjoyed my job, it was very fast paced and always a different way of resolving customer issues. I learned how to believe in myself and my team. Everyday was an adventure."
good,"I have been with Cardinal health for 27 years and feel it is time for a change in my life. I would continue with cardinal but need a change to get out there and meet new people and  experience new things."

good,I was part of the Operational Excellence Department at Cardinal Health. Had the opportunity to become certified as a Lean Six Sigma Black Belt. Led multiple Performance Improvement Projects. Overall a very valuable and rewarding experience.
good,Teams work together with a strong customer focus.  The pharma division is very finance driven while the medical division is a bit more entrepreneurial.
good,As a Mom of 3 children my work life balance at Cardinal is AMAZING! I can schedule my days how I need to and how I want.  It is great to work for a company that believes in work/life balance.
good,The work/life balance here at Cardinal Health is terrific.  You have the flexibility to work whenever you like as long you discuss this with your manager before implementing it.  They trust you to do the right thing when it come to time management.  Career advancement is very slow here.  There are too many competitions coming here from outside the company...usually they will go with someone who has a lower salary asking.  They have too many mid level positions that I am currently in...not enough of manager level positions.  I've been here for over 5 years and still have not reach my salary expectation when I set my goal before I started my first job here.  The employees that are doing VERY well here are sales reps and corporate manager level roles.
good,always be on time make sure you accurate at whatever you do and always be nice to your coworkers and always try to be better at what you do and make sure your work zone is safe
good,The company to work for. The job goals and atmosphere help tremendously with my moral. In the hospital atmosphere their is a little bit of an edge concerning job security because we are contractual.
good,"An ideal workplace for people who love to work overtime and for people who always look for something new to learn . Here I learned alot, driving order picker ,picking many different medical supplies ,getting along with different people with different cultures and races . Here i learn to be more flexible and cope up with different matters."
good,"Cardinal Health was a fun place to work at, while at times it did get hectic,it all worked out and the deliveries were delivered on time....in most cases the packages were delivered faster than what the customer was expected and that did made the customer very happy."
good,"A typical day at work, I would answer calls and help customer with any needs they might have.  I've learned a lot about working in a call center, you get to know a lot of people."

good,"I can honestly say I like working for Cardinal. I have great coworkers, the company listens to its employees, and my customers are usually easy to work with. "
good,I enjoyed working here I love to pick I had a great manager when I first started and unfortunately she had to leave. The hours were what I most liked because I only worked 8 hours and some weekends

good,Very demanding but also rewarding. Excellent place to work and grow. The Industry is always changing and Cardinal is leading the way.
good,This McDonough location was very family oriented and worked with the associates on personal matters. Training and willing to learn different areas was great. Management focused more on the employees.
good,"Currently long hours and slow process to move into different areas of the company. Training could be much better, the Buford location could use better management."

good,"I enjoyed working at Cardinal health. For the most part, my manager and coworkers were easy to get a log with. Everyone did their job well and would step in when needed. The hardest part of my job was the hours. My shift started at 3:00 am and ended at 11:30 am. This made it challenging to balance family with work some times but, for the most part I made it work. "
good,"This is a great great work place to be at, especially if you're attending college because they have flexible hours and days, depending what you seek for. As for moving forward within this company, you MUST attend school to be considered a team lead, supervisor etc. If you plan on not going to school, there is no position of moving up regardless how major of a asset you are for the department in which you work in, overall. It is a great place to work, benefits and all."
good,"my day would consist of receiving, palletizing, counting products, binning material, and operated power lifting equipment. coming in didn't know much about any of this, but with the training I received it was a breeze and easy job. Everyone was nice and had a can do work attitude."
good,Job security and benefits are good at this job. Hard part of this job are the hours you work not very good hours to have when you have a family at home.

good,Cardinal was an excellent company and I would have stayed there if I hadn't got a divorce from my wife at the time and she worked there as well. I really have nothing bad to say the management and set up and direction were the key parts that made it easy and enjoyable to work at Cardinal.
good,"Cardinal Health was a great place to work. I learned so much from good hard working people, that's what I miss the most is the people! Cooperate management needs to have a better direction in their vision. The president needs to be held more accountable on the sales side. Year after year the sales side would not meet plan and no one was held accountable."
good,"Challenging work with many career opportunities.  Excellent benefits, strong leadership.  Allows empowered employees to make decisions that effect their work."

good,"It was a good company to work to, my co-workers were allways working as a team my 16 years with this company were the most happy time that enjoy doing my job."
good,"Nice place to work.  Once you get your foot in the door, easy to move around to other departments.  The pay is ok for what you are doing, but there is the perk of being able to work from home and great opportunities with other departments once you've been in your role for over a year."

good,"Cardinal Health purchased Syncor International in 2002, so most of my work was with Syncor.  The culture was amazing...fast-moving, customer centric, leading-edge. The Founder was absolutely absorbed with making the company the best it could be."
good,"Over 5 years I've been laid off and rehired twice. The company performs very well for its shareholders, which isn't always good for the employees. If your biz unit slows down, they shut it and move on to the next new thing. One of the offices has perks like coffee shop, drugstore and doctor, but others are horribly boring and outdated..very hard to attract young energetic talent. You also have to get paid on your way in or when you move around, annual increases are hardly anything. Other benefits like PTO are very good. You'll also notice certain people get fast tracked based on who they know even when they don't perform well. Happens all the time."
good,"work monday thru friday, i have learned to drive a forklift,orderpicker, swing truck, to make a label, friendly to all co workers, the hardest part of my job, sometimes i got behind, enjoy to be at work all the time.."
good,"Minimum chance to grow."
good,I worked here for 10 years. I enjoyed my co-workers and my job. /the only reason I quit was because I could not get off of the midnigth shift.

good,Very organized workplace. I enjoyed this position.......
good,really nice experience to work for a great company like cardinal health
good,Typical work day for me begins at 11:30 at night during week and at 7:30 on sunday night. We come in are handed our assignments and immediately begin our work assignment. My team leader and direct supervisor is amazing he always helps every team to be successful at completing our goals. Most enjoyable part of our job is that no matter how difficult our nights seem our supervise keeps us uplifted.
good,"-each night you wouldn't know what you would be doing because new jobs were presented each time"
good,"The Cardinal Health facility in Houston, TX supports the largest medcial center in the world. It lends to an extremely high paced day with operations running 365 days a year. "
good,"family owned , people oriented , great place to work for.. let me make my own decisions"
good,"A normal day working at Cardinal evolves handling a huge volume of product to receive into the warehouse and later during the day sending out an equal amount of product to our customers. I've learned to never turn down free training; it makes you a better asset to the company. My management is wonderful always approachable and available to help with any situation. My co-workers are awesome, very detail in helping to find solutions to any problem. The hardest part of the job would be to volunteer to do and presentation in front of a large group. I love working at Cardinal because of the closeness in relationship I've built with everyone there."
good,I inspected pharmaceutical products and packed them. Quickly became a machine operator. I enjoyed the pace and doing the paperwork that had to be done meticulously.
good,"* management strikes to add value to the company and improve employee engagement"
good,"The only thing constant in this business in change. Makes for challenges, but also opportunity to be proactive, creative and cooperative. My department receives hundreds, sometimes thousands of contracts per day that we must interpret, analyze and input. Often times, one spreadsheet is filled with massive amounts of data; this has helped me learn how to incorporate Excel to help me sort, filter and build tables and spreadsheets that help accurately view the relatable information. We use many tools to find the data we need so it can be challenging working off of dual monitors with anywhere from 15-25 windows open at a time. I do love a challenge and thrive off projects and deadlines so even though it can be difficult, it is also very rewarding. All my coworkers share the value of teamwork and tenacity so that helps!"
good,"During my time at Cardinal Health I enjoyed the diverse background of all employees. Most of all I enjoyed the work ethics of fellow colleagues and upper management. Pushing day to day to make sure patients were taken care of was a superior goal.  The team work illustrated was phenomenal and served to be daily motivation. Although there were walls and barriers in getting some thing done, you are never far from getting the right tools to break through that very situation. Training was superb and very informal having the basics you need to fill your job description was the over all goal. The highlight for me I would have to say is the common goal of putting the patients first and the support and acceptance of being a new employee. At Cardinal you are never far away from home because that's the way they make you feel."
good,Enjoyable place to work.  Cardinal Health is now a distribution company and has changed since I last worked there.
good,Calling on Nuclear Medicine departments at Hospitals and outpatient cardiology and oncology clinics.  Business was done on contract basis with proprietary software tied into contracts.  My direct manager was very easy to work for and most of my co-workers were very supportive and reliable.  The hardest part of the job was winning contracts in the healthcare arena when your pricing was higher than your competitors.  The most enjoyable part of the job was calling on my customers and providing solutions to their needs which allowed them to focus on their patients and offer better care.
good,Very productive and filled with excitment. management is great. we build surgical kits for hospitals
good,"I enjoyed my time at Cardinal Health. There were no typical days at work, however. One day I could be working on a pricing quote for a potential client, the next I could be closing the books and working on budget. I learned quite a bit about logistics, sales, and how a well functioning business unit operates. The management and co-workers were excellent, highly talented people. I appreciated working with them. The hardest part of the job was having multiple deadlines on many projects, but I always completed my work on time. This was also the most enjoyable part of my job, as it gave me a challenge which required great work in a short period of time."
good,I worked for a temp agency. It was loud and crowed. We made the Lids that went on the things in the hospitals

good,Worked for Cardinal for 16 years. I have a history that spans about 35 years in Medical supply. Cardinal is a pretty good place to work.

good,Team work is a must. Working on your own was the best part of the job.
good,There was always a lot to be done but it was a fun place to work. Most of the managers were very caring and helpful but there were a few bad apples. Training was impeccable when the previous trainer was there but went downhill with the new training regime.
good,Typical day at work was to trouble shoot Pyxis machines around the hospital making sure every equipment is running smoothly. What I learned about this job is to work efficiently and fast because the Doctors and Nurses are relying on us for their med machines. It is a stressful job but its an fast pace adrenalin rush. The hardest part about this job is standing for long periods of hours. The most enjoyable about this job is traveling all over the United States.

good,"Cardinal Health is a best-in-class company that values employee contributions as much as it does driving top-line growth.

good,The hardest part of the job was working 12 hours shift. I learned to build printers.
good,"A typical day is very calm, a steady work flow,and stress free. I learned the value of getting along with co workers and working together as a team, it makes a very productive work environment. The management was excellent, I had no real problems with management, I got along very well with my co-workers. There was mo hard part about the job unless people had their own personal issues such as not comprehending well. I enjoyed the Christmas parties"
good,Good compensation with ability to grow
good,"Good hours, great managers and supervisors, big stupid leads. Salary is not good, company lunches once a month. The managers and supervisors need to be more often on the floor, they give to much power to the leads."
good,The job I did was somewhat easy. There are goals to meet daily which can be stressful at times. Very relaxed atmosphere. Never had a job with occurrences as low as this one. They won't really work with you if you not meeting your numbers either.
good,"The job was good. Working 12 hour shifts just wasn't for me. Got along with people i worked with, but the communication just wasn't there. I could work the whole 12 hour shift and not a word spoken."

good,"I worked in a group that was somewhat isolated from mainstream Cardinal culture.  Job was technical in nature, very hands on.  Most of us worked independently.  You put in the time and effort required to get done what needed to be done.  "
good,"creative place open door.policies, advancement, non judgement, b fairness ,,self drive/great listening skills, very  high on training ,family place  looking to find the inner you"

Very nice people to work with.  Management was excellent.  Great benefits.  Promote from within.  The hardest part of the job was the initial learning curve to learn the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the great people, the company value of providing White Glove Service and the relaxed environment with time to get your job done in the allotted work hours and done well.  How wonderful and refreshing to work at a company that doesn't demand a fast-paced, stressful environment.  I highly recommend this company!"
good,"Cardinal health is a great place to work! the hours are flexible, I liked it better when it was uromed, now that Edgepark is taking over, not so much."

good,"Cardinal has been a very good life balance fit, for me and my family. My  work hours have always gone around all my kids activities."
good,Cardinal Health is a great company to work for if you are willing to work. This is not a company for the lazy. If you want to just get by then this is not the company for you. If you put in the work you will be recognized and rewarded. Otherwise you will go mostly unnoticed.

good,Great place to work. Great company to work for. Compensation based on performance. People are good to work with. Great values.
good,A typical day for me is ensuring that everyone is doing what they are supposed to do that is related to our processes.  I have learned quite a bit such as managing inventory among other things.  Management has been really good to me.  My co-workers are really good to work with because they help you with everything they can to ensure that you understand it. The hardest part of the job is the environment because it is really fast paced and high adrenaline.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you are providing the necessities for someone that is about to have surgery.
good,very quick hands on good management good people learned how to work fast and still be efficient never a slow time always working fast management takes care of its employees
good,"Formally Bindley Western Drug Co. which was bought out by Cardinal Health."
good,I LOVED working at Cardinal. The Pharmacist and Techs were great.I learned a lot from everyone there.I really don't think I'll ever find another place where the co-workers are really that close. The ONLY reason I left was that  the hours were too strenuous(1am-10am). If it wasn't for that I could've ended my career there.
good,"good management"
good,"The company is established and does well within the community and for the community. The people are great and has a ""family"" feeling."
good,cardinal was a good place to work when i was their i planing to retire from that job but sometime thing donot go as plan so i hate that i had to move on but it was a nice place to work we had a lot of fun doing i work leaving was not on me they just lay me off
good,The line leaders are lazy and stand around to watch you do the work! They do not offer help to you even if you are new! The HR department does a wonderful job of keeping up with their employees.
good,Cardinal provided very good training. It was a wonderful learning experience. Communication between departments was important and it allowed all departments to work together ultimately increased productivity and performance.

good,Cardinal is a great company to work for. With such a large company there is always room for growth and advancement.
good,At the beginning of my employment with Cardinal it was the best company I had ever worked for. Strong team atmosphere and overall outstanding service to the customers.

good,Its a nice place to work at and the co-workers are nice and friendly if you need help with something they show you how to do it right

good,safe enviroment. funn to work there  good management lots of work clean place good service
good,"The best part of my job was my co-workers and the ability to collaborate within the organization to create solutions."
good,The work day was demanding. I was faced with challenging tasks every day and completed them with out problems. 
good,"Pick, packing, and shippingis a typical day at Cardinal Health. Inventory control and meeting dispatch also plays a big part in my job. Ive learned to communicate with assocaites in a professional manner. Ive also learned how to earn the respect of co-workers working in my assigned departments within the establishment. The hardest part of my job is not having the available product for customer. Knowing someones life's is depending on the product motives me to always provide top quality and accuracy for the customer."
good,"Cardinal health is going through some tough times lately and have had to layoff hundreds of employees throughout the company.  As i respect the need to do so, the way it is communicated is poor. They rely on rookie consultants to tell them how to restructure the businesses.  I think there will be a lot of back pedaling within the year to gain back what we let go."
good,"•	Place orders for pharmacies before their cut of time"
good,"I had fun working there, there was always something new to learn just some nights there was to much drama to avoid"
good,"You can count on a full work week, good atmosphere, competitive pay, and benefits."
good,"Great job,picking an stock,checking dates an damage, shipping an packing parmeceutacals,greats supervisors,an coworkers were fun,hardest, when time lines ad to be met ,which made it very competive which I liked,enjoyable part was the job,an coworkers, working an supervisors, always makes it a great job."
good,"The typical day is provisioning our user’s accounts which might involve a call or e-mail to the user to verify and or clarify the case. The goal is to keep the cases within the service level agreement and to do as many as possible correctly the first time. The hardest part of the job is not knowing how to process a particular case, but with the help of co-workers the situation is under control."
good,Cardinal Health is a great place to work. The management is very helpful and helps you as a much as they can (at least mine did).
good,"Pay, PTO, and flexibility were very generous. Management was generally supportive and helpful, although messages from senior leadership were often contradictory. Job security is a concern, as corporate leadership generally cull the workforce every couple years."
good,"from start to finish its steady work. very good benefits and great work eviroment0. co workers are motivational and easy to work with. long lunch periods but the only take away its a job where you leave depending on production, it could be 10 or 14 hours"
good,"Working with many different people and have fun at work, all employees have voice , they can report any issues they have.  They have 4 week paid time off"
good,"I enjoyed a few different roles at cardinal health.  Advancement and annual raises. Appreciation from managers and other employees.  They trained you and helped you to advance in your role, whatever it was.  Compensation and company perks as well."
good,The teams I worked with at Cardinal Health were very collaborative and welcoming to new personnel. It is not compensated as well as some other entities but is a strong performer with leadership that is focused on a successful future.
good,"Great place to start your career out of school. You learn the ins and outs of big company culture quickly. Your direct manager is the key to your success or failure. Don’t stay too long in the same position, as you will be underpaid or pigeon holed into your niche. They pay below average for seasoned workers, mainly taking advantage of working parents that are so too busy to pay attention to market rates. Get a job here for a few years, then get into management or leave. Cardinal will look great on your resume."
good,loved working here although i was just part-time and a customer service representative it was still fun because of the relaxed environment and supportive management
good,I’ve worked for this company before in the past under a different job title but they were excellent to work for. Recently I got a job with them again as a pharmaceutical driver. The first few days was very boring with all the computer training modules. Once you get done with the computer training they allow you to ride with other drivers to learn where all the accounts are. Everyday that I come in I enjoy my job that much more than before. The freedom from being on the road is the best but make no mistake they count on you to get the orders done correctly and on time. If your familiar with delivery driving you will love this job. I actually look forward to coming in and working the next day. The hardest part of the job is adjusting to the early morning start times but to me getting off early out weighs that. The pay is decent but no the best I would recommend it if your looking for a decent job with an ok pay
good,There is a lot of room for advancement at Cardinal Health. As long as you are driven and like networking Cardinal is for you. If you would like maintaining status quo this may not be the company to work for.
good,my job was ok picking &packing all day on your feet it was exercise for me bad on your feet with steal toe shoe over all it was not to bad of a job ok
good,Cardinal may not have the best pay in the world but it makes up for it with its fantastic culture and organizational commitment to its employees and its community.
good,"Patients waiting to be seen at the office. More about drugs. Hospital in the heart of Newark, New Jersey. Not a 9 to 5. Self taught. Can be stressful."
good,I enjoyed my job with Cardinal Health very much. I worked as hard as I could and the best that I could. I was discharged for various reasons Wich I take full responsibility for. I work hard and will do what is necessary. There are quite a few rules here which is common with any job but the management team responsible for implementation of these rules are not hands on enough to understand what it is that we do there.
good,"Very quality oriented job, fast paced mostly made the day go fast. rewarded when doing a great job. rewarded all employees whenever possible. Insurance and benefits were great"
good,"Good place for work/life balance "
good,"I liked. to enjoy working in this company. "
good,Cardinal Health is a fast pace working job people have to be able to multi task and do different jobs every day. One thing i like about the job is the coworkers they are nice people to work with.
good,"I worked at Cardinal Health when they had a contract with a hospital system to manage the hospital pharmacies. Having previously worked at the hospital pharmacies in question, this was a good fit. I had a manager who gave me the needed leeway and support to do my job. The most difficult thing about this job was because Cardinal had a contract to manage the pharmacies, we were not given any additional resources beyond what was outlined in the contract. This is to be expected, but it made it more challenging as issues occurred."
good,Great place to wort with great benefits! There are days when we have to work until the jobs are complete which isn't a bad thing. that means more money. I learned how to work at a fast pace and how important it is that hospitals get their supplies.
good,"Answered phones and took orders, Filled prescriptions, compounded drugs, and performed quality control on compounded drugs. Occasionally I had to deliver doses to customers."
good,"Working at Cardinal, I learned its an awesome company to work for. "
good,Cardinal Health is a great place to work. The employees are hard working and makes every day easy to come into work. Great advancement opportunities for your career.
good,Great company to work. Fair salary. The managers and supervisors treat you with respect and make you feel they care for you. also the company offers good benefits.
good,"Research product orders communicate with hospitals and doctors officers. Give updates on orders process reports, place orders.  Very rewarding the best place i have ever worked"
good,"Nice friendly environment, strict rules, short breaks. Overall great company. Job is to be taken very seriously so it is a very strict place to work."
good,Job is not hard and easy to learn and master skills needed in order to do your job. No extra work or OT which is good and you leave everyday you are assigned to unless stuck in traffic coming back from your runs
good,Great Company with excellent benefits but the pay scale is low.  Typical Day:  Draw and calculate customer doses for nuclear medicine sites.  Health Physics for Cardinal Health and customers including audits for compiance.  Have learned a lot about health physics and instrument calibrations.  My co-workers are easy to get along with.  Hardest part of my job is making ends meet with the pay scale.  Most enjoyable is doing the health physics and learning new pharmacy techniques.
good,This place is hopping. So many different jobs to do and there was ample chances to do what you want. I remember only good hard work and the management's respect for everyone. There were difficult times and it was not easy to correctly do the different jobs I did at Cardinal but I did OK.
good,"Picking, packing, shipping, and receiving. Learned how to use a forklift. Management was good until it was changed. Co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job was keeping my numbers up. Most enjoyable was the challenge of keeping my numbers up."
good,"As a custodian, I worked a normal 8 hour shift, but with my new position as a warehouse associate, I work longer hours. Although I still enjoy what I do. Some co-workers are more sociable and easier to get along with than others. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that the customer is being serviced properly and that they are receiving exactly what they ordered. This positon as a warehouse associate requires us to be accurate with our picking. The hardest part of the job is when an item is unavailable and it is unable to get to the customer."
good,"checking my lift, logging in the Aims to start pulling orders, packing out my orders. I learned how stock, ship and receiving, become MHE training, and dropping orders. Management wasn't (shift supervisor) good with the employees at all. the hardest part of the job was management. I enjoyed the task I had to do and the co-workers."
good,"Cardinal Health, especially the corporate office in Dublin Ohio, is a great place to work. The corporate office has an onsite pharmacy and clinic/doctors office, gym, and several caffeterias. By having those facilities onsite the company has really helped their employees be able to balance their work and life better. Combine those onsite benefits with Healthy Living programs, 401(k), and good health insurance and I really wish I didn't have to leave the company. Unfortunately I had to leave Ohio and there just aren't as many job opporunities at the distribution centers throughout the country."
good,Only worked there briefly due to a temporary assignment through a staffing agency but enjoyed my time there.
good,"Good co-workers, good professionals, and human beens."
good,this place is where i started to want to get into pharmacy technician so i think this place. doing data entry for pharmacist and dealing with the DEA forms. i know i wanted to look into it
good,It was indeed a nice experience working in this kind of company. I have been enjoying a lot while working in Cardinal health. They’re one of my support system that helped me to become who I am today.
good,"Cardinal Health is a great job. It is a equal and friendly environment. No discrimination against none. My seven years of service there I learned a lot ; the ins and outs. I do say if you want a easy job with no burden over your shoulders Cardinal Health welcomes you.. Just do your job, wear your ppe, nd come to work as schedule you will feel and believe yourself coming up the chain."
good,Job is wonderful if you like driving and can be quick to make accurate decisions when hectic situations arise.  Usually the day starts off with delivering medicine to hospitals and then go back to the lab and wait for my medicine to be delivered.  Job is not hard at all!!
good,This company treated me right.  Helped me advance in my career.  I was supported by HR and management when needed.   We were like a family and treated eachother with respect
good,Clean work space with product in correct locations every time. No waiting for work. Pickers are given all that is needed to get there job done as needed.
good,Knowledge and advancement a plus. Good pay. Great people. Great company. Learned a lot in different departments. Overtime was often as wanted. Safety was number one with this company.
good,"Cardinal Is a wonderful place to work.  With so many opportunities at your fingertips, the possibilities are endless when it comes to writing your own career story.  The overall dynamic is collaborative and there is a lot of cross-functional work to expose employees to other groups, as well as maximize their potential in their current roles."
good,"Pay and benefits are good here and the leadership are very supportive so far. Amount of PTO is fantastic. They are flexible with work / life balance allowing for the demands of family.  I don't feel guilty leaving work to take care of my sick kids.  The software system they utilize needs to be replaced.  For a company of this size, the systems they use are way out of date, putting a strain on the employees and their ability to function efficiently in their positions.  The system is not user friendly at all and actually works against the AR rep.  The industry is very interdependent within different departments and trying to figure out an answer to a simple question can take a lot of research and time due to the lack of efficient tools and systems. There is room to improve on the training and the ergonomics as well.  Desk chairs desperately need replacing and they do not allow for stand up desks without a doctor's note.  The industry itself is challenging.  Overall, it is a good job with room for improvement within the company."
good,The company was great to work for as I enjoyed every minute of it. Management was very nice and easy going. My co workers were very nice as well.
good,"Huge project, as a junior consultant It was a great learning experience and the Hospital system was very supportive with providing the necessary information."
good,"nice benefits "
good,"Get your hand held computer go to the generated location pick the items it tells you put them on the cart and drop it off at the packing station where it will than be checked, packed and shipped. You rotate between co workers on picking and shipping. co workers were fun, also here you had to work as a team to get things done."
good,"Cardinal Health has some great opportunities for driven individuals but sometimes overlooks strong talent.  There are lots of options if you're willing to relocate, though.  "
good,The company is very focused on their employees. There are a lot of great benefits for parents as well.
good,I schedule gradually throughout the day while maintaining 10 person crew and also supervise those under me.While offloading every truck that arrives for appts.
good,I would arrive and first thing in the morning I would clean my machine. Next I would get the order and input the info in the computer. Afterwards our line would start running and I would start sealing. I would then help out the team captain with anything they needed.
good,Cardinal Health is a great place to work with many great people. I have learned a great deal about working with others in a confined environment. The management does a very good job at keeping the workers motivated and keeping the work flowing. The hardest part of the job for me is trying to keep my fellow employees motivated to continue working hard. The most enjoyable part is seeing my quotas met each and every night.
good,40 hours a week are guaranteed. I learned how to manage processes and how to apply six sigma management.
good,"When working at Cardinal Health, I learned more about customer Service. This job I liked because it taught me necessarry patients in dealing with the gemeral public. If it was not for the fact that I was in an auto accident, I still would be employed there. The pharmacy and complete administration are good people. I would recomend people to apply."
good,there were so many daily challenges on the production line. Daily set ups on the on major machinery. Nice staff. A lot of benefits. Great paid time off system.
good,A typical work day base on working as a team and communicating with each other to get the job done in a timely matter furthermore management is very good.
good,"Very diverse and nice place to work at, Very straight forward when it comes to work and simple, Lunches are flexible and you get alot of vacation time."
good,"The work load is different every so often (every few weeks, months) so you never work on the same tasks for too long. "
good,"Always busy and lots of different people to talk to. The residents and other staff were all helpfull and friendly. Theres always something to do, so your always on your toes."
good,like working on like line making boxes getting them ready to be shipped i think hardest part of the job to me is making sure that the boxes don't stop the line up my co-workers are what made the job enjoyable
good,"The last year and a half of my employement with Cardinal Health was spent 3 days working from home, 2 days traveling to my assigned hospitals for weekly meetings. Even though I was considered to be 'in the field', my manager kept the lines of communication open with weekly update calls. The hardest part of the job was ensuring adequate stock was kept on hand for the hospitals due to spikes/declines in census numbers. The best part of my job was being able to meet with the Material Management/Purchasing personnel face to face each week to discuss and physically see (when appropriate) their issues/concerns."
good,"A typical night was running around scanning products, putting and pushing a cart to make sure shipments went out. It was a nice environment and the hardest part was pushing the cart."
good,"Warehousing drug products from a variety of major pharma houses.  I worked with DEA issues, due to a consent decree.  I trained Sales and Associates, developed SOPs, validated systems. Maintain budgets closely.  Also work with FDA inspectors, US Marshalls, and Homeland Security providing clear understanding of Cardinal's methods and practices.  I enjoyed working with the many departments and agencies in resolving monitoring issues."
good,I really enjoyed working for Cardinal Health the working environment was serious but also fun to be around. The management staff was excellent and they were a good paying job.
good,very fast paced enviroment time deadlines no communication very rude people did not enjoy working there at all do not recommend this job  ver pushy and rude to there employee
good,i enjoyed working in a stress free enviorment and fixing computers.
good,"Setting up machine, doing paper work , keeping count and checking product every 30 minutes. The hardest part of the job is change over and paper work. What I have learned is to be aware of my surroundings and to keep my machine running. Make sure you and your team meet production"
good,"There was not much to do other than work. Very stressful. Management takes sides. I learned to do my best.Typical day at work would be completing submissions , taking lunch then going home."
good,"Work overnights doing seven on and seven off days. Works days started on thursday and ending thursday mornings.  Answer multi-telephone lines and entered  orders in the computer system. Received licensures in north carolina, south carolina and virginia."
good,I love the work and the people I work with but the management in the plant is very bad. They have no clue what they are doing and do not like feed back from the employees on the production floor.
good,Cardinal was very stressful and I understand we made kits for surgical procedures but the consequences for error were a little extreme. More training was needed.
good,Some plants are well manage and some horrible management. some plants respect employees and customers equally but some plants ignore employees feeling and only focus on customers service!! Some plants manage day off for Christmas Eve and the day after thanksgiving but some plants never care and respect employees feelings!!!
good,"starting early morning taking supplies from dispatcher delivery to hospitals, clinics in a timely manner. Breakdown of medical returns. The hardest part of the job was no training to new events that came into job function."
good,Cardinal Health Distribution center had a great team environment however the work hours did not promote a healthy work/life balance at the supervisor level and down.
good,"Traveling to different warehouses owned by Cardinal and implementing lean six sigma projects. "
good,Associates are great but a lot of favoritism among the Leads and Supervisors. Forget about wanting to grow or develop in this warehouse. You only climb up if you're related. Nepotism.
good,I got  He job through a temp agency. When I became my birthday in October they called me In there office and explained that I have been cut because they didn’t need me anymore.
good,"I belive that cardinal health was a very safe work place, but I was not a big fan of standing in one spot for 12 hours at a time. I belive they need to get more breaks or longer breaks even if there not payed."
good,Great place to work learned a lot gave you the feeling you were making a positive difference in the healthcare field.Interaction with patients and customers.
good,"I had a great experience while working for Cardinal Health. Learned many things such as hospital management, pharmacy department operations, and mechanical and tech support roles while working in the field."
good,The company moved to Aurora.  A day consist of answering the phone and communicating with vendors. Management was willing to help co-workers. Co-workers were very willing to help and the hardest part of the job was spreadsheets.

They had someone from the corporate office come in to tell us that our jobs were being outsourced overseas and that it was due to the fact that they could do our jobs better and cheaper that what we were doing."
good,I loved the job and the company management on the other hand sucks. You really have to be liked by management in order to move up. They say there's a open door policy but when you talk to someone they still all end up finding out and then indirectly say something to you. They extended my contract three times. I was there for almost a year then let me go when I was scheduled time off that day and I found out from someone else before management contacted me Management sent a text asking for my address. Then they didn't tell me what happened I was only told to contact my agency for my agency not to have the slightest clue what was going on.
good,"This place is a great place to work for people starting off in their career. There is upward movement, but it takes time before moving up in to a management position."

good,"nights at a warehouse, sorting pharmaceutical drugs. drove forklifts to unload trucks. other supervisor would disappear for awhile. learned that you need to work together and as a manager, if your people need help, then you should jump in and help them out. you will get more out of people if you work along with them."
good,Great place to work and has a personal gym for associates to get in shape. This place really is great to work in and has great recognition programs.
good,"At the location I worked at I loved working there and my supervisor was great. Its a good company to work for if you are on the right team.

good,"It has a great working enviroment, grea working oportunities and able to learn more every day."
good,"Busy work, my skill set is underutilized"
good,A typical day at work was stressful. The crew was divided and the management would play favorites. The company policies did not apply to everyone. Prior to the new management team the enviorment was great and fun. We all worked together and looked forward to going to work. The hardest part of the job was which manager or crew member was going to turn on you or what drama would start.
good,would go to work have team meeting about volume and whats in store fo the night proceed to or work stations i was a replenisher then we took are lunch then proceed to go to work at the end of the night we would report to are team leader and then go home
good,The most enjoyable part about the job honestly is the people. I say that because when you’re around a group of people 12 hours a day 5 days a week I see them more then I see my family we basically are family and I’ve gained a lot of good friendships along the way
good,"Cardinal Health has a lot of opportunities for learning, the management is very nice and cares to help us. The best part is people, we make a great team together."
good,I liked it wish I could have stayed as a permanent job with a few more years of experience and I will be able to get a job and keep the experience I learned

good,"Overall I love working here.  My current department offers great work life balance and flexibility. (Some do not.)"
good,"This company was very great to work for.  They do many community fundraising programs and have events for families during Halloween, Easter and Christmas.  The job itself is extremely physically demanding, moreso than I could handle.  Also, the worker needs to be tall, though several employees are short.  As a 5 foot tall person, I found extreme difficulty performing all of my tasks without straining or having items fall on me."

good,Good management. Perfect place for a startup. Everyone in the company is friendly and encouraging. Loved interacting with the people. I was a temp.

good,"working under the great tutelage of the management and senior coworkers, I quickly picked up all tasks relating to my shift"
good,The company has a gym to workout in and large enough to walk around to exercise a little.The management team is well informed and great to work with.
good,"No room for growth within the company. A typical work day consists of picking and packing medical supplies. The facility is small; therefore, the co-workers are like family."
good,"We worked 7 days on 7 days off 12hr 3rd shifts & covered hospitals that didn't have overnight pharmacy coverage. I learned a lot about  the importance of triage & communication. My management team was very support in all aspects of our job from tackling new ideas for a more stream lined process & betterment of employee moral. I still stay in touch with most of my former co-workers and was honored to work with all of them. The hardest part of the job was the long hours, lack of physical activity & 7 day work week, but the rewards of having a great work environment & having a full week off afterwards was easily worth every second."
good,"I provide services to different hospitals around the United States. I place together kits for different types of surgical procedures. My job is very critical because if something is misplaced or missing from the kit, it could cause major problems during a surgery. The management is okay but there is room for improvement. The job its self is very demanding. There are a lot of rules, regulations, and requirements an employee there has to abide by. The 3 R's keep the job safe for the employees as well as the customers that we supply."
good,"Very good company to work for with great benefits, limited wages and advancement."
good,"Coming in the morning, clock in then head to the lab. Inside the lab, I help empty the cases and put the syringes in to the disposable specific barrel that has radioactive sign attached to it. Also, there is a note show the date that barrel filled up and put a side so anyone can know when they can reuse it after emptying it. I learned to follow the specific procedure to make sure all the doses are not contaminated. My co-worker were kind and friendly. I got to see waking up at 2 am to go to work at 3 am one Sunday a month or during holidays is the hardest part. Everything about it was fun"
good,I really enjoyed my job at Cardinal Health. I was well trained and was compensated well. It was a sales position but the benefits were great!
good,They like to micro manage when I first got there b1ut after a while they changed management but they are not a bad company to work for and they have great benefits
good,This place is a great place to work the people and the supervisors are real great to work with and work for..the benefits are awesome..the environment is good..nobody hanging over your head.just a good place

good,Company is relaxed with a great moral atmosphere. Great work like environment. Supervisors are easy to work with.  Opportunities for advancement varies.
good,"To be honest nice company great pay and benefits too much drama in the plant!!!"
good,Cardinal health was a great job the only problem with that job was it was very long hours but pay and benefits we're great the supervisor is a great guy
good,I love going work here and the people are nice and always welling to help also you can learn everyday from your workers all the time they will help to make you better.
good,A great place to start a career. The workplace culture is ok and much can be accomplished with the right mentality. Management can and needs some improvement
good,Good people to work with but the schedule was crazy. Difficult to balance your work time and your family time . If you love this pace can be your best place because some week you can work more than 70 hours.
good,"Cardinal Health is a really great work atmosphere. Great Benefits. The only complaint I have is do not think because you have seniority that they will not skip over you for promotions because they will. And this statement is not biased. Although, I was loved by everyone there but if they like someone more than you, you will not get a promotion the other person will. For example, I was there for 5 years and a new hire was promoted over me for QC position from an Associate I to An Associate II with pay, they promoted me but not with the pay."
good,fast paced environment  everyone is pretty laid back as long as you're working. Management is laid back easy to talk to the job is demanding physically
good,"Great company to work for! Great benefits, awesome training. A lot of leadership roles. Room to grow within and outside of work. Management was up to par, would definitely recommend  this place."
good,"I had a bad experience working there not due to the company's issue, but my own personal issues. Company's atmosphere was safe, friendly and reasonable."
good,"Great company, however it lacks career advancement. The management can vary and is at times very tedious. However, the work environment is one that pushes me to do better."
good,"I love Cardinal Health as a whole and would recommend anyone to come work here. I just don’t care for the team I’m currently working under. The client is too picky and barely knows the actual work it takes to put into the job, and the management is very petty only because they tend to do things backwards. They have you tell your every move so it can be monitored but then secretly email certain people offering them overtime. I’m just waiting for other programs to open so I can move around and work under another program."
good,"I work between 8-10 hours a day more on the side of 8 though.  There is a lot of opportunity to move up and around to different departments.  The health benefits as well as the PTO benefits are pretty good. Generally speaking the culture is fun but also focused when necessary, every department is different though."
good,Open environment where all information is available to employees and there is a sharing and caring mentality . Really like the people and culture. The location is great and I am challenged.
good,Cardinal Health is a large company and very diverse. I thoroughly enjoyed my years of employment with them. I learned a great deal and traveled extensively.
good,"Un journée typique de travaille pour moi consistait à faire de la cueillette à mes débuts et avec le temps je touchais à beaucoup de choses comme la réception, la logistique et un peu d'inventaire."
good,"I worked at Cardinal for 12 years.  I enjoyed having the ""family atmosphere"" from the beginning.  There were different managers brought in and ruined the company.  We didn't make any money in my division and it could have been done differently.  Cardinals biggest space is in Hospitals.  This change of selling off the division could have been prevented if we had different leadership"
good,"It is a great company with great benefits and compensations, but job politics rules there.  Old managers use the same way they worked before and do not like the new change."
good,I would say this place is a good place to work cause you get enough breaks and this place is very clen with air condinated warehouse equipment is all new
good,Learned to drive a fork lift pulling and filling orders. Fantastic management and co-workers. Hardest part of this job was working nights.
good,"I loved this company.  I left because of lack of advancement.  Great product, compensation and benefits.  Would love to be back!"
good,They could improve with training process but overall a good company. They will work with you when it comes to you being flexible.
good,Very fun job with tons of benefits and paid time off. The only con was that there was no much training available with manager.
good,Worked in shipping department picking bottles and cases of pharmaceuticals for various shipping destinations. Very company oriented managers.Pretty decent coworkers.
good,A day at work was fun at times and hectic when you had to buckle down and take care of situations when problems arose in the warehouse.
good,"A typical day at work is 6:00am-2:30.  Answer all emails working the oldest email first.  Run all reports to prepare for conference calls which are usually at 11:00.  After the call is over I fix all, pricing discrepancies that were addressed during the call."
good,My day at work was really a memorable one. My management really made stuffs very easy for me and I appreciate it. My coworkers were all happy with their jobs and above all their working environment
good,"Helping our Veterans and Veterans Affairs Hospitals attain needed 	supplies"
good,I actually can say when I started it was a little challenging but after being promoted 6 months after I started I gained alot.. I been here 4 years and I love it.. The supervisors and people are great to me.. Taking calls and helping in all areas gave me more experience. Its really easy I will say.. New policies have came in and they are fair. I would love to stay here as long as I can.. The pay the benefits and Pto given in advance is great.. Cardinal is great in providing the best service to customers. I cant speak for any rep but I love my Job..
good,this is a good place to get all the experience that you need to get you the experience you need for the work place
good,fast passed work place lots of politics lots of favored people besides that loved working at cardinal health
good,"Cardinal Health has lofty EPPIC Core Values. It's sad that the NLR, AR management team fail at most of them."
good,I started out in picking and moved on to receiving. I filled out DEA blanks for products and got product ready to be shipped. We inventoried everyday in the area I worked. Everyone was friendly and helpful.
good,"Overall good company to be employed for, good benefits, however the opportunity for any advancement was little to none."
good,Cardinal Health is a great to learn and to get used to the supply chain environment. Lean Six Sigma culture has been implemented and with great people's acceptance.
good,The management that I supported were very focused on team unity and development which really helped create that cohesive atmosphere.
good,"Good working conditions, Excellent pay and benefits. Great culture and fair management team. Would recommend company to others. Would go back to work there if circumstances allowed."
good,"Better benefits than other companies, most likely if you're a newbie working in a call center industry this will be your  training ground for customer service."
good,"The people that you get to work with on a daily basis are what makes it a great place to work                                                       "
good,"It was a good experience , management was always helpful and created a family atmosphere.  , Advancement was encouraged and the benefis were excellent."
good,"Enjoyed the job, working with the residents an their families. I would work there again if offered an even place loved one there for care.The staff there are like family always pitching in where needed an never batting an eye."
good,"I worked at Cardinal Health in Depew, NY for over 10 years. The people I worked with on my shift were great and I have made some long term relationships. My only reason for leaving was to find a job on a traditional day shift. I did have to give up $$ and 15 paid days off per year to switch jobs. they have the best paid time off program available in Western New York new employees start with 19 days their 1st year plus 401k match."
good,Cardinal health is a love and hate relationship. they pay good and its unlimited overtime but your hours at work are extremely long due to the contracts they have with different hospitals.
good,1oclock start till who knew when you were FINISHED!!!!. Mon -Fri Some Sat if you like. A few Holidays. Fast pace work on ORDER Pickers and Reach Trucks ...  Lot of O.T.
good,"Would have kept this forever, but hospital decide they did not want an outside contractor anymore-Cardinal offered another job (relocation out of state) and a great severance package"
good,"I worked at the cardinal health location in dunwoody, ga. I thought this job was very laid back and easy to get into a routine. I drove to augusta ga and back to atlanta everyday. Pretty cool way to work your way up in the medical field."
good,We had a great crew that worked well together.  My position was created for me and I helped hone it and make it what it was. I was entrusted to make decisions that allowed me to provide excellent patient care.
good,I was happy working at Cardinal Health. I was so excited and impressed by working over there. It was pretty cool environment working and felt happy. If i get a chance i will work again with the fantastic team over there in cardinal health.
good,A day at work consist of alot of bending reaching and going about 30ft in the air. You go and pick up tickets and look up its location then pick it and bring it to shipping to be shipped
good,We talked with customers daily within the pharmacy or hospital environment.  Everyone loved their job and customers so each day was different but never boring.
good,"Lots of bending, lifting, etc., relaxed, but cold environment. The hardest part is the bending to retrieve pans which have to be cleaned-just wish there was a tool I could use to assist with the pan cleaning, and the most enjoyable part is working with good management staff."
good,Good place and good environment I like to work and the places I wish they have some job for me so I can go back to work again for then I love to work and the place
good,Great place to work if you like a fast paced environment. Great training and great staff.  Supervisors were motivational and they definitely encouraged the employees to work and that we take our breaks and lunch. Overtime work was always available.
good,very good . I haven't complying the coworker very good people no problem internal and good training  very good place work and conform  the manager is super intelligent
good,Cardinal Health provides us the friendly work space. It provides us with continual education in the appropriate field and also gives job satisfaction.
good,"Typical day at work is HR duties. Meet and greet with employees access their needs and come up with a resolution.  With being dotted lines to 5 managers my day was pretty much full fulfilling the needs of Operations, Inventory and Finance."
good,"My role includes pricing out custom surgical kits. Working with cross functional teams such as Marketing, Sales Operations and sales team. I also help price proposals to GPOs and IDNs."
good,Cardinal is a great company.  Awesome benefits and you can make your career what you want it to be due to the diversified workplace.  It can be competitive but it is collaborative as well.
good,I have not worked for Cardinal Health in over fifteen year so I am unable to give an accurate and comprehensive review of the work environment they currently have.

good,"The job is typical server administration and dev ops includes AWS profile."
good,Great company to work for opportunity for advancement if your willing to work for it. Work life balance can be difficult at times it is a work to task.
good,"I was employed from Jan. 2008 until Dec. 2016 and I would still work there if not for wanting to move closer to my children in a different city.  A typical day at work was helping multiple hospitals with their pricing needs.  There isn't enough time to go over how much knowledge I gained during the years I worked there. The only real complaint I had was that management tended to pick certain people over and over again for projects and then, no surprise, these same people were promoted before anyone else.  This really needs to change.  The hardest part of the job was keeping my stats up and the most enjoyable part of the job was the camaraderie among all, including management."
good,Cardinal Health has provided me with the opportunity to shine and move up in my career.  Cardinal Health allowed me to shine with a sense of purpose.  Working in the hospital allowed me to directly affect the quality of patient care by having supplies available for all forms of care.  Supporting the nursing staff and mentoring my team in the value of customer service.  Management was supportive and took my concerns and implemented ideas when it was conducive to do so.  The most enjoyable part of this job was forming the relationships needed to make our job successful!
good,"Good hours, great benefits, good working environment and good working conditions. Great opportunity for advancement. Several ways to move in different direction if you wanted to change your skill path."
good,"The first thing that I would do is grab my scanner. Then I would  log in. then I would scan prescriptions, cream, and everything else that was for hospitals or pharmacies. the hardest part of the job was we couldn't go home until everything was done. my co-workers where enjoyable and always willing to help."
good,Work life balance sometimes is not great. But overall the culture and management are great. They do appreciate their employees.
good,"There was not a lot of opportunity for advancement, even with the educational background.  It was more about who you know and who likes you, not the great work that you produce for the organization."
good,It was here that i started learning the vital role of automating software. If handled well automation makes testing very efficient and effective. I was first introduced to the concept of automation in this very company.
good,"Great side job for those who are still in college, great money and time, might be hard to balance study and work, but I've seen 5 people do it, and there all graduating within the next year. Young working a 3rd shift makes it hard to have or get into a relationship."
good,"Great benefits, pay is ok, expect to do more with less. Co workers were great team players Middle management was very helpful. Upper management does not understand the necessary process."
good,Its great experience to work at Cardinal Health with abundant opportunities to work on challenging projects and getting recognition.
good,I have been retired now for over 4 years. I lastly worked in the Decision Support grp. of the company. Wouldn't even mind physical part-time work.

Constantly staying on top of employees well-beings, interests and while staying on top of the industry.  Employee interactions is another asset."
good,"A typical day at work was count product , pick replen ,stock and putaway in two different places. Pick orders and QC them and route them to where they were going. I learned that working with a trusted team in that department was really good, the coworkers are very hard workers we were like a family always there. The hardest part of the job was when we had more then 4 people not there and had alot of work to do short handed. The most enjoyable was the coworkers in the department I was working in."
good,"A typical day included clerical duties such as customer correspondense, sales reports, and planning for weekly and monthly meetings. The most enjoyable part of the job was preparing for sales meetings by scheduling speakers, planning agenda, and making travel arrangements."
good,"Highly enjoyable workplace.  Start very early in morning, drawing up to 120 doses for delivery.  Delivering to many facilities throughout the region.  Fast paced, not much downtime.  Everyone there was highly knowledgeable of their job, great training program.  Things can get tough when the supply is low towards the end of the week, but it only makes us think harder on the best way to serve our customers.  "
good,Great place to work. As long as you have the right position its great for growth.
good,"started of with a meeting then orders to pick some days medical supplies needed to be put away. Pick orders arrange on pallets wrap pallets and load them. How to work in a busy work place, and how to work as a team. What a hospital really does for patients. Management was great until former boss left and was replaced with another. Co workers all worked together to get things done as a team got along great with everyone. Physical amounts of walking and learning all the products to a tee. Was having a comfortable job that made u feel appreciated."
good,Project management of deliverables unique to each account.
good,I worked there as a temp. Suppose to be a month long assignment that turned into 6 months. I felt just like full time employee from day one. No one treated you different. I looked just like everyone else. They take of their employees. They have a small cafe for something quick and a large cafeteria where they will make you things from a menu. They have a lot of healthy choices. The management was top notch. Definitely a great place to work.
good,"I absolutely love this company, and absolutely love the team. From my fellow project assistants to the managers and up. Everyone is great! My managers always lookout for our best interest and they take care of us. Sometimes the job is overwhelming depending on the size of the project. You will sometimes have the opportunity to travel with the company too. I love love love love love Cardinal Health."
good,The place is great to work at. Alot of overtime on Night shift. The starting time is always same but you leave when work is done. Sometimes more than 12 hours but that is when there is natural storm or snow.
good,"At Cardinal health we work as a team. I love Cardinal health. Though we had long nights but the benefits at Cardinal health are good,Especially the pay time off."
good,"I enjoy my work at Cardinal Health. Awesome and helpful coworkers. Great pay and benefits. Climate controlled environment. Some employees complain when they don't realize how well they have it here. However, they do overwork the operators and temp employees."
good,Time passed quickly each shift because we were busy but not stressed.  Upper management was great and recognised our efforts and job well done.  Middle management was a little shaky but I think that reflected the very rapid growth of the company during that time period.
good,"overall the company is great, but the pay isn't as good as the competition, the PTO is awesome.. 23 days (6 of those was sick days) the building I worked in felt like family and we all got alone, but they closed us down"
good,"No complaints, really liked this job unfortunately got fired over an argument with a Associate. But hopefully get hired back on next year .  Definitely a good place to work , if you’re looking for a fast paced work environment or overtime ."
good,I hate i had to move but i did. I was valuable to the company but i had to go. It a great place to work nice ppl. And it stayed clean by me an other safe place to work
good,I would have never left if it wasn't for the fact I had a family emergency and had to move out off state. Cardinal health is a great company to work for.
good,"A great forward thinking company that was a great deal of fun to work with. The people are lovely, friendly and hard working... I loved going to work each day."
good,"I enjoy working for Cardinal Health it is a really good company and has ok benefits i just wish they actually paid the employees more for what we tackle on a daily basis and for the cost of living here in California, we handle a variety of task daily in the health care setting but are graded on a call center #'s % which does not pan out for all that we do. however the company is relaxed and fun to work for i do enjoy my job, my coworkers and the events we have at work i just need to be compensated more realistically."
good,"I love working at CardinalHealth; the company has a gym onsite and encourages its employees to get health assessments through the StayWell Portal and usage of the gym, the benefits are family focused and CardinalHealth is one of a very few companies that encourages a work/ life balance and understands people have outside lives and family which emergencies may arise and try to work with you. Also, CardinalHealth contributes to alot of charities. The perks of working at CardinalHealth and the work environment overall are exceptional; like any job it is what you make it and you get out of it what you put in."
good,"Overall, is a great company to work for. The hardest part of the job is working at a facility where their is poor communication between management and employees."
good,Cardinal Health was  a great place to work. They really understood work life balance and allowed emplyees to work any schedule as long as you made your meeting and got your work done. I really enjoyed my time at Cardinal Health.
good,Long time employee who greatly enjoyed the experience.  The people are top exceeding well educated in the healthcare field.  The pace can be hectic and the competition is fierce which provides a challenging environment which I liked
good,Es una empresa considerada como una escuela en la cual aprendí bastante.
good,Great company. I learned the in and outs of the stocking for hospitals and doctors office. Management is willing to listen to new ideas. Mandatory over time is hard sometimes.
good,"I loved working for Cardinal Health.  They care truly about their Associates.  Great Director of Operations whom I reported directly to.  I honestly thought this was my last place of employment before I retire.   Again, great culture, empowerment of the Associates, LSS driven company."
good,We are having huddle every morning before work to discuss issues from the previous day. We communicate a lot not independent driven. Teamwork is the key of our daily performance.
good,Overall good place to work. When I was there loved working with workers. Always chance to change jobs to learn something new and pay increase. I worked every department except for customer service. Only downfall at that time was management 90% were rude and not good at working with your needs.
good,Good place to work.  Excellent management and benefits.   It was a factory technician position.  Only downside was unique schedule that required working on weekends.
good,"The people and the management are very accessible.  I leave the job because my husband was relocate to US, but I wished to stay at Cardinal. highly recommended"
good,"Due to the position I held (supported V.P. of West Area and Director of Sales, Valencia Division), I was extremely busy.  I learned so much about pharmaceuticals that I didn't know of prior to my employment.  Mangement was great and understanding to ""family issues."" Time crunches were by far the most difficult due to so many managers and directors who were reporting to the V.P. at the time.  The best part was the annual theme park events for the employees and their families, baseball games and basketball games."
good,"Great company culture with great people working for them. Everyday was welcomed with a smiling face. Extremely open to new ideas, especially from the intern."
good,You can only get  on second  shift until you have 12 months on the job then you can move.  Fasted paced  long hours  work till job gets done could be early in the morning
good,"In Supply Chain/Inventory management, the work environment was relaxed and my associates are wonderful. Teamwork played a huge roll in our success. My manager truly cares about her staff and did everything to make our workloads less stressful. It could be very stressful as this is a medical distributor and we simply could not fail our hospitals...and we didn't. Benefits and time off are off the chain and are immediate upon hire."
good,"Fantastic opportunity to work for a dynamic company. Management was supportive and responsive, great team members and team environment to include interesting project work."

good,"As a material handler you would have to go to every line and check to make sure they were stocked up on every item they need. I learned how to use a power walkie, big joe, forklift, and manual jack. Management is great. The hardest part about the job is getting along with some of the people on A shift. The most enjoyable part about the job is gong on breaks."

During the last few weeks of the internship I was allowed to compound the radiopharmaceuticals under supervision of a pharmacist."
good,"This is for the recently-acquired Cardinal Health at Home branch. They are currently adopting more culture from Cardinal Health HQ in Dublin, Ohio.

People at Cardinal Health are great people to work with.  The hardest part of the job is being able to adjust to the different attitudes of team leaders.
good,"Someone once told me, after an early morning meeting at Cardinal, that they were impressed at how everyone arriving for work that morning appeared happy as they entered the building for a day's work. Since the day I started my employment at CAH, I notice that same thing every morning; myself included."
good,"I worked here for 9 years, and I loved the job! People are very nice small crew, crossed trained on everything to be aware. Was rewarded for the performance you put into the job. Pay was great. Jus like any job it had it pitfalls and that was not having sufficient equipment to get the job done effectively, too many promises from corporate that was never fulfilled. All an all if I wanted to go back to work there I probably would!"

We not only were a distributor but also a manufacture. All my co-workers were heplful and freindly.

I see no hardest part of my job because it allows me to help patients and clients and the only thing that made me sad is when I got to be separated from them.

What i have learned working for Cardinal Health is how to manage my own time and how to become a self starter and most of all how to manage others. The management at Cardinal Health is very wonderful and they take great care of there staff when a problem arises. The most difficult part of my job is dealing with the loss of a fellow co-worker it really hit is all very hard because we are all like a big family we look out for one another and help each other out when we need help. The most enjoyable part of my job is the lunch parties that we have at Cardinal health because depending on the day or the mood our lunch varies one day it could be pizza or it could be catered from a restaurant like On The Border or Buca De Pepo.

The thought of being sick and without medical coverage, was unimaginable."

good,"I loved my job here so much. Unfortunately because I loved it and worked hard each day a certain group of co-workers harrassed me daily for it.  Scary, unsafe practices with walkies. Group bullying, intimidation.  Messing with my orders and personal items on my walkie. Management couldn't help me as they couldn't catch them. Really to bad as it would have been a place I could of retired from. If you can keep your head down avoid their peering eyes and gossip, this is a great place to work."
good,"As I said, decent pay. Training corse is 6 weeks and average to what I expected. Most of the supervisors have a friendly but firm approach. When I fell ill, they provided paid FMLA and matched my salary. I fell behind on the paperwork for it and that is how I was terminated. I’d still be there if I kept up on it or didn’t get sick. Awesome company"

good,"the envirorment at cardinal health was fast pace,high production.,with games and prizes for its employees, and extra breaks for the highest productive employees"
good,"I go to school during the day, so I needed a job that had odd hours. I work from 2am to approximately 11am on weekdays and 2am to 8am on weekends. As a technician the workpace is a but higher than for a driver in the nuclear pharmacy, but it is still very easily doable. You become very close to your coworkers and managers. I've noticed that people do not get fired ""just because"" like at so many jobs I've worked at. There are multiple warnings, written and verbal, and it never comes as a surprise. There are several times during the day for short breaks--or you can use those times to do busy work--one is more likely to get you a raise when your reviews come around. One thing I've really noticed is that management actually appreciates you. When you go the extra mile, they do more than just nod. They actually thank you and let you know they appreciate your work. "
good,The culture is very collaborative and open.  The management all the way up to the top is very supportive and caring about the individuals that work in there company.
good,"The typical day at work revolved around improving the quality of healthcare for our patients and providing them with their medications in a friendly, but timely manner. I learned a lot about 340b and its impact on our patient's financial burdens. The management at Cardinal Health has been nothing but phenomenal. They have always taken the time to answer all of my questions and have given me room to grow as an employee in my field. The workplace culture is inviting and diverse. I would recommend this company to anyone. The hardest part of the job is being able to keep up with the inventory policies that are consistently changing. It was difficult to find a balance on how and what drugs to order as well as through what vendor. The most delightful part of my job was to help alleviate some of the financial hardships our lower income and uninsured patients experience on a daily basis. We are able to build a natural rapport with our patients to the extent that they feel less like strangers, and more like family."
good,This is a company that appreciates your talent and values each employee for what they bring to the table. I appreciate the management team as they make sure you feel welcome and appreciated on Day 1

The job required a skill in the compounding of the radioactive and the caution required in dealing with the radioactive generators that produced our materials for our drug compounding. The company management was very fair in how it treated the employees and how the lab was run. It was a fast pace job to have the drugs produced for  delivery to the hospitals in a timely manner and we always did an excellent job.

I was trained for 3 months on how to load contracts in a certain way that when I came out training it was decided that they would put me in Special Projects and give me special vendors that would be loaded completely different. I would correspond with my vendors to insure there contracts were correct. I also would handle rebate discrepancies and do research to find out why there rebates werent paid.
