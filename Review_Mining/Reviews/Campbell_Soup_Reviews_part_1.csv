rating,review
bad,Most of the workers that are there don’t do anything and the line leads are pick and chosen by likeness not work ethics! AND moving up in the facility is impossible unless you’re friends with management cause everyone here is perms-temps!
bad,If you are not of Native American decent they don’t want you. You can have all they qualifications for the position but if you are not Indian your app is probably going in the trash.
bad,"I would not recommend any one to work for the company breaks u down and then they want to fire u  they have some good managers they need to bring a better hr Dept  I have family members still there. They never wanted us to come work"
bad,Needs work on their managers and leaders too many rules to follow and too many bosses to have to satisfy work all the time no family time very stressful at times.
bad,company is a dumpster fire  poor mgmt and uncertanity  never know what to expect  outdated technology and no planning save yourself from going to this place
bad,I have nothing really to say about campbells soup it was  a job when I needed one. then it became must more then a job so then I left. its good for someone that likes factory work and mean ppl
bad,"Pleasant working conditions, engaging workforce, continuing education classes, team players.  I continued to learn new systems and received help needed in those areas,  Good compensation.  Family oriented."
bad,Always working no time for anything else I worked with a bunch of nice people but I was seasonal. When I did try to get hired in full time I was moved to a different department my supervisor harassed me and made up a bunch of stuff about me HR wouldn't do anything about it and they wouldn't move me so now I'm looking for another job.
bad,hated this job. very fast paced where most employees are unwilling to work as a team. favoritism is shown from upper management all the way down to production employees.
bad,If they didn’t require work keys it would be ok place and better pay and sum days off would be good to cause starting work on Sunday if a hassle......
bad,"Need to follow the instruction with a lot of executive and manager . Need to involve everything just not your side only."
bad,This place doesn't care about employees. All about numbers. No proper training system. I have been here a year and the management never are on the floor. Always in the office. Always using their phones but telling employees not to touch there phones.
bad,Work you like a dog and treat you like one too.  If you havent already been there for 20 plus years like most of them they will run you to death.  84 hour weeks with no vacation.  The entire place is also disgusting with rodents and critters everywhere.
bad,"Pure politics... much more focused on 'their  way' over good business practices. Employee engagement scores are a farce - they are not anonymous... Choice 1 - be honest and get fired. Choice 2 - be somewhat truthful and create work for your group to 'fix' problems the bureaucracy caused. Choice 3 - say everything is wonderful, and make them a top company to work for...They are successful in spite of themselves."
bad,"I have seen thirty salaried ""group leaders"" fired in the last 3 years, there is a "" buffer"" for the level just above to protect themselves from being responsible. Plant will work 7 days , and more if they could ask god for it. Pay is low for the area for skilled labor. Expect to work second shift for many years with very few days off. "
bad,"This is a nice place with amazing people but it has terrible management, you get over worked, you don’t get paid enough, you constantly have to do other peoples work everything is thrown on second shift this managers is just terrible."
bad,"at campbells you are just a number to them not an employee, you work long days sometimes without a day off for months and you get no credit for it"
bad,"management through intimidation , promotions given to unqualified friends of managers, training given to managers pets, preferred shifts given to junior employees due to relationship with managers, many were threatened with termination, vindictive uneducated leaders, senior leadership says all the right things but does none of tem"
bad,"Every year a new program would roll out that was supposed to lead us to the future.  First line supervisors were given conflicting goals."
bad,Campbell Soup is not a place to work if you have a family. We have guys working over 70 hours a week. And when the business unit leader was asked about it the answer was it's not important.  Management brushes harassment under the rug and  encourages bullying if they don't like you. Stay away
bad,This is not healthy for any human being and Campbell should not be allowed to do that to their employees. You can’t work good employees to dealth and cause their bodies to breakdown and fire them if have to take medical. I saw that too often while I was there.
bad,"Campbell Soup Company is losing itself in the modern age.  Recently, the company fired it's CEO, and it has had staff reductions twice in less than three years in an effort to save money."
bad,Follow post orders over night work  not much traffic just to quit  and your outside in your post lights are so bright  u can't see out I hated that ....thats really all I have to say
bad,"Its a shame. Company has great potential, but CFLT / SLT has single handedly destroyed nearly all of the value of this 100 year old company. "
bad,Management is poor doesn't Care about employees. The insurance was good.  Had a few good supervisor.. When there is a problem in the workplace needs to be fixed... Training is horrible.
bad,It was an easy job. It was just hard to worry about losing your job at anytime because of layoffs. It was a lot of favoritism going on there.
bad,"Top management will lie and hide behind their big smiles and stab you in the back. "
bad,"The money is good and depending on what department you work in, will dictate your workplace culture.  Lots of forced overtime.  Benefits are good.   The warehouse is very high stress with the advent of computer tracking on the fork lifts.  Quota's are necessary to keep your job. I learned some very valuable people and job skills."
bad,"worse company I ever worked "
bad,"If you go to Campbell's through a temp agency such as Two Hawk, you will get screwed. Better hope you dont ever get hurt because the first thing they do is let you go under the pretext of investigating a ""safety violation"" on your part. Just saying they treat their temps like red-headed step children."
bad,Campbells' canning facility in Dixon California runs a seasonal line for 100 to 110 days continuously.  They hire mechanics and electricians and line workers on the guise that they are going to stay employed after the season.  Shortly after the seasonal run ends they are let go no matter how good they are because it is a union operation and seniority rules.  During the season you have to work 7 days a week.  NO DAYS OFF.  They are good benefits while you are there but the pay isn't better that anybody else. Management is very old fashion union and very unfair.
bad,The last 5 years the company has continued to transform into a company that no longer values the employees.  Long term employees are being systematically removed or their jobs eliminated.
bad,"Great money if you are willing to work 80 hours a week. "
bad,Little room for error. Penalized when errors occur. Not any benefits.
bad,"Supervisors are rude, Human Resources is very unprofessional and rude, the managers there are fake. You work long hours no time off. They treat the seasonal help like you were slaves."
bad,Politics. Everyone is so busy trying to make sure that no one else figures out they have no idea that they don't know what they are doing they don't take the time to get the job done.
bad,I was in a argument with the franchise owner. I stopped the production because the meat that was schedule to enter the machines were molded. He tried to push it through and I refused it up. I was not going to allow spoiled and molded meat to be in the soup. He later terminated me for production loss.
bad,They promised everything under the sun but didn't deliver. People have families. It just came to a point I needed to move on so I can cover bills. Too bad too.
bad,I really enjoyed working there I learned how to drive a forklift and it gave me a chance to work with others and I got the ability to work in a warehouse the environment was very different but yet you were basically  by urself
bad,"Management is appalling, there is little work/life balance for many. Culture is cut throat for the most part. Most people try to move on. Typical days at work consist of being micro managed. No real career path unless you are the few chosen."
bad,"in my time as a campbell's coup Lab Tech in the QA lab on soup and Sauce, I was dissapointed to see how easy it was for the production line to cut corners and find loop holes. Higher senority workers often attested to their old school knowledge of how things go. Consequences of our supervisors and lead workers not holding some people accountable for their actions was sometimes a daily battle. Examples would be blending opperators modifying salt levels or sugar levels without documenting the process or alerting the QA lab. Also there were some opperators that chose to sign off for the product before it had been properly tested by us in the labs. this resulted in many thousands of cases to sometimes be destroyed if they were found to actually be out of spec. i learned a lot from the workers who took pride in their job providing quality soup sauce and juice, but i could never learn more from the unfortunate mistakes i have seen."
bad,"Management: Senior Management likes to talk a big talk about accountability, having open dialogue and caring about people but it's all a load of nonsense. If you enjoy a senior team full of disrespectful bullies who like to hear their own voices and are only interested in advancing their own personal agendas/careers, Campbell's is certainly the place for you. Expect to be thrown under the bus all the time, especially in front of the entire senior team, have your accomplishments put down/discredited, have the senior team take credit for your work, and refuse to take accountability for their own actions (despite grilling their own employees to always be accountable). It's hypocrisy at its finest."
bad,"My overall experience was unexpectedly unusal. For an company who seeks new products to market to the consumer, the Supply Chain area was not accepting to innovation."
bad,"Since our plant was small, some of us wore many hats. You got good at multi-tasking . Each day was differnt then the last."
bad,"* Management lacking emphathy. If you're into being humilated by management then this is the place for you. If you're into being told that you have no input then this the place for you. If you have a personal problem of any kind, i.e., death of spouse, divorce, leave it at the door, then this is the place for you. If you want to be part of the 15% that don't see a yearly increase to fill a quota, then this is the place for you. Morale at an all time low within the ""innovative company""."
bad,A once great company on the decline.   Too many unknown futures for many of the aging brands.   Senior Leadership does not have clear vision and hope for advancement minimal.
bad,"Worked there for three seasons. It paid great for what I did, but you don’t get very many days off. Fairly simple jobs. Don’t really need and previous experience."
bad,"The workplace environment became fractured with a severe divide occurring between many managers and their workers. The pay and benefits were comparable or better than other companies, but morale deteriorated with the outsourcing of many functions and the seeming lack of respect for experienced workers."
bad,"Management doesn't know what they're doing and they're always trying to expect more from you (after the new employee's sometimes put 72 hours in). They make you leave feeling satisfied, that's for sure."
bad,"Felt over qualified, management lead me to believe i was going to have a chance for a position despite knowing the position was going to someone else regardless of how i performed."
bad,The company is more interested in appearances in respect to safety and loyalty. The training is poor and there is no job security.
bad,It was very hard to maintain a family life and work the hours campbells wanted me to work. It was very hot in the factory. Alot of drama. And they dont do anything about bullying or harassment. Very little training.
bad,"Campbell Soup is a very clean buisness/plant, the only thing I did not like was working 7 days a week, every once in a while I would not mind working 7 days but they worked it every weekend. It is a pretty easy job they do not use jacks so you have to push all ingredient around in big barrels and if you are working through a temp service they move you around a lot which is something else I did not like. But other than that campbell soup is a good workplace."
bad,It was an okay and fun place to work expect for all the lay offs they give. But when they require overtime it's not an option. You have to work. They have 2 shifts. They don't really care about you having kids. They expect you to have daycare year round. Some times you will work 7 days.
bad,Poor management ! The manager was a bully! She only cared about the employees that she liked and made the rest of the employees do most of the work  .
bad,The manager never asked for our feedback on involve us in a day to day decision everything is set the way they’re and there’s no changing what so ever and no communication
bad,"The recent reorganization has resulted in quite a few people leaving the local office. Unfortunately, the workload has not decreased. Of course the end result is overworked, disgruntled employees."
bad,A facility that prioritizes production alone. Funding for capital improvements is limited based on proof of needs and distribution to production options.
bad,"Corporate does well with equality of employees.  The plants do not match what corporate supports.  There is a ""good old boy"" atmosphere at the plants.  When promoting individuals into higher up leadership positions it needs to be understood that while technical aptitude is very important, leadership skill requirements increase.  I seen several times where leaders were promoted based on strong technical aptitude and the leadership abilities were poor.  This type of situation makes it very hard for the employees directly reporting to the promoted individual leading them."
bad,I did not enjoy a factory job and was often time very stressed. But the advancement in Campbell soup is very possible and Two Hawk makes it easier. Also gives the experience needed and gives experience in heavy machinery.
bad,"It was hard work, the money was good. No career advancement. That is why I chose to search for a different Career after 8 Seasons of working six months and laid off for the other six months."
good,Work 12 days straight then 2 days off. In those 12 days you are mandated to work 4 days for 12 hr shifts. You are off one weekend then your 12 day stretch begins.
good,"No time for family. Seven days a week, you are just a number to them, but the pay is very good. Its a good job if you are young and have no life, want to be away from home living at the factory most of your life and have an unending supply of energ, patiencew and coffee."
good,"I worked at Campbell Soup through Two-Hawk temporary services. Even the weeks I worked seven days, once the taxes and their cut was taken out, my check was pitiful. The only way you make good money out there is if you're permanent through the company.  The only way to become permanent without working years and years seem to be only if you know someone that know someone."
good,"intense work environment and fast past steady work, there were long hours and breaks were not long enough. it is a nice facility very big and spacious."
good,Load mushrooms into a hoopper.At this job you just did the work that was assigned to you.You never seen management.Rarely had contact with co-workers from the part of the plant i was in.Hardest part of the day was when the line went down.they would send you home.Best part of the day was being at work period...
good,"This is a terrible place to work.  The environment is hostile to families, and they aren't concerned about their workers.  Long hours, hot working conditions, especially in the summer; dehydration and heat stress are very common."
good,"The co-workers I had the privilege to work with were wonderful.  The management styles of some were extremely difficult to deal with, while others inspired you to work your hardest.  It was definitely an experience."
good,Money is wonderful but 12 hr to 16hr shifts almost everyday and it's hard to get hired in at least it was. Stressful work environment alot of drama and long work days
good,I worked at Campbell Soup for a little bit over 10 years. I got to know some really good people at the job and I work with some really nice coworkers. The pay was fine but they offer no incentives for the work that you do. They do offer you a meal or something when the company reaches their or break a record out there but how does that benefit my family at home.
good,"I very disliked working for this company, my check never when over 250.00. Workers take longer breaks than they are suppose to."
good,"Endless overtime. Always short crewing. Been told for six years""we are hiring"" . Endless "" expecations"" changes in ""expectations"" last year they ran 4th july and shut down the week after. Run away, layoffs, cutbacks be careful what you wish for. 2nd shift seniority , union ran."
good,"No Job Security as the business is completely down. Outsourcing the entire IT jobs to india. Just to show cost saving , they take people and fire them every year."
good,There is no room for advancement. Feel as if I am stuck in my current position. Feel as though there could be more diversity within the organization. Looking for room for advancement.
good,"Repetitive job, lack of learning opportunity. Difficult to coordinate tasks, lack of clear direction. Non-political workplace environment but high stress."
good,Good pay no family life. Two tiered system that favors permanent employees. Management is poorly ran and treat employees with little or no respect. Would not recommend
good,"You will work a lot of hours with great pay, but you will have little to none personal or home life. It can be challenging but there is little room to advance into a career."
good,"Culture slowly becoming more progressive. Would be decent place to work without mgmt micro managing you. Benefits and compensations are good, but may have problems keeping IT workforce happy."
good,"Very long hours and inefficient processes; lack of clarity surrounding priorities and objectives. Management/leadership is in a constant state of change, impacting ways of working."
good,"Quick paced, very labor intense. It was a Hot and stressful environment. I believe the management at the time was not very well which resulted in me leaving."
good,"Work is not over strenuous, if you are not a permanent employee of Campbell, they really don't care for your input or abilities. sorry pay for the hard working temps, while the permanent employees make 21.00hr. compared to your embarrassing 9.00hr. its sickening because the ones making all the money don't do a dam thing."
good,"Overall pay is competitive."
good,"company is great to work for in lines of benefits but job ethics are not great, demanding 12 hr 7 day week job every week ,been like this for the 25 yrs ive been there,no care for family time,not recommended for young familys"
good,"Worked in small town, so everybody that worked there was going to stay there.  Union environment so promotion, and shift, were based upon length of time there.  Jobs were bid and the person that had been there longest got the job.  Don't even hope that you can have a first shift job in your first 20 years of working there."
good,"The pay here is great . But the management is horrible. If you work here you give up all other things in life, management gets time off and they force the hourly employees massive hours. The overtime comes from the company not wanting to hire the correct amount of people, they wish to run a billion dollar organization on a skeleton crew of workers and thousand of salary people. Also there are so many rules here no one can keep track of them. To sum it up they are slave drivers stay away don't let the money fool ya. "
good,"The money is good, but you're forced to work 12 hours a day for 5 days and the 8 hours a day for 2. You barely get time off work. Being a seasonal employee here is rough because you don't get time to spend with your family."
good,Campbell's is struggling in the current retail environment.  Company morale is low as the company struggles to define who they are in the 21st century
good,Campbell is a great company with iconic Brands and consumer centric thinking. The Latin American region is mostly driven by the Caribbean with excellent distributors in the Caribbean with a high level of professionalism.
good,A lot of time and hard work put into this place. What I've learned is you can put all your time and hard work into this company and still feel unappreciated.
good,"Enjoy working at Campbell's warehouse. I was hired on as a seasonal worker. So I was laid-off. But in all the experience of operating a forklift was awesome. I would love to do this type of work again, hopefully I am able to retain this experience if hired on."
good,"The pay here is great, but be prepared to live there for 6-7 months, and then be layed off. You will not get in as a permanent employee, no benefits, and the management there are geared more towards their bottom line than any of their employees."
good,"During my time there, the company was going through major changes, both at management and business strategy level which was causing confusion to long term plan for the company.  My assessment is not relevant for current culture."
good,Long working hours 12 hour days seven days a week much of the year. Do not get proper training in some areas. Some people get away with longer breaks which cheats you out of your break when your on relief position. Favoritism.
good,"i did a variety of jobs for campbell soup which made the job nice and not so boring. I really enjoyed being a plant janitor, transported injured emplopees to emergecy and ran errands for supervisors."
good,"For the most part, the job is fairly non-stressful and is mainly checking contractors in and out of the site. There are routine patrols in vehicle and on foot."
good,"Maintained all equipment wall to wall"
good,"typical day is 10 to 12 hours, you constantly learn new challenges and expect more than you recieve and managing managers is the hardest part of the job"
good,"Great money, lots of opportunities for overtime. Its a great job fun people to work with, just wish insurance was better and that they valued family a little more."
good,Campbell Soup Company of Canada was a great place to work up until the recent announcement of the plant closure at the end of July 2019. The people at Campbell's are good hardworking people.
good,long hours but the pay is good just need a better training program was rushed through it. and management needs to communicate better amongs theirselves
good,une société qui met beaucoup de pression sans nécessairement former ses salariés. une bonne ambiance de travail;
good,Suitable place to gain knowledge and enhance your understanding in production/manufacturing working environment. Sometimes required to work overtime and also during weekend
good,"Its a learning experience as far as how soup and broth is made packaged, and labeled, from scratch. From the ingredients, to blending and filling, placed in the can or carton, the sterilization process then onto lableing and packaging."
good,Decent work place. During slow season you will get an opportunity to  train in different areas. Busy season starts after labor day through winter. 7 days a week. Mandatory.
good,The days are long. Expect to work 10 hours a day minimum with working on 6 to seven days a week average.
good,Nights and weekends along with an unstable labor union gave an unstaqble work enviroment at times.
good,"If what you’re looking for is a lot of work, I suggest it, but it was not for me. I had no life. I had thanksgiving and Christmas off, other than that, you rarely had a day off."
good,Working at Campbell Soup was fine except for the rude workers if not for that I would still be there today. The hardest part of the job was getting the vegetables unstuck from the machines and pushing the heavy barrels to and from the production lines.
good,good place to work if you don't want a home life. pay is extremely food for the work you'll put in and need benefits for you and the family then this is the place to be.
good,"As with many large companies, it is true of Campbell Soup that it is easy to get lost in the shuffle.  They have all these programs and initiatives but it always felt like they were for show and not reality.  I found it difficult to fit in there.  All top level employees talked in the buzz words of the day and associates that were mid-level like me understood less than half of what was being said.  Wasn't for me."
good,"Good to work with you "
good,Campbell was a good job but no room for advancement. They pay well but the management was not great. I would not go back to campbell soup
good,"Work was hard but at times satisfying."
good,"Overall, a good place to work if you don't require much time spent at home with your family."
good,Company has strayed from its core business and has abruptly changed CEOs in 2018. The company is now actively closing and/or selling all plants outside of the U.S.
good,"Excellent Company, great culture and opportunity both technical and managerial. I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a new opportunity."
good,They would have a new CEO every other year and change directions of what their goals were.  There is really nothing more to say as it was a long time ago and things have changed.
good,"Well rounded company. Would recommend to anyone.Progressive and forward-thinking culture. Several resources designed to enhance career development. Several on-campus benefits including top-of-the-line cafeteria, fitness center, outdoor work space, treadmill desks, and on-site daycare."
good,Good place to work!  Good pay! Good group of people to work with! Work is not too physical. If you are low senority there will be time where you have to work 12 hour days.
good,"A typical workday consists of ensuring production lines are properly set up and FIFO is properly performed on all raw ingredients. Coordination of  5-7 loads daily of finished goods to our distribution warehouse, located in Hodgkin's, IL. and daily ordering of raw ingredients from a local contracted warehouse. One key learning experience is getting the opportunity to be lead on several projects, utilizing different resources nationally, throughout the company. In the last eight months there has been leadership changes. Out of all fairness, the management has not had enough tenure to give a proper assessment. The workplace culture, like any work environment, has a majority of team members with a great attitude/team continuity. The hardest part of the job , is dealing with the space constraints, with constant growth of the company. The most enjoyable part of the job, is the many challenges and fast pace environment."
good,"Nice place to work for downside of shift patterns , Can be hard regarding family life with young children very nosy with machinery, lots of cleaning down today after your shift is finished ready for nightshift to come on it's nice that you get to meet a lot of different people from all different walks of life"
good,Got the job done daily and worked well with others.  Learned how to perform maintenance on machinery by working with mechanics and engineering.  Benefits were great.
good,"It was a good place.  Big, lots of ""this is how we do this"", but if you can tolerate that, it's an ok place.  Long history.  You can work in lots of departments."
good,"Management got really bad for the 2017 season. The money is good. There is a lot of unneeded drama caused by ""hired in"" employees. The hours are long and stressful but the pay is worth it."
good,"	Provided leadership and insight for the development of savory flavor technology Platforms for Campbell Soup Company and subsidiaries, including Fermentation, Yeasts extracts, and reaction flavor ingredients."
good,Worked with company for 30 years and the stress of it was very difficult. Company was family oriented but gradually over the years became numbers only.
good,I am thankful for the time Campbell Soup Company was open. I miss my friends. I found it very interesting how they make the product. Each department depend on the other to achieve a coomon goal.
good,"Lots of responsibilities.  Great hours. Lots of lifting. Company required people to work from home, did not like paying for that time. Required 40 in warehouse."
good,It was a good learning experience working there and doing different jobs. But it was your typical factory job working 12hrs a day seven days a week.
good,"Campbell s was an excellent experience, I enjoyed my co-workers and the environment . I also got along well with upper management. I eventually applied for a management position and was accepted which change my status from hourly to salary. This, I felt was extremely challenging because it kind of broke down some of the relationships and rapport that I had established with many of the hourly employees; however this begin to change after people begin to understand that I was the same genuine , outgoing team player as before. Although management wanted more of a change which seemed to put me in a compromising position"
good,A typical day at work was very steady and busy. I learned what temperature the canned soup suppose to be. Management was great. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. There wasn't anything hard about the job to me. I enjoyed checking the temperature of the soup and making sure there weren't any damage cans
good,"Campbell Soup Company used to be a place where you knew you would learn, grow, even have some fun time and maybe even retire from. Their moto was ""People Valuing People"". After a while, jobs started disappearing to other countries. Jobs were being downsized and people being laid-off only to have some new hires for the same job just slightly reconfigured. People Valuing People was a thing of the past. Even the fun events to show the company's appreciation to its employees stopped."
good,"3rd shift. "
good,Professional environment.  Would give it a 4 star rating but Indeed.com will only allow me to give it 3 stars.  Temp job.
good,I Interned at Campbell's for the summer. The internship was driven by ambiguous projects that challenged your ability to research and make sense of the unstructured data available.
good,"Shift work, alternating days and afternoons on a weekly basis. Early start in the mornings. Mornings are busy, due to soup start ups. I learned how to work with others, use industrial machinery, drive lift trucks and learn lift truck safety. Also certified HACCP, ISO, WHMIS etc. Management has seen many changes in the 23 years of my employment there. The Company treats people pretty fairly, considering there is no union at this particular sight.Generally the co- workers are a good group of people to work with. I made a lot of friends while working there."
good,"Large manufacture of some leading brands in food - Campbell's Soup, Pace Sale and Pepperidge Farms."
good,"The hourly pay was comparable; however, the amount of overtime one was expected to work was unrealistic. There was little regard to the employee's well-being when he or she was forced to work up to 20 hours of overtime ( sometimes more). It is slowly getting better, but be prepared to feel separated from your home-life; when you work at Campbell's- it is your home. Outside of the forced overtime, and lack of weekends off, the work performed is not too strenuous. "
good,Did wall graphics for them as a consultant. Project turned out fabulous.
good,clean filler's then I usually do quality. I learned how the food industry is very different than typical factories.
good,Worst IT management in my entire career. Absolutely clueless and do not care about the company. They want to outsource everything to IBM India and do not have any responsibilities.
good,I learned several different was to sanitize and repair a diverse amount of machines. I also learn variety of ways to prepare a variety of soups.
good,Great Fortune 500 company.  Numerous opportunities for growth and advancement.  The hardest part of my job was gaining buy-in from several sales teams about incorporating licensed merchandise as part of their overall sales strategy.  The most enjoyable part of the job was managing the Campbell Soup corporate archivist and helping him develop ways to expand awareness of that department across the organization.
good,"I worked in the warehouse. Which means even though we were told that the hours would he getting better we still worked up to 70 hours week. The only thing good about working that much was the 1,000 dollar checks. Other than that you might as well just kiss your butt goodbye working in the warehouse. It sucks, everyone lies. No one knows anything. The supervisors will all tell you different answers to the same question. They will also beat around the bush and also laugh at you for something you cannot control."
good,Fast paced company and has many organizational changes.  many of the folks when I was there are no longer employed.  The items they produced need to be revamped.
good,"I have worked with HQ and other regions, everybody is in to help, still organization is changing all the time, since I've been working here there has been 4 changes."
good,"It was always hot in there. There was a nasty smell that roamed through the air. We had meetings before we would work. There was people who would be in the break room for what seemed like 30 minutes. So management wasn't really that strict, except to temporaries"
good,Campbell's is a good place to work. The IT department works well together however movement is limited. People have a tendency to stay in the higher positions making it difficult to move.
good,"Very fast paced work place.  A lot of overtime, too much, to be exact. Turn over rate is very high. Point system needs to be redone. But it can be a fun place to work."
good,I really don't have much to say about this position in that it was a good transitional job to tie me over until something better came along. This job was the typical 8 hour day.
good,This is a very productive company which includes multiple resources available to complete a wide array of product development. There are numerous work processes that does need some improvement to promote effectiveness.
good,"Not much to say, i went in everyday and did my job. I drove a tow motor. It was a descent place to work. Smelled like food and made me hungry"
good,"A typical work day started at 1300 hours with a safety meeting followed with a schedule for soups that needed to be prepped for the day. After that we would get a recipe for those soups. We would stretch and exercise and go to the production floor. The room was set at 36 degrees. We had 7 different stations of prep work. There was the tomato room, dairy, veggies, meat, base, dry, and the can room. I learned how to prep ingredients according to recipes. I learned how to operate a variety of machines like the cheese shredder, the sour cream pump, paste pump, tomato dice pump, oil pump etc. I learned how to break down, clean, and put these machines back together."
good,"A typical day consisted of an overwhelming amount of work due to past layoffs.  They downsize every year and, in many cases, they leave the people that are behind with too many jobs...more than they can handle.  Then it seems as though you are not doing your job the right way because you are overwhelmed.  It's a no win situation."
good,Great work environment and people are friendly. Not much else to say.
good,Rewarding 10 week internship experience within the supply chain team. Given the opportunity to explore multiple areas within supply chain as well as interact cross-functionally. Was able to take advantage of summer hours as an intern as well.
good,Campbell Soup has struggled to establish job security for their employees.  They struggle in establishing a diverse environment and the culture is very much each person for themselves.
good,if you want to make money this is the place to be. you have somewhat of a good life and good living. i just dont like the working on weekends at all but it a good job for a working person. good pay if you can ever get rolled over off temp. service
good,"Campbell's has many opportunities for people to grow their careers.  "
good,"Days of meetings all day were tough; 4 managers in 2 years; implemented a system only to have next leader not aligned; lack of strategic focus fr the long haul; Still a good ol' boys network in Supply Chain. "
good,"Had to be at work at 6;00 am. I learned how to work on the v-8 juice line. I was Quality Control on my line. Learned to weigh and torque the juice bottles. Management was ok, they helped the permanent people more than the new hire. We didn't get our time in for 6 months. Co-workers were helpful. Hardest part of the job was, at the end of the night we had to clean the hold line which was about a 1/2 mile long. Most enjoyable was that they had a store on the premises if you wanted buy products."
good,"- Managed customer accounts to ensure: accurate pricing, terms, lead times, special packing requirements, stock availability and resolution of trucking issues"
good,"There are plenty of bad characters in lower positions at Campbells, many people purchase fake urine to pass the drug test, the management is not the problem. The pay is dependant on your job and generally increases with difficulty. The Union at Campbells takes in anybody that works there."
good,"During my tenure at Campbell, the Company embarked on a shift from the traditional food CPG giants back to the genuine spirit and ethos of the founders under the mission ""real food that matters for life's moments"".  This transformation included shifting from center store categories into more fresh and wholesome categories through acquisitions and challenging the conventions of the companies core categories.  I led the team looking to lead this disruption in the Company's core meals categories."
good,Decent company but working in an old model. Too many job overlaps. Slow pace. Could be a company to retire but not one for fast growing opportunities.
good,The work area has been highly modernized in the past several months. It is a pleasure coming to work in such a vibrant environment.
good,"Lots of meetings, but with lots of good people. There is a good, collaborative culture among the staff.  Working from home, Summer Hours, all allowed."
good,"You would think that being a reliable, well qualified employee whom is always on time would be beneficial but unfortunately that is not true at Campbell Soup. The union has ruined that for most. Yes the union has its place bbut this one has over stepped. When 'Soup Season' has ended they send home a large amount of employess who are then required to file for and live on unemployment. To many this is not a surprise. BUT knowing that unemployment does not pay near as much as continued employment most strive to stay on. UNFORTUNATELY Campbell Soup will keep the employees who fall asleep on the job because they have been there for 30 years before they will choose a hard working well qualified employee because if they dont the union gives them a hard time. I have seen it. This did not happen to me because of my job position but I saw it happen over and over again as soup season came to an end."
good,"Management is great for the most part, personally I know my boss really cares about me and my well-being. A lot of weekend work though, and there's not really any incentive for salaried employees to work overtime like the hourlys. Good benefits package. Sometimes the work environment is highly stressful, though. Pay goes up yearly based on performance."
good,The company has a great benefits package but is high paced and stressful. The job has been a great learning experience. The culture in the plants are a team environment and easy to work with
good,"Selling Swanson Frozen Foods, a Division of Campbell Soup Company to local NC Grocery Store Chains"
good,make you work many hours with no choice. No benefits and just lay you off when the season is over. Very demanding physical jobs. Would not recomend if you want a full time job. People are nice for the most part. no advancement if you do not get hired.
good,"I had a pretty good experience there, none of the work is hard just fast paste but that's ok because the pay is good the only bad thing is that they have too many lay offs."
good,Good place to work and the pick is nice i welcome all like of people to go wotk at campleblls soup they have great benefits and the peoiple are friendly
good,It is a challenging and hard working to achieve the targets.
good,Great place to work until office politics override plant operations new plant manager was clueless of his responsibility and created a uncomfortable atmosphere would have never left had management stayed the same
good,If you were new you always got forced to either come in early or stay late. Great pay but really had no time for family life. I would recommend this job to anyone great place in general
good,"The employees was like my second family. The pay was great. However this is not the job to plan your retirement. Once soup season is over, so is your job.."
good,i worked for campbell soup co for thirity two years plant closure looking for new job
good,"Alls good,  kind co- workers.  Only not enough training for each job . Preparing machines anes and us too fast may put a lot of pressure on the training."
good,Great place to work but very bad benefits as a seasonal. Very laid back job. Very easy and pays very well. Great environment and management. Long hours.
good,A job good benefits and salary fast paced environment productive job.it is a team work place where you can learn multiple jobs and elevate.  Good place to start and move up.
good,"Well diverse company to work for."
good,"The company is constantly looking to improve, by engaging with the employees at the floor level and incentivizing them to perform the improvements. The company is very safety focus"
good,"Good environment "
good,Campbell's is a fast paced company that expects a lot from their employees. The workforce is highly qualified but it can be a difficult highly political place to work.
good,The company was an excellent place to work. They had a good wage and they had good benefits. They really took good care of all their employees. It was a good place to work.
good,There is no set direction. We change the game plan too often. Working with some of my co-workers. Management has it's days. Culture is a big issue in our plant.
good,I was responsible for hiring approximately 500 employees each summer.  I recruited and oriented all employees.  I was responsible for benefits for all full time employees.
good,"IT management needs changing"
good,"I only spent a few months in Campbell, working on our Capstone Projects. I was only in touch with very few people, all of whom were very supportive and helpful in our project."
good,good place to work and a great culture around the office. Great leadership and training techniques to help you succeed. Great place overall to work!!!!1
good,I interned here as an MBA student. I enjoyed the work and the people I was around on a day to day basis. The biggest challenge facing the company going forward will be the decline in popularity of soup.
good,Company was a great company to work for with good benefits unfortunate due to the economy at the the market dropped and the company closed thus resulting in amass layoff./
good,This was one of the best paying job and I learned a lot from this company. It was very hot working around all the cookers and soup being cooked. I hated to see them go.
good,"Fun place to work, had many opportunities to move throughout the technical organization and expand my skills.  Cannot assess current culture, typical day, or management team."
good,Job security was based more on production needs. The jobs are easy to learn and the hours are good. Vacations are hard to get but the benefits are worth it compared to other jobs in that county.
good,"Very professional and responsive management, and respectable compensation.  If you exercise hard work it does not go unnoticed.  Extensive layoffs were my key concern with staying.  It can be a very long time before you are immune to the layoffs."
good,great place to work but company was downsizing co workers were great
good,"Never got to see family as much, worked 7 days"
good,"As an intern, not much was expected.  However, I was able to witness how a manufacturing facility should run.  Quick changeovers and structured communication from strong matrix organization."
good,monitor freezer operation and maintain freezer equipment. i most enjoyed the coworkers bright and helpful attitude. management was organized.
good,Learned something new every day and they have amazing employees who are willing to work with you to ensure you deliver results.
good,"This is a great company with many great people however there is little to no opportunity for advancement if you are in field sales. Very poor managers who are in their position due to their advanced degree as opposed to praticle ability. It is a company in flux that has lost the vision of their best asset, their people."
good,"That was a hard job, everything has to be right(weight,water,spices,color ect.) but I really liked it."
good,Working on various internal design assignments from conception thru
good,"Provides management training to employees,"
good,I liked working there but every year as a seasonal employee you will be laid off. They work the seasonal employees seven days a week for like 2-3 months straight.
good,To work at Campbell Soup you must give up all weekends off . They  Work 7 days a week 365 days a year and you are expected to be there ! You have to use vacation days to get time off .
good,Campbells is a great place to work! If you’re the type of person that likes to work a lot that’s the job for you ! The pay is great also ! The people are friendly and if you need help they’ll always help you!
good,"Campbell soup is a great place to work. Meet great, caring, and amazing people. if you need a helping hand there is always someone there for you. like a big family."
good,"Campbell's has a great headquarters, hours, compensation, and people. Many employees stay with the company for decades and a privileged to professional growth."
good,This was my first job in a manufacturing environment. Exciting and impressive operation. I was able to grow into my position and developed a solid foundation for my career.
good,"Early morning arrival - 6:30 AM,  morning meeting preparations, Team meetings, reviews with external vendors and strategic suppliers, lunch at my desk, strategy sessions with various departments, close of day and review of following days priorities."
good,"I was introduced,trained in areas such as warehouse,filling,labeling. i learned hoiw to run a machine that put labels on the can products, i ran a machine that put lids on products, I learned how to drive tow motor in warehouse. The hardest part of the job was working in a heated environment. The most enjoyable was the job consisted of only working seasonal, 6 months on 6 months laid-off, good pay . work culture was alot of hard-working people from different backgrounds."
good,"Really great people to work with who were helpful most times."
good,"Work 8 hrs a day depending on production need with overtime available"
good,Point system was short .I learned how to weigh vegetables for each barrel .some of the work is easy . managers there was great to work with. The best part about the job was you always get hours.
good,I had a good time there and it made the day go by faster. Relaxed but getting your tasks done is #1. Like the work environment. One of the big cons is how the union doesn’t do their job well.
good,Campbell Soup was a well experience job but it was a slow paced for me. I'm used to working in a fast paced environment with keeping myself busy. It's not a guarantee that you would be hired permanent.
good,"Worked there for 27 years. I was laid off with 500 other representatives back in July of 2011 . Good company to work for."
good,Not a bad place to work for the money. only major dis-advantage is Campbells Hr department in very unorganized and not very supportive or their employees especially if you work in the container department. Which gets treated like campbells step children in my opinion Im sure a lot would agree.
good,"Pietro's Pizza Parlors bought our Grizzly Bear, Inc. for the 50 locations they had in the Pacific Northwest. They wanted another distribution path for their soups. Because they didn't get the level of soup distribution they desired, they eventually sold most of their locations to Abbey's Pizza."
good,"Fast filling and packaging operation that was dedicated to manufacturing soup 24 hour operation.  Workforce was consistent, rural environment difficult to raise a family that comes from city life style"
good,"Productive, good place to work, seasoned employees make job learning and training difficult for beginners being there not team players."
good,"Plant close all sorts of people made lots of friends was sorry to see it close. Worked tomotoe buildig, cook, filler operator fast past learn a whole lot from different departments"
good,"Worked with distributors to ensure all best practices were followed and assisted them to grow sales in HEB, Walmart and Target locations in Central Texas."
good,Great if you enjoy fast paced environments and great responsibility. Having self-initiative  is a must. There are lots of opportunities for performing tasks outside your comfort area or area of expertise.
good,On a sit down moving loading or unloading trailers with forklift. Co workers are friendly easy to learn just have to pay really good attention in how to receive pallets.
good,Great training grounds
good,a typical day at work consist of a meeting and then going on the floor to work. The job is very layed back you have very little contact with other people. a very good clean place to work. I would recommend it to a friend.
good,Relationship based company.  It's really about who you know that will help you get ahead.  There are lots of opportunities.  People are quite friendly.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Campbell's.  The company treated me very well, but benefits I took for granted as an older worker were getting skimpier for newer employees.  If you were ambitious and willing to work hard you can advance, but you have to make the opportunities yourself.  Some Managers less likely to advance a good employee so as not to lose them from the department; short-sighted thinking."
good,My experience with Campbell's Soup was a pleasant one. The only disadvantage is not knowing whether you will make your probationary period and not knowing if you will be called back.
good,Learned a lot of new skills and ways to figure out solutions. Good experience if you enjoy working for a large scale company. There are a lot of resources readily available.
good,"Run and adjust to make the line machines put out better products, always something new learned from outside venders to internal situations. As team leader, running the line with just the right support from upper management, not to much hassling, allowing me to do what I am there to do. Everyone seems to get along very well, always smiling and waving co workers. Can get tough if multiple machines start acting up, have to narrow down high priority and then work your way down the line. The good definitely out weighs the bad in all aspects, could ask for any more of a great atmosphere."
good,"Company used a 3PL provider for frozen finished product distribution. Onsite were five(5) company FTE's to manage inventory and transportation. It was a challenge, at times, to meet sales / customer demands but we did and were recognized for our results."
good,"Non-merit based culture, relationship-based environment. Does not promote MBA's. Very poor succession planning.  Old culture struggling to update and rediscover itself, to date, without much success."
good,"Great pay, but hard to balance life and work when you work 7 days a week. Not all year but during soup season with is 6-7 months a year. Hard to balance. Great people to work with, just a extended part of your family since your there so much."
good,"I was a seasonal worker. It was very fast work and hot. We were making V-7 which is everything put into V-8 juice before tomato harvest. My foreman was a good man, my team was pretty good also. Very warm in the factory, but you were kept hydrated and the breaks were fair. If you are a model employee, you will be asked to stay past late November to cover vacations in the warehouse. You may then be kept all the way until late January in the worldwide supply warehouse. I did all of that and my GM was a very proper and decent man. There were crabby, long tenured employees, but most of them were helpful and happy. They have a great company store too. Rare for a seasonal worker to get a full time position, but if you are chosen hang on to the job. It is steady, the benefits are good and the pay is good and you can retire well from here. The work is never super hard and as long as you meet expectations everyone is happy."
good,There are some really great people that partner to develop productive teams to handle the challenges that occur when growing a business. The challenge was to align on gross functional goals to get everyone working in the same direction. When alignment was achieved there was a great sense of success in meeting the goals.
good,"Great company with good values, the company is very heavy in upper management with can tend to be a bad thing especially when trying to push things through the work flow system"
good,"The day starts with a cross over meeting so I can transfer the issues from the leaving shift to the incoming shift. Specific jobs were distributed to help the day run and others would be scheduled to preventative maintenance or corrective work. I have learned to relax, listen fully to what is said before jumping to conclusions. The management in the Sacramento made several promises that would never come true. My co-workers worked well together to ensure the best outcome in OEE and safety daily. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a manager that was so full of himself that no one else mattered. I did enjoy the part of making it to a manager position, I worked for several years and went back to school to achieve a degree."
good,"Day revolved around keeping production flowing, answering trouble calls, performing work orders. Some good and some not so good, just like any other place."
good,"Campbell Soup has a very safe working environment. They are constantly working on improvements for safety and ergonomics for the employees. They have a well established moto, “The way we work.” They stand behind this by implementation of specific standards such as HPO. Campbells has a Lock Out Tag Out policy that is established in all departments and is strictly enforced."
good,Campbells treats their employees fairly and rewards them very well. For folks in the dood development and manufacturing industries its a wonderful place to make a career
good,"Worked for Campbell Soup for 37 years and it was a very good decision for me. "
good,I have learned how to drive a fork lift and work very well at the hoppers. I learned how to work well with others in a very big work place. It exciting to have another chance to be working again in such environment.
good,performed quality inspection of finished Campbell Soup /juice products Documented information for all pre-shipped  and shipped products loaded &unloaded
good,It was a good place to work at considering the area. Supervision needs work but overall a great place to work at. It was a fast paced environment but at times it slowed down.
good,"Working at Campbells is busy hours, but great pay. Great breaks, great people, easy work. I would stay and work there longer but I do not like being laid off, and you never know if you will be laid off or hired in. I need consistency and security."
good,This is a good job all in all. My typical day at work consists of me coming in and diving right in to my work. I have learned a lot since I have been here. The hardest part was getting back on a forklift and learning to drive backwards all night.
good,".  Electrician AA – technician.  Maintained all plant systems & equipment.  Including instrumentation and RF heat equip. work with raw and finished product shipping, cooking.  Can mfg filling, cooking and sealing. 76-78"
good,"Campbell's is a good company that is undergoing a great transformation due to surmounting pressure from external forces of the industry. As a result, Campbell's is forced to sacrifice many of the values and perks it had for its employees in order to be competitive."
good,"Nice place to work, the people you work with are overall very friendly and nice. The plant is very clean and easy to maneuver in."
good,"I loved being the backup person, when there was any help needed."
good,"Good company to work for, loved the time I was there. One job you just did not mind going work too."
good,"Good place to work, learned a lot while there. Left because of talk of closing the plant."
good,Pros
good,"It was a great place to work. I loved my job and my team members. A typical day is running a can line making cans for the company. I enjoyed it very much it was really physically draining at times. There was a lot on the the operator, i tried to learn everything that i could and i enjoy learning new things."
good,Keeping  busy. Working 12 hrs a day all week & 7 hrs on the weekend. It was a very hard job.Having a job.always keeping busy. Moving pallets  to around.
good,"My position was a contract position in customer service. I was to shadow someone to learn the position. This person was there Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday morning and then went on vacation. The backbiting from coworkers was, I felt, unreasonable. No one's job was in jeopardy. Only the overtime pay ended when a contract person was hired. My immediate supervisor was also new so, perhaps I expected too much.  This position requires someone to be able to do the job and suffer the verbal abuse of coworkers who have been there for many years and regret never having received training. The formal training from another department, was very good. They were also available if something unusual came up that wasn't part of the training.  They answered if they could or, directed if they couldn't.  I learned new systems; SAP, Transplace, OmPrompt and Skype. I am sure this training will be helpful to me in the future. I met many good people at Campbell's.  I wish all of them well."
good,"Worth it, though the day to day life can be hard or easy depending on your operators.  The place pays well and it is really repetitive work. A lot of silly adult drama in the factory too"
good,I like the meetings we have in regards to our work schedule before we hit the floor. It gives me a layout of what I need to do on my behalf and gives the team a layout of what we need to do as a whole.
good,"Great benefits but pay is average (they say they ""overpay"" for performance aka. bonus). Great work-life balance. Trying to be a progressive culture but not there yet. Stable place to work but won't be the most exciting job you've had."
good,"Good company, good compensation and benefits.  Team based environment.  Very involved in the local community.  Opportunity for advancement if you wish to advance."
good,"Campbells was a great place to work, it offered great wages and benefits. It employed alot of people for such a small community it was sad when it closed down.."
good,Great company.  Learn alot of new skills and ment some great people along the way. I look forward to meeting more friendly and happy appreciative people in a great work enviorment.
good,The hardest part of the job is when each season comes around. You have to be able to be flexible within your personal life to manage the summer season.
good,Perfect way to gain knowledge of the CPG industry. No day ever the same with challenges that are fun to learn from to gain great results.
good,"Nice environment, very professional. Well equipped labs for efficient work. Good benefits. I had a lot of responsibilities and was well regarded by my colleagues."
good,making sure production had the right ingredients and on time. work at a steady pace and always keeping safety first. letting management know whats going on in the work areas. whats working and whats not working and all the safety problems. talking to your fellow co-workers about work and being respectful at same time. trying to keep everybody on the same page. trying to work and to be safe at all times. making sure everybody goes home safe and coming to the end your shift.
good,"Campbell Soup Company has moved the Chatham location to Toronto.  "
good,"Overall great place to work at, they paid for my education and the salary was great.  The company also offers flexible hours which is great for families with small children and a day care on the premises."
good,"Responsible for daily operations of the 2nd and 3rd shifts which included Outbound, Inbound and storage of more that 5 million cases of product. I have enjoyed the past 5 years learning growing with such a wonderful organization that encourages growth. I think the toughest part of my job is during the busy months when I need to balance the daily operations of two shifts which can have up to 70+ members. This is also what I enjoy about my job because it challenges me and keeps me constantly working on how to improve my business."
good,"A typical workday is shipping/recieving product to go into the marketplace, and motivating employees to have good work ethics. Its important for the day to day operations flow smoothly each day."
good,The work culture is great and room for advancement  I wish they had west coast presence . The company supports work life balance. I would recommend anyone to work here.
good,Clock in and know what products are running and look and your schedule to know what is running and what will be running while you’re there.  Safety is always first so make sure you always have your PPEs.
good,Its really a very good place to work the people around are very helpful at all times don’t have to do nothing that you wouldn’t wanna do I would recommend for other to join
good,"Campbell Soup was a good company to work for"
good,"Fun first job, as I remember.  Was treated well, good workplace culture - provided good training and treated fairly.  Fun workplace environment and everyone enjoyed being there."
good,"Great company. Productive environment, good benefits, good employee recognition. Excellent training programs, very good at people's safety and environmental programs."
good,Great experience working for CPB.  Management can be a bit hierarchical at times but you will learn a lot.  Benefits are really good.  If you travel the T&E is very fair.
good,This company was ahead of its'time with regard to new mother services.  It also was very understanding with regard to the need for flexible work schedules.  The supervisor had rejection rights.
good,Enjoyed working there. It was home for the last 19 years. Felt like family. But due to the reorganization of the company my position was eliminated. My position was to insure the site leader and myself followed the permits to the letter. I worked hand and hand with state compliance officers regional and central. We created an environment where the state would ask if they could bring new employees to our facility.
good,Great place to work. Need more pay and hours . Need things to do for summer it gets slow. Overall I have learned a lot working here and gained a lot of knowledge
good,"I loved working at Stockpot. As a division of Campbells Soup they had great benefits and we had a mostly great leadership team. The director of HR was a bit of a dud, but the rest of the team was pretty great."
good,i haven't been with the company in years.   I cannot talk to the leadership of the company or work atmosphere.  I can only say that i enjoyed my time with the company when i worked there.
good,Alot of hours but no full time positions this is a fast paced job with little to no on the job training available. If you are willing to learn light maintenance on your line there are people who will show you what u need to do to make your line more productive with less down time waiting on maintenance.
good,"Strong organization with strong leadership and outstanding performance legacy.     Strong HR culture,   talented people that seem work collaboratively together"
good,Big global company. Very American. I left because I wanted more global exposure. It is a big brand. Everyone in the company has a sense of pride for the brand.
good,a typical workday was usually 8 hours. 8 hours of productive work which was rather balanced out. Employees worked together on completing their task for the day. I enjoyed the job I just didn't feel i was getting anywhere with the salary I was receiving.
good,Campbell Soup was a fun and exciting company to work for with some exceptional employees. Team work was a must and great learning environment. Highly recommend
good,The hardest part of working here was the lack of communication by the management. I was placed in a temporary position as a material handler but once the permanent employer came back they released me
good,"Meeting intensive"
good,This was a pat time position and my first job working in the food industry and was the most enjoyable job and company that I have ever worked for. It did end due to changes in the company going in a different direction and they told CROSSMARK to hire me if they wanted their business and I ended working their for the past 22 plus years.
good,Great place to work I would go back if I still lived in that state...Great place to work I enjoyed it but had to move from that state to this state I had to
good,My employer for 30+ years. This is a top grade company with top notch people. They are truly diverse. Flex hours make this a company job to look forward to.
good,"Its a nice place to work, the hours arent bad. and the work is easy at best. just take the tume to do your job and enhoy the people you work with. plus theres alot of parking."
good,This was a great job I wish I never left got 40 hours a week plus benefits. They had their own store in the front so that you can purchase their products at a cheaper price. The hard-working that I did at this company allowed me to move up and experienced many different jobs in the side of the company I was working. I had the opportunity to make the noodles for chicken noodle soup I have the opportunity to work every slurry in the building I had the opportunity to drive forklifts for many years I like this company but I just had to move away from the area that it was in
good,"Nice place to work for. They are well for helping others and letting different agengies and other come in, and make use health in better way .charity all over i would love be part of the team . I was a temp under ToHawk"
good,The work place was filled with good energy the hours was good for everyone and everyone got along with each other i would recommend anyone to work at Campbell soup and if I could I would go back asap
good,"Campbell Soup is a great place to work.  Very team oriented and a great atmosphere to learn."
good,really enjoyed working here nice company and co workers just couldn't do second shift.Other than that its a good place to work hours are great.

good,i worked in so many diffrent departments here so i got to learn alot from casepacking to labeling to filling products to quality inspector i worked with chemicals and did enjoy the people the hardest part was the force of overtime i got to learn how to use read therometers for the cooking machine did more in the bowl line
good,A typical day at work would be to start off with an employee meeting in your designated area to talk about what was going on and the orders that were to be shipped out for the day.
good,Enjoyable workplace with talented employees that are all passionate about the job they do. Benefits are great. Learned a lot of sales data after coming into the position with little to no experience. Willing to train.
good,"I loved my time there as an employee, I have learned things that I can take with me to my new place of employment and be a safer, more productive employee , and the experience and knowledge of the new machines and programs was a plus, along with all the new regulations in the food industry I know will only make me better for someone's company in the future , it was a great learning experience that I will take with me for life."
good,"I had a great time working for Campbells, even if only as a contractor.  Nothing beats working on a project that ends up becoming a produce in the supermarket that you know had a hand in making.  Some great people to work with there, too."
