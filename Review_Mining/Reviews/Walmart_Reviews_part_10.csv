rating,review
good,"We pushed carts from parking a lot to in the store every day nothing more, it boring jobs."
good,Wal Mart is everything you heard about it. They treat everyone the same. They could pay a little more but other than that Wal-Mart is a pretty balanced place to work
good,Overall it was a good experience there and some wonderful coworkers and just a friendly place helping customers with the best service.
good,"If you enjoy being with the public, it a great place to work. Many interesting things that happen at wal-mart. AS long as you have a good management team all things are possible"
good,I liked working at walmart but when it comes to work and the balance of family and school I do not think that they work well with schedules. The pay is good and the benefits offered were ok. The only problem was I had to quit because I was not getting home until 1am in the morning after picking her up from the sitter and my daughter was starting school and it was just to much at the time.
good,They would frequently run out of bags especially the very small and very big bags. When we needed those sizes most we wouldnt have any. Sometimes shelves werent organized and things were everywhere and not very appealing to customers.
good,A fast and fun place to work at.May be able to get over time hours
good,"The management is amazing. You get along with everyone. "
good,"The staff is amazing. You get along with everyone. Although, when it comes to personal problems that makes you skip a day or two of work, they are not considering anything. First time ever that it happened to me. It’s too bad cause it was a good place."
good,Por escrito psicetrico preguntas capciosas y de conocimiento
good,"I worked at Walmart for many years starting off as a kart pusher. That was horrid. Kart pushers are treated like slaves by management."
good,My experience has not been terrible but there are things that aren't where they need to be it seems managment is more competing with other managers that it often confuses and concerns other employees
good,Es buen trabajo por el horario pero el salario no es bueno
good,Good people caring gives back to the community helps when u need it carried groceries out for u when needed the costumer is always right and pharmacy pays good money
good,"A typical work day at Walmart was a busy day, especially holidays. There was always something to do and it was fun meeting new people everyday. The atmosphere was friendly and many people did their part."
good,It wasn’t bad I liked it. They did well with training to make sure you know what’s expected. They continue to do training videos every so often. Managers were mostly nice. Opportunities to cross train for different departments.
good,"My work days were always very busy. I learned how to use a register to a higher extent, handle returns in customer service and the money center. I was also in charge of organizing departments throughout the store. "
good,I love working for Walmart and I been there 5 years but I want to move up and Walmart not help me do that.i love Walmart and I’m great at my job as a cashier and customer Service and I help with doing Csm and that is customer service management
good,"You can learn to sharpen your customer service skills while making connections with not only the customers, but your co-workers as well. Working here will also help with your organization skills and ability to multi-task."
good,It was a great working experience for it being my first job but they rushed me to get my job done and when I did finish early they would tell me help someone else
good,Productive workplace and enjoyed employee's I worked with along with the customers.  They did not except document from doctor reports that could important.
good,"I worked there more then once and all the times I worked there it was different you have different managers including store managers as of this time it has changed so much that I don't know if i would go back again. While I was there I learned a lot and met some great people so it is something I am greatful to have,"
good,I love working with some of the people I did. I feel like they are great at working you up... but they drop the ball at a certain point. I've had some amazing managers. But I've had terrible ones too. Theres never an in between.
good,It all depends on Managements capability and the small stores out in the country are way easier than the more densely populated stores.  The biggest problem is Walmart hires anyone so half the people you work with screw up your good work.
good,"Be proactive in your career movement, plan a path to where you want to be in the company. Plenty of opportunities to advance "
good,Management Team and communication could be a lot better. Probably care a little more about customers than trying to take care of associates and following policies.
good,As a whole I like the job. I just want to do something different with my career! But the benifits are great and the environment is pretty good overall!
good,"Peu avoir beaucoup de clients..."
good,hay buen ambiente de trabajo aparte todos los dias te dan pan y cafe gratis los viernes es dia de desayuno gratis te exigen como en todoos los trabajos
good,"no, you get yelled for doing the smallest thing, it swtiches up everyday. Not recommended highly, Your a punching bag for managers that don't do anything."
good,I started from July 2019 to September 2019. My responsibilities include making sure that carts were returned to the proper position in the store. It was a part time job.
good,A typical day would consist of helping costumers with their needs. i would restock shelves and make sure the store was kept nice and neat. i also would work in hardware mixing paint.
good,"The managers were great,the co-workers were fantastic.working there was amazing I was able to learn how to use a pallet jack and many other things, the customers were always so happy when they left."
good,They do not value employees in a sense that standing up 8 hours needs more than 2 -15 min breaks and  1 hour lunches they should do 30 min lunches and 4 - 15 min breaks so legs and back don't tire out so bad.
good,When i was hired i thought to myself theres room on the ship but after a while i didnt realize how small the boat was and how many associates are on board.
good,"minha avaliaçao foi Justa , com o que a empresa me Oferece , porem como disse sou intermitente e nao tenho a quantidade de dia certo trabalhado , quero algo que eu possa ter certeza do meu pagamento todo final de experiencia, porem a Empresa e boa pra Trabalho tanto rm grupo quanto individual"
good,My day consists of make sure our customers get what they needed. I learned a lot with cooking and baking and the importance of a clean environment. The management was great and the environment was peaceful.
good,Its walmart. Youll be asked to do everything in the store. Can be fun at times. The work isnt hard but the customers can be difficult to deal with at times. Alot depends on the associates you work with
good,This job is good it really wants you to have open availability. It's very good for management. The pay is very bare minimum though which is minimum wage depending on where you are and the razors are not very good.
good,It's a good place to work but the pressure they put on you sometimes is just overbearing and the direction they give is somewhat confusing but ones you here for a while it's becomes earlier.
good,l'aspect le plus agréable de mon poste est de travailler avec une équipe dynamique
good,Wal-Mart has played a huge part in the man that I am today. It helped me improve social skills and really helped me pretty much master the art of patience.
good,"I worked there for a while, as a CSM, and I was frequently bullied by another CSM, and nothing was ever really done about it. I struggled at work because of it and management ignored it. I felt the environment for me was terrible. But to each their own. Maybe it will work better for someone else."
good,"Days consist of standing at a register for 2 hours + at a time which an insane about of customer flow into the store. You rarely get time to rest and relax, constantly working."
good,Its a great place to work and advance very quickly great benefits and bonus after a certain time frame team work and stay organized .Gets the job done on time
good,Walmart is a fairly good company to work for benefits are great but there is a lack of communication a lack of understanding use to be family oriented the pay is great but the house sucks
good,"Being an overnight stocker might be a little difficult when you barely start. But when you learn how everything works, it becomes extremely easy. But the hours might be a little difficult if you're not used to overnight. Overall a decent experience."
good,I really liked working here always learning new things. Great co-workers. During the trial period found out I was pregant and you can only call off so many days. They wouldn’t understand I couldn’t come in when I had morning sickness and couldn’t help me work around that.
good,"Friendly staff for the most part, though usually understaffed."
good,"Buen horario y trabajo estable, cansado por la actividades que se llevan"
good,"I love the co workers and management.  But they are still about the numbers.  So if you're struggling with your productivity, you can get written up to a certain amount of times to the point of getting fired. But if you talk to the manager, they will sit down and discuss the issues that effect your productivity and retrain you.  After all training, your productivity is still low you will get fired."
good,Respect for the individual needs alot of improvement . Very fast paced friendly staff. Shoppers are messy disrespectful which reflects on the Associates
good,"They have good benefits, they just don’t offer a full fourth hours a week for you to make enough money to live without having a second job. If you’re not management you don’t make much at all"
good,One thing constant about Walmart is change.  One must stay up to date and be a student of the business in order to succeed.  Technology is emphasized as well.  Knowledge of handheld devices helps to set you apart from your peers.
good,The job teaches you good life lessons and how to budget your money. You learn good leadership and life lesson on how to deal wit people. The culture of the place is based off great customer service.
good,"Need better communication and the co workers are okay to work with. You have to have boundaries when working there.Some managers care some don’t,they try to work you to death."
good,When i first got the jobob i was happy. But the pay didnt fit. I was unloading trucks first 4 hours 1-3 a day. I always took the hardest job so we would get it done. But when my time for a raise to come it was pennies. And that was after a year there. It just didn't go good after that. I felt unappreciated.....
good,"Full time associates get amazing benefits and they provide great opportunities for associates with perfect attendance. But the management is very picky and choosey. They don't do interviews to promote even though anyone can apply for any promotion. They already have a person picked in their head and they choose them, even if you were more qualified."
good,You’ll have max 5 occurrences and PTO you could use on your occurrence. As a stocker I had to hurry and finish with all pallets and carts if not finish I would have to tell the support manager. It’s best to finish everything and rush so everyone wouldn’t stare at you and talk. Other than that I hated the pay it’s not worth the pay in my opinion.
good,A typical work day is not that busy and there’s always a task to complete. Usually restocking is the main task but sometimes aisles have to get moved around. Management was amazing at my Wal-Mart at least.
good,If I were to work at Walmart again I would be more specific about the hours I can work. Walmart does give there employee’s nice amount of hours but most of the time they aren’t easy to work with you to make you’re schedule fit your time into everyday life.
good,I would recommend newcomers to stay on their toes . The same goes for the experienced ones. Especially in Apparel. It may seem like the most simple of the jobs there but don't let your guard down.
good,unloading the truck was a pain cause it gets hot in the trailers and being fast paced in stacking the items onto pallets that can be moved without being wrapped
good,Scheduling was a little crazy..didnt like the flip flop between days and nights. Good people. Good work atmosphere..nothing bad to say..just got a little..tedious. easy but boring to just stand
good,If you can work fast it’s a great job for you . They pay on time . Just the production rate is really high for the order fillers so if keeping pace they let you go . But well worth the money
good,I'm a cashier and we can't just take a break when our bodies feel sore and like we are gonna fall out.I'm a diabetic and sometimes my sugar drops down and I need a sweet and can't get it.were only allowed water up front I also have extremely low potassium and sodium levels and when they fall I stay to get body cramps if it gets to bad I go to er and the have to put those into me threw iv.
good,"Walmart, empresa que valoriza fornecedores, clientes e colaborados com uma politica interna preestabelecida."
good,"Overall a good place to work, good pay and benefits.   Culture difficult to explain or adjust to in a short period of time.   Work week exceeds 50 hours most weeks and exceeds 50 hours during specific periods."
good,High paced and demanding company. Room to advance but limited in options unless you want salary and management. Required workload is overwhelming to some.
good,i would not ever recommend anyone to go and work at the lake city walmart the supervisors just dont give two craps about how the employees feel they just care about the store being done. the managers has no common sence what so ever.
good,Walmart would be a great place to work for if they pay the people what they're worth instead of having a set pay for each position because some people do all the work and others don't do Hard Any
good,"I like my job, I only wish that we had stronger management. As a stocker I always end up fixing another s work. This should not be, especially when they have been identified! We have stockers who put things anywhere and management knows, but say nothing. Only tell us, FIX IT."
good,"lots of opportunities for advancement but high turnover rate. liked working there, hours were okay and the pay is pretty cool also overtime during holidays. but sometimes you have to deal with shifty management and favoritism. also if you call ethics there’s supposed to be no retaliation but it’s there."
good,"Empresa exemplar, muito bom local para trabalhar."
good,"A typical day at work would be stocking boxes or unloading the truck for a hours, the management was ok, they were somewhat flexible with the schedule but we were short staffed"
good,Walmart was tough and at times really stressful and annoying. However I can honestly say its definitely a work environment of learning and building as a 1st time job. Walmart teaches you how to work smart and safe while learning lots of different aspects/job duties that can help with various other jobs or can be put onto your resume.
good,"The only reason I'm leaving is the pay I do the same stuff as support manger does but dont get pay for it"
good,"Work at Walmart starts in the break room, with a breakdown of our positions for the night. The job of running the freight is not too terribly difficult, so we switch positions and areas around the store. As long as you know the basics, every area is easy. The main trick is just to match the barcode with the price tags. We go to our areas and stock the shelves with what has already been brought out by CAP 2. We just go through one box at a time. Most of the time, we'll try to down stack the pallets for each aisle, just to make the work simpler. We run freight until 1:30 am, where we go outside for a half hour to clear the lot and bring all of the carts in. Once we come back, we keep running our freight until 5. We stop at 5 and begin zoning, which is where we pull all of the stocked goods toward the front of the shelves so everything looks nice and full. Management is really kind here; they know everyone by name and want to make sure that everyone is accommodated. I really enjoy the people I work with, and we all laugh and joke. The job culture itself is fairly fast paced, but the work is easy and quick to pick up on, so the fast pace makes the night go fast."
good,Stressful no room for mistakes no growth overall it can be fun but its rapidly becoming a job that you don't want to stay at for very long. There is a culture of promotions going to the who you know not what you know
good,A day at Walmart was actually decent . When you clock in you get right to it . Walk around and grab the items that popped up in my scanner and I would place them in my carts. Take them to the time slots and the person would come pick up their groceries. The management was okay except my manager liked to put information out about people in front of customers and coworkers. The hardest part of the job would be the part where if we didn’t have a specific item we would substitute and sometimes there weren’t really good substitutes for a specific item.
good,Walmart is an ok company to work when you are younger and trying to make a little cash but other than there hours are not that great and sometimes it’s hard to live off what u make
good,"I think Walmart is an okay place of employment for a first job, if you're a young person still living at home with your parents and have no bills to pay.  If you're an adult with a family to feed like I am, you will be in bad shape, because you are literally living hand to mouth and paycheck to paycheck."
good,Where do I start.... I left because management sucks. The benefits we're good. They did provide food sometimes. You could wear anything you wanted but you had to wear a Walmart vest.
good,"Walmart is a very tough job and it requires a lot of strength and endurance to keep up with the work they assign you. While the management's are usually nice people, they can get rough and unfair at times. You’re expected to do work at the exact time frame you are given or else you’ll be in bad shape."
good,Walmart has a great job security plan for their students to work while still going through school almost guaranteeing their job when they come back. The atmosphere is quite pleasant with majority of associates/managers demonstrating a positive attitude towards one another and customers. Walmart allows its associates to build retail experience and customer service experience as well as applying safety handling quick time problem solving.
good,"It's a pretty cool job with a pay of 11 plus pay force. Good as a in-between job. Also, the job is very flexible with your schedule especially if you're in school."
good,It was a good job but they started working me hours I couldn't work because of school. I looked working there even though it was always hot. I would definitely recommend if transportation isn't an issue.
good,"Walmart is a diverse working environment. Plenty of options for job placement. And is a good place too balance, family life. Pay rate needs to be higher."
good,I love my job there. It has had it's ups and downs. The workload is great and challenging. Co workers have helped me learn a lot of lessons about team work.
good,"I liked when I got paid every other Thursday, very friendly co-workers. Also, I liked the most were the discounts received for the holidays, t'was a good x-mas!"
good,"OK place to work.  Highly competitive.  Ability to advance career.  Multiple benefits including 401k, stock, paid time off, discounts, etc............."
good,They have pretty decent pay. The only downfall with walmart is there point system and the fact that they don't take doctors excuses. I wouldn't recommend this job is you don't think you can go without calling out and things of that nature.
good,"I find my experience at Walmart to be pretty fair. I've met some of the most amazing people in my life so far,  As a Trans individual, I've had my ups and downs. Generally having to explain my situation several times over after the average ""he said she said"" occurs. Many finding out I was trans soon after being hired with me only speaking in confidence to the hiring manager. So discrepancy was an issue. "
good,They offer help with schooling. Can be flexible with sick days and important events. They paid $11 an hour 6 to 8 hours 5 days a week with two 15 minute breaks and a whole hour lunch in between. I really enjoyed the work environment as well.
good,Walmart is quite fast pase but is wonderful to work for. They are always intrested in helping others. Changes often in technique..there for never boring. Over all a pleasent place to work for.
good,If you are a friend of management it's perfect and you can advance quickly.  If you are a hard working and dedicated to your job there's a desire to keep you where you are even if you want to be promoted.  They definitely have flaws in management.
good,Walmart is a good place to stay with and build a career. The company has very good benefits for its employees and a good starting pay rate for new associates.  Any worker can move up in the company if that is what they choose to do.
good,"Walmart is one of those companies that everyone looks up to when they think of retail. It's your one-stop-shop for everything you need. Over here when you work, you really learn to communicate with everyone. From the customers you help, to your colleagues in your department to your colleagues who aren't in your department. You learn to communicate with everyone! Working as a Customer Service Manager, communication is KEY. You are the place people go to if they have questions about literally anything. You will also take much heat from customers if they are having a bad day so don't take it personally. This is also a place where you can make lots of friends! Everyone who works here is nice and often has a dope backstory!"
good,It was not a very good experience. For me it was very unorganized and not very helpful to customers. We didn't have enough room to do anything in my department let alone the whole store
good,They scheduling would sometimes become hectic when shipments were coming in. Because the store is so large and busy it was very difficult for my first week or two to find people to walk me through things.
good,"Wasn’t bad for a first job. Pretty relaxed job. Did get busy around holidays. Learn how to operate a sit down forklift, epj, and a walking stacker. Other associates that I worked with were great to be around."
good,It was a fun place to work in the beginning but with all the changes I feel that the changes will not benefit me in the long run.  I want to see what else is out there for me.
good,"Walmart is a great company and do offer great benefits. However your at the hand of people, if the Walmart store you work at has great employees and management you’ll most likely have the time of your life and enjoy everyday yet if the management is poor and the colleagues aren’t necessarily friendly, well it’ll turn into a job and you’ll feel more enslaved and working for each day instead of enjoying every possible day."
good,The schedule is a little hectic when you are a new associate but after a few months and a few adjustments by your department manager it can be a great place to work
good,"It is a difficult job, that allows you to have a life outside of the workplace. Their schedules range from 3-4 day weeks with a great deal of time off."
good,"Management didn't communicate enough with associates. I had a great time, loved my bosses, and had fun moving up the chain. But sadly after working there for a bit you realize management didn't always keep up. we had so many co managers come and go due to that fact. One would put someone in housing, then the other co manager would walk over and send you to help with consumables. Then close to the end of the night, they would realize they now had an empty area and no freight thrown. so they would send me in the last hour to knock out what i could. it was always a rush to finish and clean up. And always had to have people stay extra time to zone. But would then tell them to cut the extra hours they earned at the end of the week by taking 3 hour lunches and such. Great place to work if you want OT and are good with people. But poor managing of areas, and not allowing people to keep the money the earned is a big downfall. Not to mention most people cant meet standards when it came to stocking."
good,"I worked alot of overtime for the company when they asked me to work over and on my days off.  I was never paid for working overtime.  I was asked to join in sueing Walmart for unpaid overtime but I declined.  They cut my hours less than 16 hours a week, so I quit"
good,I worked for walmart for over ten years. Started out as an overnight stocker and I was able to work my way to a supervisory role within 2 years. Quickly moved to a Salaried leadership role within 4 years.
good,Walmart is a good place to work everyone is most of the time calm and it’s all good when you get your work done and you are also moving all the time it’s very fast paced once you do one thing you go to another and you get a hour unpaid lunch and 2 15 min breaks through out your shift .
good,Some mangers are terrible and prejudice high turnover rate in gulf shores Al alot of people were quiting or getting laid off all for the same reason management particular 3rd shift
good,"Walmart was a good place to work at for me, I didnt receive training due to the fact that we were short on people but the staff was amazing and the work wasn't that difficult."
good,I worked with some great people. I had fun. Always in my feet. I felt deli was one of the most fast Paste positions at Walmart. I enjoyed the people I worked with. But what I didn’t like. I was hired and marked as a part time employee but I worked a full 40 hrs a week.
good,Wal-Mart is an ever changing business and work environment with potential for anyone who would like an advancing career working with a dynamic team. This company is on the forefront in our current market and has an excellent business model for remaining engaged with the needs of a continuously changing economy.
good,"Very fast paced, always busy , work with a group or by yourself. We have a truck with freight every night so you fill the shelves every day. You need to be a self starter and need to be friendly to help people find what they need."
good,Walmart was a great company to work for they pay good and they have great benifits and they will work around your schedule. I got hired for seasonal and eventually became full time. They also have programs that help associates in need.
good,Walmart was a great but they had a lack of understanding with coworkers when it came to break time. They would let the ones they like do whatever but other than that it was a great job
good,I’ve learned to work with peers and stock and unloading trucks the experience was awesome I would love to do something like that agin in my life no matter the pay
good,I love working here just gettimg very Stressful and i feel like i won't be able to move up in the company. I love working in the mornings and having the set days off.
good,Could’ve been better but taught me a lot I learned how to work with other people and associate with customers and I had over a year of experience there
good,Its definitely one of the better retail companies to work for. Unfortunately holidays and weekends don't exist in retail and it can be difficult to get some good days off.
good,Checking out customers making sure everything was checked out and making sure the customer found everything they needed. Maiking sure the customer got all their things.
good,"An overall fun atmosphere to work in, however that is depending on your job title."
good,If you're looking for typical entry level job to begin working career in basic customer service it's a good Company to work for. Constant flow of customers in and out of workplace always calls for your service to help them find what they need when you're not busy or assistance is required.
good,"My typical day at work is stressful, fast-paced. With running between slicers and hot bar. Some days are better than others, but the job gets done. I like the people I work with the are easy going and fun to be around."
good,Most of the times when we came in we all had a meeting before we started work and then they let us all know what we was doing I told you what to do and we basically just stayed on it until we finish the job and then we got to go home afterwards
good,I personally did enjoy my job here for what it paid and what my duties and responsibilities were. The problem was how management handled everything. Any little mistake gets your written up (even if your not 100% liable). Also a lot of organization issues with assignment for the day. Plus You're only allowed 2 20 minutes breaks for working 10-12 hours shifts.
good,"The most enjoyable parts about the job are the happy customers that you may encounter. The rest is history. There were constant problems and situations arising, whether it was the associates, management, customers, or even vendors.The associates and management on the team I worked with made the job a little bit more worth having. I learned that there is never a such thing as too much patience when you are dealing with anyone that isnt yourself. A typical day as an APCH is basically preventing shoplifting, cleaning, and really running the area you are around."
good,"I miss working there, it's just management didnt know how to talk to employees and give direct orders. I had no cashiers to work graveyard. They just didn't hire them for that shift even though we took names and we found our own people to apply. They would say night shift is not available only day time."
good,Walmart is a great company to work for. It is also a secure job. The benefits are good along with their 401k plan. The only downside to Walmart is they do not have a retirement plan. You would have to invest into the 401k plan to have something for later on in your life. Walmart will match 100% of what you put into your 401k. I think that is a great thing that they do that for their employees. Some jobs will only match like 3%.
good,Had to chose a better life changing experienced job. I love all the people I worked with I just need something not so hard on my body where I can feel feel like I can continue my job duties.
good,Good benefits for the associates not the best management or scheduling. Customers are customers but the discount is cool. Availability to move up in the works and experiences good pay raises for full time employees.
good,Its not much too say bout thiss job you do a lot of heavy lifting we have 15-30mins meeting every night we oof every Friday and Saturday we rebuild counters we put shelves up and takevptoduct down amd put it back up and assist customers if they walk up and ask where sometjings is.
good,"You do get great benefits (discount card, breaks every 2 hours, 401k, etc.). However, unless you're overly friendly with management or know them personally, you're chances of moving up are slim to none."
good,"When I would have help on the job, it was a good day. There were some days that could've gone better (scheduling issues, call-ins) but management was always willing to lend a hand"
good,People and environment was great. But the work load work load and expectations greatly exceeds a realistic outlook.Overall working for Walmart was still a good experience.
good,I enjoyed working for them more management level than regual associate. Good benefits and perks. Loved meeting people this the job to be at. Customer service and being stocked is what this company about
good,"I would take out pallets, stock the shelves, graveyard is a tough shift, most of my days were spent sleeping till I had to get up for work. If you are a night owl this is the right fit."
good,"Management sucked, they never had your back , favoritism runs highly in that place. They will write you up for the same thing someone else does but doesn’t get in trouble, poor bonuses. PPTO policy sucks. Sedgwick sucks, constantly eliminating positions"
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart DC would look like: "
good,it is a great place to work that pays pretty well. Also has great benefits for working there. Easy jobs to do within the store only hard part is unloading the trucks.
good,I loved working for Wal Mart. They have the best customer service and The managers are always nice and helpful. The customers are the best people to encounter.
good,Wal-Mart is a great opportunity for high school graduates that are looking for experience in the retail industry.  They help with college fees and provide medical benefits.  A typical day at work would be best explained as busy and entertaining from customers and employees.  All employees learn the necessary tools needed to provide great customer service and the job duties needed to perform their jobs accurately.  Wal-Mart culture is very diverse. If trained properly their is no job that is to difficult to work because we insist on teamwork when a challenge arises.  At Wal-Mart you learn various job skills that allows you to perform productively.  You can learn a lot in the retail industry.
good,"When I worked at Walmart, I had no idea what to expect. However, to me it felt unfair that despite all of the past work experience I have had, I was hired to clean the store. Overall, I am glad I had an opportunity to work there, I just wish that I had more of a fair treatment."
good,"I enjoyed my time working as CSM. I mostly enjoyed working with my coworkers. I also loved serving a lot of our regular customers. Even though it is a great place to work, a lot of their policies need changing. Staffing became big problem, and the issue with theft was on a high."
good,"A typical day at walmart was always different for each position. Being a assistant manager overnights was always the same. I'd arrive @ 8pm and tour the store before relieving 2nd shift mgr. I'd print out my crew's schedule and assign their duties for the night. After our 10pm meeting, I'd go to the area with the most freight and help stock. After lunch I'd spend most of time cleaning up the backroom myself until 5am. Around that time I'd walk around the building to make sure the lot was clear of trash. At 5:30 is when my crew would clean up the areas they were assigned and starting zoning (cleaning and organizing the store) until it was time for them to clock out at 7am. Thats when day shift management would arrive and I would have to let them know what all has and hadn't been done as we toured the store to see what needed to be done that day in order to set 3rd shift up for a good night. Starting as a cashier 13 1/2 years ago to becoming a assistant manager has taught me alot. The hardest part of my job was always around inventory time. Working 60-70 hours a week to prepare the store for a good inventory was always the hardest. The best thing I loved about my job was my employees. Can't run a business without them and all their hard work."
good,Working at Walmart makes the day go by fast plenty of people to talk to and work with in the deli at least. Having the same task every day and getting into the routine its a bit monotonous.
good,"like what I do and they offer advancement and flexibility in schedules. "
good,es una empresa donde puedes obtener crecimiento laboral
good,"a very stressful place to work. much pressure put on stockers to complete too much work on time."
good,"Fast pace, friendly people, fast growing company, hard work, stressful, unsatisfactory, attendance policy horrible, great bonuses, awful store management"
good,"Em todo tempo que compus o quadro de colaboradores do Wall Mart sempre me senti parte integrante da equipe, sendo ouvido e tendo oportunidades de colocar minhas idéias em prática."
good,The job is not demanding it just includes many tasks that can be redundant yet they are simple to do.  Some of the employees do not act professionally or take initiative for simple things like taking out trash or being considerate of others.  The leadership has a few good co managers with potential for improvement however after many surveys and discussions I don not see any improvements being made.  If that was done they probably could hire more people as we are understaffed instead of continuously losing people.
good,Walmart really isn't a bad place to work. They pay decently. and have many different options for shifts. Managers are usually willing to work with you
good,"The pay was good at Walmart. Not great, but good. Sometimes it was difficult to get particular time off needed. Management sometimes made working there a difficult place to be."
good,"Managers have preferences.The work load is not equally splited.Womens don't do as much as men. Managers yell at associates constantly, and they don't listen to associates!"
good,"Upon arriving for work you walk into the back room to clock in after clocking in go to the lockers to see if there is a mc-40 (handheld) device available if there is check it out, if not go to your section and start unboxing the freight and working it on the shelfs."
good,"I've been with Walmart for a while now and honestly it alright but overwhelming alot of the time, hard workers with knowledge get little credit while new employees get promoted to keep wages down."
good,This was a cool job to and a great experience for me.But the one thing about what Walmart that was crazy was there point system I have never heard of that before.
good,"I greatly enjoyed my past experience and current experiences that I have encountered while being a Walmart Associate. It is a very fast paced environment but if you go to work and do your job to the best of your ability you will find success in working for them,."
good,you learn how to lead and the last store manager we had was fun to work for like any job theres issue if you learn to work for walmart you can work any retail theres alot to learn you just have to be willing
good,The company itself is great to work for. They offer a lot of training and advancement opportunities. You can make lifelong friends amongst coworkers. Opportunity to learn more than one position at a time to improve skills.
good,"Foi uma ótima empresa em que trabalhei e tive ótimas oportunidades de crescimento, recomendo para quem quer que esteja procurando recolocação no mercado."
good,The company is good and the job is not to hard. It is face paced and the management gets their stress levels really high and expects you to do more than you can reasonably do. If you can work hard though they leave you alone.
good,"Co-worked were fun to work with. Good timing lunch, would work as a team made the day's go by faster and smoother. Tried to keep everything organized for everyone else."
good,The one I worked at in the front end was full of friendly and understanding people in the front end.Overall it was a good experience for a first job and wasn't that bad
good,"i was there for a min not bad not good Wal-Mart , Los Angeles, CA — Cart Attendant"
good,"Boa empresa, cultura forte, respeito pelas pessoas."
good,"Time management "
good,Walmart is a good company to work for they have a good management team. They have flexible hours and holiday pay. They have great insurance plan but overall it a great company.
good,"Como toda empresa de grande porte,. com muitas possibilidades de crescimento, mas com falta de reconhecimento, da parte mais alta da gerencia em relação aos lideres e gerentes regionais, que impossibilita melhorias para funcionários da parte de baixo da piramide."
good,Great training is offered.  Love all the seminars.  Hourly associates were great.  Loved the travel and the staff.     treated people kindly                                                                                   days off given when needed
good,Its walmart. Its not some corporate office job at least not without a degree and many years of work. Overall it was a good job to have in the summer before i had to go back to school.
good,Walmart offered an enjoyable work place with endless advancement oppertunities.They offered an abundance of houres even for part time and provided an easy going work environment.
good,"I unloaded trucks every day. I would also stack freight on pallets, pulling pallets to the sales floor, stocking items on the shelves. I learned how to use a electric pallet jack, and walkie stacker."
good,Stressful majority of the time. Too much to do not enough time. Salary managers are expected to basically live there. Good money though. Company changes too much
good,I learned how people depend on you to do your part so the rest of they day could be smooth. It was easy to get associates to work with you as long as you was fair with them.
good,Only work there if u have to some of the ppl are friendly hours are some what decent management is ok to deal with and u get a 10 percent discount after 90 days
good,Have to be fast high labor fun people strict manager underpaid jobs treat you nice they love the customers almost same customers everyday get used to seeing the same people
good,"I appreciated the people there and what they did for the people, but the management had little to no idea what needed to be done on the day to day. A lot of easily avoidable mistakes with regards to overall resource management, as well as allocation made it harder then it should have been to conduct day to day operations- with many stalls, controllable and uncontrollable."
good,"I love working and helping customers,, I wish they had more hours to offer..And the management were more consistent,  I definitely would like to find a job similar."
good,I feel like as far as a job goes this is as normal as it gets. This is the kinda job you get when you're young or need something consistent. The benefits are a plus but it isn't something good for someone who has any commitments in life.
good,Besides the few coworkers who actually helped and were wonderful. I was often left with tons of work and no one else would help. I did everyone else’s job including mine. It was very stressful.
good,"Very busy store, Its a good job minus the clicks that can sometimes form just mind your own and work, get paid. Can gain alot of experience from walmart."
good,Working for Walmart was great work I worked for them for 4 years the process for getting hired was you could either do the job fairs that they have every once in awhile and bring your resume for that or sign up online for an interview and bringing your resume and if you got higher they'll give you a call back saying that you've been hired if you did not get hired they would still give you a call back letting you know that they're looking to go other ways
good,"Management was uncaring but the people i worked with were great. At the store, it was a rather easy and basic job, but when I worked at the distribution center, it was hard labor but paid well."
good,Very average paced job good coworkers can get pretty crazy around the holidays their were some managers that werent good to me in my personal opinion but for the most part i overall liked it
good,It's a slow pace work place. If you like slow pace then Walmart is right for you. You get a 10 percent discount after your 90 days. The hours are flexable
good,"For the overall size Walmart is, they should have the best health insurance plan in the country. They go through periodic restructional areas of the company downsizing its staff. A lot of people have lost their jobs during this process."
good,"I excelled quickly from cashier to Department Manager. Walmart always hires from within for management. "
good,"A typical day A work: Fast paced, A little relaxing and sometimes slow paced. "
good,Long line at my register. Time flies by also get tired of standing long hours. I learn how to work with the register and also learn a little about electronics. i say electronics is a challenge for me.
good,"I worked at Walmart for almost 25 years. I started as an hourly associate and worked my way to Co-Manager. In the beginning the company had more of a family atmosphere. When all of the local stores expanded to Supercenters that changed. In recent times the emphasis has shifted from taking care of the associates and customers to meeting goals established at the home office and running processes. Sometimes the processes interfere with properly helping customers. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was merchandising and planning seasonal events. The hardest part, especially for management was the lack of work/life balance. Taking your days off was discouraged in a indirect way. Executive visits were treated like armageddon was coming and 80+ hour weeks were common."
good,"Walmart is a an alright place to work. Some employees makes a career, when others make it just a job. Its all in the mindset of the person. Walmart change so frequently its almost hard to keep up. If you ever get employees, please n=be able to make the changes as well."
good,"I really  tried  hard to make it work, but my ears were so bad it didn't matter.  I  probably needed a medical notice to show them I had a serious problem."
good,"Learned a lot from this company, I do great with sales work now because of the selling environment. You can advance pretty quickly. Benefits were okay."
good,"There was no typical day at Walmart, always hard work but good pay.  The hardest part of the job was the long hrs of unloading shipments. The most enjoyable was working with my coworkers."
good,"- A normal day would include lifting and assembling metal shelving to set up the store. Very labour intensive but while working as part of a team."
good,At times it was hectic bit it was manageable but we had a hard working fast paced crew who we would get the job done and have the whole store zoned as well.
good,Walmart is a stressful work place if management does not like you at the same time you learn a lot about retail and how costumer service works all around it has its good sides and bad
good,"Great place to work, well organize inventory control is a great challange because u are responsible for mulitiable  departments,good people make the job easy with team work"
good,"Being a cashier isn’t the best position because your hours will be inconsistent. Maybe you’ll have a open schedule which is from 6am-11pm or 12pm and they’ll make you work from 3pm-12pm and then they’ll want you to come the next day at 6am. If you have a closed schedule and you don’t have many hours, well tough luck you would not be able to get more hours. If you’re used to getting around 38 hrs/wk and you’re cut down to 10 hrs/wk well it’s better to get a better job because management won’t  care and will tell you to open up your schedule."
good,I liked working there but the people were very clickish some very snobby. department store retail isn't my thing. i liked my job expect always having to rearrange the shelves and how they were displayed
good,Just was not hard just a little strict but i feel as if you need a little bit of strictness. The hardest part of the job was during the rush hour. A typical day was laid back.
good,"Ultimately it is what you make it.  Everyday I came to work with my best foot forward. There will always be things that can be improved as far as pay,more help to get the job done,etc. but I believe the major thing to keep in mind is to do your best and be the change you want."
good,"The best things to work at Walmart was the good management and security."
good,I wouldn't recommend this job to a mother or father that has small children this would not be a good fit if you have illness or personal things in life going on . Wal-Mart Distribution does not care.
good,"Everyday at Walmart was different, you were always working and helping people out. Wether they were customers or co-workers. It was a fast past environment."
good,"I was an ICS-Unloader at Wal-Mart, If you value your time with your family walmart is not the place for you with little pay. Hard to advance unless you have been there for a long time."
good,I really enjoyed working at Walmart they are very team oriented with works very well for me seeing as I work best in groups aim very assertive and self motivated
good,"I believe this job i mainly for first timers,college students and seniors who just want to work. i worked in a neighborhood market which was very stressful so i suggest a bigger Walmart"
good,"I was a cashier and met many new people. Although I wasn't too fond of my manager, we were able to work together efficiently. I enjoyed most of the time there, but developed peripheral neuropathy and had to resign."
good,Walmart was a good place to work. Management was always looking for ways to help employees improve for the chance to move up. Coworkers were awesome and very up lifting.
good,"not enough help to get your job done, poor management, great benefits, poor morale, stress is very high, have to work all holidays, paid time off after 90 days"
good,"I was based in the Garden Center, and the manager responsible for that portion of the store was excellent. However, things can get disorganized quickly, and sometimes you're pulled form your location to help elsewhere, so you fall behind."
good,"Working there for the amount of time I did, I didn't have one manager that knew and could follow policy or could treat their co-workers with respect. There needs to be better training on respecting others and better disciplinary acts for disrespectful actions. Also, I suggest better training for people going into management with the MC's and policy and exceptions. The over company is wonderful and meeting new people everyday was my highlight!"
good,Walmart is an ok place to work. A typical day at work was kind of stressful for me. In this job I learned about good customer service skills. I got along well with management and they accommodated my disability very well.
good,"Friendly coworkers, fast-paced, always keeps you busy. Managers could use alittle work though. You always have the option to switch departments if one doesn't fit your standards."
good,"WalMart is a company that works they people to the bone, but yet they know that is a way for people to take care of their families. They do have good benefits after their 90 days. The thing is they do not care about the health and well begin of their employees."
good,"It was a good throw away job while I was moving into the area. It's not hard, just boring. Depending on your department and manager it can be super easy. Not somewhere to stay forever but definitely a good stepping stone job or first job."
good,Good job if your a student or single. Its hard to move to management position. You have to know the right people. It not a bad place to work. Its just hard to move to a assistant manger for the company.
good,Walamart was my first job out of high school. I didn’t know much about the company or the job in general but you definitely learn everything you need to know to benefit from the job. Working at Walmart you get the opportunity to climb in the company to higher ranking jobs. There are lots of options and opportunity that you gain from working with the company. I fell the main benefit are the skills and mindset to further your career either in Walmart or getting you started on your path to other companies.
good,"We go in and a stretch before you work"
good,"I enjoyed all my positions there. Starting from a cashier, to customer service rep., to a jewelry(accessories/shoes) sales associate, to a deli associate. I enjoyed the opportunity to be able to gain the knowledge of working the other departments that make up the store."
good,"Great entry level job, that provide amazing benefits for its workers. In my experience management lacked professionalism and where very unorganized in store management."
good,this was a good job because there are good benefits. Be prepared to work hard and long because the grind doesn't stop. I am very greatful for working here.
good,At Walmart it was a lot to unload the trucks an tiring but I sticked it out an learned more stuff about stocking an build my team work skills. The best part was you was independent everyone one had there own aisle to stock all though people was walking through the aisle it still was independent
good,I worked here for 3 weeks and then was terminated some previous shoplifting that I informed management of prior to being hired.i did complete the training program in record time.
good,"Wal-Mart is  a good stepping stone.  The training is good for managers, and the work can be interesting at first, but gets monotonous after a period of time.  Wal-Mart is a great place to learn the ins and outs of the retail business, but not a place to stay for long."
good,"I work as a cashier/self checkout host I help customers all day such as checking prices for them.. "
good,"Holiday time was good we got a lot of overtime. Every body got along , it was was a small walmart not to many employees , it was very chill and smooth"
good,"Buen lugar seguro se trabajo, buenos compañeros y con equipo de trabajo y herramientas excelentes"
good,If you don’t mind standing and squatting for 8  hours it’s great place to work and if you don’t mind being watched like you’re stealing time are stealing products instead of them running cameras back to see who’s doing these things instead of going of word of mouth
good,"Working at Walmart Distribution can be very physical. Overtime is required and the average workday last at least 10 hours. The pay is moderate, but well earned."
good,can not plan your day ahead of time. management constantly changing. every new manager has a different way of doing things. I learned a lot about how to deal with a variety of people including customers and fellow employees. all my fellow employees are wonderful to work with.
good,Advancement is hard not promised as asked. Everyone should not be paid at the same level due to work different departments do. Always make sure you make agreements on paper or they will Denie the verbal agreement in the future.
good,"It's pretty good if you get a good Manager. Solid benefits, solid hours, solid pay. Decent compensation and they offer Dental and Vision! As well as a nice discount for shopping"
good,"Walmart is a great place to work, but they can be very difficult. For an example, I have a son that is going through some problems so we are always at the doctor's office. They get a little frustrated because I have to miss the full day or leave work early to get my son from daycare."
good,"They claim to appreciate the work you do but don't, they show a lot of favoritism, and they have a lot of people in leadership positions that don't know how to do the job."
good,Walmart is an amazing place to work but it is hard because there is no time for personal time/life. Sometimes it feels like you are the only person who cares. It is a lover hate relationship.
good,"good place to start work good people 3 weeks notice of when you are going to work.  mangers are very nice, always somthing to do not to far right in the the city good hours"
good,"Love it , i would recommend this job to others but it’s jot enough to get an apartment or to move in this area unless you work 2 jobs or you try to become full time"
good,"I believe Walmart's a great company to work for all around excluding their attendance policy. If you call out more than 3 times within the first 6 months, you're immediately terminated. No exceptions. I had called out once when I was sick, and then 2 weeks later I was on my way to work when I broke my arm and had to be rushed to the hospital, I was out for 2 weeks but still received 2 more attendance occurrences for it. So on the 3rd of September I had gotten incredibly ill but knew that if I called out sick I would have been fired. As soon as I showed up, the manager had sent me home immediately and told me I'll get a call back regarding my employment soon. It's been 2 and a half months and there hasn't been an attempt on their end to try and reach out to me. I've called several times asking for the manager and even walked in each time it's the same ""we'll see what we can do"" and no word back from them."
good,"Solid work environment with good teamwork dynamics.  It enables associates to feel like they are part of the bigger picture, along with allowing those that wish to move up in the company to do so."
good,"At Walmart it was always busy. I learned a lot from the customers, as in Spanish, how many times that certain customer shops at Walmart. The management was so pleasant it was very unorganized and drama. They didn't go off your availability at all. The culture at Walmart is extremely diverse. The hardest part would be how long the lines were. The most enjoyable part would be around holidays we got to dress up during Halloween and they passed out Christmas."
good,Great place if your looking for flexibility.  PTO has to be used for holidays or you have to come in the Saturday before the holiday if you don’t want to use your PTO.  That’s the downside.
good,"Wlanart is a good company to work for , it is stressful at times and could use a few Changes .."
good,some asst manger do not work well with handicap people  cutting hours not willing to fix hours I could not get even 16 hours a week that is all i needed for the week
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. They have great opportunity to move up. Walmart is a well known business that everyone comes to shop at. I highly recommended it.
good,"Heavy lifting, unloading and reloading trucks. stocking shelves is slow paced and a group effort. Understanding somewhat of conditions. Very easy and laid back."
good,"Apparel is super indépendant and easy, you just get returns and fold them or put them back on a hanger and take them to where they belong, you also had to make sure your department was clean and nothing was on the ground. Management was laid back and understanding. The workplace was fairly nice and not much you need to do."
good,Nice place to work the culture and diversity and alll the collaboration between works and managers. Always up to date and work is not to difficult for most works
good,It’s great frl I enjoy working there just need more money it be a lot to do there the Customer is  great to be around I just enjoy work there  Great management team
good,Work with a good group of people. Learned a lot on communication and day to day operations. Management demands high for 1 person. hardest part of job is was keeping management on good side of things. best part about job was working with the people.
good,My experience at Walmart was a great learning experience and I am happy that I work there. My time at Walmart has ran its course and I am hoping to work at a job so I can better my career preference.
good,"As an Assistant Manager a typical day would include working with associates, training on new processes, ensuring accurate payroll, day to day running of the business as well as dealing with customer concerns or inquiries. There is a strong culture of respect for the individual and diversity. The hardest part would be getting into the fall seasons with back to school,thanksgiving and then Christmas keeping up with the influx of freight but the most enjoyable part is the wonderful people that you work with and the sense of family."
good,Walmart was ok when I first sarted out. The management team was lenient on explaining my points. I would like to advise to corporat to not have a three months advance on vacations; dew to management forgetting.
good,"So worked there for 12 years.  It wasn't a bad place to begin with but went down hill after awhile. "
good,I did my job and I went home. culture depends on your store and managers. also location is important too. i encountered racists every once in a while.
good,"My over all experience was good kind of this facility was ran under favoritism. A lot of lack in communication but, some days where actually great days to go be there."
good,"i cleaned the isles in the store dry mopping walking the isles, picking up trash,emptying trash containers, cleaning up spills. they did carry paper goods,household items, furniture, sporting goods,clothes, verichile acesseries"
good,Ok to work if you’re a student or not to many bills over the table the job is good it’s easy time goes by fast supervisor are not the best that the down side for being Walmart they go over bord
good,I felt that Wal-Mart didn’t appreciate me as an employee. I was sent everywhere the needed me to go. People was getting paid more at my position and they haven’t been in my position as long as me or in the store as long as me and I felt that was unfair.
good,"working with the public was extremely fun."
good,"Decent company with worldwide name recognition.  Start all new employees at part time, which is not adequate for those who need full time work.  Overall, it is not bad."
good,I did everything in Walmart from setting up shells modular display inventory produce supervisor I did Deli Bakery meat production work a little of dairy I did some of everything customer service assistant cashier cart Pusher stocker Etc
good,"How wonderful the work experience is at Walmart. I would enjoy returning to work for them as a previous employee.  We had two drive thrus which required much assistance both when slow and when busy.  My staff was very educated on how to handle various circumstances as pharmacy technicians.  Our typical work day was at least 230 scripts per day.  We also made sure our chargebacks were completed on a daily basis, and that the gross profit was always positive."
good,Wal-Mart is a go go go company. The structure is always changing and procedures so if you don't like change it's not the place for you. It's a fun place to work for but can burn you out very quick .
good,Some jobs here were very fast paced. Time went by very quickly. Very hot in the summer time. Very good structured work very organized. Had no intention of leaving there but was forced out
good,"I preformed the janitorial specialist services very excellent by waxing the floors here at the Walmart Super Center in Odessa, Texas in the grave yard shift"
good,It was okay. Decent pay. Decent managers. Worked too hard. No overtime. Hours was all mixed up night you would close and the next you were be opening.
good,"Back to back calls from Customers with cable, cell phone, internet issues."
good,Well the company has changed a lot over the years and I've been here to long and I'm not making what I should be making so it's not bad but I just need more money to survive
good,clock in unload the truck go on a 15 min break come back stock take a hr lunch break come back and finish up stocking help customers throughout the whole day
good,"A typical work day at Walmart was extremely stressful. Our jobs were often threaten if we chose not to comply. Worked in extreme conditions (pretty much forced). The management wasn't the best, the workplace was hostile."
good,"The sections i worked in were fairly low-brow and thats on of the reasons i left. absolute mind numbing boredom, and you get to see the absolute worst of humanity"
good,"Assisted customers with purchases, worked cash register, answered in-coming calls, and stocked shelves.  I also organized merchandise in bins and on display tables."
good,Wasn't good be standing around all day and not be able to go help out another co-worker if they needed it we had to stay stationary for hours at a time as a cashier until it was time for a break.
good,"I had fun working at Walmart while I was there. I learned a lot while working there. I started out as a overnight cashier, and then became a stocker, and the worked up to Merchandise Supervisor"
good,"At my previous location, hours were somewhat flexible. i was placed in a department that I was not very good at. Management worked with me and placed me in another department that better suited me. I enjoyed working for them."
good,it was a job that paid weekly im a single mom so it was good but not so great atmosphere too many employees not organized everybody just everywhere but i guess they figure it out kudos to them
good,"Very productive, most days short handed, enjoyed working with the staff, we made it a fun place to work in our department, hardest part scheduling issues"
good,Walmart has a great working environment and is a great starting job or job at all.  It has great benefits and vacation time.  It is easy to change your availability to different hours.
good,"need to treat all employees with equal rights and value "
good,"Working at Walmart was great. They give very good benefits. Take advantage of the benefits. The hours are flexible so if in school or a parent, they work with you on the hours"
good,great place to work with advancement opportunities. Always short on nightshift especially with truck unloading. benefits were good and pay was fine. Job itself was boring. always same thing.
good,I have been working for Walmart for three years and I now feel like it time for me to move around. I haven`t moved from my current position since I got hired and no manager is attempting to help me
good,"Walmart always keeps you busy, but it's not a bad thing. Pay was still decent for a cashier not something that alone could be lived off in Montgomery though"
good,Very study job great co workers and always new ways to gain experience for your resume great benefits once you are full time the breaks are great just enough time to eat and gain energy to complete task
good,"Walmart is very multicultural when it came to the staff, but the scheduled that they give you is not the best for students to go by. Since you have to walk 30 minutes at 12:00pm twice during the week for they closes bus stop."
good,I think Walmart is a great place to work if you like fast pace and if you want to advance you learn a lot and there a lot of benifits for their employees and customers.
good,Walmart is an amazing place to work. The hours are ok and the pay is good. There is room for advancement if willing to relocate as a manager. Hardest part of the job is the early hours.
good,"Walmart has excellent benefits and opportunity for advancement, You have to be driven to succeed, Many many misconceptions about Walmart, Really a good company to work for"
good,"Great job, great growing pay, can be very fast pace at times. Good working hours , goes by point system to determine bonuses and vacations time. Great company to grow within"
good,walmart pays well and also gives some benefits. i never received any benefits however...they will work you if they need to and it will be a lot of workign and working late. they give you 9 hour shifts with an hour break it makes you feel like youre there forever
good,Walmart was flexible with their hours and worked with students. The tasks were typically routine. The work was not hard. I knew my expectations every day and they were manageable requests.
good,working there was fast paced and easy to adapt to and easy to get hired the workers there were very friendly  and kind never had a issue the whole time I worked there
good,Constant heavy lifting.  Stretching on ladders.  Lifting boxes on ladders.  Pulling oversized pallets to floor from receiving.   Very physically demanding.
good,"I like working there for the benefits, but with so many turn overs it became stressful. I loved my job and my coworkers. And I enjoyed the customers. But the programming systems is old and makes it hard to do your job. Faulty equipment makes your jobs hard. And you can reboot so much, but rebooting didn’t not work it makes your job harder. I started as a cashier and moved up to customer service manager, but they cut so many positions. I worked as a cashier, customer service manager, support management to a floor associates for sporting goods deportment. I love that area, but I was also the only associate on the floor for time to time. So I had to run several areas at a time. Toys, housewares, hardware, seasonal areas, stationary and my sporting goods at one time. I also became friends with a lot of my coworkers and customers. I liked my job when it can to the people I came in contact with on daily basis. My job was very easy but with the company equipment made it a daily struggle. After four years working in sporting goods I was able to talk to someone at home office and get your fishing license machine update from dail up to the internet. And that was a battle itself because I was reporting it to managerment and they answer was that they reported to home office. But when I addressed it to home office they never heard about the system we was working under. After four years with that we got a new fishing licenses machine. So when I moved to a different area in the store my direct manager was upset with me and that’s when I started having problems. And that’s the are I really"
good,I enjoyed some aspects of the job but it was really hard to find a manager when you have scheduling issues ( school and job schedules often conflict).
good,I was hired in for seasonal help. I worked over the holidays and didn’t enjoy the how fast-paced it was because the customers were rude and it was always mass chaos.
good,"This job was fast past which is a good thing i always doing something. i didn't like the hours because if i had to do something during the day i would be tired. the pay was great, and i got 40 hours a week. my day would start off as a meeting with the staff and end up cleaning up before we went home."
good,I like twalmart because it is big and nice i like the food and drinks they are good and i like the bean dip and the fries and the tots and the nacho s and the cokes and sprites and the drinks and the sun chips i like to eate the food there
good,The job depends on your expectations and your position in the store. In retail there is always too much to do with not enough time. Working in human resources was enjoyable but the training was difficult because my temporary position.
good,"I enjoyed working at walmart quite a bit however there were definitely a few problems. The management was very poor and the store lost both supervisors when I was there. As a result, the person with the most experience was promoted despite not having any leadership qualities."
good,I just worked on the Wal-Mart account. I really worked for Americal and traveled to Wal-Mart. It was a interesting job and I enjoyed working on that account.
good,The employees were very nice I just did understanding the cell phones different types and styles unfortunately  they trained me well I just prefer to work as a cna
good,"My Walmart was not the easiest place to work, sometimes i would have to stay late to finish my work, other times i would finish all of my work and be able to leave a few minutes early. The other associates were generally nice and understanding, managers were even better and would be kind and understanding while also making sure the job gets done so i guess in a way it was like controlled chaos."
good,you have a great place to work and you work with great people 
good,"Walmart provides you the opportunity to work towards your goals with a work to life balance according to your availability, and they provide the tools for you to succeed within the company."
good,It was easy work after been trained for one day and helping customers that needed help you can always ask your coworker if you don't or didn't know or knew nothing they'll galdy help
good,its a good starting job for kids right out of school. decent pay and they dont over work you. staff is friendly and help out in never had problems  id probably work here again if the pay was better
good,"On a regular day its pretty fast past all day and everyday, very friendly staff I have no problems with anyone. I learn new things about the store everyday, also management is pretty good on making things run smoothly."
good,At Walmart if you work hard you are the only one working and the manager tells you to do everything and there are people who don’t do any work and managers never say anything and they just walk around. There are also some managers who are lazy and just walk around and sit in the lucnchroom all the time and if you ask them for help they will say they are busy and managers never take initiative for anything unless home office brings it up their attention and they don’t get yelled at. Their will be some stuff that should be done but managers never do they unless they get yelled at by head office and then they will start blaming us for it even though we were trying to tell them their thing before but since as I said they never listen to employees at all
good,Walmart was a fairly easy job. You can make your schedule and lunches are an hour long. As well as two other breaks. Management will have you back and support you
good,Walmart was an ok place to work the only bad thing about them was that every day they changed or added a new rule that would get you wrote up. But the managers are good and are a lot of fun to work with.
good,"If you need to get great benefits the it is the place to work they have everything. The work is hard and that they are streaked on how muck hours that you work, so sometimes they will ask you if you can work a extra day or stay longer but the cut you latter and it messes with your plains sometimes so need to be careful with that. They will work you to hard sometimes that you know that you are doing better then everyone on your crew but then they don't stick up for you like they should and some of the managers as well will add in on drama so it was not a place for me but others it has great benefits and has great opportunity to advanced to higher levels and make great money."
good,They are great to work for their benifets are great. Its a very fast paced job i cashiered so my shift always went by fast.i also worked at the Service desk that was great but it had its days.
good,"Decent pay decent work. I'm very out going and fast paced so the job was very easy for me. I enjoyed meeting new people ,I left because I found a better job."
good,"good work experience "
good,"A workday  at Walmart starts by organizing and preparing  frozen and fresh products to be merchandised for consumers, in a timely and organised manner.  Tasks were organized in a supply and demand process, depending on the season or upcoming holiday.  It is a busy job, but rewarding. Company training helps take guess work out of how to handle products, chemicals , and equipment.  The training  also helps employees maintain optimal customer service. Continued training modules keep employees up to date in information pertaining to their positions in the company. The hardest part of the day is stock work, which can be heavy. The most enjoyable part of the job is working within a great team and providing service to the public."
good,Walmart is open 24 hours. Part time employers are always on call to pick up extra shifts. The store is always busy but the mangers organized the schedule for employers to receive their  breaks on time.
good,"I went from being on cap team to a door greeter because of drama. Being a door greeter was much easier though. I kept around the door clean and changed a small trash can. However, they wouldn't let me finish my training in a timely manner because it was just barely late. They were also horrible about breaks, mine were always late if I ever got one at all."
good,I liked working at Walmart. It was challenging have great benefits. Don't have much bad to say about this company it was a wild experience for me it has more good than bad.
good,"I have no complaints about wal-mart, in this ever changing market, things change and job was done away with, I am proud of my work and employer. Good company to work for."
good,Nice place to work at the peope are nice and very helpful and taught me about stacking different boxes on top of each other and how to drive a fork lift
good,Wal-Mart has a strict policy. the credit system for hiring demands clock in exactly  at the time scheduled not a minute before not a minute after. the people are usually nice when coming in and out.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart.  I learned so much about large corporate regulations/ rules; especially about how their chain of command works in the company with regards to their 'open door policy'... I think many would find this to be an exceptional stepping stone to their own aspirations of advancement within a company with little to no prior experience with the right attitude going in of dedication and hard work, most anything is possible."
good,"My department was a cashier , really stressful , responsible position that you have to be focus . I enjoyed working there , associates are friendly ... poor management ."
good,"Working at Walmart was great overall the pay was good, the benefits were excellent. They are very strict with being on time, being one minute late counts towards the 3 times you are allowed to be late."
good,"In my years of experience with Walmart the benefits are excellent but the pay is very poor for the amount of work you are needed to do and sometimes leads to stress. Most of the cashiers were playing on their phones and customers were ignored when looking for a clerk for help. It is a good plan to know the store, the products and where they go on the shelf because they have a quota of how many boxes are to be done in an hour per person."
good,"Overall I don't regret my time there, but it's something I'm not eager to return to. The people were nice, if a little strange, and the management was always very helpful and friendly to me. The way they talked, it seemed like I had a lot of opportunities to move up in the company, but I couldn't do the night shift hours anymore with how little I felt I was getting paid. I suppose the benefits outweighed that, but my situation changed and it was no longer a viable career path for me anymore."
good,Management is tough to work for.  Other full time and part staff are amazing to work with.  They treat people differently some like myself were required to do more than others.  They never seemed to replace workers once they left.  Management is thier downfall
good,"Sus actividades fácil de desarrollar, ambiente bueno de trabajo."
good,"A typical day at work at walmart can be exciting, stressful and eventful. I learned how to embraced customers with our 10 ft rule. "
good,"Working at Walmart was great, the employees were awesome the work was very manageable and the managers were very nice abd respectable. It really felt like a work family there. I left because I was a new mom and I wanted more for my daughter which unfortunately required a better pay than Walmart was offering."
good,"I Enjoyed working in lawn and garden. The customers were always pleasant and happy. first I would water the plants, remove any that needed marked down or out. Next I would mark down plants while helping customers. afternoons were usually spent taking care of customers or stocking shelves."
good,this was my first time working at walmart well really my first working at a retail store. the things i learned there helped me when i transfered to the supercenter. there was one manager there that taught me alot before she left and a thank her for that
good,"This company has Caused my Income to dropp significently  & I almost bebcame Homelesss"
good,"it was a good place to work at first, then they started taking advantage of me, wouldnt give me the raises everyone was getting due to minimum wage, they worked me like a manager, gave me keys as a manager would have, and the would write me up for having them although the manager gave them to me. they worked me in ever department for less than what the department paid, which is against policy and made excuses when it was brought up"
good,"Very relaxed , trained well, management very understanding. Nice vacation time, when earned and also sick days are available almost right away. I would recamend only if you don't want to work alot of hours."
good,"So, with me having former management experience, this company lacks that. There is no communication between managers of each shift, no accountability, and cant even get on process cause of not having the tools to do your job. Oh, and all of the affairs going on in that store. Wow!"
good,"Think it’s should be more about the customers instead of sales. Employees should be taken care of more as well, if they were things would run more smoothly throughout the company"
good,Overall good place to work. Management structure allowed for little opened mindedness while working the sales floor. Allowed for vacation as long as it was given in advance.
good,"We are required to offer Walmart credit cards. We usually have meetings every morning and at night. It was a fun place to work. The workers there are very friendly, but professionals."
good,"Very fast pace, a lot of people issues that have to be solved immediately.  Customer service.  Hardest part of the job is holding associates accountable because of the diversity of age, capabilities."
good,IT was good for the most part. Store Managers change and so did the hours. In the beginning you would get 32 with 3 days off. Then schedule changed depending on the asst  manager. But if the co manager went behind them and cut hours you may have 9 hours for one week.
good,I enjoyed what I did at Walmart as far as working in the Electronics section but my pay was not good and I was only part time. Could barely pay my bills with that amount so I had to find another job that would provide 40 hours a week with an increase in pay.
good,Working at Walmart is mostly of what is to be expected working retail. The management structure has improved over the years. And work is done to ensure employees have a uniform experience.
good,No days off in a row so the stress build on you and eventually you can't take much more so you end up quitting to go to college so you don't have to work at walmart anymore
good,I worked here while attending the university and they were great with scheduling me around my class schedule. In store discounts were an added plus. There were many chances for advancement in most positions.
good,They were a little rude but they were great to work for. They were fair to us and were great. I didn;t exactly work here for long so i don't know what to say.
good,"A typical day at work was usually not bad as long as you were up selling , making the day go by fast. I learned how to scan items and give discounts and price matches on different items from other stores that was cheaper. My management team on the floor where I worked was always friendly and made sure we got the job done. The hardest part of the job was standing around waiting n  customers too enter the store an enter upon your line. Because it would make the day go by so slow an boring. The most enjoyable part of the job were to always greet customers and smile."
good,Walmart was a fun job that gave me new work experience I needed at the time but in the long run I wasn’t getting paid enough to cover all my bills so I had to find something that paid more
good,"this was just a seasonal job, but i enjoyed the time i did work there, very busy great customer service the management a little annoyed with, but an ok job"
good,"You will learn how a big business runs, you  will get a lot of experience. Selling and servicing customers within one or more departments. Ensures basic and seasonal replenishment and merchandising and operational programs are established and maintained to improve sales and profitability in one or more departments. Works in conjunction with the Department Lead in maintaining merchandise assortments and pricing integrity."
good,its a place where u can start out good and working ur way up the leader to be a supervior or manger fast pace work place enjoyed been for the short time i was there
good,The job is easy but the people you work with make it hard. Some areas you may have your production based on someone else's and if they decide not to work you may be screwed.
good,Good overall place to work but all of work and needs speedy timing but pay is good treated somewhat fairly depending on how it works ethic is. Great experience
good,"carga y descarga de mercancia, organizacion y distrubucion de mercancia en tienda, recepcion de proveedores."
good,"Good place to work at for a first job, doesn’t fit my style of job. More into sales or physical work. Unfair requirements throughout employers when it comes to aisle"
good,"Fast pace environment.. recommend for a great flexible schedule. "
good,I was a front end cashier . Some days were pretty slow and quiet other were fast paced and made time pass a little quicker. They training us pretty fair and I like that we jumped right in.
good,A typical day at Walmart is never knowing what your're going to walk into. You deal with people that don't have no type of integrity at all. Most of all it's peaceful and calm as long as the customers come first and you do your work.
good,"After a long service period with the company. I had both good and bad experience with the company, the bad was the last 18 months with the company. I saw leaders that I respected and learned from lose their position and or their career at the drop of a hat. I also ended up in that position and chose to leave the company on my own accord."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart for me was a pretty overall was a good learning experience, while I didn't particularly enjoy the pay. The management is what I enjoyed the most, with everyone being relaxed and not burdening or stressing out the employees. They were flexible and willing to work with you."
good,Enjoy my job. Enjoy what I do. Enjoy the people I work with. Enjoy the training that get with Wal-Mart. Enjoy my schedule. Satisfied with my training that I have received with Was-Mart.
good,Was a good job until they were under paying me and paying inexperienced employees more than me. Worked for the company for two years. I was an electronics connections sale's associate. involving selling all electronic items and setting up/activating phone contracts. Getting paid 9.90 an hour while new regular electronics associate got paid 11.40. I had asked for a raise and was told that it was impossible and was only allowed to have the yearly raises.
good,"I really enjoyed working there, until some personal reasons got in the way. Who could beat 4 days on 3 days off. It was a great job as long as you keep yourself busy."
good,"Good work environment,  you learn difrent things every day and from every body, you have the opportunity to work with difrent people.l difrent department"
good,Great place to work if you are looking to gain experience in retail without sacrificing your welfare for a low wage. The scheduling system is automatic.
good,"This used to be a great place to work. But with their new one best way of doing things, it is not employee friendly. This new program makes work very stressful."
good,walmart  is not a bad place to work but it sometimes fells repetitive and boring to work (depending on who you work with) overall I would recommend Walmart to anyone
good,"Coworkers made it fun, however the bad communication between management and corporate offices after corporate office took over making schedules, confusing hours and people weren’t distributed on the correct days. Making some days easy peasy lemon squeezy but others were difficult difficult lemon difficult."
good,"It was a great job a lot of great poeple to work for, a great comunity but unfortunately management was very unorganized it was hard to deal with so many managers"
good,Besides the strict management it was a productive place to work and had pretty good pay. The management were good at there jobs but they were definely not person people
good,"my 11 years there was fair. I had good times and bad times, but that can come with any company you’re at. They worked with my schedule when personal matters happened and also while I was going through school. I recommend it, but not for life."
good,"Not cool. Your back tears appart after 4 hours of work, your feet want to run away from you, and the bosses are very snob. There is no such thing as fun in this job. Very boring as well. But the clients are nice!"
good,Fast pace at the store very productive with when trucks come in when unloading.  Space in the back is not suitable when unloading at times room needs to be made when trucks arrive.   Supervisor walking making store is presentable would be nice that they would get involved with day to day assignments and work besides the staff when 2 or 3 trucks are received.
good,"A typical day was spent stocking and facing the shelves. Helping the customers find their items. I worked in the sporting goods department so I got to learn about guns and ammo, fishing, and camping."
good,Es un lugar con mucha estabilidad pero a nivel interno cambian las cosas.
good,"empresa bem estruturada, mas pouca possibilidade de crescimento"
good,"the job was fun however it was unorganized where i worked but the hours were not fixed and i lost hours later on in the jobs department. The job was under staffed and not consistent. The jobs management were great with the working with you and are willing to train, give advice and help with any problems between you and a fellow co-worker."
good,I enjoyed working there. It was an easy going job and the tasks assigned to me weren't hard and easy to learn. The environment is safe and friendly to work in.
good,"Working there taught me ways to interact with others even when dealing with rudeness. Fair management."
good,Gente y compañeros muy bueno y buen ambiente lo malo es la gente q lo maneja y q cambian de sector todos los años y de horarios
good,This place was so energetic with many challenges to face day to day. It gave me the experience of being able to problem solve on the spot. I loved that it gave me opportunities to heighten my skills. If your looking for a job that allows you to become a great team player and take on projects that may be challenging and you can tackle on such a task this company is great for you.
good,walmart was not a bad employer if you liked only being part time working 40+ a week. the job was easy but they never allowed time for proper training.
good,it was hard work it was ten hours a day sometimes twelve hours but they paid good it was a nice job but hard it was more than ten hours it has no benefits but good paid two days off and sometimes one day
good,"On a typical day of work you are usually greeted by management which is extremely friendly. You go to your Department and start greeting and helping customers while maintaining a clean area. Plenty of times during the day you are asked to take on jobs that are not supposed to be assigned to you, like cleaning other departments, and doing backroom work that involves cleaning. They are pretty flexible with hours, and requested time off. They will work you like crazy all the way till your shift is done."
good,A typical day at work for a sales associate is waiting on customers and keeping departments clean and orderly.  
good,"My store was great and I have no complaints about the people I worked with, but the company itself is very cutthroat and constantly changes people, so you need to work to stand out in order to maintain a job there."
good,Its very rough to work here because you are constantly moving and its an extremely fast paced job and you have to be moving all the time. you have plenty of training time bust still at times they do expect a lot from you and for most people the reason they stay is because of the pay.
good,I loved working at Walmart because I got along with everyone and everyone liked me I was we ongoing about any situation given to me . I loved being the manager.
good,"it was ok but really have to kiss butt to get noticed. but overall they allowed flexible schedules and managers really do try but obviously they cant please everyone. its one of those ""ok for now"""
good,"It was a good part time job for some one that has school or another job "
good,At the time the Manager over Grocery where I worked wasn't too old I was able to become somewhat friends.  The hours were less than 40 and for a college kid that is good.
good,Travailler dans un grand environnement avec plusieurs taches a faire c'est plaisant.
good,"Excellent company  "
good,helping others while doing my job. loved it.while stocking shelf's it was gratifying helping others find what they was looking for.nothing feels better then helping someone.
good,not a lot of team work here and the management is horrible. I do not recommend  anybody to work there. I hope it gets better down the road but until then just a bad place to work.
good,"Walmart is a place you have to put all your attention and energy toward to company and customers."
good,"productive team oriented workplace with good benefits. there is room for advancement if you would like to move up in the company, the opportunities are there."
good,I learn how to be a great leader an stock and unload trucks the manger are friendly sometime some people have there favorites but other than that it’s ok
good,"From the people, to the policies expect change and inconsistency each day, week, and month. If you can adapt to constant change you can do well in any position here"
good,"Una empresa con muchas oportunidades de crecimiento en cual adquieres gran experiencia pero por el nivel de exigencia, es difícil lograr un equilibrio entre lo laboral y la vida personal"
good,"Seeing as how i was just there during the last few months of the year of 2016, it was a very fast paced job that had very high expectations. The only problem was trying to work at a job in which you never knew if they would eventually keep you."
good,if you were to get hired on at wal mart just be ready to work. its not any easy job. but eventually you get used to it. overall its a great place to be at and you get to meet new people everyday
good,"Try to have a game plan for the day. Get associates on their daily tasks, associate schedules, make sure associates have the tools they need for the day. Most game plans are changed multiple times a day. The management team tries to work together to get the 50+ daily tasks accomplished. The best part is working closely with the great associates I have."
good,"Talk to customers help with location of product technical problems solving "
good,Walmart does a good job of accommodating to the needs of an employee. Part-time was usually pretty flexible which was essential for me while going to school full time.
good,"The job is easy with only a few minor changes to the daily routine. You'll laugh with coworkers, cry at the idiocy of some, and be angry at humanity in general. There are opportunities abound in Wal-Mart for those looking to learn a variety of skills and sections. Most coworkers are fun to talk to and deal with, and the customers vary from friendly to angry to your dreaded ""Wal-Mart"" customer."
good,Walmart is competitive but stressful. I enjoyed my employment during my time. Management  needs to be more organized and have more teamwork. Management needs to work on their lack of communication.
good,"Walmart is a job when your plans are about not better yourself for the future ."
good,Fast paced. Need to be motivated and have time management skills. You get an hour lunch break and two 15 minute breaks for an eight hour day. They don't like you having overtime.
good,"This was my first job it was a very good environment and good managers and people that worked there a nice, I was to young for benefits or need of it but I’m sure they have a decent benifits plan"
good,"Was a great place to work for many years. Now in transition and by their own admission, the future is unknown. It is a demanding and stressful environment to work in."
good,A typical day at work depends on daily expectations. I learned that I need to not allow myself to become too relaxed in a position and look for career advancement in a quickly manner. Management is very tough and strict and most are not very hands on or helpful. The workplace culture is really diverse; some coworkers slack off and get away with doing nothing all day. The hardest part of the job is being expected to complete unrealistic job tasks in unrealistic time expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to display my creativity during holidays for my department and store.
good,Es cansado estar todo el día alimentando cajas pesadas
good,"I love my family at Wal-Mart. Most my coworkers and managers are great. I really hate to leave because they have been good to me, but my health is declining physically so I'm forced to look for office work."
good,I would go back to Walmart I would change the overnights and I would also change locations . Other than that Walmart is a wonderful world wide company to work for.0
good,The job is easy and not stressful but at times it can be overwhelming at times but not a bad job to start out as a young teenager. Great summer job and maybe a long term job and you put the work into it.
good,"Wal-Mart was a good place to work.  Even though my role was very stressful, I still enjoyed working for the company.  It provided me with the opportunity to meet people from all ethnicity and economic backgrounds.  It is a very hard place to work for, but a die hard person like me would try their hardest to see the store succeed."
good,"A typical day at Walmart was stressful but interesting .You have people being rude to you ,throwing things and stealing.Stealing messes up my inventory.Ive learned to have patience.But you work with so many different people which was interesting learning about different cultures.Management team were poor and didn’t care about their staff.But The management team stuck together to run the huge store.Work place culture was diverse.Youll meet a lot of people.The hardest part of my job were figuring out why my merchandise were missing.The enjoyable part of that job was giving customers satisfaction of finding what they need and assuring them that everything was affordable."
good,Good people friendly place to work get along with other good customer just a great place to work at I caught on to my job fast got along with other companies worker
good,"everyday you must always be prepared to help a customer with his/her issue. there are many instances were you will be fixing a car that has blown a flat on the highway, or a vehicle that has been damaged in some way. i would advise you learn to drive stick if you want to be more effective in the shop. slow days are the days you want to practice working faster. management can be a bit difficult at times due to wait times for audits. overall though it is still a job that will help you move forward in your field of study."
good,Fast paced work unloading and stocking. Opportunity for advancement and benefits provided after trial period. Team manager was always available if needed redirection or prompt for new task
good,they gave you a lot to do and it could be better pay and understanding of people fillings most of your fellow co-workers will be the best folks you will every meet
good,"Focusing on job. I learned how to manage time wisely. Balanced days. Keeping employees in position.  I enjoyed meeting new people,  It is a good company to work for."
good,"Empece como captadora trabahe aproximadamente 9 meses y pase a ejecutiva comercial aprox un año y luego ejecutiva back up el resto de lis años ,por lo que aprendi muchas cosas y experiencia en venta ya que hay vendiamos seguros de todo tipo y entregabamos productos y tambien manejo de clientes y de equipo de trabajo."
good,Walmart is a very fast and diverse place to work. You will encounter many types of people throughout your team and your customers. You need to be flexible and able to work hours best suited to your customers.
good,"If you're looking for a challenge everyday, the Walmart Distribution Center is the place for that. The pay is very good, one of the best paying jobs in the city. They make sure you work for it."
good,it was a smooth job got along with everybody everybody did their job the correct way like I supposed to stock shelves and unload trucks all night and clean up before time to go
good,Over the years things changed where many desired for better opportunities. There was a chance for advancement in the company but a fear of losing employment after watching others fail.
good,"Working at Walmart in bowling green Kentucky was okay. It had it's ups and downs. However, there was no room for advancement. They preferred to hire people that were not in the company for the higher positions."
good,"I am grateful to this company, They gave me the tools I neede to succeed in management.This company is a great start for anyone that wants to be in retail"
good,"The most important tip was quality, ethics, integrity, teammanship, and that customers are first.  I learned daily as a manager that there was always room for opportunity."
good,Walmart has never given me too much of a problem. The work that I do is very simple and the people I work with are friendly and helpful. The only thing I’ve had trouble with is harassment from the store manager.
good,es una empresa transnacional que deberia de acoplarse alas formas mexicanas y motivar economicamente mejor asus empleados
good,Worked 4 10 hour shifts. The benefits were really great as well as the discounts that were offered. I was able to be a part of many special teams as well.
good,management was a bit of a mixed bag but co-workers are friendly and customers are pretty understanding.The time of day and how close the next holiday is a big factor for how busy you will be.
good,I came into work and stocked shelves and assisted customers and cleaned up messes also did special tasks on occasion. also worked overnight. easiest part was coming in and the hardest part was trying to adjust the top shelves.
good,"due to my experience, i always had something to do "
good,"It would be better if they wouldn't just make anybody a CSM, I believe that, It should be deeper than that because the CSM's that i have met have mostly be rude."
good,I had to come in at 10 pm each night and take loads of boxes off of pallets in the coolers of the frozen and dairy sections. I then would have to put the boxes in sections depending on what and where the item belonged. After that we would stock the shelves. I learned about the circulation process of products such as dairy. Management were friendly and for the most part would listen to what was requested and would then try to help the employee as best as they could. Pretty hard working people trying to get their jobs done like everybody else. Hardest part of the job was easily my back. Also being in a cooler for 3 hours moving packages every single day gets to a person. Most enjoyable part was getting to know the other employees.
good,"A typical day at work would unloading the truck and placing them in the correct spaces before taking the product out on the floor to stock the items. I've learned that there will be people in the work place that you will not enjoy or like working with but its about getting the job done correctly and in a timely manor. The work place culture was great there were people who were deaf to black, white, mexcian, all types of culture everyone got along it didn't matter who you were we always looked out for each other."
good,"Working as a CAP2 supervisor (Support Manager) was an extremely"
good,"Very quick-pace work place. All encounters are recognized and supervised properly. Comfortable environment to work in at all times. Its a great experience to work at Walmart. The hardest part or challenges usually are doing multiple task at the same time but as long as you follow directions and listen, your usual work day shall go by smooth and comfortable. The most exciting and fun part of this job would be the job itself, you meet new people and associates and learn new traits and trades."
good,came to this job as I took a full time off of school. the job is in you like stocking and standing on your feet. But  mangemnt is wild and so much pressure is on you hte job can be stressgul
good,"No room for personal creativity, Heavy work loads."
good,"manage associates and deal with customer complaints. manage and plan for incoming freight, write associates schedules, complete an unrealistic amount of tasks with little to no time inbetween new assignements."
good,I learned that not all jobs are fair. I learned that not all managers care about their employees. The hardest part was going to work. The most enjoyable part was going home.
good,"Surprisingly strict about labor laws and corporate policies which may sound unpleasant, but actually provides a healthy workplace with plenty of opportunity for advancement. Only major downside is getting on bad terms with certain members of management."
good,"Conoci muy buenos amigos, aprendi que el cliente apesar de todo siempre tiene la razón, conoces gente de toda, experiencia en conteo de efectivo, y agradezco mucho que me ayudaron a crecer en mi experiencia laboral, tuve una gefa que siempre me aconsejo a segir adelante a luchar para tener exito, que paso a pasito vamos logrando nuestros sueños, y a darle servicio al cliente."
good,"As a production manager I’m in charge of managing the evening team, making sure trailers are unloaded in time and stocked on the floor for our customers. Keep store policy in check. A lot of multi tasking. The people make the job enjoyable."
good,"It was an ok job, I'm a college student so it worked for me. He only issue is hey didn't give me many hours. They provided us with a grace period and we had many training on the computer"
good,I worked stocking shelves. I did enjoy working there. I also helped customers find things they were looking for though out the store. I enjoyed that you were kept busy throughout the shift.
good,My experience working at Wal-Mart was overall a good experience. But it was to much of a fast paced job for me being a cashier there. I enjoyed all the hours i got and the management of that company.
good,"In general I like it, and the benefits they offer.  When I started I really enjoyed working here.  Due to the current management I can not hardly stand to go to work."
good,"I worked for 3 years at Walmart as a cashier , and I worked very hard but my work was never appreciated by the manager. The hardest part of the job is that you are working extremely good and fast but you are getting a minimum salary, when you know you should get more."
good,The counts were a bit frustrating. We were allowed to add to but not subtract from. Which does not allow for shrinkage. Vendor controlled items would not send what the computer says we have in stock.
good,I worked For Swift Transportation as a shop Foreman at night.  I worked a 4 on 4 off 12 hour rotating shift so that means I had 4 days off every 4 days.  it was a great job and I loved the Work.  They did not pay over time due to some clause in the transportation industry.
good,Wal-mart is an over all good company to work for if you have the right managers. A bad manager can turn a store upside down in a matter of minutes.I enjoyed my time working at wal-mart is was a great learning experience. I just wish it didn't end like it did
good,Great job if you want to try something different and it's room for advancement if they like you most of the associates feel the play favoritism but if you willing to learn they will let you advance.
good,good place to work and meet new people learn new things. hardest part of the job was staying up at night when its a slow night. good work place environment
good,There really big about putting customers first. The customer can fire you if they want without the customer you want have a job. But the benefits are awesome
good,"Most days at work follow the same lines. The basic jobs and tasks are easy to get the hang of and follow guidelines, the policies are clear and precise. "
good,"Honestly, Wal-Mart itself isn't a bad place to work.  Management can make or break a store's morale as anyone will tell you in retail, though when you find a good team it's hard to break away from them."
good,"Worked for the toughest manager I have ever worked for however I learned more from that man than all other managers combined. I ran the receiving/shipping backroom. Operated light heavy equipment and loved this fast paced and extremely time sensitive job. Leadership and self motivation qualities a must. Time sensitive deadlines and always under a lot of pressure were the best and worst parts of the job. I work best under pressure. Typical day at work was unloading several trucks, distributing pallets to appropriate locations on sales floor. organizing and wrapping pallets of overstock and using heavy equipment to put stock away. Organizational and self motivation skills a must. Good time management skills a must."
good,"The stores are running with much fewer staff and everyone has to up their game but with the restructuring it gives staff the goal of making the whole store what it should be, not just their departments"
good,"Keeping store clean, assisting associates, management is good but have a lack of hour, hardest part is constant moving and running multiple service areas at once. Enjoyed other coworkers"
good,Very cool place to work everyone is friendly and the customers are great I would recommend this job to anyone  it’s a great temporary job with fair pay
good,"Walmart has a tight knit work force. The authorities are willing to compromise with you so that your position in the store utilizes your maximum potential and skill. The schedules are meticulously organized and always consistent. Management is open to negotiating scheduling to accommodate your availability. The days are full and there is always plenty to be done. If you want a job where you can be challenged to develop your skills and abilities as well as make new friends, then Walmart is the best choice."
good,"I liked the job, it was fulfilling but at times it could be a bit overwhelming. I got along well with the management and my fellow team members and liked the job overall."
good,Worked for this company for many years and advanced to department manager but the pay did not match the responsibility. They need to hire more reliable employees and keep better track of inventory. The mess of inventory made it a very stressful job.
good,every morning check for out dated items on floor. We stock floor through-out the day.  learning experience is great I have new insights on a variety of fruits and vegetables. Team atmosphere I work in Produce we are a close knit group and work well together
good,"A typical night can be stressful depending on how much freight. I manage about 9 associates. It can be challenging telling adults what to do. The hardest part of my job is working at night. 16 years is a long time. The most enjoyable part is getting the job done at a reasonable time,"
good,"Walmart is a million dollar company! Walmart is a good Company, its all about management. I love what I do its just i ad a hard time with the people over me. Management treat you as if you a robot with no feelings, nor life, outside of work."
good,Walmart offered a very fun and relaxed working environment. Paid training was afforded to employees and their was an opportunity for advancement to higher levels within the company.
good,"i work in 3 year is nice to work i know fronting and facing"
good,"Working at Walmart can be fun and enjoyable.  You not only get to interact with your fellow associates you also interact with your community. It can be fast pace at times, but you also have your slow pace as well.  Adaptability is the way to be with the company, things changes new technology to help you work better is introduced. Overall it is what you put into the position you are in as to what you will get in return.  Hard work does payoff."
good,"Guarantee 40 hours, had many benefits and had sick pay, after one year can have vacation pay. was actually very easy to move up they like to promote within. pay was not very good but they provided raises. they switch up management around."
good,I worked overnights at Walmart supercenter. A typical work night was long and was never the same each night. I learned to better my customer service and what to do incase of an emergency. I learned how to stock fast and used the register. The management was good but not great. Never a straight answer from whoever would be working. Things were difficult to talk about with management because it felt like nobody was listening or wanted to help make the work place better. Workplace culture was busy sometimes and dead another. Never a dull moment working nights. The hardest part of the job was being able to get enough sleep to go in the next night or changing the store around for holidays was pretty hard and stressful. The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart was meeting new people. helping my customers and making them leave with a smile.
good,Management over staffed causing conflicts with others. Example: One manager tells an associate one thing and another manager tells another thing causing confusion and slows production of projects.
good,The best thing about it was the environment.  It's less stressful when the retail floor is not overflooded.  The managers were nice except a few.  The discount was good and the time for breaks was also good.
good,"Its a good company to work for although sometimes employees (associates and management) aren't held accountable for their actions from higher management. If you're a high school student needing extra money its a great starting job, but the low pay rate for my position isn't worth it for someone wanting to go in starting a new career."
good,"Productive. Always something to do. It can be stressed at times, especially during holidays. Have to have great energy and a a good attitude to be able to deal with customers"
good,I trained on most of the jobs in the warehouse as well as trained new employees and travelled to new distribution centers to help them open.great work environment and co workers. left for more pay.
good,"Walmart is OK for a starting place for the work field, but I wouldn't suggest being there for too long. The management is somewhat mishandled. It's nice for interaction with people in the neighborhood, and you learn about how management works. However, the work can get tiring, and the management can get very complicated at times."
good,Its a great place to learn how to interact with different people of different cultures. they also do a great job at helping you advance into a management position.
good,"It was the kind of place where you basically fend for yourself. Management wasn't very organized. However, they were flexible. I just wished the management team was more involved."
good,I liked working there. Would not have left if I hadn't been injured on the job. They let me go because I could not perform the duties of the job description. I can only lift 10 pounds and the require 60. I can only stand for 15 min. and cannot meet their requirements
good,A good job for someone young getting started with their working career.  If you go to school for management you could get paid well if you make it to store manger.
good,at walmart you have to have patience and learn to work at a fast pace. And to understand the importance of helping out customers making sure they have a happy visit.
good,My role when I left Walmart was Assistant Manager and the stress was too much. There were days I worked 16 hours and didn't finish all expected of me. Trust me I am not a slow person and still was unable to finish my tasks.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart I excelled in my positions in different departments. Team building was important to get the job completed to meet daily tasks. Daily training and company training requirements for supervisors can be stressful on top of required daily task.
good,Boa orgnização. Disponibilidade de horario. Plano de saude
good,"Customers can be frustrating and work can be stressful, management often overlook the employees' needs, but overall a pretty decent place to work with the benefits"
good,My experience with this place is it is a good job over all ive worked some bad jobs in the past its just it can get tedious after awhile and one has to have the patience working with people and co workers
good,"Walmart is a great job to have it has good benefits "
good,"It's a very fast paced field of work, but if you like helping others as myself you'll enjoy it. Some customers might step on your toes from time to time but it's not intentional all of the time I would say make the best of it."
good,"While working at Walmart Canada there are many skills that you learn."
good,was not making enough hours to pay bills. The management was some what helpful. wish management would listen to employee ideas. had great benefits. need more options.
good,The days at Walmart were mostly the same just unloading the truck at stocking the shelves.  I learned a lot where almost everything is there and it is great so when I go in there I can help people even though I no longer work there.  There are some problems with management but it takes time to give those things.
good,"This is an excellent starter job for any young person looking to gain some skills and social experience. There are plenty of clearly laid out opportunities to advance and for the most part, the management model and structure is respectable and refined"
good,"Walmart is a good place to work for some.  There is always a job, and plenty of hours, until you want overtime which is not always available, and i wanted more of.  Also, us in the logistics field do not have the same opportunity for advancement as they would lead you to believe, which is the main reason for my looking for a new job.  Its a steady place to work and you'll have a job as long as you show up and do your work, but i want something more for my life and family than that."
good,I loved the pay and the people but the actual work was tiring. A typical day was waking up at 4 a.m. and working until all of the orders were filled and that time varied daily.
good,Hours are guaranteed and advancement is easy to come by. Pay is a little low for what you do but with the opportunities it can become easily increased.
good,"This is a good place if you want customer service experience, it teaches you a lot about how to handle a customer in a faced paced environment. Good starter job."
good,I loved working here you get to meet new people everyday. It is advancement but you have to wait so long before you g=can get it. It is fast paced but the co workers are friendly.
good,"Walmart pays well enough, and the benefits are actually decent, but in terms of listening to employees, the company always prefers what they deem to be efficient, by a patently unfair standard that doesn't consider the idiosyncratic features of each employee."
good,I loved working at Walmart.  Plenty of room for advancement and they will train from within. Fun environment and very understanding management when it comes to family.
good,"Walmart was okay, I didn't really like their sick policy though. I enjoyed being a cashier and working with the public, it helped me become better at customer service."
good,"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the company itself, except for the fact that my managers were sleeping together and it was DEFINITELY a conflict of interest. Otherwise the only downside of this job is that working with these customers will slowly kill you. The customer is always right is wrong."
good,"The job is really not that hard you just have to remember things as a cashier. I never really had hard times , other besides a customer asking me something and I didn't know I tried to walk the to another worker so they can help. You don't have to remember things because there is always somebody there to help you."
good,"buen trabajo, pero casi no hay crecimiento en las areas"
good,"management is very poor along with upper managment..you don't know whether you coming or going,they change things everyday and the store is always short staffed"
good,"I liked working for Walmart, I learned a lot working there. Management was great (Some) . I would go back if I could get days and weekends off. there isn't really a hard part of the job, except pulling the pallets, killing your back. the most enjoyable part, is everyone working together to help each other:)"
good,Typical day is a 9-8 shift. You can have an hr lunch but in most cases you wont be able to take it because of the workload. Favorite part of the job is the associates and the customers
good,"Experienced a variety of jobs within the company such as stocker, unloader, and modular team associate. The jobs at Walmart can be fairly easy but management is a problem."
good,not a bad place to work for pay is decent and the hours are not too bad the work isnt that hard or bad gets a little warm in the summer time and a little chilly in winter
good,"Working for Walmart has its ups and downs. The management team in DeLand Florida could be better, but overall the workers and customers were enjoyable."
good,Great learning experience decent place to work fast paced gotta be on your toes moving no time to hang out fun work environment as well as challenging.
good,Being a cashier allowed me to interact with the public on a daily basis. Working in Lawn and Garden was a lot of fun. The people I worked with made it more fun.
good,During my time at Walmart the days where slow and kind of boring. I only learned certain things not very often. My department manager was very nice and helpful.
good,It was just a typical work as everywhere else it hard to get training into a different area in the warehouse cause there is people who has worked for 10 yeas and you have only been working for 4 years
good,Me.desempeñe.lo.mejor posible megustaba mi trabajo
good,"I had three different jobs when I worked here. I was first a cashier where I would assist customers with checking out their items, along with making sure that my area was clean when I had a moment. I then became an electronics associate, where I would assist customers with anything electronic and help them receive photos back at the lab. My last job was an overnight  stocker. I would put items in the correct spots on the shelves and make sure everything looked neat and straight. I learned how to handle irate customers calmly. I learned how to work the photo machines in the back. The workplace culture is open and they are willing to help those in need of assistance. The hardest part is having to keep acting professional when there is a customer screaming at you. The most enjoyable part was meeting interesting people throughout the day and having fun conversations while helping them. It was fun learning how to do different tasks."
good,"I hated working there. Employer only cares about themselves and saving money. They cut your hours for not reason. You get hurt and everyone tries to stop you from taking it to court and if you bring up that you are going to court for this they fire you on the spot. They are more expensive than anywhere else in my town. ""Save money live better"" more like ""Be broke live homeless"""
good,Walmart is an okay job for a highschool/college student. They are very flexible with scheduling and is pretty stress free. The biggest complaint I have is I end up running around half the store because of how understaffed we are on any one given day. Management doesnt seem to care and they are only trying to make themselves look good rather than others and the company as a hole. If you can manage to move up you can make a solid living. but most of the associates are very underpaid for the work they are expected to do
good,"A typical work day included customer service and stocking. I learned a lot about sales and how treat a customer with the utmost respect. And the management is fairly easy to work with, they care about their employees. They make sure you are doing good and work side by side with you.the workplace culture is a very diverse culture, we all get along well with each other and we all make sure each other is not falling behind and keeping up with the pace. The hardest part of my job is making sure you keep the customer satisfied as you are completing your tasks. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that you can help a customer with a question and knowing by the end you were the most helpful that they have ever encountered and is very thankful for assistance you have provided for them."
good,The management was wonderful. The customers were extremely rude which is what made the job more difficult for myself. The job was easy and even fun sometimes. If you worked on Sundays you made more per hour.
good,"Manegment was kind and worked with my schedule the best they could, no complaints it was a stable job just not enough pay and I was really far from the location I worked"
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es bueno, ademas de que si eres estudiante de brindan muchas facilidades para seguir estudiando."
good,My job Experience with Walmart was very good. They have great benefits and are very good with taking time off. The staff was very respectful and helpful when I needed help with job related things.
good,Enjoyed working for Walmart and my check was decent every 2 weeks. Working at Walmart is a very fast paced and makes your day go back fast. I would recommend Walmart to a friend first to get you at least a well paying job.
good,Fun and easy. Very easy to understand and comprehend . Understanding management team. Will to help out if they can. Easy to talk to without any judgement
good,"It was a very odd experience. I did exactly what I had expected to do and near no problems doing my job, but when it came to learning how to work other areas of the store that things changed. Just be prepared to learn more than just your own area."
good,"I started working here during the summer of my college years.  I learned a lot about providing great customer service working there.  Its not somewhere I'd want to have my career, at least not in the store."
good,ingresar a las 6 de la mañana comenzar  a ingresar a los proveedores conforme llegaban contar mercancía imprimir folios e ingresar en sistema
good,"Great management, very flexible, always willing to work with busy school schedules.. Fast paced environment, good workers/employees, amazing pharmacists, and great patients to work with."
good,"I loved working here . Even though they are slacking on people , the people that work there are very friendly . I used to enjoy working there . Friendly  olders"
good,"Managers need to speak more professional"
good,"Loved working with the people and customers,  I had a great store manager, she would come work out in store with emoloyees doing the tuff work. I had to leave for family issues with my daughter."
good,Depending what department you end up in a day can be slow or it can keep you busy all day. Management isn't the best but there's also opportunities to advance and become a better manager
good,"Can be a fun place to work if you like doing customer service. Manager was somewhat deceiving at interview however she did try her best to accommodate my other jobs schedules.  The pay is decent if you are in one of the higher paid departments. There are perks like discount cards after 90 days, and insurance after a year of employment."
good,A empresa tem todas as ferramentas para q seja um ótimo ambiente de trabalho mais os líderes impede q a empresa seja satisfatória para os  funcionários.
good,"Good paying job. The hours were very long, the production goals were pretty tough to meet. I liked that I only worked 3 days. Bad thing was it was on the weekends"
good,Empresa com horários corretos mas com alguns desvios de funções
good,"Not super difficult just disorganized at times. Profit share is great though. You get payed more if you work in a fresh department (dairy, bakery,meat , produce). Good hours mostly."
good,I loved my job and I loved the employees who worked there.  It was as if I had a work family. We always had potlucks for making our safety goals or management cooked steaks or burgers.
good,WalMart can be a good workplace for those who like interchangeable hours. They hired me to work on the cashier but I wanted to work in the bakery. I didn't like working for this company.
good,Prior to this year being at Walmart was an amazing experience. A lot of changes have been made over the past year many of which have made employees search else where for jobs. Due to the inability to no longer be able to provide for their family on the hourly cuts.
good,"Good place to work if you don't mind an ever changing schedule, working weekends. They believe Walmart comes first. I was happy there. I took on a second job with a fixed schedule and they would not work with those hours. Forced me to quit."
good,Walmart was a great place to work if your are a people person and they had plenty of hours everyone got a fare share of hours the managers and team leaders was great
good,"I worked in customer service,they pay wasn't great ! Also, you had to work a lot of weekends, time away from family. They didn't provide quality healthcare."
good,"At the time I worked there, there was discrimination against women. They have tried to make the situation better."
good,the job atmosphere is great. There is a lot to keep you busy and its always changing never the same day twice. You get to meet a lot of interesting people and the days go by so fast.
good,"Very corporate place to work, their pathways is useless to it's employees, but the pay is good. Advancement might be hard due to the amount of people they fire / hire"
good,Walmart is more of a learning place I enjoyed my co workers not the job itself and I learned that you go and do your work and you leave Walmart was a handful at all times.
good,Days felt only slow when there wasn't much to do. I learned to be freandly with all customers. Manager would keep you on your toes. Cart pushing machine helped a great deal.
good,You are constantly working with customers and providing optimal service. Would not recommend for those susceptible to high-stress environments as the customers can become extremely rude and belligerent.
good,"It is a very fast paced job, constantly on your feet performing different tasks throughout the day. Management is sometimes unfriendly but overall a learning experience."
good,"The money was great, the customers and the was the customer service managers ran things is why I didn't like it. They were full of drama and weren't very professional."
good,the people are nice and get along just fine most are willing to jump in a project and help out. most the management they hire are outsiders with no experience and they don't give them proper training and can be frusterating
good,A typical day would be me waiting on most of the kids to get there so I can form an activity for everyone to get involved. Depending on what time I work that day. Sometimes I would help children with their homework. Do arts and crafts with them and if the weather is nice I would take the children outside
good,i work with inventory and its not a easy job to do. I learned how to make my day go by faster with helping my crew with their task for today. The hardest part of the job was being finish with the truck at certain times and not having enough people.
good,this job was a temporary assignment so there is not much to tell I learned a lot of new and exciting thing I enjoyed management as I worked very close with them for the remodeling CEO came in and spoke with us was very respectful
good,"I think that Walmart is a great company. There are a some things that need to be changed within the company, but overall I think there is room for growth and opportunity."
good,"Deberían de mejorar el trato a sus empleados, dejar de lado el negocio y dar buen trato al trabajador; motivarlo."
good,"I arrive each morning at work with company equipment that needs replacing, get my job done before my lunch period then head to help others with their department where they're lacking in, ive learned where other department managers responsibilities and typical job days. assistant management is below average at best, their weakest point is lack of communication. Fellow co-workers are the best thing about this job for they make the workplace culture tolerable. The hardest part of the job is trying to please two managers at once and the most enjoyable is as said above the co-workers i work with, they make everything easier as we all help each other asone unit"
good,I put away clothes and made sure the department was in order. I also was trained on a register and in the jewelry department. lots of room for advancement
good,"Good job, good people working here, the management it's good, they have excellent pay and good schedules, great place to work, good hours............."
good,"Walmart has provided me with many opportunities throughout my career. I have enjoyed working with the company, but am currently looking to seek new opportunities."
good,Stable job to support a family. needs better communication skills to be able to work as a team. Customers are always number one. The company works to provide customers with the best experience they could have.
good,"If you are able to work physically hard, be prepared to be taken advantage of. Management will tell you to do task they don't want to touch: department managers, zone managers, and assistant managers. Its especially worse if you have more than two managers wanting task done from you."
good,"Walmart was a do-what-your-told environment. Where your job can vary from stocking shelve to watering plants. The hardest part of the job was finding work to do after ""all"" of the work had been done."
good,"The work performed isn't too bad, depending on the department. Sometimes is feels like you are a puppet in some sick game. Management dependent, it feels like they single out some associates and favor others. There are times where it feels like you are being set up for failure."
good,"I was able to move up in the company quick. They never once heard me back. Horrible work life balance. Management never in the same page, makes it confusing for associates under us."
good,The job was high volume. Task a signed needed to be completed in a time frame. But if mistakes where made the manager made the time to show you the mistake and explained how to do it correctly. They also helped those who wanted to improve their work skills for advancement. I enjoyed and took great pride in my job from the smallest of task to the more challenging ones given.
good,"I am used to working 5 days a week, usually 9 hour shift with an hour lunch and 2 fifteen minutes breaks. You are on your feet all day and must be a friendly people person."
good,It has good pay and opportunity to grow but it is very demanding and stressful. The management is usually moderate at best but in general very poor. They don't listen to most of the associates and follow their own goals and priorities.
good,"Empresa boa. Porém pecam na liderança! É boa mais tem liderança sem responsabilidade nenhuma com o funcionário, sempre com ar de deboche..."
good,It was a decent job. It wasn't to bad. But The training was horrible and it was a learn as you go type thing. The hardest part about the job is when you first start so you don't really know what's going on.
good,a job you have to multitask everyday to stocking shelves ... helping customers and running the cash registers.... putting  over stock away after stocking the shelves
good,"Great place to learn retail skills."
good,Es mas oh menos pero paga muí poco y es matado lo qe haces
good,"workplace culture,a typical day at work  and the most  enjoyable part of the job ,retail,cashering ,appearl ,health and beauty and grocety   and home lines"
good,"I start by checking area, making sure things are clean and tidy. "
good,"All-in-all,day-to-day you know what is expected from your work performance. Extremely clean facility.Safety culture is the main priority.The hardest part of working for WalMart is keeping up with the production schedule which can be extremely demanding. while working at Walmart I thoroughly enjoyed the beehive type atmosphere of the plant."
good,the work was ok. i learned how to interact and help customers. managment was amazing. the work culture was cool but i never put myself in a position to get side tract. the hardest part about the jjob is trying to stay busy once everything is done. i enjoyed my manager and team because we all worked together to get things done.
good,"I learn a lot of Customer Service, cashing check, money transfer transactions, return and exchange merchandise, receive customer phone calls. put all merchandise back."
good,"I Worked as a night shift stocker at Wal-Mart. The Job It self was pretty easy, just boring. Although it was boring it also had its good days. I Actually liked the job, but I had to find something with more money."
good,Walmart has it highs and lows like any other job.they love there customers and they put there customers first.the management is terrible but not unbearable.
good,"At the Service Desk, you did anything from sending money to other people in the U.S. or other countries, to returning merchandise that is not right for the customer or was defective. Sometimes we would ring up the customers orders of merchandise that they got in the store, to help out the cashiers on the floor. We would help security out on a daily basis, based on activity and stolen items being returned. We would have to keep a good pace up, because sometimes you are all alone up there with a long line of customers waiting on you. Hardest part was that prior sentence. Being all alone with a lot of customers was crazy. Hopefully management would come help out or send someone, sometimes not. Loved meeting new people and helping them out anyway that i could."
good,very interesting learned new things every day loved assisting customers and feeling a sense of pride for my department.  always changing employment structures and rules. did not promote associates fairly showed lots of favoritism
good,"es un trabajo un poco estresante debido al ser un manejo de caja en un super mercado, lo que me gusto es que aprendí sobre el manejo de caja mas afondo y adquirí mas experiencia. lo que no me agrado es que era un empleo temporal y un horario de salida era demasiado tarde."
good,"Daily operation of a large super center including merchandise replenishment and maintaining a grand opening ready facility on a daily basis community involvement, and customer service"
good,I applied for Wal-Mart 3 times and then got a call back. I have only been there for a couple months and it madness. There is so much to do in so little time and the managers always have something to say about it. I did not have a good experience.
good,A typical day being a stocker at walmart is you would come in with a smile on your face to be able to help a customer while at the same time stocking meat or dry products on the shelves. I loved my co- workers
good,"É uma grande empresa, onde se pode ter um plano de carreira conforme o passar do tempo."
good,pretty cool......not much to say but my experience was worth the work. I was paid well enough and they even hired me again. I wish I could go back sometimes.
good,A typical day at Walmart slow during the week . Gained a lot of knowledge from different areas and moving from cashier to supervisor was a smooth transition. Management was not always right on top of things but we still managed to get the job done with great teamwork from coworkers. The hardest part of my job I would say would be when you not a liberty to do more for a customer that has been around loops to get what they need and they are now just extremely over the top out of control. When the end of the day comes it like it was all worth it and you just looking forward to another day.
good,"It's been a while and I'm pretty sure that there's new management, but that was the worst part of the job. Management seemed to gravitate towards those who could be ""encouraged"" to complete the tasks that other employees couldn't (or wouldn't) in addition to their own tasks. This made for an excessively stressful job. The company was great, the coworkers were mostly wonderful, but the management at the time made it difficult to appreciate the positive parts of employment with them."
good,It has been okay working for Walmart some days could  be better. Manangement team don't listen and don't communicate. They need to get help in grocery
good,trabajo de contabilidad administrativa y recabar doctos en diferentes cedes del mismo negocio para realizar el trabajo en tiempo
good,"My typical work day consisted of stocking and making sure that everyone around me was done on time mean I would go provide help if needed. "
good,"It's a good job not a lot of thinking involved, hardest part of the job is learning to stack and move quickly. Definitely good job for a high school grab to college kid"
good,"Hard work. should be young not over 40! you lift boxes ALL day long on a system that TELLS you if you are throwing the boxes fast enough. They call it ""production""."
good,It was a okay job as far as management they could have had a better structure. The hours were great while I was working two jobs always stayed the same schedule. Was overall a okay experience working with them.
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with, the most thing I hate about my job is management, but other than that it is a great company to work for"
good,This store helped teach me how to become a great future leader by showing me everything on how to be an awful one. Most days began with checking email and getting your keys followed by checking up on the front end. During my time here I learned that if you manage to reach a salary position the store owner will not do anything to you no matter what happens or how you treat your the people below you. The store itself was all around a friendly environment. The hardest part of my job was simply the ever changing policy and the mock policy managers would put in place. At times managers would even go against company policy just to help there friends or bend policies to avoid conflicts with other managers. In my opinion this is very unprofessional.The most enjoyable part of this whole job was the drive to work together to finish a task.
good,Most of the managers were useless however my support manager Elwood Blake was fantastic. Honestly he was the only reason I stayed there as long as I did. The upper store management was out of touch and that was annoying and my department managers were horrific people.
good,"they didnt show to much respect to the employees, they dont care bout peoples health, they dont care if you have an excuse or not it counts against you"
good,"Hours were extremely flexible, but everything else was what you would expect when working for such a large corporation. Was easy to learn the job and is good for those entering the workforce."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was getting along with the fellow co workers. Everybody did their job and management was there if you needed help. Good atmosphere.
good,"Talking about electronics, helped with customer purchases. Management was strict but fair. Hardest part of the job was organizing the merchandise. Enjoyed helping customers."
good,"Fulfilling the important role of help an organization customers resolve issues that can reduce their satisfaction with their products and services. Through working with customers, I have also developed the people skills that can be advantageous in a supervisor or training role."
good,It was a fun workplace all except for all the racial discrimination that goes on in the back. If another employee goes and complains to management about being discriminated against there's suppose to be an investigation before doing anything but there never is and the person being accused is automatically terminated without proof of doing anything
good,The customers are a little crazy sometimes and the hours can be long. With the right CSMs though it is a great workplace. Everyone works together and it is a friendly place to work in general.
good,Great place to make money. Great benefits and 401k. Love working in sales and helping customers. Wonderful training to be in management. Always room to grow and work your way up the corporate latter.
good,"My typical day was I came and swiped my card in the back to check in. Then, I found my manager and went to my assigned register for the day to work. Most of the days were great and the customers were awesome. I learned how to work with customers and assist them even with different needs. The management at the beginning was great but once my supervisor left, the management went downhill, which led me to leave. The workplace culture was very diverse. The hardest part of the job was scanning the fruit because sometimes they had no labels. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers with there groceries when they needed help."
good,Good place to make a long term career.  Advancement was possible with a lot of time and commitment.  Company changed values over the years and family no longer existed to its employees.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work. You have ups and downs at every job but they're are more at Walmart! I used to work for Walmart and some of the managers are really understanding however when it comes to assistant and store managers they wont have your back if their is a problem with you and a csm! The benefits are great but the level of stress and time you have to put in to receive them is another story! If you choose walmart go in with a straight mind, stay positive,  stay to yourself, do your work, and go home!"
good,Working there was an ok job. The people are pretty nice and try to work as a team to the best of their ability. Management kinda depends on the person that you will get. Some managers are pretty nice and work with your schedule and try to help you no matter what. Then there are others that don't really care and just want you to work.
good,The job was great at this location.I love their insurance. It was a very stressful job with a lot of peolpe coming in and out all the time.You had to work at a fast pace all the time.
good,I like Walmart a lot its great a place to be if that's you first job but I don't advise any one to be there permanently its good to get you feet wet but I want something that pays more money
good,"It's Walmart. As a company, its not that great. The co-workers were awesome. Middle management does all they can to work with you as an associate to go between upper management and the employees."
good,I liked working at Walmart   it was a nice job. The most part i liked about it was zoning straightening up what the customers messed up.  I enjoyed helping customers find what they were looking for.
good,It's a good job to start off with. It's some good workers also. Some mangers are also real good helpers if you ask for help. Wal Mart main focus is to keep their customers happy.
good,Latest technologies fast paced environment.  Good place to work in the local community. Enjoy learning about this company and their logistic system. Bonuses are given for good work very  good company
good,"Depending on where you work, WalMart is a good job. If you work in White Plains, you get a lot of unprofessionalism. They treat the store like they're at home"
good,"Not a bad place to work, What is good for me, might not be good for other. I'm looking for another Job because I want to focus on my field od study and also get off the road to stay close to my wife and kids."
good,walmart is a very good place to work because they have very flexiable hours and good pay but they are very unorganized they never hae nothing together and its very unprofessional
good,This was a great way to get my feet wet in the working world by this being my first job. I learned a lot from this company whether good or bad I've carried this experience to each job thereafter as a reminder of where I started and what I took from that experience.
good,"In the 14 years I have worked for Walmart, I find only the younger associates are routinely promoted and the associates that have paved the way are passed over for advancement."
good,"A typical day, usually involved a co-worker calling out or just not showing up where I usually was able to pick up the slack. As often as that happened working for Wal-mart all in all wasn't a bad experience. The best part of the job was the rare moment where a customer made you feel truly appreciated and that's what kept me going into work."
good,"Great place to work , but just looking for something different and more income , great people , and a fun and great learning experience . , I learn lots about costumer service and meet lots of really nice people . The management is good"
good,"Long hrs, lack of upper management communication. I went on personal medical leave due to needing an emergency surgery and i came back from leave. I worked 2 days and then was terminated for attendance."
good,It It wasn't that great kind of boring. It felt like a slave to the system. I honestly stacked meat on the shelves all day long and it made me go crazy
good,Ther is no typical work day at walmart. Every day offers something different weather its job assignments from managers or assisting customers. The hardest part and the most fulfilling part of the job is helping customers. Management is usually very helpful in performing your duties as well as coworkers too.
good,"hustle move and keep going, learned more about dependability from other sales associates and management, you job is to have the answer and procedures to initiate and proceed with daily business and adjust and adapt to any changes from company policies and guidelines as well as direction from upper management."
good,Putting toys back on the sales floor is really busy work. It's 100s of toys that you have to put back . Some days it could be busy some days not. Everyone has to. One together as a whole and help the store kept to its rights appearance for the coustmers.
good,"The main thing to remember about any job in retail is that you will not work set monday to friday hours.  You will work whatever hours they need you to work, or you will not get the hours.  You will work holidays and weekends, and sometimes you will work nights.  If this is ok with you, then Walmart is a great place to go and move up the chain of advancement. If not, look elsewhere."
good,I've worked for better places but it was okay temporary job' the mangers where fair and i never had a problem with any costumers i got along with everybody there so never did i have a problem.
good,"The company Walmart has a great labor atmosphere; unfortunately, the cashier position is specially active and busy most of the time. Even though, it was a good experience to work."
good,The job has many good benefits but wasn't very flexible with schedules to allow for family life.  Walmart has too many mangers and not enough sales floor associates but the associates are friendly and become like family.
good,"I enjoyed learning about the merchandizing industry and the overnight shift.  They worked well with me and my scheduling right off the bat.  Getting our work area set up and utilizing the pallet jacks was really fun especially when the boxes were stacked really high and they would waver back and forth through the aisles.  The shift went by so quickly some nights with us setting goals on how many pallets we would complete that shift.  Two of us managed to get 10 loaded pallets finished.  We would first sort the entire pallet and put everything into carts and then we would spend the other half of the shift unloading the carts and putting the products into their proper places.  It was physically demanding at times but helped me get back into shape fast.  Our lunch breaks were a little too long causing tiredness to set in.  Other than that, I made good friends and learned a new skill."
good,Walmart is a decent place to work for and if you really want to move up you can prove yourself. Advancement opportunities are there but the higher you go up the more responsibilities there are. The benefits are great as well as they match 100% of your 6% 401k contribution and a number of other things. The culture is very established throughout the company but each store carries it differently. Hardest part about being an assistant manager has to be the schedule the long hours and so many days straight it is very draining and the work life balance is not great as a manager.
good,"I only worked there for a month but it was an okay job... management has changed since then so I assume its better."
good,A typical day at work was performing overrides and register drops. I learned that in a managerial role you have to respect and teach associates that were below you. Management was very rude and only seemed to care about the bottom line. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people in which you work with.
good,"Get to work on time , always clock in & out at scheduled time . If you see that a customer is lost always help & make sure that the customer is happy ."
good,I was employed there for almost 14 years. It came with good days and bad days. I was just burnt out on retail and wanted a change. Pay was great and overall the company isnt that bad .
good,"About Walmart:"
good,I go in and we start off with a meeting and then go out and start throwing freight in the asigned area of the store that im asigned i learned alot from working at walmart like how to be friendly and helpful to i did love the atmospher
good,During my time at Walmart I was happy to meet all the customers good and bad there was a lot of problem solving going on and I loved it because it was a challenge there was also a lot of work to do over at the store which was great because it made time fly by fast the only thing that I did not like is that employees and management was never on the same page and management was so disorganized
good,"Greet all customers, check them out, and thank them for shopping with us. I sometimes helped customers find certain items if they were having trouble. Management would come immediately after I requested for help, they always solved every problem. Workplace was always busy, especially on holidays and beginning of the month. Everything about this job was pretty much easy and common sense. I enjoyed seeing my regular customers the most."
good,Worked as a team I care about the company the customers and my coworkers.I am a cmpassionate . person with a big heart. Im dependable trustworthyand flexible. I love to help people.
good,Wellmy overall experience at wallmart was Farley good the workers where all good they all did there jobs pretty good management was understandingredients it was all a pretty good experience
good,"great home and work life balance"
good,hard work sometimes but your time goes by. you got good managers and bad ones same with associates. A lot of different ways to advance and earn good money.
good,"its what you expect from working at walmart, my experience working there was alright. i didnt like management at all. they had their favorites and really showed it. only benefit is having a discount card after working there for 3 months."
good,"Wal-Mart is an awesome company. I guess it all depends on which store you work with. A typical day at Wal-Mart is tiresome, and overwhelming. I learned that to be recognized you have to take action yourself. Nobody is there to help or save you. If you want something done you have to do it. Management at MY store is unbelievably ridiculous. I have never met people with absolutely no respect for others. They aren't there to help you or help you persue in your career if anything they rather see you fail. The hardest part of the job is having to do everyone else's job, but your own. The best, and most exciting part of the job is the relationship you build with the customers."
good,A typical day at work was eight hours a day dealing with customers and running and learning all parts of the entire store. Its a great opportunity as along as your willing to help.
good,"This job is pretty much nothing but customer service at times. No matter where you are in the store if you are an employee you are pretty much expected to know where everything and anything is and all about it, at least thats what the customers expected at times. Overall a pretty good company to work for if you don't like good benefits."
good,I would clock in and i would go to my department.I would find my department manager.how to change price.They where helpful sometimes.They treat people the same.When you don't know how to do something.Learning knew things to me
good,aunque las actividades para realizar exeden  generalmetne el tiempo de jornada y exige compromiso  extra para poder  cumplir completamente con lo que se requiere.
good,Working at the distribution center isn't the worst job I've had. The pay is decent and the benefits are ok. Rules are always subject to change without prior notice and you do not get a say in the matter. They recently took away paid holidays and made it so calling off on a holiday is a huge hit to you and can easily lead to termination.
good,"Must be high energy and ready to work with all kinds of  people."
good,Walmart would be a great place to work if the managers and higher up cared about their employees. If higher up showed more gratitude towards their employeess then more work would be accomplished.
good,"Eles não dão espaço para os funcionários,vivem sobre pressão e julgamentos errados."
good,Get directed priority checklist from supervisor. Complete top three tasks.  Break. Zoning for an hour due to waiting on other co-workers to perform their tasks. Next three tasks.  Lunch for an hour. Complete remainder of priority list.
good,"I am a team leader and motivated  exemplar. I dedicate my time appropriately. A typical work day for me is to walk in ready and positive to get the job done, and to help others. I would say the hardest part of the job will be the training. I am a fast learner and always ask questions for tasks that I don't understand. The most enjoyable would be going in confident, and ready to get the job done right with my friendly felloe employees"
good,Working in the pharmacy setting is a good position. You learn a lot of health and wellness products. The customers are generally nice and the work is not complicated or too intense. The coworkers are great and management is flexible and understanding. The pay is good and the hours are flexible. It's a good position for students.
good,"Su paga es muy mínima , a los trabajadores les piden mucho cuando el pago es muy poco , las autorizares no colaboran para que el trabajador se sienta cómodo"
good,It is a great company to work for.  There is a lot of room for advancement and they try to promote from within.  You can move departments and learn a lot of new skills.
good,"I love Walmart. It is a good place to work and benefits are great. The only issue I have is that there is not as much team work as they make it seem.  It is suppose to be a team work kind of company, but there are a lot of problems with workers and management not doing any type of team work. They only go by the rules we are suppose to have when corperate comes to visit."
good,Funcionarios felizes outros nem tanto trabalha fds mas é bom
good,A typical day at wal-mart could be unsafe. Wal-mart in my opinion was not very good at screening who they hired. I thought they cared more about money and production then the employees. Management would replace you very easy if you didn't make rate. I didn't care much for the culture. I learned that not every place is a safe place to work at.
good,No work life balance. Great room for advancement. Company working on improving lots of aspects of the job. I really enjoyed working with the different groups and individuals that I had the privilege of working with on a day to day.
good,A place to kick start your career. I enjoyed working since I was a student and wanted experience. Only problem I had with the management was time schedule. They never matched my school timings with that of job. Hence I had to quit.
good,For the job I was doing the post was not enough I feel my department should make 20+ an hour as strenuous as the work is and add much money as Walmart consumes.
good,"Job security with Wal Mart was amazing, the management team was usually too busy when you needed them. The hardest part of the job was that the store only closed on Christmas Day."
good,Wal-Mart had a nice and friendly work environment and culture.  The hours were inconvenient at times. I enjoyed tree ability to purchase Wal-Mart stock and management was very catering.
good,"Working here overall was pretty fun. Management wasn't no nice or helpful. Besides being asked to function without taking breaks sometimes, the hourly rate we were being paid was horrible"
good,"Most days are very busy, not much down time. The hardest part of my job is completing additional tasks; not because of poor time management on my part but because of the lack of other staff unwilling to pull their own weight. I enjoy the customer interaction."
good,"In the beginning of working for Walmart they were who they said they were. Providing a good living for their employees. Slowly, through the years they have taken away pay and benefits and changed how time off is paid out and taken away time off days. They pay an average wage but could do more for there employees guaranteeing more productivity."
good,"Its okay, just walmart, they need to do better with the attitudes of some of the cahiers, i wasnt happy there at all, i had to involve Corporate a few times"
good,Management was the only issue. They were not on the same page. Some wanted you to do this others just didn't respect what you did for the company as an employee.
good,"Working there was certainly interesting, but not my cup of tea. When working on the register in my cashier position, often some of the other cashiers would walk off and i would be stuck with a line because of it. Management didn't take care of that problem as well as I would like them to."
good,"passava compras de alimentos,eletroeletronicos,roupas,brinquedos,materiais escolares,utencilios domesticos,sac,atendia telefone,recebia faturas,fazia recargas de celular,ajudava na organizaçao da loja."
good,"I was with Walmart for several years, and I am very grateful for the opportunity. It's a great place to advance quickly with the company."
good,"Overworked, underpaid. Work environment was good and comfortable. Management was the biggest issue and recycling associates for minor reasons."
good,"The typical day at Walmart, is clocking in, finding out your days tasking and following through with them. You cover breaks, fill in at other departments, stoking your department, and if your department had a register, running it. Management wasn't always the greatest, as some were only there to put in their time. There was managers you'll love working for and with. Work place was great, and never had a problem with it. Hardest part of the job, was bouncing around to different departments, and trying to learn them as fast as you could, to supply the best customer service that you could. The most enjoyable part of working there, is the people you work with, you'll make great friends, and will make the job all so worth it."
good,"I had a fun time working at Walmart. I met lots of new people and built new relationships. The most enjoyable part of the job was creating relationships with customers and employees. Sometimes, it was hard to get things done because we were short staffed. But overall working for Walmart was a great experience."
good,Long hours with pay that is not equivalent for entry level workers. The work environment is good with a family type feel to it. Much of the time spent is labor.
good,"The shift starts at 10 p.m and typically gets over at 6:30 or 7:00 a.m. I learned how to stock and zone. The hardest part of the job is figuring out the register but once you get it down it is fine. Management is good. The most enjoyable part of the job, would be the co-workers."
good,"Stocking shelves.  I learned a lot about customer service and how to properly serve customers.  Management were easy going and fun to work with.  Workplace had a bit too much drama for my taste, but ignoring it proved to be a fitting response.  The most difficult part of this job would be the huge crowds on Black Friday.  Th most enjoyable part of the job was some fun times."
good,My hours are reasonable the other employees are friendly but management can be problematic on the grocery side of the store. The work pace is a bit more faster in the meat department than in other departments of the store.
good,The overall job was fantastic along with the co workers. The management was somewhat good. The customer were giving compliments to different co workers. Every day was a new adventure to see what needs to be done.
good,"I utilized most of my sociable people skills here because of the large amount of diversity. The management was not not what it should have been but I loved the environment,"
good,"enjoyed organize & pricing new items to put on shelves, customer service, enjoyed how well we all worked together as a team.  If you helped others at work, then they would return help as needed."
good,I've never work here before but I'm more than willing to learn. I can work as long as needed. I would really like the chance to work here and would much  appreciate the chance.
good,"A great place to work, and move up the ladder. You can also travel with this company. I worked in varies areas for this company and I had fun doing and helping the customers."
good,I have always worked with customers for majority of my life I have great experience in that very positive workplace enjoy working with others love being on a team that can work well by myself
good,Wal-mart has good benefits. I was able to achieve a full-time position within the first year of my employment. They also participate in a myshare quarterly bonus.
good,Muy buen lugar para trabajo y pues excelentes espacios. Comedor un lugar donde te puedas desestresar en tu hora de comida y muy buenos compañeros.
good,"Job was decent but stressful. The benefits were a plus as they offered good medical care and a nice 401k pension plan. Employees are not loyal to the company and complain they don't receive a fair pay for work demanded by managers. Walmart is the one company that evaluates every year to each different store to see if pay needs to be increased to employees. During my time as Assistant manager, my employees received a pay increase every year and the company offers a great pension plan."
good,"Working at walmart taught me a lot and i think its a very good part time job to have. Co-workers are great and we all bonded over the dumbest things but love them none the less. Hardest thing was dealing with very impatient and rude customers, but other than that really good experience."
good,Working for walmart is alright. The hours are more consistant. management is very fair. room for advancment in the store.
good,"As I was working as an employee in the electronics section of the store, I had been dealing with customers who were pleasant and non-pleasant."
good,"Always busy and you get to meet a lot of great people everyday working at Walmart but you will always have your good and bad days, work is easy just have to stay busy and working"
good,"Walmart was a cool place to work for many years. However, under new management, Walmart business is going down the drain now. It appears that good job ethics along with respectfulnesss in the workplace and professionalism as well are not taking place as it should on every job. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there at the moment until things have changed under new management for the best of everyone in society because Walmart has people working in a hostile environment which is against the law and is dangerous to everyone's well being. Call 1(800) WALMART if you have any concerns! God bless y'all and good luck on success in your careers."
good,"Great environment, gave me alot of hours. The Co workers were OK but it's good to work to yourself to maintain a position.Would love to be back part of a winning team if granted the opportunity."
good,"Aside from the weird hours I was working I really didn't mind working there. I do have to say that if your not dedicated to your position with the company then there is no use applying there. I admit it does have a high turnover rate, but if you stick with your job and keep doing good at it, then you'll advance quickly. There are many perks to working at Walmart. After 90 days you and your better half get a discount card that is good on everything EXCEPT food."
good,All staff is great. Business is just usually busy. The managers work very hard to help associates. They were very nice and encouraging.
good,"I basically greeted the customers, scanned items, made sure everything is correct on the screen, ask them if they need anything else. Converse with co workers, get my job done, make sure customers are happy & pleased."
good,"Walmart has great benefits. It is a great place to work. I have met and grown to love many people that shops at Walmart. If you are a person that is looking to move up in management. Walmart would be a great place to move up quickly, because they are constantly grown and looking for new people to bring great opportunities to the company."
good,"Working for walmart has been a great job but some bosses play favorites a little to much. It makes our lives much harder when they work and just makes you want to quit. Overall the job it self is not hard and the pay is decent. The co workers are very helpful and know how the place works better. The hardest part has to be dealing with the favoritism of the management staff, It just makes your job so hard when you cant do anything right when certain people are present."
good,You are basically there for one job and you need to expect to hurt. Its a great job for anyone who can handle pain and work fast.
good,I like working it pays off and got to have money to survive when you got a family and a girl friend that might end up been my wife got to make sure my kids goes to college that's a fact
good,"Besides the driving distance, it was an a place. I meant wonderful people, who I still speak with. Management was not very understanding. A typical day at work was very busy."
good,"this isnt a bad place to work, I really wish i kind of stayed around, and pursued assistant manager position or maybe even went to school if I got into a spot where i knew how a business was ran."
good,"Can be a fair place to work if you are attending school. They try to be flexible with employees if they have children by allowing you to work day or night. The work is not hard work for the most part, but it can be very busy work. Most of the management are pretty fair with employees. The co-workers tend to be friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is having to stock a double truck of merchandise in a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is receiving bonuses."
good,"Ringing customers up and bagging groceries, but the hard thing about Walmart is getting to use the restroom or taking breaks on time due to individuals forget about the other workers."
good,"Walmart pays the employees big time, just in the sort of benefits that is business with in the company. So holiday pay was replaced with food and some will even offer the employee perishable discounts on Walmart stuff. This plays out as a sort of slavery to the company. "
good,"Always busy, and people bustling to get groceries. Lots of agitated and easily angered customers. "
good,"I only worked there less than two months, but in the time I was there, it was very fast paced and everyone was really bossy and yelled a lot if I was going to slow. I was very new to the work world so I was still getting used to it. I had to quit due to personal issues so I did not really get to experience it to the fullest."
good,"Working over night is one of my favorite shifts. "
good,"It is big format in Bharat Walmart,there very family and customer relationship is very good.and there all magement tim every one supported. Everyone beleav on your stoff and goodness."
good,"This is a great place to start a career within the company. Every job/career has it's pros and cons. There is no job work/life balance. The schedule is always iffy it is subject to change any time the business see's fit so if you make plans to spend time with your family that probably won't happen. You hardly ever get two consecutive days off in a row so the days off aren't really enjoyable. You are always open 7 days a week until 9:00 o'clock and you work most major holidays so a lot of time is spent working rather than getting to enjoy family. You spend a lot of time getting screamed at and cussed out by customers and management is not really empathetic about the situation because they are not taking the phone calls. Also they hire outside supervisors instead of promoting within so you play second fiddle to someone who has never stepped foot in your department until they are hired and you train your supervisor so it easily upsets you because you feel you are not good enough. Besides that the company does try to work to make sure we do have days that are unlike any other employer . We do have days set aside to do something special such as nacho day, chili day, crazy sock day, costumes on Halloween, etc.There are all staff meeting where associates are acknowledged for hard work and dedication and there is plenty of opportunity to advance within the company. You also get PTO."
good,"Best thing I can say keep to yourself and make sure you do your job to the best of your ability, Also in a timely fashion. Don't  allow others foolishness interfere with your success."
good,Whilst the job itself was good the management never appreciated what you done for them but were quick to criticise your bad points.
good,"I loved working at walmart. you can start as a cashier and down the line become a member of mangament. working with people everyday , helping customers, the discount is a bonus."
good,Good job but they don't give you enough people for your department. So you have to do a three mans job and your only one person. You also have to go overnight for weeks a year.
good,"Working for Walmart is good far as benefits go & building experience but only problem is you have to be on your p's & q's daily to keep your job. we had a problem in OT so my 2nd shift mgr told ALL 2nd shift associates to leave no later then 11, the 3rd shift mgr asks me & another employee to stack 2 pallets of water to help 3rd shift out before we leave but the problem comes in at he asked us at 10:54 need i remind you ALL 2nd shift employees are to leave at 11. So me & the other guy stack what we can & leave at 11, next day come he writes me up saying i didnt listen to what a mgr asked me to do even though my mgr told 2nd shift to stay no later then 11. So i got wrote up for listening to my mgr & not another mgr thats not even in charge of 2nd shift."
good,I worked there for 6 years it pays my bills Health Care through the company. The company is not a bad company to work for it's just the management of the store that you're working yet
good,It was a good learning experience. The supervisors rapport may vary depending on your connection and work ethic. Overall it was a fair job.
good,"WMS Supermercados do Brasil, é uma empresa muito grande, com certeza existe muitos problemas para serem ajustados. Mas com o porte e número de funcionários que existem nela hoje, achei um ótimo lugar para se trabalhar, cresci e aprendi muito com ela. Me desenvolveu não someto como um profissional mas também como a pessoa que sou hoje."
good,got there around nine every morning. I learned how to clean and get carts and assist people in need. Co-workers were great. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees they were kind.
good,"Poor communication."
good,I didn't like it. I loved the people I worked with. The benefits were okay. I didn't really get anything from them because I didn't use them.
good,"A typical day at Walmart as a Customer service manager could be considered a headache. however, over time you get use to it, the culture of the job is great but customer can be somewhat hard to deal with, because the live off the saying the customer is always right.  Job advance is mostly giving to the people who are favored, not earned. Your hard work is overlooked by your mistakes. management fire more than they educate associates. With all that said the best part of the is working with your co-workers, over time it became a family and develop a since of pride and honor for the store you work for to achieve your goals."
good,It was a fast paced job I knew what the goal was everyday unload the truck at a decent time. The hardest part was sometimes we had 3 trucks and were short handed but still got the job done. I learned how to operate the electric pallet jacks and walkie lift also how to use the bale. I loved the fast paced work and the fact that we stayed bust most of the time.
good,Hardworking days stocking shelves and helping customers. I met many coworkers and became lifelong friends with some of them. Management was ok but could have been better to their employees.
good,"-Typical day? Go to the daily meeting, check your tasks, complete those tasks all while giving customers excellent service and assistance."
good,"Mucho trabajo te exigen."
good,"most of the job duties was basic, stock shelves, tend to customers. store #84 was probably the best location for the time i was there"
good,Not the greatest place to work for.Its alright but management is terrible.Whether you do something wrong or not they don't care.You'll be blamed.The hours are awful & so is the pay.
good,"Working with walmart was a great experience. I learned a lot of various skills there. The hardest part about working with walmart was the shoe pallets. Sometimes we had 5 full shoe pallets and we had to work them all in one shift. My managers were very supportive in helping me find my way and teaching me the routine of walmart. The shifts were the best thing i liked about the job. The shifts were long, but very productive. it was never a day where i had to pass the time."
good,Wal-Mart is a good entry level job with plenty of opportunities for growth in position and experience. The training is thorough and pretty decent when you actually have time to follow through with it. Most of the manager's were helpful when they had time to help. Overall I would recommend someone to work for Wal-Mart.
good,Overall Walmart has been a good experience. The benefits a good. Management will work with you if there are family emergencies. The hours and pay are competitive in the community.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers. I also enjoyed being able to display great customer service with respectful verbal skills while helping customers and also answering multiple phone lines.
good,i start work walmart 2009 day time sale associate after 3 years i change over night stocking and loading unloading still the same job it is really like it but i went to change different job.
good,"What i have learned working over the years is Being Productive,Great Customer Service Skills, Energetic,Management Skills, Microsoft Word,Excel,Saftey Skills, Product Management, Sales. i Love working with other as well as Training Myself and fellow Employees. Sometimes deadlines can be stressful but overcome in a timely matter. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,it is a great place to work i learned a lot while working there the employees r great people i made a lot of friends and meet a lot of people the customers were great
good,"Sinto muito por nao fazer parte da mesma,onde aprendi a desenvolver minhas qualidades e fortalecendo a União em equipe,superando as metas do dia a dia."
good,good place to work great employees learned alot about produce most enjoable part was working with the other produce associates
good,"Wal-Mart has great discounts, you get fantastic benefits. You get your two breaks and lunch, you stock when there's no customers around so you can get your job done quicker. It is a good job to start with."
good,Everyday is different and fast pace. Overall company is a good place to work and advance. Work is hard at times and job is very demanding.
good,The days were hectic but also pleasant. To me I felt that the customers made me the person I am today. I have learned to value the customers opinion before making my final decision. overall Walmart motto the customer is always right.
good,I worked at Walmart for over a year and thought it was a fun job. It became stressful at times when I needed to travel and couldn't and I missed out on pretty much ALL of my family's holidays. I had knowledge of the entire GM side and was able to work in any department as well as cashier. If you know how to cashier it was mandatory that you did it despite being from the floor. It was stressful not being able to do my job because of it.
good,"Soporte de sistemas, manejo de Reportes e indicadores de venta, supervisión de cambios de precio, señalización,Control de inventarios,manejo de reportes de articúlos sin movimiento a 5 semanas, reporte de articulos existencias negativas, cambios de existencia, ajustes en inventarios, facturación, transmición de pago a proveedores, control de gastos, contabilidad basica en transferencias de cuentas contables, Revición en cuentas contables y compras ."
good,"Great managers to work w/. fair yearly reviews. Made some of the best friends w/ some of the coworkers, that i still talk to this day. After 10 yrs."
good,"Walmart is a massive company, and I started in a store that hadn't opened yet. So I wasn't surprised at how much the atmosphere changed within the year I was there. I enjoyed working with the starting management/co-workers and they appreciated my hard work for the most part. Things changed a few months in with new management and employees. I saw instances of preferential treatment, and what I thought to be some questionable decisions with employees as well as customers. Without going into details, I will say I was terminated for a mistake I did indeed make but one that didn't call for termination (and I do mean ""mistake"", nothing to do with dishonesty or corruption. A mistake much less serious then ones made by higher ranking employees who weren't fired). I felt as if I was being pushed out. I was young then, perhaps I should have been more assertive with certain things. I believe they knew they were wrong as they didn't contest unemployment despite the termination sheet claiming they can. These comments are against the management where I worked, not against Walmart in general. I received benefits, raises and advancement opportunities while working there."
good,"At the Derry Wal-Mart, I've met so many amazing people. I enjoyed working with the managers, and my coworkers. The store had such a positive morale, and made it fun to work in."
good,Overall a fun place to work. only became busy a few times a week other then that you were filling the product. Lots of cleaning tasks that must be done daily. job was never boring always something to do.
good,It is very fast and busy. You will always be busy. I learned to balance hectic and chaos when it comes to the many customers. I do like the fact that I was always busy. I like that I could pass most of my time by working and helping customers to the best of my abilities. My co-workers are very helpful and flexible. I think the hardest part about the job is not being able to help everyone especially when it gets busy.
good,"Very productive positive outgoing on time worker. Love meeting new people.."
good,Very busy I have learned alot about stocking and serving customers. I have also learned how to zone shelves. I think the most enjoyable part of my job is working with many different people and cultures.
good,"great benefits -opportunity  for advancement, stock purchase options, insurance,  profit sharing , great co-workers,   management is fairly good but can be slow on acknowledging the hard work of the associates that work hard,"
good,Some days at work be really busy and some day be real smooth.I learn how to change prices and move shevles.I learn how to take care of customers needs and wants.It help me build chatacter and self-discipline
good,"A typical day would be arriving on time to set up for the trucks to be unloaded. Once unloaded, loaded pallets would go to their department. I learned heavy work is fun work. Management had productive ways of getting the job done. Co-workers were friendly and easy to work with. There was no hard part of this job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friends I made."
good,"a typical day at work would be, I go into the store, clock in, push carts around for hours and then the manager would give me other tasks to do."
good,Walmart is productive and fun workplace with a Teamwork environment. The managers are very supportive and outspoken. very clean work space. constant work.
good,the job was physical demanding if you are a hard worker and motivated this is the job for you. the hours are long more so during the Holidays
good,"Overall not bad"
good,"mucho movimiento en los dias martes un gusto por estar movido en el trabajo eso me gusta"
good,"same respect between the employee but not that much withe the management. what i have learn with this company is time management. the hardest part is when the store management delegate work to department managers, and all department managers will come you and asked for help"
good,very nice oplace  had alot of friends there the managers were very nice to me had fun getting discounts on the supplys there very nice people great enviroment
good,"i loved talking and meeting new people every day as well as forming relationships with regular customers. My co workers were wonderful people and management always performed the duties that comes with being upper management. The hardest thing about working there was the constant moving from station to station but, i wouldn't consider it hard."
good,A typical day at walmart was average unless its the first of the month and during holiday shopping seasons. Ive learned to always welcome customer with a smile and willing to help them with no problem.The management there isnt up to par.. My coworkers there were great they always help me when i was stuck with a customer and gave me advice on how to be a better employee. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet customer needs without upsetting them. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet different types of people each day
good,foi um aprendizado.pois fui bem recepsionado e aempresa ta de parabens porque segue as politicas corretamente
good,"Very busy environment, late lunches and breaks. need to hire more employees. Hired as Cashier, but you have to work on the floor when it needed"
good,Walmart is a good job aside from the management playing favorites but they are nice and to get along with.clean store decent break room.
good,"Working with the company for 15 years I've learned a lot and worked in almost every department in the store , management is pretty great there, co- workers are very nice , the only hard thing about the job I would say is preparing for inventory, it can be a little stressful at times but I always make it through, the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet and talk to different customers that come in each day and helping them find what they need to make their shopping a little bit more easy.."
good,When a hard worker comes along they stick them with every single department and help out all the slow people..regardless of health issues.  they just want the job done as fast as possible they do not care for employee well being. Pay was good for the job though just wish the managers wouldnt be afraid of the store manager
good,"I have done just about every position on overnights I can think of besides supervisor. I have worked as a cashier/customer services, I worked as a grocery gm and freezer/dairy stocker; I used to run the backroom as a IMS associate which Walmart got rid of that position I got the mod team position which I went through two weeks of training. I soon after transferred to another location in which no one at the store was properly trained they were just given the job. I have done a lot of supervisory training including training my supervisor."
good,"Always busy, too many managers trying to be the top gun.  Great work place otherwise lots of fun.  Have a lot of company outings.  Great benefits.  Hardest part was keeping up with the customer demand."
good,"Working in almost every department stocking shelves during the overnight shifts was hard, but with the co-workers I had it was mostly fun and enjoyable."
good,"My typical day was setting up my register, making sure it is clean and stocked with bags. Greeting my customers with a smile and a positive attitude. I've had several customers ask for my supervisor to let them know what great customer service I"
good,"come to work complete my tasks enjoy the co workers on the night shift. go home to sleep all day."
good,"after 23 years of honesty and good behavior I was fired by age.and I "
good,"As atividades rotineiras era limpar,precificar abastecer."
good,the culture is great! if management knew the issues employees had with their supervisors the workplace would be better. supervisors allow a large select group to walk and talk and play around all day but when another crew members does the same for a minute you get pulled aside and threatened to be terminated
good,Walmart was a good place to work. It was very hard work in the back room receiving merchandise. The pay was not that great though. The work was rough and the employees should be paid more.
good,overall i loved my job it showed me alot then just begin a cashier it showed me how to make people happen even if there not havin a not so good day
good,A typical day at work sucked. i loved my co workers but the management was horrible. they do not care about their employees as much as they say.I cashiered for 8 hours a day 4 days a week. You don't get benefits unless full time and they tell you otherwise. hardest part was dealing with stress. customers are always rude and managers are never helpful. best part of my job was checking out people who made me laugh and told me to keep my chin up because they believed in me. i loved my regulars.
good,"Typical workday was to check the back room to see if there was fresh freight that needed to be worked prior to starting on assigned tasks.  After being there for a few months still hadn't been trained on all aspects and tools of the job.  Co workers were supportive, but tended to complain about situations.  Management was easy to talk to, though tended not to follow up on suggestions.  Hardest part of the job was not really knowing what you would be working on due to other management priorities.  Most enjoyable part was the coworkers."
good,Nice company. Decent amount of work but consistent in scheduling. Management is reasonable and it is a very rewarding job. Learn a lot about inventory management.
good,"I've worked here twice, it's ok, if you just do your job and don't screw around you shouldn't have any problems. I got along with pretty much all of my co-workers and the managers."
good,"If you do your job and do not cause problems then you will be satisfied with the experience. That is as simple as it gets. I clock in. I do my job to the best of my abilities and no one would bother me. Some of the customers (as is in any retail situation) can be a bit much to handle, but when handled with care they tend to be easily swayed."
good,"Working for Walmart have its perks , most of which don't kick in till after 6 months. The downside is too many managers , too many opinions and a lot of miscommunication"
good,"Customer Service, Helped customer identify and satisfy their needs in the store."
good,empresa boa para crescimento da muitas oportunidades acolhe os funcinarios muito bem
good,"It is the largest company I have worked for. I don't mind the size, it is just easy to get lost in the world of things here. There is plenty of opportunity to grow in different directions. I moved here in December, 2010. I am looking to move back to the area where my family and friends live. I will be happy to provide further information at your request."
good,"Wal-Mart was a great place to work on a typical day of being a electronics sales associate your going to deal with customers all day long so have to know what you are talking when your helping someone. "
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and with a diversified amount of things to do and get done."
good,"wal-mart kept me on my feet, Which made the time fly by I also loved working there they didn't offer part time workers benefits that was the only bad thing."
good,"It was such a fun and vibrant work space, too bad about the pay and extreme work demands put on the employees. Not my favorite place."
good,"Empresa oferece crescimento constante e oportunidades, temos como apoio a gerencia que nos direciona e desenvolve como profissionais, apesar de termos a rotina do dia administrativo  o dia a dia do varejo é intenso e nunca é igual ao anterior, pois nessa área estamos sempre aprendendo coisas novas, desenvolvemos uma adaptabilidade em encarar mudanças e sair sempre da zona de conforto quebrando paradigmas e seus pontos fortes da cultura Walmart são: atendimento ao cliente, respeito pelo individuo,busca pela excelência e integridade."
good,"was very fast paced work, enjoyable talking and helping customers in any way I was able, the coworkers were nice and friendly to work with and helpful. Training lacked a little would typically set a new person up with a person to train them that they themselves havent been there long enough or had the experience that I feel should have been present in order to train someone new descently and effectively. Pay was reasonable, but bonus and special pay lacked and was unfairly laid out. overall my favorite thing about the job was working with the people, and the constant business the environment had to offer."
good,"I enjoy my job, and the hours and wages are fair. I learned much of how Wal-Mart is run. They have a big turn-over in employees."
good,"cook food and help customers in the deli area, help the get best shopping experience. had one of the best experience but was not something i was passionate about"
good,"I worked at Walmart for 4 years & it was a very challenging job. A typical day at work was busy, & meeting new people. I learned how to use a Gemini (handheld computer). My co-workers: Some were great & a lot I could do without! Dealing with all the different attitudes was the hardest part of the job. Becoming friends with the customers was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,typical day at was the same just had to learn the patterns of work flow and learn your craft well to be able to handle a lot of customers and to fix mistakes quickly management is there to help you and will help suite you to an area where you perform the best the most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and the hardest part was getting use to the pace of work it constantly shifts and isn't constant pattern from day to day
good,a good company to work for. you stay busy and the day goes by fast. i learn to be a better person and stand up to people and not let them run over top of me
good,Working at Walmart you have to have communication. Everything is about communication mangers will work with you if you talk to them.
good,"Excellent travail pour un jeune étudiant"
good,"As OTC manager I provided Pharmacist assistance inside and outside the pharmacy.  Scheduled employee hours, placed orders as needed.  Made sure shelves were neat and orderly and full.  As the pharmacy tech I received the prescription from the patient/customer, entered information into the computer then filled the prescription set it aside for pharmacist to check to ensure correct medications were pulled then ran register to cash customer out."
good,"Mucha actividad."
good,"Arrive on time to switch off the next employee"
good,"I enjoy working at Wal-Mart. Co-workers are nice to work with. Management associates are always changing. Current management has been at this store approximately one year or less. "
good,"overall I great job for high school and college students I worked at Walmart right out of high school. very flexible and positive environment, cant say the same in todays age and time."
good,I really dontg have much to say the were a great job great paying but to be a work place could have kept a lot of personal drama out of the workplace
good,"A typical day at work is not always typical.  A plan may be made ahead for yourself but upon arrival management may have other ideas and priorities for you.  Customers always help in deciding what you accomplish for your day also because they are number one and require your first attention.  Working here takes a very versatile person.  Something I much enjoyed about my work."
good,"no weekends off isn't good, work goes by fast , co-workers do what they want, i like being busy. theres always something to do but i don't like the fact that people don't complete there assignments on time"
good,"Management style has a lot to be desired. Other than that the environment is clean and safe, the fellow associates all get along. The hardest part of the job is getting the task finished in their desired time. I learned in this field discipline and respect goes a long way."
good,"Walmart has been a great company to work for over the past 4 years.  I started with the company when I was in college and was able to quickly advance to become a customer service manager.  My co-workers are like a second family.  The management at the store level is also very supportive of building a strong team.  "
good,"fun easy going workplace, overnights is a bit harder on your immune system and overall performance and often gives you no time to do much. co workers are always friendly and help."
good,"Dealing with a lot of customers every hour of the day, helps me be more of a ""peoples person"". Co-workers respect other. The most enjoyable part of the job is to know that i helped satisfy a customer. Management very supportive."
good,A typical day at work would be greeting and socializing with customers as i ring up their items. co-workers were nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers.
good,I had the advantage to learn many skills and I progressed at this job. I had lots of opportunities to accede in different traits with  this company.
good,When I first started working for Walmart i began as a stocker. I would go to the back room where the IMS workers would pick items that needed to be stocked. I would walk all day through out the store putting items on shelves and also assist customers with whatever they needed. after four months management moved me to overnight due to understaffed shift. while on overnight I was in charge of what most associates called the hardest job. I would stock paper and chemical items which in total accounted for six pallets of stock. A month later I was to be moved back to day stocking. Management tried to keep me on overnight because they said I was doing excellent work. When I came back to day shift I was moved to Downstocker. that job title means I was responsible for unloading the walmart truck and dividing the stock for the overnight shift. I still hold this job title for Walmart.
good,"Great employee's. However, higher management not involved enough. Great benefits, good pay, and bonuses. I learned retail can be fun. I also learned a lot about Inventory Management."
good,"Staying busy helping out where I can, work hard learn from others ask questions. The hardest part getting busy having no help are having an issue and no one caring not feeling respected. The most enjoyable making new friends and running into old ones."
good,"It was a good workplace the managers were professional and understanding. The employees were welcoming. I had a good working experience with Walmart. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, they were amazing and nice. I have excellent communication and interpersonal skills that made it easier for me to communicate with the customers on a personal level. There was a lot of multi- tasking involved at this Job and helped me to become more better at multi-tasking."
good,Work consisted of longer hours and shorter days. Walmart is a good company but Our store manager were typically ran by employees rather than working with them.
good,"I would unload trucks and restock shelves, conduct inventory on a monthly basis, and build shelving units. Check dates on food and dairy items as well. Organize storage."
good,Learned responsibility And Tried my hardest to get The Truck Done on time. The People where kind and Friendly Hard Workers.
good,"I learned a lot working at Wal-Mart I have worked with retail company, but never a big supercenter. I have worked with so many different personalities daily and working in a supercenter you get to see people that you haven't seen in a while because everybody loves Wal-Mart"
good,great place to bulid a career. Management is very strict but stay on task. You learn fast and with the help its much easier than being stuck on your own. The most enjoyable part would be meeting new people and growing with your team mates.
good,"As a customer service manager my primary duties revolve around assisting customers with various inquiries regarding store policies as well as concerns that may arise, managing the Service Desk, Cashiers and Courtesy Associates as well handling the Money Center and Money Gram services. I have been working for Wal-Mart for three years and started off as a cashier in 2012, I was quickly promoted to service desk and became familiar with Wal-Mart returns policies and Money Center Express services (wiring money through the use of Money Grams). Our management team prides itself in providing a fast and friendly service to the customers as well as maintaining a safe and open working environment. The CSM's (Customer Service Managers) have the largest and what is considered to be one of the most important teams in the store; it is our sole purpose to expedite customers through the checkout process in a polite and friendly manner while keeping the front end clean. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing people smile after they've had a long day and knowing that we were able to provide them that smile with our services."
good,uma empresa que te da a oprtunidade de crescer profissionalmente
good,"Foram momentos de aprendizagem."
good,"I would recommend working at Wal-mart for a good first job. They don't all treat you nicely, but their willingness to talk to associates who are having problems is really nice."
good,a okay place customers number one priority not so cozy with coworkers but a fun environment very tedious job very but good money and a source of income
good,"The work environment was very fast paced which was a plus. The managers were very easy going and willing to work with you if you showed great work ethic plus a lot of people that I knew personally worked there and came to shop in the store, so it made it fun going to work everyday. The hardest part of the job was working with people who weren't happy in the work place and were lazy."
good,"Most days where pretty normal. I clock in, we have a staff meeting, and then we go get our freight and start stocking. I how to prioritize my time much better. Management was okay, but could've been much better. Job wasn't hard at all."
good,I loved working at Walmart. I just wish I was able to better manage working there and taking care of my children. I moved on to a job that was within the current time frames of  my childrens school.
good,"It's ok, I guess. Not the greatest place to work at but I won't trade for anything else. Some co-workers are accommodating and I love all my customer both the good and not so much. I like it because most employees over there knows how to handled themselves. But most of the managers are a duchbags. All they care about it themselves and their employees. Other than that I think work at Walmart is very great."
good,"fue una muy buena experiencia laboral, un buen equipo de trabajo, buenas condiciones laborales"
good,They watch there shoppers shop which makes them uncomfortable management gets disrespectful at times never know when you'll get fired no matter how hard you work
good,"Worked diligently as a cashier. Performed an assortment of cash handing responsbilities. Managed credit cards, checks, and cash."
good,"The management team could use some work but overall a very enjoyable place to work. The work isn't difficult, but for a hard worker such as myself the tasks can be a bit tedious. As you work there you learn a lot more about the things in your department being a heavy user of electronics i knew a lot going in but know even more now going out. The management team could do a little better as far as communication goes but other than that they do a very good job at holding everything to high standards.  One of the hardest, but if done correctly one of the most enjoyable, parts of the job is Customer service and knowing exactly how to help, or explain things to the customer. But with the right coworkers you can find a perfect balance in switching out between the team to suit the customers needs."
good,"ao chegar os serviços eram designados a cada operador  em seus caixas com o tempo que fiquei na empresa aprendi a me comunicar melhor com publico e contagem de cédulas."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place if you are in you are in a good place. From my personal experience Wal-Mart would be alright if the corporate system was not implement on them. Some people who normal be cool changes because of their position. And it seems to happen to everybody. And the people that are working harder always seems to have the lowest pay. I'm the cart pusher so people assumed I was getting pay more. I was working in 100 degree temperature and working alone for months, but when I told them that i made minimum wage lowest in the entire building they where shocked. There were days when it was too hot, too cold, and too rainy, yet I still work alone. I ask them to fixed the machine to help me with carts but it never happen. Trust me I asked for them to hire someone and they just kept giving me excuses. As soon as I leave they hire three people and fixed the machine I was asking them to fix so it can be easier pushing the carts."
good,"Working at walmart was a great experience, very simple job with great benefits! It was relatively quiet throughout the night, so the distractions were minimal. A typical night at work consisted of a lot of bending, lifting and of course, organizing the merchandise you stock as you go."
good,Great Coworkers great managers and work with your schedule as long as it's school based. Has a decent benefits program.
good,Start time is 5 am as soon as i clock in I start to each for tool from my coworkers and I If there is any. Supervisors Clocks in at 7 am but taking the supervisors role is a hard nor bad thing when you have great coworkers but thats not the case. After 7 am I report to supervisors to on the status on what is going on from the time we started. I have learned to deal with 8 supervisors asking you to do so many things at once and take the role of a supervisors.
good,"I was able to work along side police officers daily, and this prompted my interest in law enforcement/security. This also gave me the idea to enlist in the Marine Corps."
good,"At times working at walmart could be very stressful however, talking to customers and helping them was something i found rewarding about working there. I didn't like that my customer service didn't matter as much as how quickly i serve my customers but walmart does get a lot of customers so i guess it's understandable."
good,"A typical day at work requires me to manage employees, quality, security, budgets and planning. Train, hire, evaluate and promote personnel in all departments within retail establishment. Collaborate with company executives to promote increased sales, business, and expand the company."
good,"A typical day at Walmart included greeting customers, locating products, price-checking items, and organizing store shelves and displays. I would also answer customer questions about policies, services, and products. I learned new functions and better enhanced my organizational skills. My co-workers were easy to get aling with and team players in my department. I didn't find my job challenging at all and actually caught onto everything quickly, I enjoyed the organizational part of my the most. Help handling shipments and merchandise."
good,This company can be great to learn the basics of customer service and retail general skills. Management can be messy but bearable.
good,i loved it I loved the people typical day going getting on register to start my day with costumers I learned to do wics n handle money better
good,A typical day at Walmart is going in dealing with nice & some rude costumers. Meeting new people & always learning new things. The hardest part of my job is untangling buggies. It can be stressful & can hurt. The most enjoyable part is seeing new faces.
good,"I really enjoyed the bonuses quarterly because my store rocked, my coworkers were fantastic, and I loved it. "
good,"Hired part time, mostly work 35 hrs per week, I have learned a great deal. We have great co workers and we try to support and help each other when possible. I enjoy the customers and try to assist them in any way possible and the customers are most appreciative. I have missed my other job and do not feel creative so I am looking to relocate to another company."
good,"Depending on what day or what time of the month it is, a typical day is coming to work with a positive attitude because I'm going to be in the front being involved with he customers. I would make sure the isle is clear presentable stocked front faced so that special or clearances will get noticed. Also it is required for me to distribute tobacco sells. In my line there is tobacco products and there is no other line that hold the same merchandise for purchase. In order to make a appropriate tobacco sale is for me to know the rules and regulations to selling tobacco and alcohol or any other products that prohibit underage from purchasing. Also every shift I work on a specific our when customer service closes I would assist the supervisor in collecting all money that was collected that day from the entire store"
good,"I worked the overnight shift. That did not slow down the flow of traffic in the least, as we were a very large scale store that stayed open 24/7. I learned valuable lessons in time management and customer service."
good,I would unload trucks on to rollers then onto pallets and take to the floor to its correct location i loved it considered getting paid to work out that was my motivation and hoping to find another similar job again soon.
good,"a typical day at walmart is having great customer service, stocking all merchandise that is unloaded off the trucks zoning and sometimes helping cashiers out."
good,"O trabalho é agradável, aprendi como organizar um estoque manusear o rádio frequência, gostei muito da direção da empresa dos meus colegas de trabalho, a parte mais difícil do trabalho era estrechar os pallets quando estava sozinho, Já a parte agradável era  quando estava na separação de alimentos para o embarque."
good,"did not receive many hours, the work was easy, the hardest part of the job was being in the heat filling trailers. the break room was awesome"
good,"The work environment varies depending the management at each store. The benefits are ok considering the jobs take little to no skill. Provides training that you may not be able to find elsewhere with most ""entry"" level jobs."
good,"Fun place to work, just didn't feel like it was meaningful to me.  Has a lot of good benefits, but didn't have it so I could stay full time when I switched facilities when I moved."
good,Lots of standing cashier work and great customer service. co-workers all kinds of fun people and management is great patient an caring. Hardest part is standing for so long but breaks are giving and the store is so big you will enjoy the environment itself.
good,"Customer Service"
good,"really liked working here, only stopped because I had a baby, but when I came back...they changed to whole office, less people working, bigger work load"
good,"I learned alot from the different co-workers, multi-cultural staff, always helping each other.  Management was easy to get along with and to work with.  Love interacting with the customers assisting them in any way, bagging purchases, cash/debit/credit purchases"
good,"Great Company to work for, high satisfaction guaranteed for customers, good benefit, it offered fair open door policy to keeping a good relationship between members. However, failed to response to lesser details in providing honesty. Some of the managers are abusing the system in favor of  their own goods, rather than doing the right things.The work ethic or  policy is absurd, symbolizes ""a slave driver."" It is truly archaic, catastrophic the working situation at a certain  point in some stores; employees are being timed up to do their tasks, which are more often way beyond human ability or capacity just  to exceed their expectations.  Cashiers are being sometimes kept from doing their physiological needs, just to serve customers or to  get the cash in. A highly disparity rate in the way employees are being treated with respect to their race, gender, and nationality. The sick time eligibility is a joke, employee who is sick has to call out twice to get one day pay and has no right up to seven absences within a period of six months; otherwise he/she would eventually get discharged.   In fact, these above statements are not necessarily general, because some of the stores are different accordingly to the district or the individual in charge. And where the employees may receive positive feedback for what they really deserve. Overall, one cannot say this is the worst company to work for, because it has good and bad aspects or methods, such tendency one may find anywhere or in any other companies . In fact, this  is one of the reasons Walmart is one of the best retails companies in"
good,it was an okay job. I did a lot for a little. I needed to get out and do sometime greater. management was lacking. the most enjoyable part was the lunch hour.
good,I have no complaints about working at walmart. the management there was very helpful and honest. they treated me like family.
good,"Toys was very unorganized and little kids made it hard for up keep so nobody wanted to work in toys. I came to work each day going from aisle to aisle cleaning behind toys and organizing (Zoning) because I held my self personally responsible because i was the only one over there. A customer came in one day and asked ""have you been working here long"" i replied ""No"" and she said ""Well you can tell the difference, Toys looks a lot better."" So I believe I made a positive difference to the store in my time being there."
good,"En esta empresa el área de cumplimiento ambiental, en que me desempeñe es muy nueva, data del 2012 a la fecha por lo cual aún tiene vacíos en la organización de su capital humano."
good,"I loved working for walmart. Most of the employees were nice and easy to get along with, The customers were friendly. Walmart's pay and benefits were also very nice. What I did not like about walmart is the hours and organization that they had. One day you would be working 2nd shift and the next day you would have to turn around and work 1st shift. The computer did the schedules and when you brought your schedule up to a manager they would tell you to see if an employee can switch shifts, if you couldn't find anyone willing to trade shifts you would have to work it. Also there were never any set days off and employees wouldn't have their days off together.  I am looking for a job with more of a set schedule to have a good routine."
good,I enjoyed all the people I worked with. The customers make this job what it is and the associates you work with help you keep yourself going. They are the ones that motivate you.
good,I would rang up customers food items. I would clean my area. I would talk to everyone in the line. I would see different people all the time.
good,The managers do not follow all the rules. Employers do not always follow health guidelines. Not very good vibes and lots of negative in the workers.
good,The hardest part of working for walmart is everyday your schedule is different. The most enjoyable part of working at walmart is you get to meet all kind of people. You also have the opportunity to work in different areas of the store.
good,I have enjoyed all the years I spent working with Wal-Mart corporation. This company has really helped me build my skills as a manager and has helped me become better in my current job. I carry all the management skills I learned at Wal-Mart and use them each day.
good,"The hardest part of my job dealing with rude people. I still loved my job. The co-worker was sometimes rude but, I still love my work enviorment"
good,"everyday is a challenge. The management team assumes that a person can do more than is required by company standards, and if their standards are not met the associate is held accountable. I truly appreciate my co-workers. the hardest part of the job is attempting to reach the standards set forth by management. I most enjoy working along side my fellow teammates."
good,"When you come in, you jump immediately to task, which normally involves tracking down your department manager to get the tasks you are scheduled to do that night. If it goes smoothly, most tasks can be completed rather easily and quickly. One of the major let downs is being register trained. Although I love working with the customers and being their last interaction in the store, they are extremely understaffed on the front end. Almost every night, you are called to the front to help check because there really aren't enough cashiers. Management there is wonderful and really likes to step forward to help the associates and customers fill any needs possible. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers and knowing that I did my best to supply them with the information and help they need"
good,I unloaded truck and put up products in freezer and I would stock shelves also.The management team was great just needed more money to take care of my family. The job is very enjoyable but the hardest part is being in the freezer too long.
good,"Walmart has gotten away from the family belief of Sam Walton however this company will promote dedicated, hardworking associates."
good,"Fast paced job with lots of multi-tasking involved "
good,"we get to work and have a start up meeting to review over what the work load is for the day. after we get assigned to our areas we wait for empty trucks to come in to start loading inside of them. One thing i've learned at walmart and found to be very good at is driving the Clamp Forklift. Management at walmart to me isnt the best, seems like all manangers are trying to out do one another instead of working together as a whole company. I enjoy the people i work with we all tend to hang more outside of work. I have to say the hardest part of my job is dealing with managers and there  poor decisions to making our day run as smooth as possible. but overall i enjoy the rest."
good,"Great chance for advancement, and to travel within Wal-Mart to help at other stores.  Each store has its own manager and that means that the experience in each store varies a bit for customers and associates also."
good,"Good place to work as a entry-level associate.Have seen"
good,as a cashier i love my worker because I like talking and meeting new people. greet them when they entered in the store and always help them with a smile on my face. solve their queries about product. handling both cash and credit transaction. hardest pert of the job how to handle angry customer if he don't want to listen you but I managed to deal with that kind of customers.
good,a great work do what I do when I do it get done on time. have no problem work with other people
good,"A typical day included working with and serving a large, diverse group of people."
good,learned a lot while working there. honed my supervisory skills and management skills as well days were always different but enjoyed challenges when they came along  learned how to multi task quickly to get job done
good,"A typical day at Walmart moves on a well paced schedule. I learned when its not busy to clean my area around me and put away all returns. The managers are a big help, especially when it comes to a price check or a problem with a customer they are always there to help. My co-workers as well are helpful. Whenever your lost or have a problem sometimes a co-worker can help out therefore you don't have to call a manager. The hardest part about the job is that all cashiers have to be prepared to get backed up at times when its busy. You have to make sure you have bags, receipt paper, and anything else you might need. The most enjoyable part about the job is that when we're backed up (busy) we get customers in and out in a timely manner and time actually fly's when we're busy."
good,not much teamwork but steady work is offered and I was generous for the opportunity
good,in my at walmart its was good place to work.i was a overnight stocking employe for 4 months in that time i had optain discount benefits etc.I had nice co workers for the most part most were through when i needed help with anything.
good,"I would start off my day by counting all the out of stock merchandise, so i have a grand total number for both can and dry foods and liquids. Then using my (telzon) inventory gun, i would scann all the outs in the departments i was working in. This would go into the system, then the backroom associate would remove all items from the backroom on the list. i would then take the filled charts and bring them to the floor and work them to the shelves. Also sometimes i would have to help wtih managements daily notes like creating, destroying, and moving features of food and candy around the store. What i've learned is that i can have management skills and can handle mulitple tasks at one time. i love the people most of all especially the customers they would always come to me for advice about products or just to find an object in or not in stock."
good,"Every employee, at every level must be able to multitask daily."
good,"This was a very busy pharmacy filled at the time 500 prescriptions a day, One drawback was I didnt get to know most people by name because to many a day. The day just fly by everyday. You could move up in this company if you wanted to.It was very close back in the pharmacy and I liked how every helped everyone and worked together to make it run smoothly,"
good,"A typical day would be scanning items, taking returns, processing payments and stocking foods. (For each of the positions) Management was great at keeping things neat and organized. My co-workers were a vital asset to the work I was a part of, great people. The hardest part would probably be dealing with all the difficult customers at customer service. Most enjoyable would be not having a difficult customer, brightens all of our days."
good,"working for walmart its been like a roller coaster ride. In other words it has its ups and downs. Some associates are great to work with, while others are just a pain because of the lack on development."
good,"Walmart is always busy.  I scanned the fastest so i was always on busiest lane.  I enjoyed the people.  It taught me to look at the human aspect of life in a poor economy."
good,"My day began with zoning the toys department, breaking down boes and restocking the shelves. When a customer came to me with a question I did my best to answer to the best of my ability. Working extensively with the managers in my department gave me a positive outlook on my career."
good,"Fill selves, set up deli, and cook food."
good,"très belle place de travail , mais pas assez d heure à chacun"
good,"to help people to find things they're looking for and that helping people can make you feel good about the person you have become. management was outstanding and you couldn't ask for better people. my co-workers were the best, if you needed help they would help you if they could. the thing I enjoyed most about this job was helping the customers out."
good,Friendly people and fun environment. fast place working environment.
good,It was a great job whenever we had the amount of help that we are supposed to have.
good,its a job that pay the bills I don't like wal mart been there to long management is ok the hardest about the job use to be when I close by myself but now its easy because I have done it so may times
good,"Es una buena empresa,tienes oportunidad de crecimiento y desarrollo,"
good,The hardest part about working here is that the pay rate isn't enough to live. The best part about working for this company is that it has a lot of caring associates.
good,Working here I got to experience so many types of people. I got to help and be there for many customers on a daily basis.
good,"A typical day at Wal-mart consisted of basically doing gun sales, fishing/hunting state licenses and also alot of customer service. I learned alot about the departments that i worked in from paint, to camping/sporting goods, to housewares and furniture. I got along with both managment and co workers. Hardest part of the job would be covering multiple departments when your the only one around that area. Dealing and talking about the items that were being sold."
good,"A typical day working at Walmart was pretty much a busy day. I was always worker rather it was from producing photos, answering calls from customers, to cashiering. I enjoyed working for Walmart because it was filled with people and different personalities. The hardest part about the job was trying to keep up with every task because sometimes you would have to do multiples of task at once and have it done by a certain time. But after getting the hang of the tasks and being there for a while its get pretty easy and becomes a natural thing for you."
good,"I believe that some members of management at Walmart Super Center did not care about their duties at Walmart like they should have. The hand scanners did not work when I started working there as a front end cashier, none of them. The cashiers that were there before me were afraid to address the issue but I wasn't. The hand scanners were finally repaired or replaced. This helped the cashiers to avoid hurting their backs by lifting something that was too heavy and also helped us to scan faster. Whenever, I shop at Walmart now, I am often thanked by some of the cashiers that I worked with, for the new and, or repaired hand scanners. There are some members of management that look at me like I did something wrong at that time. I believe that I helped the company and I helped my fellow workers and that makes me feel good. I believe that those in authority at that time did not care that backs could have been sprained, or something worse could have happened. I'm thankful for the time that I was employed at the Super Center. I believe that I did make a difference there and if they would rehire me I would go back. I keep applying but I believe that management considers me too outspoken and won't call me. Oh well, if they don't, it's their loss."
good,"Love WalMart. Have fun, but some managers are very rude and disrespect associates."
good,"low pay, to demanding in what they want done for the pay. overnight restocker"
good,As you only hear the negative in the news of Walmart. It's only fair to the upside too. Walmart may not be a high paying job. But offers fair wages for the work they provide for the associates. They also are strict with management to be equally fair to all associates. Associates also have the comfort of jobs security if they only just produce the jobs they are assigned. I never saw anyone push hard to work beyond their pace. And most employees are satisfied with their jobs and stores. The company takes great pride in making employees feel they are a part of the store and each has an important roll.
good,"A typical day at work for me is greeting customers, checking put there items, helping in customer service, anything else I am asked to do. I have learned many different things working at Walmart. Some things would be is interacting with people, learning to run registers and many different things. Most of my co-workers are good to work with and they all do there part. The hardest part of my job is when a customer gets angry but I handle  the situation in a good manner. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to interact with a lot of new people and getting to talk to them."
good,A good company to work for. The only negative I have to say is they place a lot of emphasis on customer satisfaction that they overlook there employees.
good,For the most part Wal-mart is a  great company when you have proper management and the most upbeat of associates just like other companies they have there ups and downs Wal-Mart does also but this is a company in where you can be able to take care of a small sized family with time comes benefits etc. but overall Wal-Mart is fair.
good,"A typical day at work consists of doing reports(sales and packing slips), checking in merchandise, reading glasses, adjusting glasses, answering phone calls, directing people to the doctor office, inputting patient information, calling insurance, using lab equipment, helping people choose the right size frame, explaining the difference in lens materials. Working with co-workers is enjoyable especially since we are a team. The most enjoyable part of the job would be helping the patient. Keeping up with the changes in insurance policies is probably the hardest part of the job. In this job it has helped me grow in ways I don't believe I would have been able to had I not been in customer service. My communication skills are great."
good,"Most people are spread out about the store so there isn't much socializing. The Deli is a different story, you are placed behind the counter with between one to seven other people. It can be crouded, but also a very high energy work place. There is lots of noise, the work is hard, and there is a real danger of burning, cutting, or shocking yourself on equipment sometimes. But it is extreamly satidfying when you get the cleanup job done at night with your co-workers and form a sort of bond."
good,"Walmart offers great benefits and you can purchase stock. All the walmarts ive worked at all the employees are really nice and welcoming, The hardest part of the job would be to maintain the cleanliness of the store especially on busy weekends. I loved how fast i could move up at this company. i also loved learning new things such as sales and goals. A typical day for opening for a zms would be get your daily notes, execute them by 11am and follow up on the department managers on their daily routines, prepare the 2pm unloading plan and tour your areas. For closing is a little less foucused on your own area and you tour the entire store every thirty minutes. Its interesting cause you get to know the workers and their work habits and gain their respect. I really enjoy working here."
good,"I didn't mind walmart. It was a fun environment, with a lot of learning and growing opportunities."
good,this job is not for students or people who enjoy sleeping. i did have fun working here though. i met a lot of cool people.
good,Work sometimes in the backroom and in the work area where customer shop around. I learn how to treat people with respect and how they treat other too management was not that great sometime they would not even answer to some of the call but my co-worker would be very helpful and help other if they had the time too. Hardest part was trying to get everything ready for special event sometimes at the last minute and i also enjoy working with my co-worker because they made time go by and most time out the day they would help each one another to finish on time.
good,"Very routine work, one knows basically what to expect every day.  Managment as a whole is very attentive and approachable with an ""open door"" policy.  Co-workers as a whole are friendly and welcoming, most are very helpful to new employees.  The job is not hard at all, but if one had to choose the hardest part it would be pulling heavy pallets of bottled water onto the sales floor for restock.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the laid back atmosphere."
good,In this people friendly environment you have the pleasure of meeting and helping a variety of people on a daily basis. Me personally I enjoy the the responsibility of making sure a customer has the right things to enjoy there shopping experience at Walmart. I always great people wit a smile and always be willing to give them suggestions. The hardest part of  this job is leaving the customers unsatisfied. The most enjoyable part of this job is know that I just helped some one have a better day.
good,good beniftis friendly mangemtent. and co workers. had fun at the same time getting your job done worked safe.
good,"My typical day of work consisted of Walking up and down isles, making sure everything was straight and clean and helping customers find whatever they needed."
good,served over 100 customers per day to their deli necessity's
good,"working in many departments stocking items"
good,Enjoy working with my co-workers and the public.  It is busy and hectic most days but it makes the time go fast.
good,My experience was decent. very few incidents in any way. The management looked out for its employees and helped with what they could to make the job a positive experience.
good,it was a alright place to work in and you learn a lot from many other employee's and we learned a lot of skills in sales and tale tasking and unloading trucks was pretty amazing.
good,I would fill milk and eggs until the truck gets to the store then i would unload the truck.
good,"go to work unload trucks, place in zones. pull orders,get them to floor for stores.plan what is scheldule to go first out.the trucks being late"
good,"A typical day consists of helping Customers, Providing out standing customer service skills. Maintainging A neat and safe work place. Provding fast help and Accurate help. Keeping Customer happy and coming back. I would handle money at the cash register each and every day, Beg items and greet customers as they walked by or left the work place. While working at Wal-Mart I learned how to deal with all types of customers, I boosted my Customer service skills."
good,"ótima empresa para se trabalhar , oportunidade de crescimento e ambiente agradável ."
good,A typical day at walmart is very productive being a supervisor. During my employment at walmart I learned to have patience with unsatisfied customers. My co-workers were very welcoming when I first begin working there. The hardest part about the job was making sure that every customer was checked out at a reasonable time and not standing in line too long waiting to get service during the holidays. I enjoyed helping customers make sure they got everything they needed during their visit at the store.
good,"Many opportunities to grow within this company, management is always there to guide you when needed, co-workers are friendly and always willing to lend a helping hand."
good,"Empresa que tem como objetivo desenvolver seu quadro de funcionário para liderança."
good,"Walmart Just Isn't For Me, I Don't Believe They Trained Me Correctly, And I Don't Believe Its There Fault. Just Bad Timing."
good,"On the arrival of my shift, I am required to locate all the tools responsible for beginning a successful work day . It can range any where from printing out the present modular ,to printing the up and coming modular for the store's future week relay, to generating picks to be restocked on the sales floor. Once done prepping in the backroom for my shift, I am then required to meet with a member of management, as well as a relative job team member, to discuss particularly where I will begin, or where assistance is needed. Then, once everyone is aware of the work load at hand, it is knowledgeable to go over any other job related task so that I can quickly maneuver from one job duty to the next.  Another key responsibility that can also be very useful is reading over the cover letter associated with the modular at hand, to inform you about your current job task. This cover letter assists with the acquired time it takes to complete each modular, as well as making it easier to notice any changes needed to be made within the mod.   In addition to the cover letter, and setting the modular relay, it is then required to clean up unwanted debris and prep any overstock to  maintain a customer- friendly sales floor. Thus allowing any customer to obtain any product visibly needed off the sale's floor without interference of your work. If asked by the customer for a product not visible, you are more then likely to assist each customer to the best of your knowledge with the product. This particular part of my work day seems to be my personal favorite part,  because I am able to interact with"
good,I liked working at walmart even though most times it was tough. It was hard balancing school and work at the same time. I liked working with all the friendly people there
good,"Empresa que exige agilidade,pontualidade e responsabilidade. Dias compridos e desgastantes."
good,productive environment to work in. Satisfies customers at all costs. learn how to use different and advanced equipment
good,It was a very nice and relaxing work place also the employes were very friendly and i got along with them well
good,"I would rate Wal-Mart as a great job to work for. I have been with Wal-Mart for 7 years, and have worked several position within the store. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with certain customers, I love working with people but most days you come in contact with the customers whom are never happen. In that case I try my hardest to deal with the situation and move on with my day. I always remind myself that only I can put myself in a bad mood, not others. My most enjoyable part of my job would be helping teach fellow associates how to do things around the store and helping the customers that are sometimes the sweetest people you will ever meet in life. I could honestly admit that I would change how management would be within our company. Our management team does have a lot on their roles each and everyday, but I do feel that most management could use more training and respect for the individuals within the company. Overall though a great place to work for."
good,"the day starts kind of fast paced from the start of the day customers coming and going,and the sound of ratting shopping carts and welcomed shoppers chatting about the night before,reconnecting,are simply just shopping. my co-workers are great, always smiling and greeting me and what seems like every corner. the hardest part of the job would be having to locate are track down a specific item that an individual wants are needs. but the reverse side to that would be the most enjoying part of the job, and that would be to see the smiles and the signs of relief once I've retrieved the item..the management team at Wal-Mart are some of the best management team in the business. What ive learned at WAl-Mart is to give the service to others at myself are my family would want. Wal-Mart is a great place to work"
good,"A typical day at work is non-stop.  I learned something everyday from either my fellow management team or an hourly associate.  The management teams always worked extremely well together.  Total store we considered ourselves ""a family"".  It was a nice feeling to know that we all worked together to get the same result.  The hardest part of the job was the work-life balance, expectations were really difficult when issues arose.  I totally enjoyed my job, the relationships you make with our customers as well as each other."
good,Not to bad but nothing to brag about. Advancement is easy but the pay sucks.
good,I communicated with a wide variety of people on a daily basis. There were a lot of managers that I had to report to when there was an issue. All the managers and my co-workers were kind and willing to help out if I had any questions.
good,everyday at walmart was about the same. i came in started the ovens got my day started. managment would always come around to see if things were getting done. the hardest part was breaking down the stock in the freezer becaus nobody else wanted to do it caus it was really cold in there
good,"Walmart is a very challenging place to work since it is such a big corporation.  They expect high performance and great attendance."
good,I enjoyed my day to day tasks due to the fact that i was able to see my ideas come to life and make a profitable income. I also understand i that everydaty is not goin to be a good at work but the mangers and employees made sure that things got done and cheered me up in the proces.
good,"A typical day at work was always providing fast and friendly check outs. the only thing i learned is retail really my cup of tea. management was fair , co workers some were helpful and some were useless. The hardest part was dealing with rude customers. The enjoyable part of the was good conversations with the nice customers."
good,"Aprendí a trabajar con todo tipo de personas, por ejemplo el personal que desempeña algún oficio"
good,"I would open the Money Center to take care of the customers needs. The most hectic time would be the first, third, fifteenth, and income tax time. I have learned how to be patient. Most of my co-workers were very easy to work with and management were sometimes easy to get along with. I really enjoy taking care of my customers because without them how can we make a living. Respect is the key to success."
good,"I believe that my thorough understanding of accounting processes including transaction recording, invoicing, database upkeep, financial reporting, financial administration, period-end reconciliation, accounts payable, accounts receivable, general auditing, and clerical handling, along with my strong work ethic, team-playing personality, organizational skills and multitasking abilities will assist me tremendously in performing my work duties effectively while my previous experience in maintaining accounting journals, ledgers and other accounting support tasks will ease my integration into the company's own processes."
good,This job is all about customer courtesy and appearance. Your co-workers are great to work with and managers are pretty cool to
good,"A typical work day at work is being involved with hundreds of customers. I've learned that even on a work day where you repeatedly do some of the same duties of the job, things can change at any times. The hardest part of my job is not knowing and the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help customers in any way that I can."
good,"Good coworkers most of the time, polite and helpful managers, normally nice to work outside."
good,"Aprendi muito trabalhando lá principalmente a trabalhar em grupo, em equipe."
good,Walmart is more focused on sales than associates or customers.  This trend has caused the company to lose sight of how they were able to become the number one largest retailer in the world.
good,I like this job mostly. I learned a lot from the people I worked with and learned a lot about myself in this job. Everyone I worked with was stellar but the pay was low and the stress was high.
good,"Com certeza é uma empresa de grande porte a nível internacional, mas no Brasil me pareceu uma empresa secundária."
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart was to try to work on your department plus's work in other departments. Didn't her much help plus management didn't really help.
good,"Being a cashier at walmart was a more fast paste job and well given training. At Walmart customers use cash, check, and also debit which is accepted at other shopping areas as well. One thing I did learn was how to accept wic vouchers and what they are used for. If I had a question my co-workers were more then glad to answer.  I enjoyed ringing people up on my register and answering any questions they may have had for me. I didnt find anything to be to hard at all."
good,Wal mart is one of those Jobs I would not Recommend anyone to apply for. If your job title is something else they will have you doing everything but what you are suppose to do. I worked in TLE.
good,"A company that was once great, when Sam Walton was running it. Now the vision has swayed just a little too far."
good,"Stocking shelves and keeping stocks in order to make them presentable."
good,"Wall mart es un trabajo muy respetable  por su buen trato desde sus gerentes hasta las encargadas de caja.."
good,Great beginners job. They do work around any scheduling if need be. The management is very friendly and reasonable. The most difficult about the job is standing on your feet for multiple hours and lines can get very hectic.
good,Typical day consist of unloading pallets and stocking shelves of merchandise. Keeping area clean and ensuring a safe work habit. New management every three months was kind of hard to get adjusted too. Being that every manager expects something done differently. Co workers were fun to be with. Hardest part was keeping energy to work through the long hour shift at night.
good,"A typical day at work is making customers happy."
good,"The job was perfect , management was horrible. In my opinion full-time and most experienced co-workers had favortism."
good,"uma otima empresa principalmente para aqueles que visam crescimento dentro dela, oferece condicao de trabalho com plano de saude, muita dinamica e respeita opnioes dos associedos."
good,enjoyed the job until they no longer wanted to be my friend after that hated the job
good,"tres belle journee charger,  bonne collaboration avec le commerce3 detail , tres belle esprit equipe ,bonne connaissance du detail et du service client"
good,i liked working there. i liked the fast paced environment. the hardest part was dealing with already angry customers and trying to get on their good side. they offered great benefits.
good,Since the death of Sam Walton all the focus has been put on production goals and very little on the associates. Sam Walton wanted the associates to benefit from their hard work.The work environment and the morale has gone downhill.
good,it takes time to get use to the fast pace but after that everything works out fine
good,when you get to work you clock in make sure you get ther at lease 10 minuts befor your shift start there will be a metting on production .then you work for two hours stocking or what ever your job is and you get a 15 minute break. then lunch then another 15 min. break then its time to go home
good,i work in electronic so i had fun interacting with costumers answering questions about their products and also teaching how to use the product helping people out.
good,"Typical day at Walmart was going in at your designated shift checking your area for any damage to equipment or goods being that I hope any customer that needed help, working the cash register, restocking shelves and providing excellent customer service. What I learned at Walmart was the value of positive social interaction. My coworkers are great, they tell me everything I needed to know about the store and how to be successful as a Walmart sells associate. While working at Walmart I did not find any task that was too difficult. The most enjoyable part about working at a Walmart sells associate with having constant interaction with great people."
good,"My shifts are 4 to eight hours in length five days a week. I learned how to efficiently handle money and how to work with WIC customers.  My customer service managers and hiring manger worked positively with me.  Co- workers were conversational, but hard working. The hardest part of the job was handling negative customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with co-workers."

good,en la empresa de Wal-Mart  el objetivo es tener buena productividad así como hacer al mismo tiempo la buena atención al cliente es un poco complicado pero se logra atreves del tiempo.

good,"My day started at 3:00am baking bread. I learned how to work on my own, as I was the only one assigned to the bakery. I did help in the deli when needed. The hardest part of my job was completing everything on time when they were short in the deli and I was assisting customers part of the day. I enjoyed talking with customers and assisting them. The day usually went by quickly."
good,"While I was working at Wal-Mart, I got married to a man who worked there. My department manager would flirt with him, and be very rude to me. She pushed out day and night shifts freight and told me to work it, although I had been working there for a few months at the time, I had not put out end-cap and side-kick displays. She was very rude and irritable. Her behavior went unchecked and resulted in my eventually leaving the store."
good,Walmart was a good first time job. Eventho the pay great there is nothing to protect your job because theres no union.
good,Wal-Mart got me through some tough times. However being one of the bigger corporations I expected the professionalism to be more than it was.
good,"You have a basic routine your suppose to follow day in and day out but never allowed to complete because you don't have enough staff to help you. You are constantly bombarded with tasks but never given enough time to complete, never appreciated for anything you do, and never are listened too. Management almost always gives you a predetermined answer and never follows thought with consistent decisions. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you are on lunch or leave for the day."
good,"What is expected of you should be illegal. Average turn over rate is 2-3 years in the distribution centers, and they try to shorten that every day."
good,"Loading and Unloading trailers at a fast and productive safety first pace.

good,"challenges in retail,fast paced enviroment.customer service through out the whole shift."
good,A typical work day is laid back and you stay to your self and you do your own thing. They tell you to complete a task by the end of your shift.
good,"Front-end at the cash register it very refreshing and never gets exhausting. Refreshing because theirs always new faces to communicate with and help out. Also being quicker than other co works and at the same time keeping the same level of professional standard. I loved the job personally and learned a lot and understood that i was doing something good as far as helping people have a good shopping experience, very satisfying to help others. Overall a beautiful experience."
good,My typical day would start at 4:00A.M. I would drive fifteen minutes to Wal-Mart. I started at 5:00 A.M. I would pull any out of date meat off the shelves to be thrown away. I then would make a list of all the meat on the shelves that needed to be stocked. I would go in the back and begin cutting the meat needed. At about 10:00 A.M. I would go to lunch. I would return at 11:00 A.M. I would organize the cooler and rotate all the stock. I would unload the truck when fresh product came in. I would also order any product we needed. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers the most. The hardest part of my job was working in the freezers where it got really cold. At 2:00 P.M. I would go home.
good,A typical day at  Wal- Mart starts off at 7am to 3 pm each personal work day. Through out the day we have Mandatory store meetings keeping all associates up to date on all sales and merchandise that enter and leave the store. I've learned to work both independently and within a small groups of individuals. The hardest part of the job would be all the heavy lifting and moving of merchandising around the backroom and onto the sales floor. Most enjoyable part is working with the associates and customers that come in and out of the store.
good,"Normal"
good,It was usually busy and understaffed. But I did love my coworkers.
good,"I learned a lot while employed at Wal-Mart and if i could describe my time there I would say, that one get more from the company the longer you stay"

The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers. The hardest part of my job, most of the time is when I have to do double the work, due to lack of coverage. But, I always try to keep a positive mind and get the work done.  Overall, Walmart is a great place for employment."
good,"i enjoyed working there it was clean problems were taken care of when reported. The management was tough but fair "
good,"A typical day at work is like no other, you go in do your job and go home, you keep things to yourself and costumers are number 1.  I have learned what its like to do a midnight shift which i really enjoyed doing, I also have learned what its like to have customer satisfactory.  Management was excellent always an open door policy, anytime you had a concern you could always go to a manager and talk with them and they would address the situation."
good,Se hablaba mucho del respeto al individuo pero en el ambiente laboral eso era lo que mas faltaba
good,"Era bem corrido trabalhar lá, pois a gerência cobrava os trabalhos a todo momento, mais foi muito bom , por que aprendi a ter bastante habilidade e ser responsável naquilo que for minha obrigação. "
good,"A typical day at work can just be pretty calm and easy going"
good,"A typical day at work was getting an elder come up to you and trying their hardest to get out of peoples way as fast as they could because some people are just rude. There was so many elderly men and women who would come through my line and would have the biggest smile on their face, then a younger person would get behind them and try to rush so i would just smile and say take your time, your fine. I loved working a Wal-mart, I just had a hard time driving back and forth not getting many hours."
good,Good place to learn about customer service and developing management skills
good,"a typical day at work is good the busy part is at evening "

good,A typical day at work is alot of freight. I learned to read upc's and learn how to use a talzone.
good,Wal Mart for me was just a place to start my work career. Wal Mart has some okay benefits but if you work hard within the company you can move up to management. My only problem was the low pay rate.
good,When an issue came up and it was presented to upper management it was discussed and resolved.
good,just like any other Wal-Mart . the best part is the discount during Christmas time
good,i hated working at walmart they barely trained me then expected me to be able to keep up with everyone else i ended up leaving cause i couldn't do the work as fast as they wanted

good,Had a very good working environment. Provide good customer services and well organized with caring management team
good,"Start up meetings, received work load for the day including receiving and replenishing merchandise. Management was ok. Production goals were hard to meet especially when the work was not there. I did not like being wrote up for not making production when the work was not there to help me meet my goal. I left walmart for better job opportunity"
good,I learned a great deal from this company. Overall it is a great place to work with lots of room for advancement. It is very challenging a any job working with he public can be.
good,Great benefits with competitive pay and hours there to be worked. The only problem is that there is no security within the company once management attempts to alter certain work situation.
good,"I transferred from a way worse walmart but I really like the managers and some associates here however one manager i cannot stand. I usually tend to build the features and do the overnight support managers job because she can barely walk, she constantly bashes other employees and managers alike. She has no concern if costumers are in the next aisle, she will loudly cuss and say things i wouldn't even say out loud. Usually other employees will drag out there work so they don't have to help anyone else.Its also incredibly annoying that so many associates abuse the call in system therefore leaving you to pick up the slack. The pay sucks therefore usually people have two jobs and if not have government assistance."
good,"Typical days last 12 hours, this is a fast paced environment where you are on your feet, consistently monitoring associates, merchandising, while focusing on great customer service."
good,"Baking Bread, Cleaning Organizing, Stocking and storing product,  Preparing for the next day."

The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experience."

good,"dealing within  electronics departments,  working in team. helping customer to find the products and providing information."

good,"Customer service, stocking, and receiving/delivering shipments are major tasks at Walmart.  I learned how to deliver good customer service, multi-task projects, work in a fast-paced environment, and how to be a team player.  Management gives guidance and encourages associates to exceed customer service and expectations of the company.  The hardest part of me working at Walmart is the physical labor that comes with the job in which there are many tasks to be completed in a timely manner.  Interacting with different types of people who have similar or very different backgrounds.  Walmart is a very diverse company."
good,"-Terminar pendientes, actualización de indicadores y organización de citas con la gerencia, la dirección o la VP, "
good,"Walmart can be a great start but it takes a lot of time, patience, persistence and dedication."
good,"Excellent place to work as a full time student, flexible hours and time off during exam periods. Management is very understanding of employee's personal needs. Co-workers are always full of energy and it is due to them that I have stayed for 5 plus years. Hardest part of the job is not enough hours when they are needed."

good,"Revisar las ordenes de rotulos y elaborarlos"
good,A typical nights at Wal-Mart are busy. I have learned a lot of team work while working at Wal-Mart. Management steps up when workers need help or guidance in how to perform a task. The co-workers are fun to work with. The hardest part at first was the nights but you get used to being up all night. The most enjoyable part of the job is the different personalities of you get to interact with throughout the night as far as customers and employees
good,Job requires to be physically fit that involves lifting repetitively.
good,walmart was a great place I Enjoyed going to work except on black friday
good,Need much more than 12 weeks to train for assistant manager.  Set many new manager up for failure.

good,"first time working in retail it was interesting learning somthing new"
good,"I was a cashier here and once hired, you train on the computers and do a lot of testing and you have to pass every test before they train you at the cash register. When there wasn't a lot of customers (slow days) I would do cart pushing and zone other departments by making sure everything is neatly displayed."
good,I provided customer service by assisting cutomers by locating items and resolving any issues in their shopping experience. Supervise and train incoming associates by assigning tasks and following up. I have learned alot from the company and have gained skills to further my career. I enjoy interacting with customers and co workers and having the abilty to teach others and promote advancement. I enjoy the fast pace environment and the challenges because it I have the ability to handle difficult situations and make timely decisions.
good,"Todo comenzó con grandes expectativas de estabilidad laboral y progreso,.tuve 4 o 5 citas previas a ser aceptado como ASOCIADO, así le llamaban a los empleados, pero...tenia solo un contrato de 6 meses, y eran unos 530 empleados en total, yo estaba dentro de los 17elejidos de pastas frescas.- Hice todo lo que se hace en pastas, desde elaborar tallarines, ñoquis, ravioles, etc .- hasta cargar vitrinas de exibición. Eran horas de mucho trabajo, y solo 15 m. de descanso cada 4 hs.En realidad no aprendí nada porque fui a enseñar a ese lugar como oficial pastero. La dirección estuvo ausente en casi todo el tiempo que permanecí en la empresa, solo una vez vino a evaluar el trabajo.No tuve buena relación laboral con algunos compañeros y el sr jefe. LIDER.La parte más difícil era tener que soportar los malos tratos del lider, lo que mas me gustó fue que uno de mis discípulos, que ganó premios con mis fórmulas personales aún sigue trabajando en el hiper, siendo el único de aquella época.-"
good,"correria atençao,trabalhar em grupos separar trabalho com vida pessoal,boa bem atenciosa,legal me ajundavam muito ,elaborar as notas e mercadoris pequenao . bom lugar pra trabalhar alegre tods se davam bem ."
good,"I enjoyed working for this Company very much. I knew what i had to do everyday i worked. I worked various hours in all the departments to serve customers needs. If we didn't have a certain item in stock, i would call other stores to see if they had that item and drive there to get that item for a customer. The Co-Workers were very friendly and easy to get along with. We had a lot of team work. There was nothing i didn't like about that job except that they were cutting hours back which i needed 40 hrs a week. The job itself was very enjoyable and the Management team and employers were great to work with."
good,"I love the freedom, because i used to work for Giant Food Inc. and Shoppers Inc. and frankly Wal-Mart is better. In the sense of freedom. At first they dont pay you for what you are worth. Overall the managers are hard working, thoughtful, and they listen to your needs. Its a great second job.  It's simple, easy, if you arent trying to move up, fun too."
good,"A typical day at work involve the beginning of work meeting, which consist of days review, inventory numbers, and the amount of hrs for the night's shift. I stock mainly the dairy area (juice, milk, cheese, yogurt, and sometimes meat). My co-worker are cool but most of them are immature and I need to be in a more mature environment. Management is up and down sometimes. The managers think we are slacking but they never see how hard we actually work. I can describe them as presumptuous and outspoken at times. The hardest part of the job the time frame sometime. 18hrs or 12hrs worth of work seem easy with two people but all the moving, down stacking, and transporting other department items is time consuming. The things I enjoy the most is the making custumers smile when you speak, help, or just being nice to them. "
good,Wal-Mart is always flowing. Employees work well together with minimal management oversight. Customers definitely make the day interesting and fun. I have learned that you do not have to change companies to change jobs at Wal-Mart. It has diverse carrer opportunities for everyone. The hardest part of the job is finishing all of the assigned tasks while being constantly interrupted by customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is socializing with new and friendly people.
good,"My typical day at work is to stand at a register and greet customers brightly while I check out thier groceries. It's not what I want to do, but it pays for my school loans. What i've learned is how to stay calm and polite under stressful situations. The management is o.k. They do thier best and the work gets done by the end of the day. I love my coworkers. They all have so many different personalities. The hardest part of my job is getting exhausted by the grueling work load that Walmart requires, but the most enjoyable part is knowing that I made a customer happy, and knowing I'll be seeing them again soon."
good,Good company. Good schedule.  Good people to work for.  Values family and work balance.
good,"Wal-Mart is an okay company,its just a few kinks that needs to be worked out."
good,"Highly motivated, creative and flexible individual. Especially skilled at building effective,"

good,"Gosto muito do meu trabalho e do que eu faço,haja vista que Deus nos deu todos dias sem nos cobrar nada;porém não tenho dia especifico.Todos os dias a vida nos ensina algo e não é diferente na empresa,o aprendizado é continuo."
good,"A typical day at work for me included stocking groceries, working in the backroom, setting up displays and occasionally being calling up front to cashier. I learned so much from wal-mart, I learned how to order merchandise and what upper management is looking to see concerning the merchandise on the floor. Some of that entailed counting, pricing changes markdowns etc. The management at wal-mart was fantastic, they were able to lead and also work hard. I worked very well with all the mangers and had been spoken to on various occasions concerning being prepared to become a future manager. The co workers in my department were generally all hard workers. Communication among us was key in order to ensure that the full work load for the day was completed. The most difficult part of the day was on occasion the extremely heavy merchandise that needed to be moved and in those cases I just took my time and paid close attention to overall safety. The most enjoyable part of the day was finishing a work load and having time to attend to other tasks"
good,great place to start a career. allowed me to enhance my people skills while employed.
good,es buena empresa tiene mucha seriedad y son respetables esta empresa se dedica al servicio al cliente para sus beneficios y comodidades.esta empresa ofrece estabilidad laboral
good,It was a good place to work. Not too demanding. Coworkers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job for me was the heavy lifting.
good,"Eu entrava as 6:00 e ia embora entre 18:00 e 20:00,aprendi muito,como se relacionar com os clientes,como trabalhar em grupo,como comandar uma equipe,sempre que precisei do Gerente sempre me ajudou,tinha muita cumplicidade com meus colegas de trabalho,pois sempre que eu precisava deles,sempre me ajudavam e vice-versa,a parte mais difícil era a carga horária,pois saia de casa as 6:00 da manhã e chegava em casa entre 21:00 e 21:300 e cansava muito,e eu não tinha tempo para dar atenção para minha filha de 4 anos,e na maioria das vezes nem a via acordada,pois nesse horário ela já estava dormindo,esse era o lado ruim de trabalhar no mercado,e o que eu gostava mais era do pessoal,pois quando alguém estivesse com problema,seja financeiro,particular ou no trabalho,nós se ajudava uns aos outros,isso sim não tem preço,e nunca vou me esquecer dessas pessoas com quem trabalhei."
good,"At Wal-Mart, I worked mostly night 4p-1a( I hated that) did that for 3 years. A customer would ask if I worked there, I would say 'yes' and help them out"
good,"Wal-Mart Logistics has a really aggressive initial pay scale, which is nice in the short time. If you stick around and do your job there is many raises and bonuses. Wal-Mart is the king of policy, be aware that policy is the be-all-end-all at Wal-Mart."
good,typical day would be checking people out with their merchandise.they were an ok company to work for.management while i was there wasnt the greatest.co workers were a joy to be around.hardest par was learning the service desk most enjoyable i met ne people every day.
good,"No dia a dia era muito bom de trabalhar,aprendi muitas coisas como atende um cliente,como operar um caixa porque quando entrei não tinha nenhuma experiencia.Tinha um convívio muito bom com meus colegas de trabalho."
good,"Im a hard worker, and this company is all for hard workers and my experience at wal-mart was similar to my cooper tire experience the only difference is the people in the work area the loading process and management"
good,"At walmart, I have learned without the customer my job is meaningless. I have learned the value of team work. I also enjoy the incentatives that Walmart participates in if we push our work hard enough."
good,i would go in and stock shelves
good,I learned how to handle customers in a positive way no matter what the situation was. I trained new imployees. Answered all kinds of good and crazy questions. Physically worked hard.
good,"I have learned that in all jobs it a best practice to always try to do your best at what you do. The trick to it all is gathering the training you need to succeed. I do not have negative things to say about Wal-Mart, In-fact its quite to the contrary. You see Wal-Mart has been a great place to work for me. Since I started to work there I have gained many new skills that might have passed me up. A large portion of this has to do with the training I gained from Wal-Mart. How ever It is in my opinion that the area Wal-Mart needs to improve on is advancement of their Associates. The associates that go above and beyond and strive to learn and move forward... These are the associates I am talking about. You see Wal-Mart has not given me any opportunity to grow. I received great annual reviews, in fact my last review was rated as a person who exceeds their expectations. I just feel I'm being over looked and want to advance my career in the field I have chosen. Security is my life and its what I do. Wal-Mart has taught me many great things and is a great place to work. But if you want to grow with this company they make it near impossible."
good,"Very enjoyable environment to work in. I learned a lot of customer service skills, such as always making sure the customer is 100% satisfied with the job I've done. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new skills, that will help me with future jobs."
good,I was a bouncing cashier and worked customer service as well. I learned how to tell if someone is stealing and whether or not a dollar bill is real or not. I learned how to deal with irate customers and how to be an excellent customer service rep.
good,"A typical day at work is always busy. We had many customers come into the pharmacy and drop off prescriptions. At the same time, we have other customers coming to pick up their prescriptions that were dropped off from a previous day, or called in by their doctor. I learned a lot while working here. But most important, I managed to learn about medicines, like names and actions. It's also a very friendly and interactive workplace, since I always had something to talk about with co workers and managers. I truly felt at home when I was at work. I couldn't ask for a better team. What was hardest was trying to make and keep every customer happy. It is unfortunate that we cannot give every customer what they want. But we always strive to prevent issues from happening and keeping a consistent, fast workflow. I enjoyed the job because I know that customers are relying on me and my co-workers to deliver something that is vital to them. Their health is in our hands, and I am proud to have such a responsibility."
good,"rotina diaria de trabalho entregar resultados diariamnete, aprendi muitas coisas na empresa dar valor a cada um dos funcionários respeitando seu direitos e ensinando seu deveres, meus colegas de trabalho foram ótimos nessa caminhada a parte mais agradável do trabalho e gostar do que eu faco e fazer sempre bem feito"
good,Walmart is not my dream job. Management does not care about their workers.
good,"Work Hard, learn and pick up additional skills and functions, enjoy the Company"
good,Walmart is a great diverse job and has flexible work schedules. Great for a part time associate and excellent opportunities to move into management positions.
good,"A typical day would involve stocking up items that need to be stocked. I would complete any tasks assigned whether it was stocking, pricing, re-organizing items in my department. I learned more about working with toys and what customer's expected of me in that department. I found management as well as my co-workers very helpful with my job. The hardest part was dealing with demanding customers day in and day out. It would become too much sometimes. I did enjoy the satisfactory of helping customers on a daily basis with a friendly smile and receiving a smile back."

good,A typical day at work starts off reviewing how many pieces of freight are on the trailers. Then we do our daily tasks. Next we unload the trailers and stack them neatly on pallets. Last is the hardest part pulling the heavy items out to the salesfloor.
good,clean bathrooms sweep whole floor stock break room mop main floor clean break room and repeat
good,Aunque ya sabia afine aun mas mis conocimientos bancarios: y mejore mis dotes de venta y capacidad de liderazgo.
good,The hardest part of this job was serving a busy store with angry customers due to not enough associates. I sometimes was the only cashier open. Co-workers were nice but management was not. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to connect with the customers and talk to them. This job had taught me a lot. I learned important customer service and people skills from this job.
good,"I found it very depressing. I do not know if it was my co-workers or if the job was truly boring. People are hardly in a good mood. My hours varied and the pay was minimum wage. Busy days are the best days, especially at customer service."
good,Being able to be on the floor and interacting with customers really helped me become a more intellectual person because you deal with all sorts of people.
good,"eu gostava muito de trabalhar la,o salario era meio baixo mas a equipe de chefes era muito boa,sabem tratar bem seus clientes e funcionarios,me dava muito bem com colegas e chefes..nao tive problemas com ninguem,apenas sai pelo horario que era complicado .mais dificil era quando tinha que trabalhar periodo da noite ,por ser perigoso voltar a noite pra casa sozinha pois nao teria onibus proximo a minha casa a teria que ir andando.no mas era bom mesmo.."
good,Would load supplies on pallet and travel from end to another end of the warehouse to load onto truck. I learned how to use a new piece of equipment called a PE. Management was alright but wasn't the best.Co-workers are very helpful and hard workers.Working 10+ hours of almost nonstop work. Was a good way lose weight.
good,"Se trabaja arduo pero tranquilo y sin mucha presión,eso hace que el operario se desempeñe con mas tranquilidad y eficacia dentro de los tiempos establecidos para realizar las tareas,se aprende día a día,eh aprendido el manejo de zorras eléctricas como así también usar scanner,y otro tipos de tareas,la dirección y gerencia es muy atenta y persuasiva,los colegas como en todos lados hay mucha competencia pero sana,y me gusto mucho del trabajo es el progreso y el constante aprendizaje de nuevas tareas."
good,"Within my time working in this department, I was in charge of the fitting rooms, answered phone for the entire store, put out returns, did price changes, and stocked shelves. I learned the Wal Mart price marking system, how to communicate via phone and in-house radio simultaneously. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of working here was multiple demands that were happening all at once. The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with and helping customers."
good,"Got to learn different things about electronics, and photos. learned the process of one hour photos."
good,"Worker as cashier.Some days were easy others hard, staff was nice. was only a summer job,not much to say about it."
good,"My coworkers, my manager, even the BIG Boss, were great to work with! The values of the warehouse population were great."
good,Walmart is non union competive pay. I nice place to work if you have no children. My last day at the company. Was the day my son
good,"At the beginning of every shift, managers and associates attend a 10 to 15 minute-meeting in which they decide how the work is going to be organized for the night (Basically, who is going to do what?)."
good,A typical day at work would start in an employee meeting for 15 minutes and them would go front of store and replace another employee and then start running items on the convaler belt and ring up the customer purchases with a cash register.

good,"I worked overnoight so it fit my schedule, never had any problems with customers at night as much as the day."
good,"como toda empresa tem seus altos e baixo,a empresa é muito boa de se trabalhar,porem o gerenciamento não possuía liderança"
good,"Everything about this job was just ""tolerable."" Nothing was spectacular and nothing was horrible."
good,Walmart is a place where it shows growth in and individual and also gives you the option to be very social with the customers and also your coworker. The managers there are loving and are willing to change things in case of an family emergency and also school. The hardest part about working for Walmart I would say is having some customers that just not in a mood and very upset but I try to make them have their very best experience while shopping there. Because I am a very sociable person i would say the most enjoyable thing about working for Walmart is having the many different conversations with your customers and enjoying hearing all the different stories about their life and also sharing mines with them. My coworkers are also people that I enojy working with becasue without them the work day would go by slow and dull.
good,working with customes to satisfy their needs and want and to help them in making purchases. i learned the differnces in tv styles and lcd and plasma tvs and where to lead customers in making the right purchase. management was ok while working their you really didnt see them as much on the floor because there busy doing office work and other duties. my co workers were fun and friendly to work with they always asked me questions if they werent sure about something as i did to them as well.the hardest part of the job was learning how to use the telzon system but once i got the hang of it it was easy and made me even more computer friendly.the enjoyable part of the job was hour lunches

good,"A typical day at work is usually good, no complaints. You just have to keep a positive attitude regardless of ant negativity around you. My co workers were very friendly and lovely. I got along with everyone. Sometimes all it takes is a smile. There really was no hard part to the job. I would say any job is hard when you first start out but it's a piece of cake once you get the hang of it. Dealing with management is what really irritated me though, when they showed no compassion for their employees and did not want to work as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my favorite customers all the time and ensuring they received great customer service."
good,Wal-Mart is a retail company in which I come in contact with customer on a nightly basics.I have the chance to service them by helping find the items they are looking for.as well as putting freight on the counters.I learned how to explain policies and procedures to other associates and supervise and delegate areas to associates.I get along well with my management team as well as my co-workers. There really is'nt a hard part to my job.I enjoy enteracting with others and helping out.
good,"Walmart has always been a great company to work for especially due to its profound history. As the largest retailer worldwide, meeting new people daily is the greatest satisfaction. All the other issues are minor because the customer is #1!"

good,i enjoy my work experience at walmart i need to find another.
good,"A typical day would consitst of me standing at a till assisting customers with their purchases, comments, and complaints. I learned how to operate a till and work with money, debit, and credit. I also learned many codes and rules to prevent shop lifting. Managment and co-workers where easy to get along with and very helpfull people. Hardest part of this job was probably standing on your feet daily. Most enjoyable part was that I got to make people happy and show them my wonderfull customer service skills."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart I had many tasks but I loved every one. My work was constant and steady and it made the day go by so much quicker. My co-workers where pretty decent, but I think some of them could work on their attitudes and they way they greated and treated customers. The most enjoyable part of my days at work where when I greated a customer with a ""hello, how are you doing?"" and some replied back that I was a great customer service person."
good,"A typical day at walmart was customers first.making sure that they were happy and got the help that they needed.What I learned as a walmart manager was excellent customer service,people skills,time management,inventory,sales and profit to name a few.My co-workers were very helpful most of the time.The hardest thing about my jobs was trying to keep the environment as calm as possible.The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,It was a pretty good company to work for. I did enjoy my time working there.
good,Very challgen work place. A work place that deals with the public you have to he well around with great customer service to work at wal-mart.
good,"I learned alot while working for this company and met so many great, helpful people."
good,"Walk my areas and identify areas of opportunity that need to be fixed fast. Check for completion of the closing tasks the night before. Assign tasks to associates to completed through their shift. Take part in the area meeting to discuss the focus of the day. Complete the required compliance tasks and begin prep for the next day. Every day is a challenge! It's like chopping a tree down with a spoon. In the short term it seems useless, but in the long term you will fell the tree. The best part of the job is watching my areas grow into profitable parts of the store and watching my associates achieve more and eventually promote."
good,Good company to work for. They offer good benefits and freindly associates.
good,It's stressful alot of the time. The members can be pretty hard to deal with at times.
good,"The management team was rude to the employees! They talked bad to them in public. I saw how they talked to other employees, and I left because I knew any two ways one of them would have came at me like they did that lady😟! It would have been problems. So I gave Sherry my resignation aka 2 week notice 🤔! By then I was fed up with the foolishness."

good,It was fun working at Walmart most days and others it was really bad some customers where really bad but still do your best to satisfy the unsatisfiable
good,"About as much as can be expected when working retail , was not difficult but does require effort. Only stressful during weekends, holidays and key hours of the day. Management was pleasant for the most part. Certainly not the worst experience, but I will chalk it up to it being a bad year for the company."
good,I loved my job but my managers isn’t so professional . It was too many people that come to work just for the looks of it . Nobody actually wanted to work .
good,You come in do your job just fine. Just avoid getting in trouble. Butt really it's a good job. Good pay. 10.00 an hour is pretty nice. Hmm what else..

good,"Walmart is a good first job. It is a job that will always keep you busy, and will help you build a strong work ethic for future careers. Management is very helpful and will make sure to assist you whenever needed."
good,Wal mart is a great employer despite the loss prevention team......I  don't like their open door policy. It's not what they says it is. But the management team I worked with was Awesome
good,Good for career advancement and retail all around experience. Along with a pathway to warehouse opportunity and management services . Strick attendance policy makes more reliable workers
good,Great benefits has a very up beat work environment. Everyone brings a smile and positive energy to work. They encourage you to do your best. As long as you show your effort to make rate and work as a team.
good,Helping costumers making sure they can fine everything they need and maki g sure they have a wonderful shopping experience and always say thank you for your business we look forward to seeing you next time
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. The money was very good and you can take on extra hours, day's, and shifts. They try to rotate weekend's for everyone and what ever shift you want they give."
good,This is a great place to work. Very good about letting you move up fast I really enjoyed it there. My supervisor was great although you had some that want I was blessed
good,"I wasn’t there long, but did enjoy it. Staff was nice and management was okay. I had to leave due to issues in my life but would have stayed longer if I could."
good,"It's a great to work here, great colleagues and easy to get along with pay is great as well and customers are mostly nice people to talk to. Managers are good and always happy to help"
good,"I Clock in meet up with manager the manager gives me clear instructions on what I need to do. The manager will either tell me to do restock, overstock or bring a pallet of frozen dairy to the freezer. What I enjoyed was the amount of work I was always given to do it made my hours go by fast and they have flexible hours.The hard part about that it is it took a sometimes very heavy and maybe no help from associate at times."
good,I was able to smile and enjoy myself n the coolest environment. It was by far the easiest and more laid back job I ever had. As I am gettin older I look forward to job security and what better place then Walmart.
good,"During my days of working at Walmart, I learned a lot. Some days were a little hectic but I still managed to work at a steady pace in my work environment and also learn at the same time"

good,I really liked my job it was fun loved my co workers I only left because there was a death in the family and I had to relocate  would really like to go back to work there
good,"Ótima empresa,empresa está instável neste momento de transição."
good,"Me parece una empresa común, no ofrece sueldos competitivos, ni mucho menos buen ambiente laboral."
good,Working there was a blast with my coworkers. They always were fun to work with along with hanging out with them outside of our jobs. Holidays were always a blast too with the music we played as we worked.
good,Nossa uma empresa maravilhosa que gostaria de volta
good,A great environment with awesome people to work with. they are very welcoming and easy to work with. the management team was very helpful with informing you with the info you cant provide to a customer if you didn't know.
good,"If I would've had a better management team or working at a bigger store, I would've had a way better experience working there. It was a small store so we had to unload the truck sometimes two and then stock it. Employees at other stores say they either unload or stock not both, but that wasn't a problem. If management wouldn't have been giving us a hard time as if work wasn't getting done fast enough, even though we're doing a two-man job in one shift. It was just overbearing and stressful and I couldn't handle it, but under better circumstances I would work there again."
good,its productive and a fun place because you meet and greet all different types of customers also the  co workers are sociable also there pay is well and they give good hours
good,The biggest problem with Walmart is they don't have many full jobs. It's mostly part-time. That's fine if you're a student or have a second job to make extra money. For I can barely make ends meet. No overtime is allowed. If you're looking for a full time look elsewhere.
good,Good company to work for as long as you get work done you will be fine. Work is fast and you have to work at a quick pace and be efficient as possible.
good,Great place to work horrible pay but flexible schedule and easy   People are great good atmosphere to work   Management does care and room for advancement
good,"Great experience at Walmart safe work environment, excellent staff, workers great to work with . They train you right and assist you until you grasp the concept of your task . Wal mart is a good organization to be a part of."
good,I worked for Walmart for almost 3 years they were a great company to work for. I moved up fast working with them and they encouraged it 100% of the way.
good,As with any company there are always pros and cons. During peak there is more than enough hours to go around and during off peak things are slow and evening shift is scattered among other shifts or stores to help ensure hours until volume returns.
good,As an fullfillment associate at Walmart I found it quite fun but also stressful at the same times because of course the truck didnt show up at the perfect times everyday but you learn to handle those situations and get your freight out on the floor asap.
good,"Walmart is a great place and grow up>"
good,The management that works with you are very helpful if you don’t know what you are doing or even if you need help. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people and customers that you work with. Working here you make a second family
good,"Being a cashier at Walmart wasn't bad at all. It was the managers that made it bad. They are only concerned about the store, which is understandable to an extent. But I was getting sexually harassed and they wouldn't do anything about it."
good,Walmart is a very busy space and always full of unexpected reactions and responses of the customers. Management was always away or busy. Always need to be active.
good,"showed up every day,did my job to best of my ability but after 4 months couldn't make rate. Think they could have moved me someplace else,but they would rather fire someone who shows up every day without question,does their job the best he could(I'm 53yrs.old)and without conflict.,and train someone else for the next 4 months just to do it all over again...good work environment...in some areas expectations for 'rate"" is a little too much."
good,"Over all if you are interested in moving up in the company, If you show up for work, positive attitude, and good communication. you can be successful."
good,Walmart is a great place too work. However the Walmart I was employed at had poor management.. but all and all it’s a great place to work with great benefits
good,Am looking to go forward in another company whether it's being dept manager or assistant manager or anything else that is available in your Trussville ala store
good,"Very fast-paced, everything and everyone is active during the heart of the day. I worked in the diary dpt. so I had it easy for the most part, I got along with my team mates and my dpt. manager."
good,Walmart needs alots of help to improve but have a good work flow. Customers are a come and go. The pay was on the fair side for the position you were working at.
good,My adventure at Walmart was amazing I am glad I worked there in all my areas. I do think they are all about money and not employees for the most part. I did their asset protection job but It was all about politics and not how well you performed your job.
good,Employees were watched with a fine tooth comb. They had favorites and they at times were treated differently then a normal person just there to do their best job.
good,"Walmart has good hours,usually have a good staff too, and most of all nice pay. You get discounts on products and you also have an family discount too."
good,"Loved job and direct supervisors. Store management not so much. Job was stressful. Did enjoy co workers and ease of transition into position. Found out was sick and reduced position, hours, and pay once tapped into insurance. Denied short term disability claims and pay for time off after surgery. Wont work for them again"
good,"Being able to lead others by example, and seeing them grow is one of the best parts of my day! I believe that positive thoughts and actions attract positive thoughts and actions!! "
good,This job was good for as long as I worked there. I feel that I was being under paid. The management could be a whole lot better. I liked the shift I worked.
good,"The Wal-Mart in Harrisville Utah is horrible to work for on the overnight shift."
good,Quit.i had meeting with supervisor and manager concern ing my shift it was said nothing can be done.they had me working straight evening told them I couldn't work all night they didn't care.
good,The company has had some changes with the attendance policy and because of that you can lose your job quickly. Other then that if you need a job then apply
good,"They offer good benefits, 401 K, medical insurance, dental insurance, short and long term disability, competitive wages, clean environment. always busy"
good,"Given the right management team to serve under the job can be very rewarding. Great opportunity to learn new things, work in different departments. Benefits are great"
good,"I learned how to stock and zone freight, I also learned how to read freight stickers and barcodes run pallet jacks and box compactors. Overall a good company to work for. I learned alot."
good,Worked here for a summer job. Manager and other associates were kind and patient.Pace was dependent on days some more busy than others. Overall great job for high school or college students.
good,It was a pretty decent job at first until I was moved to cart pusher for getting hurt twice. Cap Team 2 was the best position there even tho we only had 5 people.
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for. Truly. I am constantly on my feet, my days go by so fast because im constantly working. The pay is manageable for anyone. I learned a lot from working there. I definitely upped my customer skill points and it really helped me be vocal. I think the hardest part about working there is the customers, you could be dealing with super nice people or some people who have had a really rough day and takes it out on anyone they see. But, it helped me grow in being able to handle my emotions and theirs."
good,"I worked at self check out host which means helping customers when they need help or if they set off the machine by not scanning items or fixing prices."
good,Walmart was a good workplace many types of job duties but some of management was unfair and very strict at sometimes most of the work environment is timed and fast paced
good,Working for Walmart is great they help when need to be help look out for each other friendly to fellow associates. Just always great vibes management and managers do their job and always making Walmart a better place to shop
good,"I actually loved working at Walmart, but I wasn't a cashier or a stocker. Their new attendance policy could be great, but they do not tell you how to apply the PPTO you've accrued to days missed due to illness or injury. So you still get occurances even if you had the ppto to cover."
good,Buena corporacion para aprender múltiples funciones
good,I really enjoyed working with a few of the managers and made a lot of good friends in the other employees. Some of the customers were great to work with as others could be a handful.
good,You have to love working with the public because it's not easy. I love working with the public and my associates.. Knowing how to handle unsatisfied customers is the number one key to working with the public.
good,Off job a little but it fits Looking to have better love in makin then when I there I like the job but somethings u can complain about but gotta deal wit it so not really bad cool collective job just keep your head up
good,My job as asset protection was one of the best jobs jobs i have every had. I enjoyed the action that came along with the job and I enjoyed working with the team that I was assigned too.
good,"Depending on what shift your on, you will not get any hours certain parts of the year. The benefits are great, it’s a great working environment, poor management depending on what area you work in... PTO is what you make it"
good,Great benefits but upper management is not the best because they really don’t take care of there employees but the pay is great and the employees are good to work with
good,"I learned a lot while working at Walmart. I gained more knowledge on the flow of the retail business, and how important management is for the associates."
good,"Job is stress-free as long as you and your team are not expected to do the entire store's job  (including management). The workplace is steady, day to day."
good,"i loved everyone i worked with, everyone was so nice and friendly and welcomed me to the ob with open arms. But the lack of hours they gave me is what made me leave."
good,"The management is relaxed, but makes sure you get work done, and the other employees are laid back and work hard. The management helps in any way they can, and are overall fun to work with."
good,"They say retail is fast paced, but Walmart is on another level. Typically being the biggest and baddest store for miles in several towns, you’d think they would have more employees. They stretch their associates far too thin and give them ridiculous task times. Not to mention for a multi billion dollar corporation, their stores have a lot of problems when it comes to repairs. The people you work with and helping customers almost make up for somewhat indecent store conditions."
good,Within the time working at Walmart I made some good friends. Working here you have to work at a constant pace and try to accomplish the amount of pallets you have by the end of the night
good,Mangment was the worst I ever seen or had in my life they was so young and disrespect it just was time for me to leave they was very favoritism in that place
good,The only thing I didnt like was there were no armed guards guards were doing eveyrthing but thier job which was to support customer host other then that everyone was nice
good,i feel like it was just the one i was working at. A lot of the stuff there was not as updated as the other stores. So it made things a little difficult.
good,Walmart Distribution face pace logical job. The most enjoyable is with helping my team group. The hardest part of the job is making goal for the week.+
good,i hate this job its hard and stressful the managers dont treat you fair they show alot of favortisim it sometimes if your a people person  beware these customers they make you hate people
good,"It's a good place to work for."
good,I fell into depression.. this effected my attendance so i choose to leave.. it was nice that my manager understood my reason and place me on the rehire list..
good,Demuestra q es una empresa q piensa en el bienestar de los trabajadores dando un buen grupo de trabajo y estabilidad laboral
good,"It’s an okay place to work. Very very low pay at the store I worked at. Very early hours. My supervisor was really nice and I liked most of my co workers, HR were pretty rude."
good,I'm treated fair and I have the opportunity to move up in management. It's a good work environment. The health benefits are fairly decent especially the dental care.
good,"This job allowed me to learn how to cross train and become very close friends with the people I work with. This place was a job that I was able to come to work and be excited and happy to attend. As other people were hired, the job became strained, but I still enjoyed working with other workers and the management team."
good,For the most part it is a fun place to work. I get to learn a lot about money machines and working with the money safe. I clean my lane. They are not pushy people.
good,Management does not manage. The associates sick as a team to get the job done. Customers love to be welcomed by us and to be involved with our company.
good,Walmart is a good job to have the company I was at was just a little unorganized. Even with that everyone was still a team and worked hard to solve problems. It was a great experience and gave me some skills in solving difficult situations and some experience on a register. They also helped me become more responsible and thought me how to take ownership for my mistakes
good,"Management always has backs you up. Fast paced workplace. People are rude, but you learn how to manage it throughout the day. If you work and go to school at the same time, you have to let management know about 2 months ahead to get all the paper work done."
good,Unload the truck take to the floor stock get the store ready for the next day work on the register did a few remodeling to store put together a super center
good,"I stocked shelves, changed labels, moved shelves, cleaned, help customers, answered the phones, put back returns, also when Walmart was very busy I would sometimes help with the register"
good,"normally all I did was out away truck decorate cupcakes and help stock the floor. although I knew how to do all 4 sections in the bakery. the hardest part was working in the bakery because my mom has passed away a couple months prior and she use to be the manager of the deli so work was a constant reminder of her. I asked to be moved but was basically told I would be stuck there. I liked Walmart a lot just not the area I was in, the manager over there was a grown women who acted as a 16 year old. It was just hard trying to deal with my own problems while constantly being looped into her drama and crazy antics."
good,Ok at the time. different everyday never know what to expect. A lot of stress especially during Holliday season. Great management willing to work with you.
good,"ambiente de trabajo bueno, una calidad de vida buena"
good,The work place culture was pleasant most of the times. The top management needed a little improvement however the Department Managers were great to work for. The hardest part of the job was working short staffed. The most enjoyable part was working with a great team of coworkers.
good,"Had a good 16 years at Walmart now wanting to do something different  , worked on the floor , helped customers and cashier work, the people I worked with was very helpful and made great friends enjoyed working  with all them"
good,"I enjoyed my time there despite 6 months only but until they create numbers that are obtainable for pickers without them actually ""cheating the system"" (working through break, working through paid lunch, etc. I seen it all and people will do this to keep their 100%), I don't see this as a job for anyone 35 and older unless you get involved in a different department other than being an order filler. Even with that said, forkilift operators, replenishers, etc. have a quota base job as well. It's dog eat dog mentality there and as long as people are making their numbers, they could care less about anyone new or anyone that struggles with learning the curves. There's retraining available but the welcome mat wears thin after two or three times at this. You hit so many ""steps"" and they let you go and God forbid you need a band-aid or get an injury, the blame goes on you and you get written up for it because they will find a way to report it as something you did wrong (lifting wrong, stacking wrong, the list goes on) and they try to re-enact the events despite they weren't there to witness any of it. They just go by the info you give them (or the persons involved) - quite humorous really despite the seriousness of the situation."
good,"A typical day at work is making sure that all my overnight associates get all the freight thrown and that I turn over a good store in the morning with my Assistant Manager.  I teach and train my associates on what they do well and what they need to improve on.  I help my associates when help is needed.  I am the first person my associates are to report to unless it is something that I am not eligible to do.  I also work with my mod team to make sure they are resetting the departments to corporate standards.  The hardest part of my job is making sure the store is good condition for the Market Managers, even if I am really short staffed.  I enjoy working with the associates I have and work well with my Assistant Managers."
good,"I come in, scan my bag to see what register I have to go too. Go to my register, clean it and zone my area and help customers when they are ready to check out."
good,"They generally promote from within, and they cross train you on various positions which increases chances of being promoted. They generally work with you on schedule flexibility."
good,Great place to work. Money is there to be made. Long stressful hours along with production that has to made at all times. Very hot during the summers and cold during the winter month.
good,I would love to work at Walmart Again friendly employees great job love to work there again if I can Had no problems with My Employees great place to work good position ahead at the job and met a lot of new friends
good,Typical day is easy even paced. I learned how to use rf gun. Great clock in or out system. Everyone greats and helps everyone.  Most enjoyable is seeing different people.
good,Walmart is okay too work at if you don't mind not having a life for awhile. It's long hours some days cause of food stamps & that's usually a long busy week or some days its a 4-4 days a week depending on management i guess?
good,Walmart been good to me i have nothing bad to say other than should hold an person accountable for there own actions make sure the shifts runs smoothly love the people ive work with always there if there an problem outside of work there help you though it
good,"This job was helpful and some days were better than others, but it’s hard becouse of the drama that some of the staff and managers cause. The Walmart I was employed at was a neighborhood Walmart and was great in the beginning but it’s a hard environment that was difficult to work in."
good,"I did price changes , stock shelves , rotated stock , unloaded trucks with forklift in meat dept. I did inventory control . I worked deli and I worked on the over night floor crew ."
good,I enjoy my position at Walmart. Walmart believes in pushing their employees to grow within their company. They believe that I would be a great manager for their store and made sure I was successful while doing so.
good,Big work place customers coming from different angles speedy checkout serve customers at they will greet people with smile and always say something plit
good,Walmart was a fun job to be in. Everyone seemed to connected with one another even if you didn’t know them. They have you a lot of opportunities to move upwards. But the benefits wasn’t all that well. Sometimes lie to the associates to make them look better.
good,It was nice working with my team to help the customers with whatever needs they had. I would recommend working there without a doubt. It’s not for everyone but it works for a lot of wonderful people.
good,Its a good place to work at and learn new things. They work with you and help you adjust to anything. At time work can be entertaining and fun after working so hard.
good,When I started I loved it but I feel like it depends on who’s your manager but I love my job. I’ve made so made friends and these just some great people you meet everyday
good,"Walmart, Prejudgements on the very first customers service desk always started as you just tried to work your self with new enthusiasm on a old workplace."
good,"My number one pro about my job is the people.  I have an amazing team! They make they day better. "
good,The job was easy for me. I fit in with everyone no matter what. I had no problem making friends. I learned how to attract people just by the way they appear. The workplace was very laid back. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday.
good,Walmart is one of those jobs where you can climb the ranks quickly with some good work. My management team was fantastic. My coworkers became close friends of mine. time flew by because I was always busy.
good,"Working in the bakery you get to do a bunch of fun things; decorating cakes, cupcakes, and donuts. the hardest part was organizing the freezer because being in the for long periods of time can suck."
good,"I liked being a Cartpusher, but i was forced to work alone on one side with no Help. I even told but little was done. Most of the employee knew how hard worker i was and Some Management. The Point system wasn't a problem until we got two new cart associate , so they let me go."
good,"There is never a dull moment at Walmart.  If you like a fast paced workplace this is it.  They offer a lot of incentives, often have meals and snacks."
good,"Often a pleasant place to work.  Manager is always there to help, and I learned more about vehicles than ever before.  The hardest part about the job has to do something with some customers that try to make it hard on us employees while we stay calm throughout the whole situation."
good,Productive and safe workplace. The most enjoyable part of being a sales associate is the relationships with co-workers and customers. It's easy to help customers find the merchandise they're searching for.
good,The work load was higher compared to the payment. Very busy place to work. The wages were really low and there were only slight increments in pay annually.
good,"Great work place, friendly work environment. Fast past a lot of desint employees to keep you happy and likening your job. Friendly and helpful, great learning experience."
good,"They can improve in team work!!"
good,Very hard to work like a manager without getting the pay while you're manager's acted like you was their boss. Everyone always came to me for questions on what else needed to be done next.
good,Cajera rellenaba productos también y limpieza mantenimiento
good,"Boa empresa para trabalhar,precisa melhorar em questão administrativa, mais gostei de trabalhar nela,da chance de crescimento profissional , aprendi muito com minha liderança sistema da empresa, relacionamento com meus colegas de trabalho, melhor forma de atender o cliente que é a razão de ser da empresa agradeço pela estadia"
good,I used to like working there but they have to treat all associates equal. Other than that i miss working there. Some customers you learn to love seeing them all the time .
good,"i enjoyed meeting new people daily, you never know what to expect at Walmart so many different cultures in and out the store, that is what i miss the most working at walmart."
good,"Great place to work. Management sometimes works with your schedule. Place is clean and safe. Employees all work as a team. To move up, you have to exceed all expectations."
good,"Stay on your toes  toes don’t make any friends do your work and get out nobody is your friend stay to yourself , always smile when helping an customer."
good,Walmart isn’t a bad place to work. It’s fast paced and can be great. The main issue were limited scheduling and a disconnect between home office and the store its self.
good,It was a good place to work I had fun it was a good experience fast paced always friendly I was always on time. Friendly co workers. And it’s a safe environment
good,Some days were better then others I worked with people my age so kind of hecktick but other then that I liked it I liked the older workers better because they understand me
good,Not too hard as long as you like people. The hardest part of the job is standing for so long if you are not used it. It takes a few weeks for your feet and legs to adjust. Most of the managers are pretty nice and understanding.
good,The company could use some updates and not be so picky with whom they get applications from and be better on allowing days off when needed especially when it is a pregnant worker.
good,"nothing to hard, depending on the shift."
good,It was good. But only if you wanted to just earn a little extra money. But I made great friends that will last a lifetime. I was overall happy with working there
good,"Working at Walmart can be a great opportunity for someone who is just getting started in the job market, is attending college, or has other responsibilities that may hinder them from a regular 8-5 job."
good,"I liked working at Wal-Mart as a Front End Assistant Manager, but a lot of times I worked longer than my assigned shifts and sometimes I worked six days a week with only one day off."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet new people everyday. In really understanding the One best way to make the company work as well as its been doing
good,"Cap team 2"
good,The work was fast paced and steady the majority of the time. Management was very flexible with family emergencies. The environment was always positive even when things got stressful.
good,I was a cashier for walmart for 7 years and i have learned alot when i was working at walmart .the workplace was a fast pace job to do. the management team was fun to work with.
good,"I love the job but is not enough for life living! Raise is not much but other than that is not bad to work ther, good thing if you’re area is not working you can help in another area meaning you will fulfill your hours."
good,Very fast paced the hardest part of my job not being able to do more for the customer. The work place culture is good at Walmart the look of it and atmosphere  brings back that old Walmart
good,Wonderful work experience. Good team of Employees and Managers. Very friendly staff and flexibility with schedule. Great source of leaning best customers service.
good,"It really depends on what store you work at. They all have the same processes so it's easy to transfer, but everything else is different in each store. Some stores are like a huge family and those are the successful stores. While there are some stores that have 160% turn-over rate and they don't do so well."
good,"No quesito estrutura , não tenho o que reclamar , mas ela não sabe escolher seus líderes , alguns confundem as tarefas , mas e uma empresa regular ."
good,I worked at a store that wasn’t a super center it’s was more of a family type of environment. You only get discounts after you’re first 6 months and insurance after a year. While at a super center you get all these things they cut your hours like crazy because there’s more people. At super centers management doesn’t care about anyone. It’s very stressful.
good,"I didn't enjoy working at the Walmart in my Location / city But in the future I wish I have a better Experience with Walmart, hopefully I'll be able to Get Seasonal work"
good,staff and customers were very friendly. guaranteed hours of labor. pay and benefits were good as well for the hired position. management was attentive to customer and staffs' needs.
good,The management was questionable at times but had an easy work environment and the coworkers were easy to get along with. There were a very small amount of people that I would consider a challenge to work with.
good,"A good, for your first job to start.  Your hours will vary from day to day.  New workers will not get first shift. They would not work around my class."
good,"Prepare yourself for a chaotic environment, and learn how to quickly adapt to change. The salary and benefits are high in order to keep managers from leaving the company. Physically exhausting, as there never seems to be enough time, resources or wages to keep the store clean or well stocked. But a great place to hone your leadership skills. best of luck!"
good,It was okay. Every day job was to work in the freezer. With really no help had to count everything every day was in the freezer for hours manager wanted it done
good,"Overall, I had a lot of fun at Walmart."
good,I would enter at 8:00 AM and was able to fill all my prescriptions before we opened. This allowed us to concentrate on orders that just came in.The work flow was continuous and smooth.The techs had a set break and lunch.The pharmacy manager was easy to work with and had a good sense of humor. The hardest part of the job was the commute which took about an hour from my house. The best part of the job were the benefits were good.
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for.  They do promote from within.  The store manager that I worked with started out as an hourly associate.  However, Walmart's #1 priority is their bottom line.  Walmart likes to make itself look good.  For example, they gave us pay raises so that they could say, ""We LOVE our associates!""  But to pay for the pay raises, they cut our hours so that we were actually earning less money per pay check than what we were getting before the pay raises."
good,Been at Walmart for 5 years and it has it's up and down  depending on the manager that's over you. I just go work to work and make my money and go home
good,Productive if you can find equipment. Stressful some days. I've learned alot. Always changing electronical wise to make job easier. Relaxed dress code.
good,"Walmart was an exciting company to work for, I loved the fact they marked  down their meat so it could be affordable to customers, and donations they gave away to the less fortunate."
good,"Walmart is an okay business to work for. Besides being understaffed, work can be fairly smooth. You may have a customer or few who can be quite rude. But you have your occasional nice customers. As far as management it could have been a little better but not bad enough to complain about."
good,"Come into to work , gather all the loose cats in front of the store an that's not in the cart holders. Next , I would get an electric carts that's around and bring them to be pugged up. Last, I would have to grad the machine that helps get the carts out the holder an put them together an take them in to be reused."
good,"Wal mart is an ok place to work some of the mangers has they pick and choose co -works . They ok i have no ill will to say abt the place my sister has been employed there for 26 yrs,"
good,"Decent first job, with plenty of opportunities for advancement within the company. Benefits are solid and the pay is competitive for an entry level job."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. I had issues with management about my school schedule. I was told they didn't look at availability during Black Friday time in which I had college final exams. There were also times the schedule changed with no notice. On my original day off, they put me back on the schedule with no notice and I was terminated for a no call no show. They would not even give me unemployment."
good,The policy needs a lot of work. The people I worked with were very nice and willing to take shifts when I needed them especially since I was sick a lot
good,"The manager over the cashiers is the BEST! "
good,"Enviroonement de travaille agreable malheureusement manque parfois de gestion, de temp et d'heures"
good,My experience there was rocky start but I love the people the I worked with they help u never leave u hanging.. Always look out for one another.. Good quality in the people in just a place that u could call home
good,This job changes took place daily. The production was very difficult to get daily. The accountability is unfair for the amount of work that is available. The unfairness that takes place on a daily basis.
good,Typical days were long but went by Fast because I was always busy. You met new people everyday from customers to Employees. One big Family is how I describe it.
good,Fast paced environment always changing to ease customer shopping experience. Loved the job simply not enough hours to make a career out of it unfortunately.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart for a limited time but did not intend to stay there for long. Management above me was not the best but the sales associates who worked for me made it worth the stay.
good,was able to gain better ways of dealing with customers and learned how to be patient. Gained more work related skills and ability to move up with in the store and company.
good,"It was a good job to have in high school, but if i was to move up, it would be difficult, and moving onto another job would be hard as well. Especially Watertown's facility, which had less than excellent staffing."
good,All in all a very good place to work. But if you allow it they will take advantage of you and your work ethic. Have to be able to take in alot if you work here.
good,Working for Walmart was a good experience.   Your job was expected to be done in a timely manner and done to the expectation  of management.  Which gave you a feelin of pride for caring about your job and getting it done right.
good,"The point system was riddled with disadvantages, with the probation period giving you only 3.5 total points for your first 6 months, that moves up to 9 after that time."
good,The job was awesome I simply had to relocate in the blink of an eye. it was a very far distance from where I reside and my family then moved even farther.
good,"Walmart is probably the most decent job I had because it offered everything u needed that a job should have. Their were benefits, raises, bonuses, and opportunities to advanced."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Very fast working. Walmart has very good insurance. The schedule is very flexible. Walmart is also a good place to move up in management.
good,I enjoyed working here. Patient center care was my focus. Raising awareness for regular health immunizations was my job and I excelled in it. Pharmacy is life and my time there was amazing.
good,"You are on your feet ALOT while working at Walmart. You MUST enjoy working with the public, which comes easy for me, but not all are cut out for it. There is plenty of room for advancement when you work for Walmart!"
good,"Did Qpr walk, counted depiosts, store walk , check on associates, store meeting, work on frieght, trucks, order items for store, helped with customers, help associates mods,work end caps,what ever else we needed to do."
good,Working at Walmart was good but it required you to stay on your feet for a long time. The hours were okay but there wasn’t an option for full time positions.
good,"Cashing customer purchases out."
good,"Working at  Walmart was always quick paced. The employees would receive one hour and two fifth teen  minute breaks. The company also offers you an employee discount  card. So that the employees can purchase items when they are off. Part-time and Full-time employees, both receive vacation time, and employee benefits."
good,I learned a lot at Walmart and it helped me improve as a person. The people that worked there is fun and active. They were willing to help beginners and improve their work ethics.
good,Walmart taught me a lot of things I learn new things everyday Walmart also changes every year but I’m looking to move on to more money and learning different things
good,a good day with my co-workers. They enjoy helping customers. I learned how to coupon and i learned how to interact with different customers of all ages. the hardest part was the short breaks and when people called in and left us short handed Management was ok
good,Great place to work with great benefits. The only downside to this job at the time was the pay. Other than that there really isnt much you can complain about.
good,"i  am really a people person i like to help out alot so i help customers as much as i can, busy job but very productive, managers were acceptional, and respectful."
good,"My coworkers were great, I loved working with them every day. The management wasn't the best and it made it hard to work there. Overall it was a good job but the management wasn't good at all."
good,There were a lot of managers who do not appreciate the workers and constantly demand the most while providing nothing towards the organization. Overall mediocre experience but a great learning curve.
good,Walmart gives you enough  help to perform your task daily. The company is growing so fast and big and wasting too much money on unnecessary stuff like overlapping pharmacists even in a very low performing pharmacies. i think this is recipe to fail
good,My time here at Walmart was an amazing experince. My job responsibilites changed day to day which allowed me to gain expeerience within different departments.
good,A typical day at work was you never knew what would happen with in that day. I learned patience how to handle situation. Management was wonderful. The hardest part was sometimes saying so late. The most enjoyable part was when I made someone day.
good,"Buena empresa ,  horario flexible para estudiantes"
good,"•	Loading and unloading shipments"
good,Walmart in my opinon working wise isnt to great it had management issues alot of schedule changes and most of the co workers didnt seem to friendly wasnt being treated fairly so i left
good,"a typical day was fun n I learned many things day to day "
good,"Pago puntual "
good,"The most enjoyable part about wprking at walmart was the people I worked with, customer that came to shop there, walmart had some good sale.It helps you learn more about the retail bussiness."
good,Fast paced workplace with production goals. Wages are ok but could be better. Hours are normally less than 40hrs per week. Hours are unfavorable. I work at 3a.m.
good,Walmart is a loving caring family orientated company I love working with the public I love the paste that Walmart system is on  I want to succeed in an environment of growth and excellence to meet personal and organizations goal
good,They are flexible with working with your schedule. I was in school in they adjusted my work schedule around my school schedule. The management team is pretty cool.
good,"While I worked at a smaller Neighborhood Market location, I can honestly say, I had some of the best times working for Walmart. Working in the pharmacy, I dealt with customers, local doctors offices and insurance companies, so it is definitely a fast paced environment. Everyone gets annual raises on your anniversary date, and quarterly bonus depending on store sales and reviews. They offer 401k and stock options, and they do match up to 5-6% of the 401k. Even though they are improving the wages for employees, it could still be better. If they added more full time positions, I probably would have stayed, but it seems like they want more part timers so they do not have to pay for too many benefits"
good,Work is tough and a lot is expected. I have learned a lot about customer service and how to handle tough situations. Management is pretty good aware of situations going on and treat us well.
good,Walmart was a very good job personally I would tell people to go there its a good job not hard at all. Work goes by fast long as you do work and it’s very smooth nothing to really worry about just do you work and go home.
good,"I started my day with going to the backroom to see if we had freight to work, If we did I would do that. Depending how much freight I got done, I would go to the back and see if we had any picks. (Picks are our overstock items that won’t fit on the shelf and put in the backroom on a shelf to put out later whenever we ran out of the item on the shelf) if I finished all my work for the day I would help wherever they need help around the store. (Like cashier, hardware, housewares, toys, seasonal, and stationary.)"
good,I love working at Walmart just wanna work in my field the hours are good . I love the benefits that Walmart have to offer fast pace job good people to work with.
good,"Pra pessoas que gostam de ver pessoas e ""movuca"" muito bom, aprendi ser um ótimo profissional, fui operador de caixa e depois de 1 ano fui promovido a fiscal de caixa, a gerencia muito boa tinha boa vivencia profissional, o mais complicado em comercio é lidar com o consumidor independente da situação e eu gostava muito de ser fiscal."
good,Wal-Mart is a good place to work. Has a good work environment and benefits. It's a hard job but for anyone willing to put in the work it can be rewarding.
good,Fue una experiancia muy buena apremdi muchas cosas
good,"Wal-mart is home to a lot of great employees and managers. Overall, the job is fairly easy to accomplish and anyone with people skills will flourish in this type of environment."
good,"Had fun working with the people that i did work with. Management was Okay, some better than others, I learned that you can get promoted but it is based on  how management likes you. The hardest part of the job is being promoted to what you want to be. The most enjoyable part of the job is to work with the friends and talking to people through out your work day."
good,no complaints it was a good working environment. it was fast pace at times but you did have your time to relax. I loved management. most of my co workers was awesome.
good,It was always fun times working at Walmart. Just got unlucky being sick and let go for attendance.  Would definitely recommend this company for anyone who wants opportunity to climb in the work place.
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for and they work with you around your schedule. "
good,"Walmart is very fast paced and demanding.  Can be a fun place to work, depending on the store and management team.  As a manager, it's necessary to find a work life balance in order to move up."
good,Work life balance is great. Never felt stressed or the need to work long hours. Most people I worked with were pretty incompetent. The IT department was notorious for being extremely slow and not getting things right. Your job satisfaction was probably largely dependent on your direct supervisor. Some are good and some are bad.
good,The work was hard but rewarding. I learned a lot of things i had not known before working at Walmart. The management was kind and every helpful when needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they needed.
good,"it was a good store to work at .the customers are really nice to deal .the management was alright , the only thing I didn't like was the fact that it was union ."
good,Too much to do and not enough time to get it all done. The best part of working at Walmart was the customers and associates I got to work with.  It felt unsatisfying to not be able to get all that was expected done.
good,Walmart makes sure the employees have proper benefits for the job that they do but can be a bit unorganized at times. Some days are better than others as in most places but there are a lot of miscommunications.
good,Some days can be more fast paced than others. You have to assist customers with questions about where a product is how it works or maybe even helping them carry it to their cart or car.The best part is it being so diverse & learning from customers.
good,"As someone who is single with no kids, being an ASM at Walmart is great. There's always room for advancement in the company, and the benefits offered as an associate are great."
good,"Fast paced workplace. I liked meeting new people every day and sharing stories while checking out.  Also returning items was always a good change of pace, along with changing locations around the store."
good,"every company has its problems but overall its a decent job. If you want to make a nice amount of many and love retail, this would most definitely be a great job to start at"
good,Enjoyed my brief employment  and would recommend applying to anyone with aspirations and goals great experience due to fair management and fellow colleagues
good,"grateful to have the opportunity to work for Walmart, although their amount of hrs they can give has to improve . very fast paced on busy days and an amazing store manager"
good,"Preparing myself for a Busy day,Making early mornings phone calls,reminding customers that there prescription has been ready for pickup for a certain amount of days.I learned familiarity with phamaceutical products.I had an awesome Manager that treated me with upmost respect. My hours was very reasonable. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some customers with attitudes.And last but not lease was getting to know my customers. marjority of them became my friends. PERHAPS MY FAMILY."
good,"I loved working for Walmart until the customer first program started at the beginning of 2018. It is a computer based program that creates the schedules. I am a divorced single mom that has custody of my children every other week. On the weeks I have my children I could only work until 5 pm so I could see them. Before this program started Walmart was willing to work with my certain schedule. But after they told me it was up to the computer and couldn't guarantee those hours. So in a nutshell I put blood, sweat and tears into my employment and then got crapped on. Walmart doesn't care about their employees lives! All they care about is the almighty dollar!"
good,"Clocked in went and got the freight that we recieved over night, took that straight to the floor to be put out. Most of the day is was un boxing the shoes and hanging them up organizing them. Along with answering jewelry pages to go up front and help customers with the picking out just the right ring for them."
good,The store management was excellent. The upper management (district level) liked to micro manage the management teams. You always were a favorite unless you asked questions on direction.
good,The customer are friendly and I think it would be a great experience to some people. When you have a problem you have a great group of managers that’s there to listen and help you manage your problems
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart you get to meet a variety of people and everyone that works there is like family if it was for the kids getting sick I will be still working there I will definitely recommend Walmart as a fun exciting and wonderful place to work
good,i got to work all over the store learned new things every day i got to work customer service meet new people i did cashier work the store was a great place to work.
good,"I didn't like that they were VERY against overtime hours. They watch your time in and out like a hawk.if you need to get something checked or get information to a higher up, its exhausting. Plus side, the employees and management are very nice and help in whatever way they can when you're able to find who you need to talk to."
good,"work ethic was fine but I had a few issues with the point system in place for tardiness. That and, I wanted to transfer to a different area but was unable to."
good,Walmart was fast paces environment where you could advance with a strong work ethic. The pay and benefits are not very good but you do get discounts on everything within the store being a employee.
good,We have a lot to get done in the day but it can be done. Just pass yourself  and things will get done with everything you need to do in our shift. Do the cleaning and stock the the area on your list.
good,Was funny work here and all my cowakers are the best person the I can meet all was good and safe Florida it a beautiful city and the activities so funny
good,"In my opinion, Wal Mart has a wonderful benefits program and great people to work with.  The hardest part of the job was trying to get everything done within a 7 1/2 day shift.  Sometimes not possible with what the company expects."
good,"I have learned a lot at Walmart. I have learned how to manage my time, how to grow and figure task out. I have learned how to be a leader and how to assist customers."
good,The job was alright. Break time was the only thing that would bother me but overall it was sweet. Easy money working in the  Wal-Mart warehouse. 3 days wasn't enough getting paid 13.70
good,It paid well but the management wasnt the best and the breaks were a little too short. I made some friends there though and i did enjoy the fast paced work. It kept me busy.
good,you would come in and get started right away!   orientation  was so long. they now have this new program that after you finish it (it’s on a computer) you go from $9 to $10 an hr. i liked working there some days lol
good,learned time management skills. Stocking different departments within the Walmart Store. Customer Service  Skills assisting customers shopping while accomplishing job tasks throughout Walmart Store.
good,"Working as a pharmacy technician was fulfilling as well as challenging. It was wonderful to help customers with their medical needs, but at times it would be extremely stressful when we were understaffed or when inundated with prescriptions and customers."
good,"To me a typical work day at my local super center was face passed, hard working and neatly mannered. Time was a big deal in my department. Management was good for the most part just the system wouldn't allow any air to breathe on an everyday basis."
good,I was a stocker for dairy products at Walmart. This job required fast-paced working skills along with great customer service. The hardest part of the job was the temperature. Other than that the job was great!
good,You could easily make walmart a career choice and stick with it for a long time you just have to learn to deal with management. It's a good place for some but you actually want to to be able to stay for a long time.
good,Working at wal mart is a great experience.  We multitask in a fast pace environment makes the day go by fast.  The people you work with become family it's a great place to work.
good,I worked at a store that was on the nicer side of town. It was very busy and we never had a problem making apprehensions. Management was always pretty fair.
good,"I actually love being a customer service manager for Walmart. I started out as a deli associate. Then I started to help in produce, apparel, overnight stocking and the front-end. Eventually after only a year, Walmart made me a customer service manager. It's hard work at times and that's what I loved the most. A CSM must oversee the front-end cashiers/customers, the customer service desk, maintenance associates, get all key turns throughout the store, handle the customer/associate complaints, and handle all loans throughout the store. It's a very rewarding position, it will teach you patience and wisdom (knowing what to say and when)."
good,"wonderful place to work, enjoyed my 1 year as a cashier. Management is really supportive and lovely co workers. Had lot fun and will surely recommend for a starter"
good,"9 to 5 job "
good,"The job itself is fun and unpredictable, yet competitive. If you are very physical and competitive, then its the perfect job about you. The only thing I dislike is the favoritism the managers show to certain individuals. Other than that, the pay and benefits and great and the people."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed driving for the franchise. The staff trained me well and kept my spirits high at all times. The surrounding area took care of me with consistent tips (show a little of your personality for big tips).
good,"Wal-Mart was a very diverse  business but could be hard and a hand full at times. It was hard to deal with some customers ,but  great long time career."
good,a good place to work. worthwhile employment. but should be full time hours NOT only part time. there is room for advancement you just have to be willing to apply yourself
good,"It was a steady job, not much fluctuation when it came to changing schedule, but it happens every so often. The hardest part was setting up for holidays such as Black Friday and Christmas."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great idea and a great concept mind you. As an ex employee one is not paid correctly for the billions Wal-Mart is making, products are marked up anywhere between 150% to 500% and that is all profit that the employees do not see. It is like slave labor just to keep a roof over ones head or diapers on ones children."
good,Working here was a okay place to work at. The job wasn't so hard and everybody worked as a team. I enjoyed doing what I did. The hours were very flexible.
good,"Walmart is exactly what you expect it to be, a big corporation."
good,"I clock into work at 4, set up pallets throughout back room, open freight liner truck and start unloading goods to specified pallets, each time a pallet was full, we would bring them to the sales floor using pallet jacks, I learned to work in a fast environment smoothly and efficiently. Management were always cordial when you approached them. Work place culture is why I wouldn't recommend working there. Hardest part of the job was working inside the truck during summer time. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the shifts the schedule to night time so it wasn't hot anymore, less people to navigate through in the store when taking out a pallet."
good,It’s a great company to work for. I really like the job. I benn trying to grt back to work for them. It’s a really good company with great benefits and flexible schedule.
good,I enjoyed it for the most part. I just want something different then retail. I enjoyed my position just need a change. the only bad part of wal mart is there never ending on changing how they schedules.
good,"I love the company that I work for, and also the position that I am in. However, I am not in a position that provides a healthy work/life balance for me. That is the sole reason for my search for a new opportunity."
good,plenty of breaks. friendly managements that listened. hard to move up. works with college students. opportunities to move around company positions. set zoning times
good,Es una buena empresa pero un poco exijente. En algunas cosas.
good,It is a good place to work with benefits.  Co-Workers and great people to work with. The customers are great people. The pay is OK as well as overtime pay.  Walmart is just a good place to work.
good,"I Worked at Walmart Supercenter on Turner Rd SE in Salem, OR for three weeks while I was trying to move up there."
good,You are always busy and meet new people. I love the customer service line of work and this was some much fun getting to create displays and doing resets
good,Overall it was a pretty good experience. Decent pay pretty flexible hours. Very fast paced & got to be willing to be flexible & learn how to work in other departments
good,Fast Pace Different People And Different Attitudes .Walmart Is Very Known So You'll Always Run Into Somebody You Know. The People Are Friendly For The Most Part And Full Of Good Energy. So It Jus Makes Your Job Easier.
good,they are nice and have a good working environment clean and peaceful. have to red line to get the customers to come to you. and do the 82candy which is not hard to do.
good,Walmart is a great place to work with the benefits and incentives if you have an awesome management team. They can afford to pay a lot more for all the work they have manager doing and associates are definitely over worked and under paid. But you can buy stock and 401k good health benefits. The discounts can definitely be a little more for employees. They have a few unrealistic expectations but that's because management is still trying to figure it out.
good,"I love being a cashier but  some of the assistant manager were mean and racist. Which made my job hard. When a particular assistant manager wasn't there I had a great day at work."
good,I don't any review for this company Walmart if you working for is gonna trained for your experience and push to advanced technology for good work for your future
good,"Personally I prefer work that is fast paced and keeps me moving, at Walmart I found myself standing twiddling my thumbs doing nothing for hours. I enjoyed working there for the most part, it just wasn't what I enjoyed doing. But the hours were good and so was the pay, just not my type of work at the time."
good,At tht time needed better manger staff. Even tho i was a cart pusher they didnt care about how hot it was they just kept tell all of us cart pusher to stay out in the heat and keep getting those carts....
good,"I'm a very friendly hard working person that can & will accomplish almost any task given. I love being around people & working hard ,fast paced ,different situations to deal with everyday ,friendly associates"
good,"I enjoyed working there certain days , well we have our days. I always enjoy meeting new people and also resolving any issue dealing with the front end as a manager."
good,"Clock in, obtain money for register, print reports, work the reports, major attention to customers, keep merchandise stocked, work assigned areas for product count,computer entry, merchandise verification."
good,My job at Walmart was very laid back it was kind of boring. It was very well paid for what little you had to do. The store manager was not very nice but the employees didn't have to deal with her often. The assistant managers were very nice and helpful. Overall it was a pretty laid back job.
good,walmart was a lot to deal with. Management was a mess and the co workers was a constant  headache. They didnt have everything in order like it needed to be. Supervisers didnt know how to talk to their employees in a respectable manner
good,got to work punched in put my vest on get my telzon  get my cart go threw all the ails and check the inventory. My expirience was it is a good work place but not as much team work
good,"Cleaning, cooking and cutting meat for customers. Manager was wonderful, scheduling issues at times. I learned about a different atmosphere, a new company and new people!"
good,Wal-Mart is a fun place to work at there are a lot of nice people. A lot of business so you always have something to do. I was a electronics associate but also did cashier i worked face to face with people. I have good social skills i enjoyed the long hours and all of the costumers.
good,I have been with the company a long time. It does have good benefits and vacation time. The management is like anywhere good and bad. In less your full-time you will not get very many hours.
good,"Es bueno el ambiente que se tiene en la tienda, en ocasiones un poco cansado por exceso de trabajo"
good,"what i learned at this job was more people skills and to help customers with there phone troubles. some days there is very long because you are on your feet all day and no customers for you to talk about phones.the hardest part about the job was learning how to set up phones."
good,I would get into trouble for talking to coworkers and customer service managers would always watch me when I walk away. It was my first job but I feel like I learned a lot.
good,"Working at Walmart was a fun experience . The raises were reasonable, but when transferring my work info ,pay check info, and work schedule didn't transfer."
good,"My review of the job I had at Walmart supercenter I did like the job but the only thing that I did not like about the job was the point scale which is based off of  your attendance. If you did not come to work you would receive a point, which means if you were sick you still had to be at work. They don't care if you have a health problem or anything you still had to be at work."
good,"Well, a typical day at Walmart is very stressful and its so much a Customer Service Manager have to handle in one day. We have to run all registers, money center, and customer service desk. And also deal with all customers concerns and complaints."
good,"Empresa con una gran cultura laboral, y perfectamente conformada, se aprende mucho, en todos lo aspectos, culturales, laborales, manejo de personal, emocional, etc."
good,"My experience at walmart was overall good. I was always busy, the environment was clean and a fun place to be. If I could go back I would. The job ocerall gives u experience with all kinds of customers."
good,"In a typical day in my last position I fulfilled management tasks of opening and closing the facility, as well as overseeing a staff of seven individuals. Throughout the day I completed various administrative duties as well, including answering phones, drafting documents and emails, filing and greeting customers. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."
good,"I liked working by myself. But when I worked with other, I hear nothing but drama and gossip. I only talked to a few there but usually stuck to myself."
good,"I came across alot of people,because i was saving the store money....because i stopped shoplifters with their mechandise.I also helped with safety.I enjoyed working with everyone."
good,"The daily routine on the job is the same thing everyday. The direction the company is going, it requires the stores to be on a process to better serve and provide for their customers. I've learned a great deal of my management skills at Walmart over the years. I enjoy the day to day work at Walmart, but I am ready and eager to utilize my skills some where else."
good,a regular day at Walmart is pretty busy. I've learned a lot about customer service while being at Walmart. The hard part about working there is balancing everything that comes your way. For example getting your tasks done plus helping customers. Sometimes you'll get pulled away from your job to do something else. Like run a register or go into a different department.
good,Working at Wal-Mart is an interesting experience because you never know the kind of people you will meet while working there. The hours are sometimes weird but you make decent pay.
good,"-I would go into work open the service desk. Clean, wait on customers,train others."
good,i Met alot of nice people and we helped each other when needed i also got to see some of the singers and models that shop there the manger was very nice and helpful
good,"I really loved being a CSM, however if you were not in a clique they would find a reason to fire you. I learned a lot of management skills, and automotive skills."
good,"Can be very stressful, I am very much a team player but you need people on your team.  Management has changed so much in the three years that the store has opened, that it is hard for any employee to adapt to it"
good,"A very challenging place to work, you will meet a variety of people, with a variety of personalities. Pride yourself on being knowledgable of store products, can be very helpful with customer""s. communication with upper management on any and all issue's."
good,"Its pretty cool working here, the customers are nice. You learn a lot working here and its important to remember what you learn because it does matter."
good,the hardest part of the job was the lifting of heavy RPC's and loading them on the carts to put out the items and down stacking pallets to search for the needed produce to be put out at once
good,Walmart gave me great experience in learning how to keep up a faster pace in the job world I learned how to unload trucks and stock shelves and be on the assembly lines eveything had to be done in a certain amount of time
good,Not the best job I worked for but not the worst. What I like most about this job is it allowed me to be flexible with my hours. I worked all shifts with that company. Which allowed me to hold other jobs.
good,"Have been given many chances to try different positions-consider myself lucky because I have been promoted and able to move. The management at store level is concerned about the people who work there but that is where the concern ends. The supervisors over the market I work in do not care about the people and use humiliation as a tool to motivate the store managers and assistant managers. If someone wants to be promoted, grow a thick skin."
good,I personally think the job I do needs to be done later in the day. It is very hard to know you need to go to sleep when you know the sun is shining so bright still.: ) The computer programs that are used for my job needs to be fine tuned. You shouldn't put out a program and process until it has all the kinks worked out of it.
good,"It was a great, job good pay, healthcare you won't work if your not on the clock you get paid for whatever you do. You can move up at  this job. You just have to be ready to work because you will be timed"
good,"interaction with general public is a learning experience. provides skills that can be used in most any profession for example money management, customer service, time/schedule management."
good,"Working here is not very bad, but it can somethings clash with your personal life, especially if you are a student. You have to let them know ahead of times if you have any important obligations. However, the problem is that you may have to keep going after them. The management need to be a bit more organized."
good,Its ok I guess because it pays the bills. Management sticks with management and thats that. I enjoy the co workers. Some customers are nice and some are rude. No hard part to this job except keeping a smile even when youre being screamed at by customers.
good,"Walmart is a fast-paced and stressful place to work. Offering the "
good,"Family oriented.  Cash count/accounting office and bookkeeping for a "
good,"Store Manager equipped with extensive experience in retail management and sales. Employs excellent leadership skills"
good,Overall a good experience met some great people love the fact that everyone is on the same playing field I started out with wool on when wal-mart bought it out it was a good job with decent benefits
good,"Although it's a very easy job, there's not always much to do(specifically during closing hours) because everything gets done quickly if you're a good worker."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work. They have plenty of good Benefits, and I always enjoy working there. I am really just looking for something that is full time."
good,"Dealing with customers was great, some were rude but I just stayed professional. My days there were tough at the beginning, but than I started to enjoy it. Talking with with customers & making friends but most importantly I loved my job there as a cashier."
good,Walmart pay was great health insurance was great hours very ruff very family time. Promotion not good. Associates some good bad. Exception out of control
good,"Particularmente eu gostei do método de trabalho da empresa, sempre fui muito bem tratada e assistida como funcionária . e também o ambiente de trabalho ajuda muito os funcionários."
good,"I feel Wal-Mart Is an excellent place to work for and to build a career. I would like more opportunity to advance in the pharmacy field, however in retail pharmacy you do not have the option to advance."
good,They were flexible with whatever schedule you wanted to work. There was plenty of opportunity for advancement as long as you were a good employee. They also had benefits.
good,when I worked for them I had an entry level job in Tle. I had great hours and I even participated in the LUBE RODEO which was a lot of fun. It was a program to show off skills and performance and compete with others in your area to be the best of the best. lots of fun and great hours. never really had benefits due to the fact I was young and didn't understand value of them at the time. but I worked forty hours a week and enjoyed my time there
good,"I was a personal shopper for Pick up Today. I would go get items off the shelf that customers would order online, and bring them to where the customer would come pick them up. My schedulecwas mostly evenings ao management would be at the front of the store 99% of the time trying to help with check out lines, but if you ever needed assistance majority of them are willing to try and help. My favorite part of the job was the customers, especially the happy ones! My least favorite thing of Walmart is the the level of respect alot of the associates have for each other. I enjoy working and staying busy so the department that got me to move around throughout the store really helped at staying focused and kept me aware on what the current changes throughout the building were."
good,I did a lot at walmart its a okay job if you like customers and if not the freight overnight sucks thats the only part i hated we needed help but the best was the deli
good,"I loved working on team. It was a nice routine, I learned the perks of working as a team, and knowing how to communicate. Management, was so-so, but the workplace culture was nice. The hardest part of the job was when there was too much freight that needed to be work, but the most I enjoyed was the satisfaction of finishing the job, and well done."
good,Great crew workers and the best customers.. Great benefits good pay ways to get a higher position vacation hours sick pay best staff and bosses.overall great place
good,"I had a bit of trouble with one manager but they all have that one guy that's gonna mess with you, I enjoyed the job and I was cashier, getting to see a lot of people and make they're days better, worth it."
good,It was a great place to work i had  fun working with everyone at walmart. I just didn't like how they would work sum more than others. But other than that it's  Good job it just wasn't for me anymore so i left
good,"É uma empresa que as vezes deixa um pouco adesejar com o cliente.mais é uma empresa responsavel .organizada e atento gualidade e verificação de produtos vencidos a gualidades de determinados alimentos ,limpeza do local."
good,"You have to be on your Ps & Qs! Make sure you follow the chain of command when there is a problem! Be careful who you discuss scheduling, money and personal issues with. Overall, not too bad."
good,"A typical day at work consists of running the register, taking a break, running the register again, taking lunch, running the register, taking a break, running the register again, and then going home. Sometimes I was asked to cover the doors so the door greeter could take their lunch or break. "
good,Great schedule a lot of hard work and responsibility. Definitely not for people who don't like to be constantly moving and are afraid of getting dirty and working hard
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart pharmacy on the west side of Green Bay Wisconsin. The employees where always working hard yet keeping a smile on everyone's faces.
good,"I did have close contact with customers and management. I enjoyed both, specially the customers. I would work for this company again if given the opportunity and more hours."
good,"working here has been an interesting experience that has helped me gain more knowledge to prevail the retail environment. the hardest part of my job is making sure my busiest days with the most orders get done in a timely manner. I enjoy cake decorating. I get to use my artistic ability. when there is a situation that needs solved, management doesn't always fix the problem."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was an fast paste job, although it was my first time working an actual job.Is still had fun working there, The management looked forward me taking care of everyone responsibility. Because I was a very quite person, that didn't care about getting mistreated.The most hardest part was doing my job, and looking out for everyone else."
good,"Empresa da oportunidades de crescimento, a cultura é boa, somos avaliados de acordo com nossos esforços e competência profissional, beneficios bons, colegas de trabalhos eramos uma familia, pois sempre nos ajudamos uns aos outros, no geral uma empresa muito boa para se trabalhar."
good,Great hours i worked with a good team. Overtime was not that great. Was not allowed my breaks all the time. Great that there was an hour lunch. Good benefits
good,Good job good people really loved going to work and was very dependable and have good customer service skills really good place to work i moved to Cincinnati area looking for work
good,"Had a great time learning and getting the opportunity to learn a new job. It was my first Photography Job, excellent opportunity to gain the knowledge to start a career..."
good,"Well a typical day at Walmart would be dealing with upset customers. I learned alot working at Walmart. Some of the Assistant Managers will take their time with you and show you all the ropes. The Management team are good for the exception of the Store Manager. She has no respect for anyone. The job I had was never hard. I really liked getting to know all the Associates, and finding out their work ethics."
good,I've never worked for a company that was more for its associates. I started as a Deli associate and was very quickly promoted up in the company. I appreciated every opportunity Walmart granted me. I would have stayed a lot longer but the management at my particular Walmart were a pretty big problem. We went through nine assistant managers and two store managers in the year I was working there. I've worked in other Walmarts where this wasn't at all an issue and I deeply wish I'd stayed there.
good,"E uma excelente  empresa  pra se trabalhar  ,mas principalmente o diretor da mesma e um péssimo  profissional"
good,"If you are looking for a job that doesn't ask much of you other then your outlined duties... this is the job for you. You are incharge of your assigned check outline in which you will stock items and clean frequently. You must be friendly and welcoming to customers as you will handle their checkout process. Knowledge of proper money handling is a must! The job is a great way to start with a company who will not let you go unless you don't follow simple company policies. "
good,good place to work for. Walmart a good starter job. they have rise they give you. help you throw whatever you need sick paid. leave paid great starter job
good,The management was great. They had a way to make you feel at home. I learned patience in this job as a cashier. It did get a little boring when it got slow.
good,Responsible for stocking and helping customers with carry outs and sales service. Developed excellent peoples' and communication skills as interacted with customers on a regular basis
good,"Good place to work, when I was there not sure how it is now.  I have not worked at that location for years, ans no longer stay in that area.  When I worked there I worked in several department helping out.  I was a great worker so they let me work where ever I wanted to."
good,"Supervise cashiers, answer customer complaints, address cashier issues, put away products, answer calls, and get loans for cashiers. Hardest part of the job is the difficult cashiers, the ones that always have an issue with customers and never seem like they want to be there. The most enjoyable part is some of the customers, meeting different people."
good,Good place to work with good benefits. Gives awards for length of service. I worked as an overnight stocker. Filled the shelves and zoned the area in which I worked.
good,"very low salary "
good,"Great company to work for, management and coworkers are fun to be around and very helpful. I like the work that I do, just looking for something with more consistent hours."
good,People are welcoming and easy to work with. They are always willing to help. Management is great and I really enjoyed working with them.
good,I was a CSM and I actually loved my job. Only reason I left was because of the schedule. I personally had a great relationship with my upper management
good,"my role included managing and supervising Stocking Ism back department unloaded trucks and stock store made pallets for merchandise, promoted within 6months of being with company to department manager of grocery (Responsible for stocking and choosing store items to sell for customer and also create special projects to sell top items, later advance to Ism supervisor with team of over 8 workers to independently manage as well as schedule for shift assignments as well as a plethora of other duties"
good,It was a normal day of working and do what you can do to get the work done. I have learned about of how it works in the workplace. And still learning how to cooperate and communicate barrier with customers and managers. It is difficult for one person to do all the work and timing to get it done is most difficult to do. I like the job to keep busy until the time is over. but cannot expect to be perfect all the time as we had to learn from mistakes. We can fix and solve the solution to make it very effective production.
good,If you are not a people person Do not apply for cashier etc. Alot of times managers were not around to answer questions by that I mean the big ones they would watch the lines get long and then complain as to why they were so long rather than jumping in and helping... also there are more people working there and hours to be given instead they would pull back people off their tasks to come help check and then complain when the back workers tasks were not complete? There are new workers at this walmart manager wise so hopefully its a little more under control!!!!
good,Walmart has a great variety of employees and fun working environment. The particular Walmart I worked at had excellent managers and i enjoying learning as much as I could from them.
good,Too much favoritism and unprofessional. They looked out for those they hang with outside of the workplace. Very rude................
good,"Great work environment, management is friendly/knowledgeable, hardest part of the job is not having the necessary tools to do your job on a daily basis, most enjoyable part is the customers and co workers become like a family to you"
good,"ambiente de trabajo bajo objetivos, los dias son muy dinamicos en cuanto a cuestiones de realizar diversas actividades e inclusive llegar a vender productos como apoyo a la empresa que no es parte de RH pero tengo disposicion a realizar actividades no afines a mi puesto con el objetivo de lograr las metas de la empresa"
good,"I Enjoyed My Time Working There. The Work Environment Was Great, The Ppl Was Friendly, The Pay Was Good. Overall I Would Have Great Days & Better Nights There"
good,"It was a fun place to work. It was unorganized at times, but overall a pleasant experience. It taught me a lot about customer service."
good,"While i worked there i had a fairly good time, though the job i got there simply wasn't at all for me. However the overall atmosphere and the kind people that worked there have me considering reapplying one day for a position that would better suit me."
good,"Trabalhei como aprendiz, adquiri conhecimento na aérea administrativo, a direção da empresa era boa, os colegas amigáveis. A parte mais difícil era carregar peso e a mais agradável era a boa comunicação com o gerente."
good,"You can start out in one positions, and can quickly advance to management positions. you have the ability to gain experience in different departments."
good,being a cashier is physically exhausting and kind of painful. thats all i did with this company. hardest part was standing still for hours at a time.
good,"A day of work at Walmart for me consisted of clocking in at the beginning of my shift, checking they task management system to see what tasks my supervisor has set for me to accomplish and how much time I have to complete each task. I'd go to the first task department, start my task timer, and get to work stocking the merchandise very neatly. The hardest part of the job would be the task management system itself. The store I worked for only had certain computers that would actually work when you scan your badge to start or finish a task, which proved very frustrating at times when I was in a hurry. The most enjoyable part of working for Walmart were the 401k benefits, insurance, and the hour lunch and decent breaks."
good,"i worked there for 3 years, it was a good company and i enjoyed the benefits avaliable. managment was good, i always had good hours. any questions i had were answered promptly."
good,Other than management this job is easy. You just have to keep your head down and take all the BS and let them lie to your face. When working there be prepared to do more than just your job listed.
good,i wont say anything bad about the company but i will say that they give you overtime and have good benefits just be on time and come prepared to do your job
good,VERY BUSY. You do yours and other peoples work. You do get to learn about the store and you understand when people come into the store and are not able to get a location answer from a person who works in the toy department on were the bread is. There are more then one department in the store and each worker has a set department they work in.
good,The atmosphere is great including the customers but the management team lacked a lot of professionalism when it came down to handling personal matters. The open door policy isn't much of an open door.
good,I learned how to distribute merchandise across the store as well as seperating and carrying heavy pallets. Moving at a quick pace. Most enjoyable part was the people the workers were always helpful and friendly. Least enjoyable was how management carried out objectives and fail to relay communication
good,"I worked at produce and it was good part time job with school. At produce you basically have to restock produce throughout your shift,clean work area in the backroom, pull products that are near expiration,make bales sometimes."
good,I enjoyed working there the only issue was that management was never around always talking it forced us to put the customers on hold I use to love Walmart now it just seems they are all about the money instead of their workers or even their customers
good,"The job itself was great, just had poor management. They couldn't get anything right. Soon as i became shop manager everything changed. Everything got easier and more stressed for everyone."
good,"Management is great. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult co-workers. The enjoyable part is making sure that the customers is treated fairly. By doing that, customers will always appreciate you."
good,Enjoyed the people i worked with and the customers. Also enjoyed the discount and bonuses The people i worked with were like a second family to me.
good,Whenever I had a question or needed help my manager was really good at helping me or finding someone that could. She was always there to talk to if I was having any sort of work related problem.
good,My experience at Walmart wasnt as i expected once i started. The management wasnt always there when we needed them. The Csm werent very welcoming. The training wasnt good at all.
good,This job has many opportunities and a great training system. There is always room for advancement and never a shortage on hours. The management team was not really present while I worked there that sometimes made things difficult but overall it was a great experience.
good,it was ok I did my job and I move up in the company and I we be happy to go back . I injoy every minute I work for them  wal-mart did me good
good,"I Love my job at Walmart, I love the workers and managers. I just don't want to work overnight anymore and the pay is very little."
good,"Mgmt hires a lot of people that don't make the job any easier. The bare minimum of employees is required and accepted. One way that became most apparent to me is that keeping a level of personal hygiene is barely a considering factor. Supervisors also lack skills to demonstrate positive and professional workmanship for the work environment. With those points mentioned, in my opinion mgmt loses big points for condoning such poor workmanship and losing sight of coworker and customer satisfaction. These are the conditions I'm referring to. Subpar mgmt and supervisors."
good,Very easy to move up in the company great people. Great benefits and pay for the leisure of the work but like all days it indeed has days but the walmart family helps you get past your problems
good,"At my job I used to greet customers, help with customer needs, price scan, clear the money draw, scan for trash, I also stocked and rung up items at Walmart"
good,Great work life balance and the opportunity to learn how to operate various equipment with proper training. But theirs not a lot of room for growth because you max out in a three to four year period.
good,"I could share so much negativity about this place(Dyersburg,Tn.)branch,but I want.The only good thing I have to share is,as far as giving chances to promote,is OK. Really I don't have too much good to share."
good,I like this job the most very easy overnight just stocked shelves and incident accord and they were not understanding about it so I quit I did not want to but I had no choice
good,You won't hate it but you won't like. The people there are cool though and the managers are okay. You get a lot of hours depending on your position. I was an unloader who started with 32 hours which quickly jumped and stayed at forty however I was still part time not full. You also start at 9.00 dollars an hour. We were kinda also short handed a lot so people were pulled from there job to do something else while still be expected to get there job done.
good,you can always learn new things and meet different people.i enjoyed the most was meeting people and helping in any way I could.the hardest part was not always having what you need to get the job done.Me and my co-workers became a family still today we see each other as family.i was able to learn differnet aspects and departments of the store.
good,"El ambiente laboral . Muy cnforme divertido .. "
good,"Working at Walmart has been a wonderful experience. Walmart gives benefits every 3 months, they understand when your dealing with a rough situation. They schedule you when you are available. There is nothing bad i can say about the company, other than there being more safety rules to protect customers from falling or getting hurt by something in the store."
good,Wal-mart does not compensate well.  Benefits were good.  I liked the work hours on the night shift.  Management treated you well.
good,Customer service oriented requires work on holidays including xmas eve and thanksgiving.  Management is effective when trained properly.  Tools to perform job correctly are attainable
good,"fast paces on regular day"
good,"Loved my co-workers, but hours always got cut. Made great friends but I would work my butt off and go over time but didnt want to pay overtime. and when i put in for transfer the would help me change locations."
good,"a typical day at work, im dealing with all kinds of customers with different backgrounds who i try to make sure they leave walmart satisfied. I learned how to be patient with my customers and associates. learned how to deal with customers during difficult situations. My managers have all worked their way to their positions, im always learning something about the business and how to better myself in my workplace."
good,The hardest part of my job is not getting the tools I need to get my job done. It's very high demand to get all your work done along with the hours being cut. They expect you to accomplish you job task no matter if you work 40 hours or 30.
good,if you like slow pace and helping others you would love this job not very hard to do the staff is great and most customers aren't hard on you you learn basic customer  skills
good,"I admit walmart was a productive job , paid well but didn't acknowledge hard working employee's who seen the greater good in the company not just a pay check."
good,"There is a lot of standing in one place, and opportunities to clean up the aisles and fold clothes when it gets slow.  When it gets busy with customers you may stand in one spot for long periods of time just scanning items and collecting tender.  I learned how to tell if a bill is legal tender or counterfeit, I learned how to treat people in a friendly way, even when they are being annoying, obnoxious, or being otherwise hard to deal with.  Management it alright, sometimes hard to get help when needed if it's a busy day where a lot of people are having troubles, but they are mostly willing to listen to your problems and concerns.  The co-workers are nice and generally will get their fair share of the job done.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get credit card applications, which are tied to your bonus along with if the customers are taking the survey, and other ways they ask you to engage the customer.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people, and if your into talking to a lot of people, that can be quite enjoyable.  Also it was nice to know exactly what the job was, because of the repetitive nature of job.  Also training other cashiers is fun."
good,los días por lo regular son los mismos mucha gente mucho trabajo que supervisar día a día se aprende una cosa nueva del sistema de la empresa en clientes y en productos lo mas difícil es el acomodo de personal y encontrar sus cualidades para que estén en el lugar correcto a laborar lo mas me gusta es poder hacer lo que mas me gusta poder tener un buen ambiente de trabajo
good,Helping customers purchase their prescriptions and learning all about the different types of medicines that people take every day was always interesting because I have always had an interest for the medical field.
good,The customers were great as well as my coworkers. I worked well with everyone. And have excellent customer service. I loved helping the customers who couldn't find something. The work area was fun and refreshing.
good,Was my first retail job great experience worked with a lot of great people had many positions and loved all my experiences
good,Dont mind me wrong Wal-Mart is a good company but as of responsibilities and respect for you they don't have at all. They are very messy and will get yelled at for even doing your job good and finishing on time.
good,"The work and people are great, it's a fast environment with a lot to do so you are always kept busy, the only complaint I have is the head manager overnights has no clue what he's doing and has unrealistic expectations about his employees, it made a lot of good employees quit sadly."
good,"the management in our store are excellent, as well as my co workers. i develop my customer service skills, my work is same routine everyday"
good,There is a lot to say for the most part any of the other co-worker will help you. they have a limited amount of managment that actually care about the employee mainly none of them care.
good,You will make great friends at wal-mart and you will need them lol alot of the co managers are so picky about everythingthey will drive you crazy.
good,It was a good company to work for but looking for more stability and more hours. If you are looking for a part time it is a good company to work for.
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for, however just like any other company it has its ups and downs. Management system sucks, and they are all about seniority. Its very hard to move up with company."
good,"n/a nothing really I loved working at all my jobs . had an amazing experience with all of them .. I enjoyed working there , the ppl were nice .love working with people .meeting new people ............."
good,"I loved working the overnight shift at Walmart. Everyone was so unique and colorful but there was a lot of drama and gossip and issues among grown women and it was rather petty and annoying. "
good,"Going in to work it is a lot of customer service, you must be kind and knowledgeable about what details of information you give customers. My managers are all very nice and help with any needs that the employees have."
good,"es una empresa en la que puedes aprender desde organización, la relación con las personas, formas de responder correctamente, buscar soluciones prontas y correctas y a la convivencia con los compa;eros de diferentes temperamentos  es decir  te ayuda a tener mas paciencia"
good,"it's a job, worked as a night stocker most stable position if you do your job well. Please rest appropriately for overnight stocker position, this job can be exhausting and strenuous."
good,"Nice environment for pat-time associates. "
good,"worked as a cashier for many years, enjoyed getting to know customers and providing customer service. Made my day to see my regular customers come in."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, con oportunidades de seguir creciendo."
good,"Hard management experience. Very rewarding work. Hours long, very hard working around holidays.To many managers in one store. Was always ready to hear conservation."
good,Had to be able to take care of your dept. and help customers at the same time.  Must be organized to get all jobs accomplished
good,"On a typical night at Walmart you'll gather ""L"" carts as you down stack merchandise and separate it by isle. For example, ice cream, frozen waffles, garlic bread goes on one cart, frozen dinners, fries, and vegetables on a different cart. Once the freight has been separated you and your team work freight to the shelves. Overstock is prepped or tagged then placed in bins located in the freezer. The bins have a location tag and using a scanner you place the overstock item to that bin location. After the freight is all worked, you return to the department and begin zoning, or straightening up merchandise on the shelf making it neat and presentable. Some coworkers are wonderful to work with while others are lazy and unreliable. The hardest part of the job is withstanding the cold, and organizing the department because some will ""plug"" items where they don't belong making it that more difficult to finish the job at times."
good,"Started when I was a senior in High school, worked their for a while it gave good experience of what the real world was like, and it's not friendly. The story you hear about wal-mart are true."

good,muito bom relacionamento com colegas e chefes maravilhoso   so sai pois fui embora de porto alegre por um tempo
good,"A typical day at Walmart was helping a lot of customers, which that's what the job is all about, customers come first. I liked that most of the time every day was different. Some days I would be stocking shelves and helping in the back room maybe and some days I would just be busy with customers all day. There were some customers that were a little more difficult to handle but that comes with the job and I learned how to deal with those kinds of customers and learned a lot of patience. One of the most enjoyable things of about this job was when a customer would tell me how helpful and kind I was."
good,"Flexible, fun,and simple workplace that allows you to enjoy your day while being productive. Freedom to do work on your own time while still receiving the help needed."
good,"es una muy buena experiencia laboral en WALMART SUPER CENTER, ya que permite a todos sus empleados adaptarse a una jornada laboral que nos permite realizar otras actividades fuera de, ademas que les da un desayuno con pan y café para el turno matutino y para los del cierre son apoyados con su pasaje"
good,es una empresa con un gran ambiente de trabajo y exelente calidad de trabajo
good,"Typical day is Clock-In; Gather sells materials, which is a few vouchers and surveys; Then tour inside the building and provide a sells pitch when offering the offers from Picture ME Portrait Studio."
good,"Responded promptly and answered/resolved customer inquiries and complaints."
good,"aprendes a no mezclar tipos de alimentos contaminantes ya que son nocivos para los clientes, a estar al orden con las fechas de caducidad para que la empresa no tenga perdidas (mermas) a tener el área limpia ya que lo que me enfocaba era a alimentos perecederos. no tuve ninguna queja de parte de la gerencia ya que siempre se mantenia un trato amable y cordial pero siempre respetando a los superiores, al igual que los compañeros. lo que me gusto del trabajo es que aprendes a tratar con los provedores, y aprender a levantar pedido antes de que la mercancía se agote y no tengamos ningún faltante. la parte mas difícil era entrar al área de los congelados ya que cada semana se tenia que hacer la limpieza y pes el tiempo que tenia que estar en la camara era bastante."
good,Obviously Walmart is always bsy so it can be a hectic place to work. Need to have really good time management skills and be prepared to be flexible a lot.
good,i can always thank wal mart for letting me get pay raises and learn more things inside the store. management was okay they were never really there but the older ones that couldnt do much
good,"Walmart has been my source of income for about eight years."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. All of the associates are extremely nice and fun to be around. It is a really fun and rewarding job.

good,buen lugar para desarrollarse y estar estable con buenas prestaciones
good,"Process that was required to perform certain job functions and having equipment to perform the job efficiently. "
good,Walmart never hires enough people to actually run the store and just works everyone who is working to the point of great exhaustion. The majority of the people who work at walmart are great people. It's just the business itself that is not very good to work for.
good,my time at kfc was may have been short but in the time I was there I got do a lot of different thing like put toys and clothes away ect..
good,This place is a pretty good place to work. I enjoyed my coworkers and the opportunity that i had to work for this company. The promotions are they way they should be .
good,"worked as a xmas temp,staff was always nice and friendly and the customers made it a very nice place to work,colleagues were always happy to help"
good,"This Walmart was one of the more dangerous ones. The customers were unruly a lot of the time and you had to focus very hard on making them happy. Management didn't seem to care a whole lot about the employee's. Working here you really just feel like it's just a job, not something you want to do forever."
good,"The things that I love about working is that is a good thing to do, you got to meet new people, working together with the associates is great things to do to get the work done."
good,The job was a little hectic since I worked around holiday season but they were very nice about trying to schedule me around my school schedule so I can't complain about the hours.
good,"You never know what to expect on any given day. One day you may spend the entire day stocking your department and the next you end up binning overstock and the next day you may be helping out in another department, I work at a very large store which has a full grocery side. I learned a lot about the retail side of life and everything isn't as they always appear. There is a whole lot of things that need to be taken care of and put in order for a store to run at its peak and be successful.Inventory and the process itself is very critical to the business."
good,Most of the managers will not do their own job and expect for you to fix it.The day to day people you work with are good people.
good,"I worked overnights so my responsibility was stocking shelves. The hard part, there was a lot to be done in a short period of time. I like it because it kept me business, which made the night go faster."
good,"I learned a lot about working with the public and about walmart in general. The people i worked with were a great group of people because they made you we got what was needed such as supplies. However, the walmart i was working at shut down."
good,"I am currently a student for Administrative studies. I had planned to stay with this company in the interest of seeing to soon-to-come changes coming to our company. My managers were understanding and said the Office Associate would train me. Unfortunately, now that I need it I'm experiencing some resistance in cooperation or lack of knowledge how to handle my situation. Mind you I did inform them of this two months in advance. I am now forced to leave so that I can get the experience to graduate..."
good,It was a great. I love working night shift. If I could I would go back but the only job opening in kinston is days. I don't think i can see my self there working day shift
good,"Being a cashier at Walmart was fun. Greeting customers to ""did you find everything okay?"" to ""thank you for shopping at Walmart."" Not only that but my co-workers were friendly and outgoing. The hard part of being a cashier at Walmart was the price matching. Customers would come up with an excuse of why they didn't bring their ads, which we had to tell them that we couldn't price match without an ad. On the other side it was an enjoyable job when everything was calm without customers."
good,I enjoyed working freight and interacting with customer and assassinating in their needs.Working in Walmart you have the opportunity to purchase shares and a match program on 401K.
good,I enjoyed working here. It was very diverse. You meet new people everyday. The staff was excellent to work with. A friendly environment.
good,A typical day at work is a meeting in the morning. Then we go stock the merchandise that's on the floor and pull at least two rows of the merchandise forward for the customers.
good,"To Begin With, my typical day at work was start stocking shelves as fast as i can, then i was to clean up my mess and assist customers till the managers found me something else to do. I have learned not to trust co-workers and other people other then yourself.Also, ive learned how to work with customers to help them find what the need and if we cant find it then i would go and look for the product. The management has a poor rating for being kind to workers and co-workers. I mean atleast here in Butler. The hardest part of my job would be working with that assistant manager sherry. The enjoyable part of the job was to see the customer happy at the end of the day."
good,It was very frustrating at times but most of all it was a fun learning experience. The co-workers were very helpful and made it easier to catch on to.
good,"Itemizes and totals purchases by recording prices, departments, taxable and nontaxable items operating a cash register."
good,The hours are great and the productions sells are very great but there is not to much team work. Its either you know or you do not know
good,working nights at Walmart are good not a lot of people around so you can get your shelves stocked quickly and nicely. they toy department is where i was put most often i could put out 10-15 pallets of goods a night

good,"I would work there again, I am just ready for a different scene. I applied for a management job, but was never looked at. They have great advancement if you show that you want it."
good,when truck arrives unload freight off truck onto the sales floor for customers. customers are mostly friendly half the time
good,"Working at Wal-mart is what you make it.Some days can be long and hard while others can be short and sweet. You learn different things such as shelf counts (how many rows of the product goes on the shelf), building pallets, and how to bail boxes the correct way. The management sometimes have their days. My co-works are a big help most of the time if im behind in my work they will come over and help me finish up in a timely manner. I would have to say working more than one aisle a night is a hard part of working at walmart. The most enjoyable part of my job is actually being noticed for the work."
good,i enjoyed making people happy and supplying there needs when they asked for something i would go out my way to satisfy them
good,"Un día laboral en Wal-Mart es algo ajetreado, mucho dinamismo"
good,A typical day working for Wal-Mart would consist of checking your tasks list on  a computer and then completing those tasks as the work day progresses. The most enjoyable part that I experienced was working with nice people for the most part. The worst thing about working at this particular Wal-Mart was the management didn't seem to care about their employees.
good,"Very productive work environment great management. They are very understanding and helpful to those who may not get the job as quick as others. A lot of team work and manger involvement,"
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was very smooth. Other days may have been slightly challenging, due to lack of coverage. Management however was not always at its best, but most of them did what they were capable of doing. Cashiering was very easy and enjoyable. I love to make my customers happy and carrying out their needs and seeing them smile was the best part."
good,"good co-workers, friendly environment, hard working people that's committed to getting things done. Managers very great. Customers nice most times. Maintience was partial. Beneifits was great. I learned alot from working here."
good,"El walmart un día cualquiera es llegar checa puntual de entrada, tu comida y tu salida, saludas a tus compañeros de trabajo, llegas con tu jefe pides tus herramientas de trabajo y atrabajar."
good,"This was a very productive place to work. Due to the popularity of Walmart we stayed busy and that was what I liked about it. Time flew and before you know it, it was time to go. I also loved the coworkers I worked with."
good,Walmart is a okay company. Sometime  they need to understand that workers better. I like working for  Walmart.  They have great management and co-workers.
good,Typically I would be posted in the photo lab.  If the floor was short I would assist as a cashier. The envoronment was always busy and you have to deal with a lot of personalities but I'm ok with that because I love meeting new people and having a positive attitude.
good,".- llegar temprano hacer limpieza de área , prender pantallas ,cherchar etiquetas , acomodar la mercancía nueva , y empesar  el dia vendiendo ."
good,"A typical day at work is; "
good,"uma ótima relação entre empregado e empregador tive experiência"
good,Walmart is place where the customers are always right. Which gets very stressful at times but at the end of the day its a place where people come together as a family to make the world a better place .
good,helped full customer services. Helped full casher when they need help. I had learned a lot of things that I had never done before. I like to work with my co-workers she always admire that I am a hard worker and I have a skills that I can use it in the job. The most I enjoyed to work this company is to meet a lot of people and the are from different countries.
good,"Co workers where easy to get along with, x-mas time was a busy time for us but you learn to be fast at what you do all while making sure the people at your till where happy and found what they needed. some days i would be called back to other parts of the store to help out."
good,I absolutly loved working for walmart they were understanding helpful and great patience with questions. I wouldnt mind working for them part time again.
good,"It has been a great experience, this job has taught me so much. I have learned to be patient with co-workers and especially customers."
good,"we would come in to work, put personal items in our lockers, punch time cards and proceed to the back room. Then we would start binning overstock, until the 10 o clock picks dropped."
good,"Working at Walmart was okay, but I'd rather work somewhere else than go back and work there again. The I didn't like about Walmart was the Walmart I was working at was always crowded and I have anxiety when it comes to that type of thing."
good,"es un buen trabajo, donde se apoyan los compañeros en todo lo que se puede, ademas de tener una hora de comida todos los días, los vienes se hacia una justa para discutir el progreso de la tienda, en el que se nos daba de desayunar, ademas de recibir la experiencia de recibo y conteo, y de trato al cliente."
good,basicly we came into work and hopped right on registrar had lunch for an hour the back to work one more break then we go home. the management is generaly ok
good,"Wal-Mart is a fun and ever-changing workplace with great potential for advancement."
good,Clock in and open your drawer. Greet customers as they come to your aisle. Scan all of their items and bag them accordingly. If money is needed call a CSM (Customer Service Manager). My co-workers were all very nice and easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job was probably how fast paced it was but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle. The most enjoyable part would have to be the support of my co-workers.
good,A typical day at work is counting down the podium as soon as I get there. Then taking over for the other CSM to go to lunch or a break.  Then catching all the calls through out the store for money or costumer related calls.  What I have learned is to be very friendly and adjustable to satisfy all costumer needs in a timely and friendly matter.  My management position is a great position to have with you do have support from you upper management team. Most days is pretty good.  MY co workers are pretty good and they always tell me they are happy to see me when I am there because I catch all their calls and I am there to help them when they need me to be.  The hardest part of my job is keeping up with having enough registers open when we are busy.  This goes back to having upper management support. Sometimes they help and supply you with enough associates that you will need to keep a good flow but most times they are fussing because you not having enough registers open and they do not have enough cashiers associates to make this job easy.  And the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to have a nice flow through the front end and seeing the costumers leaving happy.
good,falta administracion y trato amable y responsable con los empleados
good,"My review for this job is an okay job if you got bosses that will let you work and do your job properly like it should get done. What I learned from this job is to learn to try to get along with everyone at your job."

good,Maintained a clean store and kept the shelves stocked with merchandise. Greeted and helped the customers with a smile.
good,"I started out as a cart pusher and moved inside to help stocking groceries. Management was amazing, though the job itself was rather mind-numbing."
good,Walmart is a good place to work. They are pretty reasonable about scheduling you if you are in school. My mangers were great
good,A typical day at work involved clocking in and setting a register.  You learned how to deal with many different types of people. This job was in high demand and needed to fill vacancies. If anyone has been in Walmart when there was only two registers open would understand.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with a rude customer who may have just been having a bad day. The most enjoyable part with the meeting really nice customers because the day went fast and smoothly with other have a positive attitude.
good,I been at this company for a year. I never thought the pay was that low knowing walmart is majority everywhere in the United States. Its was challenging meeting new peoples co workers learning something new such as the cash registers customer service. I always knew it was always about the customers and how to deal with irate customers. I love my staff.
good,"I learned how to be patient and voice my opinions and concerns. Management is always around to answer questions and address said concerns. The coworkers are wonderful, each store is like one big family."
good,"The job started with a very thorough computer training program, which taught me a lot about what I was going to be doing in my position. But once I began, I ended up being expected to do many other departments' work, and learning new store functions on random days, only to compensate for a short-staffing. "
good,Love the customers. A very good place to work. Nothing ever hard about the job and always had good customer service. Managers always on duty.

good,"Following the sundown rule ( do not wait for tomorrow what you can do today )  makes me more productive thus finishing assigned work on a timely manner.Being a manager , open door policy is important in effective communication. Respect for individual is the key to a harmonious relationship. I normally find a job easy  because I have a positive attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job is social interaction."
good,Walmart is a great compnay but sometimes they forget that we have family. And don't like to work around some of the associates  schedule for them to got to school. And for as upper managment their don't like to listen for ideas that you may have that can make a differnt.
good,"at the start of anyday always a hello or goodmorning. and we would finish cleaning up whatever was left over that last night crew didnt finish. then our first customer comes there and we don't have enough people there in order to work on their car so they leave angrily. then someone gets stuck on freight until they are needed. and the other continues with cleaning the shop. our next scheduled employees come in around 11 so now we can work. it would be the same scenario every week. I learned that Walmart is a good company just the management their could give two craps about your job there. my co workers were awesome id work with them anytime I could. management had the worst schedules for everyone there, there they didn't do set schedules they just through us all around the place. there was even days you didn't even work in the tle section cause they are lacking so much staff. the hardest part would have to be with dealing with management and where your placement for the day is going to be. the most enjoyable part would be working in your assigned area with out any interruptions and you just get the day done with."
good,Walmart Supercenter was quite the experience. There was always something to learn whether it be customer service or learning where to put new merchandise. I worked over nights which was an experience all in itself. People who shop at night are very different from the customers that shop during the day. It was always a pleasure to show someone where an item was located. It was also fun seeing new items firsthand.
good,"El trabajo era muy comodo facil y accesible, me desepciono mucho q no hayan tenido en cuenta mi desempeño, mi asistencia y mi compromiso estando embarazada y me dieran la baja."

good,"Don't be discouraged by the initial positions offered, this is one of the easiest place to advance your career. They are all about promoting from within. If you put in the work, you will surely be rewarded."
good,a typical work day would be me standing and attending to about 15 customers per hour with various needs. for the most part it became exceiting because al you did was either stand and cash out customers or get to walk around looking to help people.
good,"no matter where I work I give all I have in what I do. I try to go above and beyond sometimes I think I try to do too much or so I was told, I didn't think you could, but I enjoy working and doing my job to the fulliest of my best ability."
good,"Um dia na empresa muito bom com uma comemoração de um churrasco com as metas da empresa alcançadas.Aprende a ter mais responsabilidades na hora de trabalho mostrando minha capacidades.A direção era muito boa sempre estava a disposição dos associados e a gerencia sempre nos dando conselho no que é certo e errado pro os associados,os colegas de trabalho sempre unidos ajudando um aos outros,a parte mais difícil do trabalho não sair no horário certo mais acontecia as vezes e aparte mais agradável era quando todos como associados,gerencia e diretoria comemoramos juntos coisas especiais da empresa."
good,"Resolved customer complaints regarding sales and service. Monitored customer preferences to determine focus of sales efforts."

The enjoyable part is job satisfaction ."
good,This position required outside membership sales to local small businesses in the metro west area. I met weekly and monthly sales quotes and found potential members to be receptive to my sales approach despite the overall resistance to Walmart and Sam's Club were up against in the early 90's in the area.

I learned to work really fast and stay that way all night thanks to my Navy background. Management is ok the co-workers are the best part of the job we have a lot of fun together.

After the brief meeting, I go to the department that is assigned to me. I start open the products in the cases and put them on right place on the shelf under the UPC number. The difficult part is to find the UPC number of the products. Each product must correspond with the same UPC located on the shelf. Also one part of my  duties is to help customers to find what they want."

good,"Siempre hay trabajo nunca se podía decir no tengo nada que hacer por que  siempre había trabajo, durante mi estancia laboral aprendí muchas cosas que son de utilidad para mi vida personal y mi crecimiento laboral ya que me dieron la oportunidad de tomar decisiones que beneficiaran a la empresa, durante el tiempo laborado siempre tuve gerentes que tenían la disponibilidad y atención para cualquier duda que se tuviera alguna inquietud  jamas vi favoritismos de parte de ellos , mis compañeros de trabajo después de algún tiempo formamos un gran equipo de trabajo donde todos realizábamos nuestro trabajo en tiempo y forma a manera de que nunca se nos acumularan los pendientes, la parte mas difícil que encontre mientras laboraba es que yo era mucho mas joven que alguno de los compañeros que tenia ami cargo entonces se me hacia complicado que siguieran las indicaciones pero aun así les hice ver que solo era trabajo, lo que mas me agrado y me gusto de mi trabajo es que nunca estaba sin hacer nada, aprendi mucho y que te motivaban para seguir creciendo."
good,overall a good company to work for with flexible schedule. Also enjoyed the people I worked for
good,"A empresa é excelente, ótima pra trabalhar, aprendi muitas coisas , me dava bem com todos os colegas, fiz muitos amigos, a parte mais difícil era ter que trabalhar finais de semana e feriados ."
good,A typical day of work was a constant day of tasks whether you were on a register or doing code sunshine..I enjoyed the fast pace of always having something to do.
good,"A typical day at work"
good,Great place to work at. Many oppertunities for much advancment.
good,I enjoy working for the company but there is nobody in the company that motivates the employees to become a manager and move up in the company
good,"Work day was usually busy and in the afternoon. I had started off a Cashier and in 3 months made my way up to Customer Service Manager. it was a great experience that I and encouraged myself to move up a position.  I had great communication with all the employers at Wal Mart in every Department. "
good,Regular job everyday stuff. management was kinda iffy but loved my coworkers and the customers.
good,This time at Walmart was very stressful. We were always overburdened and understaffed
good,"My coworkers where awesome to work with, the most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers."
good,"Nice easy 8 hour work days. putting things back on shelves. "
good,"Job was easy, but when i was hired i was told i would get full time hours but only worked pt hours"
good,"A empresa é comprometida com os funcionario,mais o Beneficio não era o suficiente para a função exercida e por conta dos estresses com segurados,e tambem por conta da responsabilidade de sigilo de dados dos contribuintes."
good,Working at Walmart can be a rewarding job is you have drive and can handle being pushed.  There is always ways for growth and advancement with pay increases.   You become part of big family that works as team no matter what shift you are on or job duty which gives you support an is always there for you no matter what kind of support you need.
good,"Hard environment, you have to be at the top of you game and physically fit to keep this job. Pay is beyond excellent and so are the benefits."
good,the day was determined by how many customers came in during the day.
good,I loved working with the customers and working with my group of employees. Training other groups of employees for other stores was a great feeling. I had some of the best managers in my Tire Lube Express department.
good,"I loved working with my fellow walmart employees.  I hated that the schedule wasn't set, every day was different."
good,"I dedicated 6 years of my life, soul and body to Wal-mart. I worked hard every day to meet daily goals and tasks. I proved that on my yearly reviews with meets and exceeds. Always receiving a raise. I am proud to say the individuals would make it past 1 year mark are the best in retail. The work is physical."
good,"Wall-Mart does not have a typical day. Every day is a day of on going objectives. Never know whats to be expected,from old ladies needing help with the food on a counter, to people who steal.I learn all ways come to work in a good mood but come ready for action at times, cause its a very public sociable area."
good,"My responsibilites at walmart was many. I trained new employees, stock the store,and  handle inventory. I think I enhanced my skills as a sales associate."
good,Unload trucks for about 2-3 hours depending on number and size of trucks.  Build pallets and move from receiving area and then go to lunch.  Come back from lunch and move pallets to sales floor and then order pick from the bin for the rest of the night.
good,"Me gusta la atencion al publico, primero era llenarme de paciencia por la gente que va apurada, pero despues me adapte."
good,"Wornderful Work place,with skillful management well organized to customer anmd consumers. ive learned and engaged better with one on one customer service.my typical day at walmart was great and relaxed and at a steady pace."
good,"Your experience at this company will vary from place to place, however, the Walmart that I do work out, my managers and supervisors are exceptional. Pay is low though."
good,Working on the cashier register was the best part about this job and I would have loved to stay at walmart if I never moved out of state!
good,"Co-workers are friendly and helpful, as well as all managers.  I've learned how the retail business runs and what's expected. A break room is provided for associates with free coffee, microwaves, and vending machines.  Occasional Bar-B-Qs, and special discounts during holidays"
good,"I have worked for Walmart 15 years, Walmart has great benefits. I worked as assistant manager, department manager,and over night support manager my productivity was outstanding. my attendance was outstanding and my job performance was outstanding. I worked through diversity and I find Walmart to be an excellent career opportunity. I would like to be considered for advancement within the company."
good,it was hard to get a CSM to come help you and your customer. Sometimes I had to keep the customer waiting 10+ minutes for someone to come and help us.
good,"I would go in, clean my station, check milk and food expirations, Greet customers at my station, and scan their items, help them bag their items, and tell them thank you for shopping at walmart, and have a great day. "
good,I had to interact with customers all day but it was a nice job with benefits. The hardest part of the job was the customers because some customers could be pretty nasty. The most enjoyable part was the pay.
good,Pending on what dept. you work in will determine how far you go.
good,Wal-Mart at one time offered a great deal to their employees but over time the benefits grew less and less.
good,llego a cerrar póliza de venta me gusta apoyar a mis compañeros una vez que termino de hacer mis labores durante el día hago retiros parciales a los cajeros y brindo atención a clientes lo que me gusta de mi trabajo es que hay trabajo en equipo
good,"I had worked for Walmart for almost 3 years as a cashier. My job duties included: greeting customers, ringing up their items and bagging them, saving them great deals, showing them with items in the the store was, keeping my area clean and presentable, and filling in at other departments for my co-workers."
good,A typical day at this company is very stressful and sometimes unorganized. 
good,"Meeting New People"
good,"A typical day work is cashing out the customers at the register, taking breaks, lunch breaks, and keeping my area clean. I learned that being a cashier can be very stressful at times when customers complaining that something is wrong. Management is awesome and wonderful. My co-workers are really nice to work with and does team work. The hardest part of the job is that there is really nothing hard because everything seems really simply to me. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and talking to customers who are happy about shopping in our store. "
good,"Profissionais, dinâmicos muita correria aprendemos a regra do por do sol . Ótimos colegas de trabalho,a parte mais difícil seria a liderança as vezes não sabem cobrar o associado,companheirismo."
good, 
good,"The job is fine, it's working 4pm to 1am that I don't really care for."
good,"A typical day at work involves servicing the customers, stocking merchandise and zoning. I have learnt a lot about the customers and their special needs. The management team is approachable and ready to solve customer problems. The hardest part of the job is resetting the modulars and preparing for inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job is stocking merchandise."
good,"A typical day at work for me is coming into work and grabbing my com with all the money in it, counting it to make sure it's $1,000 then I do cash audits, gather change requests for the cashiers, assist at customer service when needed, or I am line managing, saying hello to customers and leading them to the fastest and shortest lines. Another part of my job in picking up overstock and putting out new stock."
good,"Your Walmart  co-workers become like a second family to you. All  employees help each other out financially and emotionally with care as your blood family would."
good,"A typical work day would be 8 hour shift. Steady work pace and hard work because Wal-Mart Never has the amount of Cashiers needed to complete the task, so therefore, the cashiers have to work extra hard. Co-workers are good. Management is okay some are just not a people person. Some are also not fair. I do not enjoy anything about Wal-Mart besides I make a little more over minimum wage."
good,"empresa que incentiva o trabalho em equipe, gerência e supervisão presente e interativa."
good,"My days would start with department start up meeting,at the start up we were informed our work load to who was needed where most of the time I was sent out to other departments,in the beginning I did not like going to other departments then I learned the more areas I worked was a plus for me because I was learning new job function on top of what I aredy knew,I learned to share knowledge and jobs skills combined with common sense to co-workers to get the job done,the hardest part of my job was showing someone to do job and someone else come along a show the co-worker how the third party does things and some people can pick-up from the third and myself and and make a go of it while others get confused then I would have to retrain that co-worker day after day till they can do the job that was enjoyable,the enjoyable part of my job was that I was never bored,my manager and supervisers were flexable"
good,Typical day was order filling and shipping out goods. Fast paced. Timed on orders. 
good,"to me is just woking overnight in staying up"
good,"As a Cake decorater I was able to be creative in decorating cakes to put in the display case. i also had daily responsibilities such as stocking ,cleaning and closing."
good,Enjoyed the competition against myself of the checking people out quickly.
good,Wal-mart is a non- stop working enviroment. Always something to do. Great place to work
good,everyday you have something to do you will never be bored managment sucks but other than that its pretty chill.
good,I love working at walmart it is a postive and loving work place.
good,Flexible schedules. Working closely with management to maintain all departments. Learned to perfect my customer service.
good,Very nice coworkers and Management feels like a family
good,The Hilton offered good training and housekeeping skills that I may utilize for the future. It was like having a big family while working with the other housekeepers.
good,Almost all co-workers and management were friendly and made working there easier.
good,wal martis an fun place to work.A typical day at involves quality customer service.there management well be expecting job performance daily to maintain quality assurance.
good,"Typical day at work was learning, and unloading trucks, stocking and paper work."
good,"Very busy work day stocking, working pallets onto shopfloor.goal was to get department ready and presentable. undertaking tasks and showing other assosiates ways to improve the department and health and saftey."
good,"great place for entry level folk. Low skill, low stress, low pay work."
good,This was a new store under construction when I started working there. It was very challenging as it was opened in sections and other sections were still under construction.
good,"Everybody is very nice and the assistant managers were always wanting me to learn something new because I was learning quickly. I was always complemented on how hard I worked. Management is great. I learned price management, how to stock shelves with the products in the warehouse and on the floor. I learned how to set new features and mods for products."
good,I would go in each day and find out which register i would be at all day then i would start ringing up customers items and assist them with any questions. I learned that everyone is different and some have the worst attitude but the managers were great at making it less stressful and trying to make the customer happy the best they could. It was hard working there though because i dont like to deal with customers when they are at there worst but it was nice working the people that i did and the management was great.
good,Great place to work as a Cashier. I meet and got to know many types of people. My co-workers were awesome and my manager was very understandable when I ask for time off. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping my co-workers on the sales floor after my shift was over at the register.
good,* como eu fiquei muito tempo na gerencia então eu não via meus colegas de trabalho da frente de loja então eu chegava e ia fala com todos la na frente depois eu voltava pra gerencia porque lá eu passava as minha 4 horas inteiras na quela sala.
good,"Cash handling, stocking and restocking material, safety regulations and guidelines. To me how to be the go getter in jobs for my first job. Management and co-workers were amazing good people until shifting occurred and parts and people started changing. Holidays were the hardest part. The money was the most enjoyable part of it all."
good,"flexible schedule. lack of support from management. low pay, very little room for advancement. Company hires outside the company rather than within"
good,I like working at walmart it was a great experience. Normally I would have my customers that just loved me come in and only get in my line just to conversate.I learned that all customers aren't going to be patient with the customers who cant make up their mind with their items.Management were pretty cool and helped out a lot. the coworkers were friendly and great to work with.
good,"Es una gran escuela para entender conceptos de planificación, de reposición, de logististica y de finanzas. Aprendí todos los movimientos necesarios en una empresa y los procesos minimos con los que se puede generar eficiencia dentro del retail"
good,"Management keeps you on your toes, and your coworkers are friendly, you'll never run out of things to do. I've learned how to better manage my customer service skills and it has also taught me how to be patient with customers. It's made me grow as a person and as a cashier, and I like the fact that they encourage you to move into other parts of the store to help you understand the company. The attendance policy is very strict and they tell you the day you start, it's not something they take lightly. being a cashier is one of the easiest things you will find within the company and you're role is just as important as anyone else's because you have the most customer interaction."
good,"A empresa walmart é enorme e muito reconhecida porém tem uma desvantagem remunera muito mal os funcionarios, os beneficios são bons: plano de saúde, vale transporta, refeição e premiação. A cultura tambem super importante mais precisando melhorar apenas na valorização dos funcionários."
good,"I started my day by checking my register for correct amount of money, and then started my job. I first learned customer service and how to use a cash register at Wal-Mart. Co-workers were nice people, often quiet and kept to themselves, but nice people once you talked to them. Hardest part of my job was taking back all of the returns or unwanted merchandise back to where they belong. Most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with some very interesting nice customers on a daily basis."
good,Very nice place to work discount card excellent we all got along really well there we worked as a team. What I like about it I got paid every week I got a good discount card it sure paid off when I have to get my eye exam and a baby bed
good,"I really appreciate the opportunity to be a part of the ""Wal-Mart"" family, but at times, feel like my college education can be better used to assisting others in a more therapeutic environment. I clean restrooms and feel morally satisfied, but believe my talents can be better ussed elsewhere. I have made some friends in the short time I have been employed and enjoy the oportunity to be relaxed and still perform my duties to the best of my ability. I like the overnight work schedule, but do not like the idea of limited opportunities for extra shifts, full time status, benefits, etc. I intend to continue working because of the somewhat relaxing nature being a Maintenance Worker provides."
good,I really enjoyed it for the first five or six years. Management slowly changed and you began to feel like you no longer mattered. There was great team spirit in the original Walmart Family.
good,my co-workers and I are the hardest working people at work we all get along we are a family.
good,"I was seasonal when I worked for Wal-Mart but while I was there it was very enjoyable. I didn't really get a chance to interact with management much. It was kind of "" you're trained now get out there ""."
good,"Great job security, i have been there for years and i appreciate having that type of security"
good,"Great atmosphere, great company to work for, with ability to move ahead in career."
good,"at this job i learned to take the job on more effectively, with my struggle with depression and all i managed to stay at the company about 6 months. It was a struggle for me to make it through the hard days of work with tons of stress and weight holding me down, but i managed to complete it and get through. I loved working with the co-workers all the employees were generous, kind, caring and helpful. Working in the dairy was amazing, my tasks where stocking, doing inventory, throwing out expired items and working in the freezer like doing claims, and pulling out what needs to be stoked. Cash i gained experience in copouning, doing price matching and all."
good,It is like a family enviroment within your own department. I enjoyed knowing my schedule three weeks in advance. I didnt enjoy however the managers. They were ok apart. But they were constanly going againest each other.
good,"A typical day at walmart would consist of helping the customers meet there needs while shopping, helping them find what they need,stocking and working freight. i learned how to multi-task, management is very nice in see to that the employees are treated right. my coworkers are fun to be round"
good,"Would love to work there again.Good all around working enviroment,tryed to get rehired dont know what went wrong ,something about credit when did you all start that my credit is fair ,I dont know what the problem is."
good,well i worked night and have a child it started to get exausting.
good,I have worked at two locations.
good,Walmart was a great job i got to work in all departments and help build the store it was a very fun journey.
good,I hated every minute of it. I loved working with people. I was a cashier. The management stunk. Treated horrible.
good,In Asda I learnt new skills everyday
good,A regular job you can have your ups and downs
good,My typical day at Wal Mart as a department manager was stressful because of the work load but the biggest part was the unorganized management team.
good,"If you need to start a new career or need to have a second job, then walmart would be your best bet. You do have room for advancement if you choose to stay with the company. It is the largest retailer in the world so you will always have work to do."
good,I work for Wal-Mart for three years. I took this job because it was the place that called me back after looking for a job for 1 year
good,Okay place to work. Other employees dont really get along and kind of do what they wish.
good,"Worked with wonderful people, always looked out for one another never had anything negative to say."
good,"You can move up really quick with Walmart, but you have to be able to brown noes like no other. The pay is compairable to most other retail stores, but it's nice to have the 401K and profit sharing."
good,Working at Walmart can be fun. Well the customers what makes my day fun/
good,"Great place I really like the environment. The customer service experience is really great, and all the people there are very welcoming."
good,The only thing i didnt like about walmart was soing the same things every day all day long. The managers were great dealing with me being pregnant and making accomadations to help me stay at work. Any problems that I had with anything they worked it out very quickly. Also they are very quick to give praise if you work hard. It is kind of difficult to move up but only because there are a lot of people working for the company that are just as qualified if not more qualified for the upper positions.
good,"I only worked there as a temp., but I was laid off before the date that was agreed upon when I began employment. I was given vague information as to why I was being laid off."
good,It can be easy and hard at times. We always work together as a team and get our job done correctly.
good,like overall concept of store but managers at that time didn't follow.
good,Being a cashier the customer service manager that we work with can be very rude to customers. Other managers above them just don’t do anything about it and just go along with it
good,Working as a department manager teaches a lot of skills to be organized and marketing.  Customer reaction and having a well stocked department is an every day chore.  Management help isn’t always there and the equipment needed is scarce and an every day struggle.
good,this company was a good company to work for but alot of the management got jealous or made if you wanted to better yourself it was alot of drama and i will never go back
good,Walmat is a good place to work. I do alot of some other tasks such as self check online pick up. I been trying to get to online pick up and haven't heard anything in while.
good,"I had fun with my Job here, serving people with a smile and making sure they are satisfied, which is the most important thing we have to make sure all the time"
good,There main focus was Making the customers happy. They were really flexible with me and worked around my schedule. Theres room for growth. If you are a hard worker you think they dont notice but the managers notice you. The pay is okay. They want you to do more but yet you get paid the same. You can get a raise but that depends on the time you work not so much how much work you put into it. Working with customers is hard. Have to be ready to face some difficult customers.  Some managers on the floor were rude oh  to customers. And when there was lack of communication they wouldn't go for help and wait until a customer steps in.
good,There is mostly good people but there is some bad people who was trying to get me fired so I ended up putting my 2 weeks in. But it was good to work there at first.
good,"It's a good job if you have the right store manager support,and the support of your support managers and your associates,I really enjoyed my job and working with the public"
good,Great place to work management has to get better but other than that it’s a good place nice people and family environment good benefits and good raises
good,"Cons"
good,"Scan items from ware house, after scanning go on the sales floor and placed items on shelf. Breaks are decent. Team members are kind. Customers treat you with respect."
good,Overall Walmart is a great place to work. They work with their associates when it comes to flxiblitiy. The pay is average but can be better. I enjoy what I do there.
good,"Walmart was a nice job. They paid well , and always made sure I knew what I was doing. Other employees were very nice . They do have a few problems that was hard to get around. They worked with my extracurricular activities a little ."
good,It started off as a great place and now it is just a very hostel environment. The happiness isnt there anymore. Manager nor the associates care anymore.
good,"Being a sale's associate was a lot more enjoyable than being a cashier. For the most part the cashier was a second-choice position due to the lack of an availability to hire on after a seasonal temp position in the Toy department. As a sale's associate you are constantly moving throughout your shift and being productive. As a cashier, things get slower as the night progresses and people stop coming in."
good,Walmart is quite remarkable place to work at I been working in the deli for 16 years I came out of Charlotte North Carolina get down here I guess about 2012 transferred to Vegas from Charlotte I enjoyed work Walmart it’s just that I need a little bit more extra moneyTo take care of Newer bills thank you.
good,It was amazing working there no problems everyone was helpful there working together to make the job easier and the manager was great I had no issues there just poor pay
good,Working in this company makes you a tough person. It gives you room for improvement. allows you to make decisions in a complicated situation whenever there are problems arising with the customer. Learn to respects other people especially the customers. learn to practice patience and tolerance.
good,"There is  room to move up. However, they expect you to be there no matter what and calling out because you are sick is terms for dismissal. If you are willing to sacrifice your home life and only focus on work then it is right for you."
good,It is a great company to work for but the concern shown by management for employees welfare should be improved. Not just concerned about the welfare of Walmart.
good,"Tiene ventajas y desventajas. Procuran darle seguimiento a la gente quien trabaja ahí los de RH, como considerar tu día de cumpleaños, etc. Algunos subgerentes, porque así les llaman, quienes no pasan de ser simples supervisores, son unos despotas. El salario de los mecánicos es una miseria, $6400 mensuales. Los supuestos beneficios que te ofrecen por trabajar ahí son mínimos, como 10% de descuento en sus tiendas afiliadas."
good,I wouldn't recommend this job for anyone wanting to work for more than a year unless striving for a management position. This job gets very tiring and stressful especially in the holiday seasons.
good,The hardest part of the job when I was employed was the flexibility of the work schedule and managing time as a single mother with kids I did enjoy the management and employees
good,Good people nice managers and great place to work just I was part time and they wanted me to work like a full employee without the benefits. Would’ve stayed longer just the expectation of working 9 hour shifts when I was part time was overwhelming.
good,"The pay is great, and they have great benefits. My store tends to be higher stress than most stores. There is a lack of communication in the management team."
good,Enjoyable work place however very demanding. Very good place of u don’t have a home life. Very easy to advance in the company however very competitive.
good,I think Walmart is a good job. I recommend working there. I just found a higher paying job that was day shift . I was working night shift and it wasn't working out at the time for my family .
good,The work is steady and people are fun to work with. Benefits are good as well. The pay sucks really bad. This company can afford to pay 2 or 3 dollars more an hour.
good,It was a good job and great pay just very disorganized and unprepared. If your under 19 you can not sell alcohol and almost every customer you have has alcohol so it gets really frustrating when your line looks like it’s never going to end because you can’t get a manager to finish the transaction. Also there pricing is never right so you always have customers getting angry because that was not the price they saw on the shelves it’ gets really hectic at times
good,"more notes than humanly possible to complete, forced to stay late. should not be taking breaks and lunches or you will fall behind on notes. home life poor."
good,I enjoyed working woth my co workers and got along with everyone. I reset shelves and stocked all departments.  I got along with all management. And i was always early to start work
good,They want u to do 20 hours of work in 8 hours. You have more then one boss. Telling what to do. And if it not done in the time they want it youll get in truble
good,"It started fairly well but as soon as my job label went from ""cashier"" to ""self check out host"" my hours were cut to unsustainable levels. I am looking to leave now."
good,"I work there as a cashier and night stocker, it was a job for me so I can't complain. Management was well and I had set hours to work, I don't have anything to say about Wal-Mart ."
good,"Everybody complains about Walmart but as for my experience it was the best I've had so far.. I thank them very much for the opportunity, experience I've gained, and the time I have had there.. thank you"
good,"Management was great, but it was hard to work around personal life and corporate rules. Especially with their occurrence rules. Great benefits and room for growth. If you plan on staying I suggest looking for that growth vs staying stagnant in your position."
good,I worked to provide for my family and pay my pills and still not enough to survive here in hawaii to expensive for starting 12.00 per hour 5 working days of maximum 7 hours a day at least 8 hours would be more better i have been with  the company for over 10th years maybe I deserve appreciated for all my hard work that do but i always remind myself never complaining about what ever happened to me just do my job one day at a time and kindness and happiness shares these happiness with other team members respect team members and customer too
good,It was great most of the time some of the customers were rude most were great with positive attitudes that made the day go by faster and paced thru the night
good,"Un excelente ambiente laboral, lideres al pendiente de sus empleados,  eventos muy agradables, subenirs por puntualidad y productividad. Reconocimiento a los empleados."
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Wal-Mart Pharmacy, my co-workers were like family.  I always tried putting myself in the customers shoes, and going above and beyond to help them or their loved ones.  The Pharmacy Manager(s) are very considerate to not only the customers  but also the technicians.  Within a Pharmacy there has to be team work, however you have to be able to acknowledge tasks that need to be done and address them.  The most difficult part of the job would be working with Insurance Company's refusing to pay for a Rx's and between the Insurance and Doctor trying to get the patients Rx processed per Insurance denials.  I started as a Cashier and worked up to be a Pharmacy Technician so I learned everything from the Cashier to counting and labeling prescriptions."
good,"*check out customers "
good,"A typical day starts either really early or really late and as a Manager you will work 12 plus hours a day, sometimes 7 days in a row. The culture is great and the benefits are great too. Working with all kinds of people has always been the most enjoyable part for me. I think the hardest part are the schedules/hours."
good,"Para mi fue un buen trabajo por q te desempeñas en varias areas te enseñan desde lo mas basico a lo mas.complicado yo obtuve muchos conocimientos desde recibir mercancia hasta el.acomodo de mercancía,atencion a clientes,desempeñe en el area de cajas ,en el area de perecedero estuve a cargo desde registro de la merma y entrada de mercancia y seguridad alimentaria lo malo que hay jefes que.piden quedarte mas.tiempo  cuando esta prohibido el.sueldo es poco para todo lo que se hace"
good,"Not too bad company but cut backs are severe. I love my job as accounting associate but eliminating the job to put an atm machine in replace of a person , I did not agree .Yes, change is good but it should be treated as a whole."
good,"A good store to work for however need to increase pay at evaluation time for a job well done.  They need to give more hours to those who need them."
good,Walmart Brasil foi uma empresa que motivava os associados a se engajar sempre para um bem maior.
good,I have been working at Walmart for three years and every year I learn something new. Walmart is an great opportunity because you always can invest in yourself and climb up the ladder of the company.
good,"I know I’ll always have a job which is great since I have bills to pay. Also since I’m in the bakery, I get paid a little more than a regular associate like a cashier but not as much as a manager. There’s always room to move up in profession as well. Just have to deal with the rude customers"
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was not only stressful, but fairly unorganized. There were always new complaints on products not being available as well as issues with other workers. My time there was spent rushing to finish work because we were under staffed. Knowing that it was more of a corporate decision on hiring new employees, we made the best of the situation we were put in and most workers were very hard workers."
good,"Ultimately my termination was my fault. I didn’t have the occurrence policy down like I thought, and it backfired on me. My particular manager was understanding and great, and the department I worked in was very fast paced and quickly getting more traction."
good,"I enjoy working hard and my team does that, its fast pace, easy to learn. If it weren't for management it would be a great place to work. We are left to do it with little to no supervision which is great because there is no micromanaging and we get our job done. Only downside is there is little to no supervision as well to the other teams/shifts and the job isn't getting dome."
good,"basically getting paid to work out , "
good,"Very laid back and super friendly staff. Really enjoyed the quiet environment, the only reason I left was because after a bit my muscles couldn't support a 40 hour work week."
good,I only gave Walmart a a low review because of the management. The job it self wasn't hard but the management was never pleased. Even if everything was perfect they keep trying to find away that it wasn't.
good,"Overall Walmart is Walmart a store. When you need something weather it be food , water, clothes, etc Walmart has been there to support everyone family's and hobbies."
good,"it's a good workplace, the people there are nice it's just managers.i get along with every day. i work hard, everyday. i enjoy the energy i'm allowed to convey everyday."
good,Walmart overnight was cool back then but now so many things have changed! I enjoyed working there and i hated leaving because i got so close to my coworkers!
good,You're processing so many prescriptions that you don't have time to really help the customers. Also some of the rules were ridiculous. The coworkers are really great though.
good,Working there was okay but it’s a lot of work and  moving  but if your use to that then you’ll do fine. If not it’s not the job for you. More people you talk to there the more you get
good,"I worked in unloading trucks, stacking boxes on jack pallets, helping customers, and the benefits were better then toyrus and I was a part-time. They were flexible with schedule."
good,"Long days on your feet for low pay, but they do offer great benefits after a year of employment. If you love to meet new people, this is the place for you. There is always lots of interesting people to meet on a daily basis."
good,Walmart was a fun and diverse place to work . Help me learn and grow in many areas of mangment.  It’s help build a strong foundation and family area too.
good,"Es una empresa con buenos beneficios laborales "
good,"The associates I worked with were worth showing up to work everyday. I enjoyed their company and the made work fun, even when we had to work long hour days."
good,"When I worked there it was a good quality family store! I would love to go clock in a work, everyone there was like family there to work with so that made it better and easy when you know you had people there to care and look out for you, sad to say its not like that anymore."
good,"la empresa es buena pero el salario muy bajo,  ..."
good,I don't have anything to say other than I've had many positions.  All were challenging.  I have nevet been demoted for not doing a good and productive job.
good,"is a great workplace to work, And you have to invest time inorder to learn new skills about your job. The work place have great customers and you have to be willing to serve them.Not so much room for advancement.In my position fitness is very important in this position of sales floor customer experience/ Cashier. You also have to be a very happy person to excel for you dealings with customers day in day out.Personally l enjoy my job here as of the difficulty of the job it's sales,can you sell if not ,Thats the difficult because if you deal with customers it could be answering simple questions  and then seal the sale and this encompasses  knowledge of product  , location and store policy on every dealing level.Execution is very important how well you know your brands, can you process a register and seal with a smile simple things we take for granted. There is a lot more to be learned beside what l have written about."
good,It was nice to see regular customers faces. Also you always get to see new food and get ideas on what you may want to put on your shopping list. It's better to always keep a smile on your face and a positive attitude even when customers are rude.
good,"Muito boa essa empresa, pude adquirir muitas experiência."
good,El trabajo fue bueno. Los compañeros y los jefes son muy amables.
good,"I honestly don't remember too much from working there. It was something to make money until I could start school."
good,I am supposed to be a full time associate.  But I am scheduled with less than 30 hours per week.  With that I cannot keep my bills paid.  Even with 33 hours a week I cannot take care of my bills.  Full time should be 40 or more hours a week.  How can anyone survive with less than 40 hours a week at Walmart?
good,Getting Start To Work Around People. Not To Work Fast But Keep Up The Pace. Good Management. Great Store For A Start. Get Start Wax Floor. Last Sweep.
good,"I loved it, up until they quit being understanding with their employees. I myself was going through an abusive relationship and missed some days that I shouldn't have, but on the outside of that I was an extremely hard worker."
good,One of the most simple jobs around nothing new. Get used to standing in one place for long periods of time. you can take bathroom breaks but you need to have cover if you go.
good,"nobody wants to help people when a task is to difficult. I learned that nobody takes the job serious, like for example, people cheat their hours by relaxing in the break room for long periods of time and come to work when they fell like it and have their employees clock in for them whenever they are gonna be late"
good,"Working as a cashier at Walmart, my daily task was to cash customers out, bag their items and be able to get them out of the store in a timely and respectable manner.  As a cashier I learned to memorize all the codes for all the produce items, and find methods in which that would make my job more efficient to our everyday customers. I also learned to utilize my customer service skills when dealing with a customer, and try my best to assist them if i can, If I am unable to assist them I would locate them to someone who might be able to."
good,I feel that if Walmart had better managers that they would have more cashiers and that people wouldn’t leave within a week or 2 and that the managers need a better attitude
good,Clock in analyze the freight gather up working materials access damaged products separate items according to area work the freight go on 15 min break lunch then another 15 min after that home..
good,Overall stressful work environment. The company is more focused about money than the associates. Benefits are good. Some long-term workers need to retire.
good,Everyone at walmart is very nice and always willing to help each other. I did enjoy the fact that we get an hour for our lunch break even thougb it wasnt always needed.
good,My career with Wal-mart was 15 years. Started as a Service desk associate. From there I moved up the ranks to Assistant Manger.  When there were health issues they worked with me to a  position that I worked for 8 years. It was still a supervisor position and I trained the new assistants for the store.
good,Great learning experience Opportunities to move up flexible hours and works with your schedule gets a chance to meet wonderful coworkers and customers
good,Walmarts training is rigorous and can prepare you for any other job. One can move up quickly but the level of care the management shows their employees needs to be worked on. Hard work and you can be fired at anytime no matter how long youve done well for the company.
good,"Walmart is for hardworking people so if you see your self unable to perform tasks please stay away from it"
good,well walmart is walmart. I cant really say much about it anymore its been a while since i worked there so not sure on how they have changed. when i was employed it was a good experience as a job.
good,Walmart is a great place to work. Certain managers are terrible but most are awesome. I do recommend working for them if you are full time. Walmart treats part time terribly and gives us horrible hours no matter how much we ask.
good,"buena, un poco estresante dependiendo el tipo de ventas en el dia"
good,"They cut hours like no tomorrow. Not a trustworthy job for money. One time, they changed my schedule the day before I was going into work, and they said ""they didnt cut any hours"". although my hours went down by 20."
good,I enjoyed to work there and the workers support each other. I learned to be along with people even they're rude. I love to work by myself or with a teamwork. The hardest part of the job is not to use my phone.
good,working in a very fast paced environment. production is recorded and accounted for while safety and quality enforced everyday. perform safety meetings everyday and throughout the day. operate forklift to complete most of the daily functions
good,The hours were good and I enjoyed meeting new people and becoming friends and also being able to help the customer in any way I could. I was able to help the customer get in and out the store fast I always got compliments about being so fast and my line being the shortest the customers really enjoyed coming in my line to get checked out.
good,"Es una empresa muy buena en general para trabajar, aunque nos han tocado muchos cambios de jefes por ser un local de paso, pero en general tiene muy buenos beneficios."
good,They treat their employees like dirt and treat their employees so bad it’s rediculus  they will stop giving u  hours and they will cut yours hours n the mangers treat u like dirt
good,The point system works well for this company but this store I worked at management seems to pick favorites and that's cut and dry however I would recommend  working at a Wal-Mart very good pay very good chance of becoming management and more
good,"Genuinely enjoyed working for Wal-Mart until I transferred. Store Manager at the Kyle,Tx store was unbearable. He was rude to everyone. Wouldn't even make eye contact with you when spoken to. Constantly on the walkie scolding all managers. Never pleasant to be around."
good,I think  manager could have been more concerned  bout employees and had more staff to fit customers  needs.i enjoyed  my job I got to  meet alot of interesting  people. Team players  are a must in a company  for it to suceed
good,"Going to work was always a pleasure, co-workers were always willing to help, and make my day better. I learned new cake decorating skills and also how to use ordering devices and how to do inventory."
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you have other things to do within the day and you still need a little cash. They do not pay as well as B Braun but it was a decent job. Any one can handle it. They have a variety of positons also. So if you are not a talkative person you can be in the loading area.
good,If you just want a job then Walmart is your choice. The pay is not good but everything else is. You have to start off as part time for 6 months before moving onto a full time job.
good,walmart is a great store. i think for what the employees do their under paided. its sad when people get hurt they try each way to not take blame. even with proof. i love there products. staff is friendly.
good,"A mess sometimes, managers never communicate with each other causing problems between associates and managers. Salesfloor manager is very stubborn and cant be reasoned with"
good,A fast paced work environment with career advancement potential. If you like being on the phone and resolving conflict you might consider this oppertunity
good,"A typical night for me would be getting there at 9:30 pm and starting around 10 pm. Then we would all go to our assigned departments and start stocking. At 12 am we got a 30 min break, at 2 am we got an hour lunch break, and at 4 we got another 30 min break and we got off at 7 or if u were no done with your freight then you finish before you left."
good,As a cashier you stand on your feet the entire shift.  It is a fast pace service industry with very diverse customers.  The products are good and most of the time the items are properly coded so it can be scanned easily and quickly.  The management is helpful.
good,"The best thing about walmart is the managment leadership, and the bonus pool that is offered on a quarterly basis. I worked for a couple of different stores, and the management; all of them are 5 star in the leadership department, which I have not found anywhere else."
good,Not one of the best Walmarts in the area. Management was poor but the pay and the benefits were excellent.Most people were nice to work with and the hours were good.
good,"Walmart is also a great place to work.  It's the associates and the management team that kept me there for so long.  It was hard work, both mentally dealing with the public & keeping the place looking nice.  Although retail wasn't what I wanted to do with my life, it was helpful to my family."
good,"Many task to complete before 1st shift comes in. From counting money to stocking shelves and rounding up carts for the new day. Everything must be neat,cleaned and stocked."
good,I liked working their however their was a CSM there that didnt treat me fairly. She was rude to me in front of customers. And she somehow kept getting away with it. Eventually i got tired of it and thinking about it made me dread work everyday so i ended up qutting.
good,"This job is great for beginners, offering extensive training and a walkthrough of your day to day work. The breaks are well timed and the general coworkers you spend your day with are helpful and courteous."
good,It wasn't a horrible place to work but it wasn't great either. It was honestly really bad at communication there it was like no one knew anything and no one ever talked to each other about work stuff.
good,"Walmart had great benefit, only thing I couldn't do was balancing my work life with college life. It was either work or college. I left Walmart because my degree was important."
good,I learned how to deal with difficult customers. I became very fluent in scanning and memorizing items. It was always important to treat our customers with respect and always put a smile no matter what the circumstance.
good,"Walmart is a great job for anyone who is in need if a job. There is always something to do at this work place. Its a great start to get your feet wet, Or stay there & Start a career of your own."
good,"i like the job because its pays good and its cool to work there, but sometimes stressful because of the people, but overall its a good place to work at."
good,"Its enjoyable but i just needed more money, my paid was not enough for living. But everything else was good. And also i didnt like the baggy rally :) ."
good,"Hard-working people, Caring staff, Flexible hours. Great Pay, Takes too long for benefits, but great benefits, you recieve after 3 months of working there"
good,"most management is okay i leaned customer service skills and cashiering for the first time, hardest part of the job is on stocking being on a time limit"
good,"the customers was great. helped pharmacist dispense prescription medication. patient was sick so i had to compassion and empathy.answering all incoming phones, and interacting with patients daily."
good,Fast and friendly place to work at and a place to practice your customer service skills and experience new things challenges that we sometimes don't know we are capable of...
good,"Large store, fast paced, good benefits."
good,Must have good Customer service  skills have to now how to do exchange and refunds work with money on a register read upc numbers  help  located merchandise on the floor
good,"They really align the company management so much. I was employed for less than a year and had 2 positions eliminated.. Granted they found a new position for me and didn't take my pay away, but has changed my hours so much that now I have lost time with my children..."
good,La compañía tiene muy buena capacitación y te entrega herramientas para que puedas surgir dentro de ella.
good,"8  hours alot about retailgood   fair none coworkersd. But they was easy to work with them, I had a good team workers! If they need me to come in when someone call in i be there, never late"
good,I liked it because of the pace. Never had my boss down my back i had the ability to do my job and go home keep focus on your job and no one else's be your self to a degree it is a business after all but all types are welcome.
good,i am deaf yes ? i like anything stocker or maintenance cleaning lot yes ? thank you ok . i try back work or not back my friend some time or miss yes . i not worry work ok . i like work wallmart yes .
good,"nice job if you are young, single with no debt and willing to show some effort. new starting pay is $11. that is enough for a high schooler or college student looking for work experience"
good,"Always busy and very customer oriented. Poor management. Great pay and benefits. Lots of rules and regulations. Constantly changing procedures."
good,fast based retail enviorement with little proper training unless you look for it advancement based on tests or assesments that do not take your actual abilities into account
good,I started her as a cashier and aggressively progress. Mastering almost everything I resigned as a department a manager. Walmart is a great place to learn different experiences.
good,"Fast paced company, the pay is getting better. Vacation time is good. Associate need to be trained better. The company should invest more money into equipment for associates."
good,"Walmart honestly was a decent place to work,its was a comfort to the job . The people in general made the nights go by, it really didn't feel like work most times."
good,"A typical workday consist on coming in and going straight to your assigned register; after 2 hours you will get your first 15 minute break, and then return to another register for the next 2 hours. Then you will get your 1 hour lunch and return to finish the day just as started. The days are long during the week but the work is somewhat easy. Communication skills are necessary, and memorizing fruit/vegetables codes is a must to guarantee quick checkout."
good,"Typical workday could be fast or slow depending on what day of the week it was. Hardest part was dealing with customers who could be difficult at times, which was something i did not have a problem handling."
good,"A typical day at Walmart consist of coming in at 2pm,and getting the truck unloaded, after the truck is unloaded we have to take that product and put it on the shelves, at 9pm until 11pm we pull out pallets of unworked product"
good,"they cut my hours so i had to leave,i could pay my bill with less hours,beside that,its a company to work for,and the people are nice too............."
good,"The typical day at Walmart started with clocking in cleaning my register, zoning the candy and toys helping the customers however I possibly could.I learned exceptionally good customer service skills and was in training to be a customer service manager. Management could use a little work and give more appreciation to their employees. The hardest part of the job was standing up all day, and the most enjoyable was helping customers to make their day easier better and leave them with a smile."
good,"In the vision department, there is always something to do to stay busy, like cleaning the frames on the frame board, sweeping, dusting, and making sure everything is in order. It is a professional atmosphere and also very relaxed. It's completely different than the rest of the store as we deal with HIPPA information everyday."
good,It's pretty decent clean and workable environment. Good pay. Not bad at all also management was ok but got things done what i was told to do . Got along with workers and customers especially.
good,its a job the people you work with is what makes it ok plus the jobs not to hard it beats most places to work plus they pay good for around her in paintsville kentucky
good,I Worked with a great team.Most team members gave all their hard work in everyday. I learned a lot about customers and our products. I learned how items are stocked properly and stored.How to change prices and determine the proper signage. Friendly atmosphere to work in.Most enjoyable part of my job was having a great hardworking team that helped each other to get the work done and meet daily standards.
good,There would be isles for you to work on to put the grocery up and whatever that didnt go up .that would have to go to the back and be bend with labels
good,"This job involved alot of walking around and requires some special skills to perform it properly. You also need to be proficient on the computer since you'll be using it as part of job requirements. The hardest part is trying to meet the quota of catching shoplifters. Most of the time there isn't enough going on to meet the proper demands of the store. Also, if you don't catch onto the skills required for it quick its miserable going into work each day hoping you can perform your job properly."
good,"Good place to work, managers where helpful. The most enjoyable part of working at Wal-Mart was the employee interactions. Learned alot about my job through training."
good,"Chez Walmart le salaire devient intéressant puisqu'il y a des heures à fournir. Le staff est relié par un point commun: si tu es jeune et étudiant, tu parle en mal de walmart. Si tu es plus âgé , tu es heureux de travailler avec ton équipe."
good,"Coming to work and talking with my associates and taking care of their needs to make sure they had what they need to take care of their areas they managed.    Meeting with the management team of the store to provide the needs of the day.  Walking and meeting the customers as they enter the store, making sure to have what they need when shopping.  Taking care of needs of the customers and their concerns.  Taking care of my associates.  The hardest part of the job is when you lose an associate due to death."
good,"Most days are the same. The hours are 12pm to 11 pm, at least at my store. The benefits are decent; medical, dental, 401k, stock options, and 10% dicount on most items in the store."
good,nice place to work good hours and good money. The people at the job are pretty nice. some are pretty helpful. only down fall of the job is that time goes by slowly doing the same thing daily
good,En éste trabajo se me dió la oportunidad de ganar el buen sueldo que tuve gracias a Dios y aprender a trabajar a cargo de los guardias y aprendí a ser muy responsable con cada desición y ser profesional en mi desempeño.
good,"Its a fast pace job. Some days are faster pace then others, but there is an issue with the managers writing you up for very stupid stuff.Its an okay job."
good,The guys out there definitely work hard. I made sure I went above and beyond to help them like they helped me. I loved working there and I loved my regular customers.
good,I worked many roles as an employee for Walmart ranging from cashier to pharmacist assistant to department manager. My fellow employees were very nice but not overly willing to go above and beyond the role they were in so I took it upon myself to do so. When assistance was required in any position I was the first to volunteer. As such I was taught almost every position in the store and moved my way up to department manager of infants and then ladies fashion. Although I struggled to learn everything on my own as my management team was very lacking it made me more resourceful and confident in my position. I enjoyed every position I worked in and everyone I worked with.
good,The environment  is enjoyable  but the lack of staff is horrible. Hours could have been offered for overtime. I will say the benefits are awesome.  Overall fun place.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work, its easy to understand. The managers on the other hand are absolutely horrible. They dont listen to anything, completely rude and dont even follow the rules."
good,I loved working for this company. It is had work however you are aid for the hard work you ate doing and it is well appreciated by the company and the show it very often.
good,"The Managers are power hungry and dosent know what they are doing and tend to over work some of the workers. the employees are nice and its a very friendly enviroment,"
good,Algunos gerenciales deberia tener mejor tacto con lo asociados
good,"Received extensive Business Analyst training."
good,I like working at Walmart. I was very pleased with being there to. My job was to make all costumers happy and get them in and out as fast as possible. I had to greet customers and stock the store
good,"I personally believe it needs more organization, better communication and fairness to the associates. If those things are fixed in the store the store would be more great than it already is."
good,"it is a good place to work, but you never know what kind of management you have!"
good,"If my manager didn't leave I would probably still be working there. You know what they say, a company is only as good as those who lead it. Other then that its an alright company but needs to be ran by the right manager."
good,I learned i could move faster then i thought. I learned that you can got to work and have a lil fun it was great but i was going thur a love of family issue at the time and i went over my points
good,Would go.back part-time  fast past hard work unloading trucks but slower after unloading trucks overall it was a good job and a great teamwork skills involved environment
good,"Being an Associate for Walmart for almost a year now, I do enjoy being at Walmart. Although I enjoy working at Walmart, management isn't so great. I do recommend that you look into the different locations."
good,"While at wal-mart I worked in various roles with the company from cart pusher, cashier and logistics. The hardest part of this job was the uncertainty of where you be assigned from day to day. The most enjoyable part was  interacting a lot different people."
good,"Un día típico de trabajo en walmart siempre fue bajo mucha presión ya que tenias unidades en camino hacia algún estado con bastante dinero en mercancía a bordo y tenias que resolver administrativas."
good,"Learned fast . It's easy .. stay positive and come on time .. always remember safety at all time , never bring drinks on the floor and to dress comferty"
good,it is a good job just have mass up management but good pay friendly co.worker but for most part i enjoy working there if i can go back i will i learned a lot
good,The Managers don't have respect for customers or employees. I would not go back because they talk to you any way they want to.I would say this this pay is ok
good,"Not really much to tell, alot has changed over the years. I worked 3rd shift for the Wal-Mart in the Steelyard. They let me go for lost paperwork and terrible communication."
good,"Clock in, Meeting on what to do for the shift, get what your suppose to get done, Lunch, back to work to finish tasks at hand, clock out and go home. Have a couple of smoke breaks."
good,"Need to pay management better pay for thier job."
good,"A typical day at walmart continus busy work. If looking for something fast paced and meeting new people everyday, walmart is the place for you. Nice place"
good,Overall I thought it was a great place to work. Everyone is very nice  and the management was very good. I enjoyed working as a team there. I think there could be better pay though.
good,"work area is safe , was glad to go to work ,a place with EQUAL opportunity of bieng in a higher rank and positions training is the the best of i had before"
good,My experience at Wal-Mart was frustrating often being the only employee assigned to my department on the night shift.As all departments during that shift were understaffed.I do however owe credit to the management staff that were understanding to the situation and to my great co-workers who helped to make the experience a more pleasant memory than it could have been.
good,Ambiente laboral grato . Cumple con medidas de seguridad apropiadas para trabajar de manera tranquila. Oportunidades de desarrollo como colaborador. Cursos de capacitación . Reuniones diarias sobre el trabajo a realizar . Trato directo con la Jefaturas . Buena acogida para proponer ideas . Respeto por las personas .
good,"Sales associates duties depend by department. Duties can be fixing the department you working on, stocking merchandise, helping other departments, as a cashier or getting into the parking lot to get the shopping cars."
good,Overall it wasn't that bad to work at walmart . Managers had my scheddule so messed up. plus didn't fix for so I had no choice but to put my 2 week notice in. I'm sure there is more like my experince out there.
good,"Relaxed environment, must be able to be flexible in work ethic, paid time off, vacation and sick day pay, great lunch and break times, 401k plan great balance for work and life"
good,It was a nice place working  but we got the job done on time I like the hours I use to work in the employees was very respectful but the customer  was very rude in loud
good,"You weren't really rushed to finish a task as long as the quality was perfect. The coworkers were always ready to answer any questions you might have had, and the managers were more than happy to take care of any issues you had. While working, the environment was a bit cramped in my section but everyone worked really well together to make sure we were able to move around as freely as possible. Since I was overnight, not many customers came in but when they did it was really enjoyable to help them. The hardest part of working there was when a shampoo bottle or soap bottle was broken and you needed to take it to the backroom along with anything that got the soap on them and clean it all. I really enjoyed working with those around me and everyone was really helpful and fun to be around."
good,"This job can be very do-able how ever it can at times be stressful. The people who i work with make the job easier,  more fun, and less stressful. It all depends on the people who are around you."
good,"Otima ,maravilhosa e um lugar bom pra seguir a vida de um otimo  trabalhador ."
good,Enjoy the environment of the work place. Very clean store and customer service is right on for the customer. Friendly associates that are more than willing to help
good,Working for Walmart help me gained a lot of experience and knowledge. I like that we were quizzed every month to keep us on top of tasks Also it helped me open up to other dealing with customers and helping them out. I felt the amount of work I done was underpaid but overall a good company
good,Aside from having to work weekends and holidays I had a pretty good experience there.  It was very challenging and I always had plenty to keep myself busy.
good,Pretty good first job met some interesting people. work hard and loved it nights where a bit long though. I would change it for the world met on of  my best friends there.
good,"Management at Walmart is amazing depending on what one you go to. I loved my job there wish I could have stayed but sadly could not. Walmart is a very strong and productive place to work, Yes they can be tough on you but that is only because they want you to succeed in the company, there is always room to move up and grow with Walmart."
good,"Great place to work for, good bonuses and good benefits. Competitive at with other surrounding companies. Also enjoy working with all the great associates I have."
good,As an unloader it can be stressful at times because some days there multiple trucks which means a lot to unload and a lot to move to the sales floors and at this time people are pretty stressed out and grouchy. I wouldn't recommend it to some that can't handle stress or pressure. Other than that it is a very good job.
good,this job was a good job to have. Honestly don't know why I even left. the management was cool and the co-workers were awesome. I would go in and stock food and go home. It went by quickly every time.
good,I love the pay and the fact I was able to work lots of hrs. I love the benefits. I love the atmosphere. I do not like that some of the managers did not have understanding when it came to my children. I always was scheduled for holidays like I didn't have children.
good,"Strict environment that focuses on productivity, quality, and safety. Hardest part of the job is all the rules that you have to follow. The benefit of the job is the pay and work schedule."
good,"Se a empresa investisse mais no funcionário, motivando o com gratificações e promoções de cargo, melhoria no salário, acredito que melhoria a produtividade e desempenho desse funcionário."
good,"The environment was decent, though a bit too much drama for me wish to return there. As a whole Tue company us pretty good to work for aside from the No Acception of Doctor's Note policy...thanks to that I was let go..."
good,"I love the system of Walmart.I love how it works. Honestly, i really do love the idea of this place, but they need to work on a few things. The Managers are the main thing I'm talking about. I understand it can be hard to control all the associates in a big place, but at least keep control of the people who are supposed to be managers! They treated me like complete garbage! I am usually a fairly humble guy, but I feel like I was controlling one and a half departments on my own and all they ever focused on was other people's mistakes and blamed it on me. I was not a manager by the way, but I still got in trouble for their mistakes! They would never get on to them, just me. (sorry for the rant) Other than that, I love that job. I learned to keep my cool in stressful situations. Sometimes we have pick up where other people slack. Hardest part of the job was trying to control people knowing i have no power over them whatsoever. The most enjoyable was they system the Walmart works on as long as they use it right."
good,"I was over receiving,backroom and also whole grocery side. I would receive invoices. Make a plan of action for my team members and follow through with them, Stock grocery,order,work modular and deal with any vendors or issues with grocery or backroom. It was great because my day flew bye. It was kind of crazy able for others some days for all I had to accomplish by end of my shift."
good,buen ambiente laboral para aprender a trabajar rápida y limpiamente con horarios flexibles pero con un bajo salario
good,This job paid well and also gave bonuses. Cant forget about Paid Time Off. I also valued the low prices and discounts that we received when purchasing items.
good,Working here was ok. They changed management which was great for the employees. The work place culture was very stressful. We were not allowed to say hi while working. The hardest part is that I am a social butterfly and I was not allowed to talk to anyone. The easiest part was that I was a really great employee and got all my work done quickly
good,Not bad working here except busy days can get a bit overwhelming but it's a good just that works with your availability . Only thing I dislike is the lack of workers for closing
good,The only thing bad there was the management which was horrible. Other than that i had no problem working for wal-mart. The customer service there wasnt the  est because of the people they had over there.
good,It is a fast paced environment they are all about time management. They will work with you not against you. Sometimes they just can't help out due to guidelines.

good,If you don't have a car don't apply for the job cause with out guarantee transportation you will lose your job. Show up on time clean and ready to work. Leave outside situations at home don't bring your problems to work.
good,They never give you a chance whatever the manger say thats what they go with. They never want to hear what you have to say. The hardest part of the job is to try to satistfy and angry customer. The most enjoying part is when you know you don your job and well
good,"I did not enjoy how the manger of the store ran things, very rude and never gave back positive feed back. The shift supervisor always keep us busy and made things enjoyable."
good,Walmart was a good place to work at. I heard other workers had little problems here and there with customers being always right. In my department we where always in the elements the only time we did not work hard was thunderstorms and holidays.
good,"Walmart is a nice place to shop, but as fourth as in wat goes on behind close doors. You wouldnt believe some things that happen which is crazy. You have your good managers an you will always have your bad. I enjoyed the experience, but I choose not to work there ever again."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart and was sad to go due to serious medical reasons at the time. I loved working with all my employees. They were wonderful people and i enjoyed helping customers and interacting with them.
good,The position is ok but management over my area makes it hard to balance life outside the workplace at times. It can be stressful if management is not for you.
good,"Working at Walmart was a breeze. The required tasks and goals were easily attainable. The chances to move up in the company were actually very likely, so long as you showed initiative and reliability. I would recommend Walmart to anyone looking for a retail position. Just know that it is a very fast paced environment that requires a lot of dedication."

good,"The management was was cool, could have been better it is a fun working with different types of race and co-wokers. The pay could be better and hours could be better."
good,this company isn't one of the best companies to work for. as long as you learn fast and can learn and perform in multiple departments you'll be fine. but over all its a very easy job.
good,"As a cashier I was too ring out customers merchandise, make sure they did not have any problems with their visit at out store. As a service writer I was too check vehicles in for oil changes and or tire work as well."
good,i had a good time worker there every one was very friendly and they made come to work worth the while i will be going back in the near furture
good,Good starting pay with a promise of a fifty cent raise after completing six months worth of online training. Online training is thorough and easy to understand
good,On your basic day at work would be coming in and staying busy until your shift is over. Team work is essential to get through the day. there needs to be communication at all times.
good,I did not enjoy working at walmart. The coworker was very rude and also the manager. The pay was good. Lunch was good a hour lunch and two 15 minute break. We use to have great parties.
good,I was a floor associate for diary department. used to stay for a long period of time in the cooler stocking the store merchandise such as milk and creamers for the customers.
good,Its a place that you can definitely learn different skills but its not a place where you go to make friends just go to work and do your job
good,The managers are great I like how Walmart funds the community and their employees. They have an excellent training system.and they help all of their employees to make their company and their associate strive to make their experience and the customers experience a better place to shop.
good,Walmart is a place I'll never work for again it was all about them they didn't care about their employees. They didn't give raises when needed. Managers didn't do their job they didn't know how to talk to the employees.
good,The best part of my job was knowing that when I went in I was helping sick people get better by having the RX ready. I like learning about new drugs and their side affects. The hardest part of my job was seeing customers walk away without their medicine because they didn't have insurance and it was too expensive for them to pay for.
good,The co workers were fun and nice. The environment was welcoming. I learned more about customer service procedures as well as handling large amounts of money. The hardest part of the job was trying to calm down a very angry customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co workers.
good,"Management is great if you keep your nose clean, do your job with a happy attitude, and avoid talking to most salaried members of management on a regular basis."
good,"The job itself was amazing. The people at my store were great and I had a lot of fun working here. Butting heads with a few people above me was a bit difficult but other than that, not a bad place to work. The pay is great and the hours are nice for a steady income depending on what you do."
good,"long days , learned patience, my manager was ok, but my supervisor was amazing. Loved my coworkers, made a few lasting friendships. Hardest part of job was when it got so busy and we were short cashiers. Lineups were long and customers had little patience. Most enjoyable part was the few fellow cashiers that we could joke around with and loved talking to and getting to know."
good,"I enjoyed working at walmart.  I had alot of customers who sought me out to come thru my line as I love to help people.   I liked the busy day.  I would do regular cashier, wic transactions, and credit card applications. I made many friends with employees there.  The hardest part of the job was putting up with cranky customers which every company gets. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping my customers"
good,"Siempre muy energico desde mi llegada hasta mi salida, aprendi a siempre trabajar con sentido de urgencia, me capacite al 100% rapido y siempre haciendo un buen trabajo hasta formar parte del equipo gerencial. Hice buenos compañeros y despues amigos e intercambiamos aportes e ideas para el mismo negocio, la parte mas dificil del trabajo fue, que en algunas ocasiones no se contaba con el capital humano y/o herramientas necesarias para concluir las actividades diaras. Y lo que mas me gusto del trabajo fue: que adquiri michisimos conocimientos y habilidades sobre el manejo del negocio y se que esto me abrira mas puertas."
good,Productive and fun workplace. Worked 8 hours a day five days a week. The employees are caring and helpful. I worked at Walmart for 7 years. The management team changes consistently and needs more teamwork.
good,"good place to work, benefits after 6 weeks. responsibilities include: record manage stock of cleaning chems, maintain equipment,delegate maintenance team, clean floors. The best part about the job is the co-workers, because at night people just let loose. At this job we were like a big family, i would do my job along with do anything that my coworker needed of me."
good,"As an inventory management associate, the backroom crew unloaded the truck onto the proper pallets. After a pallet was done, we wrapped them with shrink wrap and rolled them out to their correct departments so other sales associated can stock the items, I learned that regardless of gender, anyone can unload a truck, as long as you keep a good attitude and work out!"
good,"It was a busy job but fun and the customers were fun at times, they have good managemnt it was a friendly store i met alot of good people"
good,"Breaks are too short! I am one of the top order fillers there, and was passed up for a promotion, because I was told I didn't have enough administration experience!"
good,Great environment and great people and place to work at.hard workers and always smiled.loved unloading the trucks and putting the stock to the floor
good,Many good people to work with. Good environment. Safety is a top concern. Good training programs. Learned how to deal with people in different situations.Many good managers.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was like experiencing a new day at life. You never knew the type of people that would just might come down to your register. Just like making their experience easy-going there, they sometimes had an interest about making your day at work a little better. It was almost, always easy to keep in contact with management and a positive relationship with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was getting a register that don't work in certain areas, sometimes, until things get upgraded. The most enjoyable part of my day is making my customers feel important!"
good,"busy"
good,"Typical day was serving customers to their satisfaction."
good,Usually did closing and nights. Mostly organized the floor in clothing. Did merchandising and frate. Sometimes grocery isles. Then we would answer phone calls as well for our department.Nothing to hard.
good,"I was sixteen when I worked at Wal-Mart. It was a good first job. I was treated like dirt by most of my customers and was told quite often how I'm wasting my life by working there, at sixteen! I personally had a bad experience working here, but that's not to say that someone else might not love it there!"
good,"All the people i knew from walmart were all nice to me besides the managers. I worked there for 8 months and i never had gotten one word of appreciation from them. I asked them to transfer depts. for 8 months and they never did, they only care for themselves."
good,"Walmart is a Wonderful Place to Work given you have Good,Honest,Management who actually do their Jobs..I was a Front End Cashier and I loved it apart from doing working with people who are onlyt there for a paycheck.. The Most enjoyable part of My Job was My Customers"
good,would gladly work at a local Walmart again. meet lots of new people see a lot of new faces you really get to know the community with time you even have regulars. worked the express tills so when you noticed they always appear at your till it's a little intimidating ha-ha
good,It was very calm cool place to work at.  Sometimes it was kind of annoying because a lot of the employees talked about each other.
good,The pay and benefeits were excellent but managment and the way things are run is terrible. Production is so high it's hardly attainable and the mangers don't know whether they're coming or going half the time.
good,"bom o que tenho a dizer que aprendi  muitas coisas boas gostava muito do trabalho pesado eu trabalhava na perfumaria gostava do que exercia ."
good,"Muy buena empresa, donde uno se puede desarrollar y aprender de los demas"
good,"Apesar de ser do ramo de varejo, onde trabalhava era a parte de logística, então era fácil a comunicação com liderança. Tinha uma parte muito boa com o relacionamento com Rh onde participávamos muito em ajuda a comunidade e meio ambiente. Ganhei promoções e muito incentivo para ser conferente."
good,night shift was the best shift. The managers on night shift were extremely helpful especially around the holidays. The best part of the job while stocking shelves you also got to help customers.
good,I would be go to my cashier that I was assigned to and begin ringing customers out and chatting with them to keep a smile on their face. We're taught friendly customer service and I gave the customer just that.
good,Walmart was one of the first job I ever worker for besides winn- dixie. Overall one of the best job I ever had but the amount of work management wanted us to do was unbelievable.
good,Typical day is to greet patients and stock the sales floor. Management here was really good I loved them and co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of this job was making sure everything was in the correct place and learning where to properly put everything. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting so many different nice people.
good,Its a good company but am looking to get into the  field  of safety Wal-Mart has always been welling work with my schedule that's what I like about them.
good,"Wal-mart is a great place to work for a temporary job. They are very flexible with you availability and schedule. The work environment is very family like, but can sometimes be overwhelming. There is a sense of superiority from some people which can make the work environment a bit uncomfortable and frustrating at times."
good,Wal-Mart is a great place of employment. In my years there I've realized my work was all repetitive. Even though my assigned duties were fairly easy I was always the go to guy for high priority projects. Management at my time of employment was very slack and is now being investigated for improper use of power. The walmart employee setting was always family orientated and pleasant.
good,"The job in the vision center is pretty good over all. Doctors are nice and manager is nice. I love checking in the glasses and getting them  ready for patients. There are bad days with this job though. Quite a lot of rude patients. A lot of people like to argue and want ""trial"" contacts because their prescription is expired. Some days are good and some bad. Definitely a lot to learn when starting out working here."
good,"Very stressful. Fast paced environment. Co-workers were awesome, we worked as a team. Management overworked a lot of the employees so much that they couldn't be as productive."
good,"Travailler chez WalMart a été une très belle expérience. Les journées étaient toujours occupées surtout étant que caissière. L'opportunité de travailler chez WalMart permet d'ouvrir d'autre opportunité de travail. Par contre, le management était pas satisfaisant. C'est juste avec certains des employé qu'on pouvait bien s’entendre comparer chez Tommy. Ce qui était le plus dur était de faire face aux client mécontent de la file d'attente ou quand il y avait un problème et qu'il fallait attendre, mais le plus agréable était de garder le sourire, rester patiente et de leur dire que sa ne durera pas longtemps, car ce son eux notre clientèle donc il faut leur donner un bon service qu'ils méritent."
good,"Walmart has been good to me, its a good place to work, where there is room for growth and building relationships with others."
good,"Walk to work, start in the back and organize which product goes in its area, stock the products in its area, break down boxes and put them in the recycle bin."
good,The coworkers and managers are very nice and it was a pleasure working with them. The job is really laid back and enjoyable. The only reason I left was because classes were started back up in the fall and I left for school.
good,"um dia agitado muitos atendimento ,"
good,walmart is a hard place to work .they put to much on one person . if they ever had enough people it would be great. i really loved working with the people there and have many friends.the management was awesome. and worked just as hard as everyone else .the hardest part of the job was not having enough help.
good,"Stock shelves, pull pallets, cleans and sweeps. customer service. we work as a team to get the job done. we work at a fast and steady pace"
good,"great place to work and develop people and urself"
good,"Meu dia começava verificando como estava o abastecimento do balcão do supermercado. Meu trabalho consistia em atender os pedidos dos clientes, manter as prateleiras bem abastecidas e receber e estocar as mercadorias recebidas, além de manter o açougue limpo. A parte mais agradável era a convivência com os mais diferentes tipos de público. Já a mais difícil era a sobrecarga de trabalho devido a falta de funcionários. A direção era até certo ponto compreensiva mas havia muita falsidade entre os colegas de"
good,Walmart is a diverse atmosphere and is a very enjoyable place to work. There are a lot of challenging daily activities and the people side of the business is like no other I have experienced in my retail career.
good,i learned how to stock merchandise from backroom to sales floor
good,"From my experience, co-workers are wonderful. They make going to work worth while. Management is ok. Some think too highly of themselves, which is disappointing at times, but I respect their position and do what is asked of me to the best of my ability. There are those who are good managers that can get along with others and still get their workers to get the job done. "
good,The employees are fun and easy to get along with. There were always customers to help and always something to do. The Management staff is extremely nice and always listening to the employees.
good,I did everything in the shop. I especially loved know that we had a specific torque for each vehicle instead of over tightening or under tightening lug nuts and oil pan bolt. I got along with all the employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the heat and cold temperatures. The best part of the job was knowing I kept the customers vehicle on the road and that they were safe.
good,"I enjoyed my time there, the friends I made, and all the countries I visitted."
good,Walmart is a suitable place to work. Management and supervisors are friendly and easy to work with
good,"My typical night at work depends on what position I am on the schedule to work that night. As a cashier, I report to register 15 when my 10 pm shift starts. I assist customers with their questions and transactions. Around 12 am customer traffic slows and I begin to zone the front end. After the front end is zoned, I zone other areas. When needed I help stock merchandise. "
good,"-A typical day at work would be greeting customers, preparing work station scanning groceries while interacting with customers, returning items in its proper place."
good,This place is a fun and educational work place. It had various employment advances and worked with the schedules at hand.
good,Management was awesome. a lot of people don't like working for Walmart. But that was not my experience. Friendly Co-works. I learned a lot from this job.
good,"Walmart pay is ok, they do have benefits which is very good. The Walmart that I worked for had its areas that was more organized than other areas, depending on who was managing some days would be chaos, for example you would have apparel and beauty workers working in the food area or it would be the other way around, that was not good. Overall the Walmart was ok"
good,"Busy, Busy, Busy. It was good and not so good management at Wal-Mart, I can honestly say. Co-worker, um, didn't do to much talking at Wal-Mart, just went to work and did my job."
good,"In the past 7 years I have leaned quite a bit working with Walmart.  If you show interest in learning other areas of the store, you will most definitely be trained in those areas. Since I showed interest, I learned the whole store, 1st-3rd shift, which helped me advance to my supervisor position. The pay is not so great but it is a stable job.  Managers come and go though. Some of them will like you and some will not, which will limit how far you can move up. They do what they want with who they hire for certain spots and are very biased sometimes.  Overall, everyone is friendly.  They do not want to work with availability any more though.  You are married to Walmart if you work there.  The job isn't hard, but I do love what I do. My associates sometimes complain but they do have the hardest and least compensated job in the store. Unloading trucks IS a task. Other than that, Walmart is an easy job if you are willing to just do what is asked of you, even though your job title may not entail it, if management deems it necessary you will be scrubbing toilets and pushing buggies."
good,its an awesome job to start out with but i don't recommend it as a permanent job.
good,I liked the company it was a nice place to work. They offered two shifts and also had a nice break area.  Its a production based environment that is fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to focus intently on the task without a lot of distraction.
good,"Es una buena empresa maneja buenas prestaciones,antiguedad,y crecimiento para todos,mi jefe directo siempre fue muy consiente y amable."
good,You would be assigned a register and start ringing up customers. Lots of money handling.  Management was not very smart when it came to opening up more registers. Co-workers were friendly and helpful.
good,"I was always very busy but never felt appreciated, I came to work when called in, I would stay late when needed... I learned a lot about retail, the management was not very helpful"
good,"A typical day at work was long but entertaining, a long day with the guys getting the job done quickly."
good,"On a typical day, I see financially how my business had done the previous day and start planning based on that and the available staffing I have. I have learned that you need to stay on top of everything and most importantly, stay organized to succeed. The management in my facility all works well with each other to get the tasks and hand accomplished along with the co workers. The hardest part of the job is making sure you are holding all of your associates accountable if need be and make sure everyone is on task. The most enjoyable part of the job would be having a free mind to make your own business decisions to help ensure your business strives."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work and build a career. the knowledge I gained at Walmart will stick with me, forever. Management and co-worker are good people, they do get unhappy, but still do their job. Customer service is the hardest part of the job. Customers can be the most rewarding as well,"
good,Working at Walmart was a good experience. I learned a lot from the pharmacist and technicians.
good,"meus encarregados de setor eram muito legais,eu adorava fazer o serviço de separaçao se pudesse voltaria para la com certeza"
good,"A empresa possui uma política sólida, onde nos permite utilizá-las no momento oportuno, possui uma infinidade de ferramentas para estratégias para melhorar e aquecer as vendas, tem um sistema que nos auxilia bastante a exercer o gerenciamento de produtos. Em contrapartida, baixo salário, orgânico limitado, zero em premiações."
good,"It is easy to move up in the ""food chain"", but even after you move up you are still not making good money and get no respect."
good,Family values. No overtime allowed. Different culture than anywhere else that I've worked. Love the 4 day work weeks. Weird shifts though
good,"Un dia tipico en el trabajo era que llegaba me ponia el uniforme y esperaba a que llegaran clientes para el mantenimiento, se llegaba la hora de comida y de regreso era lo mismo."
good,It's a good place to start out but wages are little and hard for a full time associate to make a living
good,"llegar fichar,ir al sector con los compañeros a charlar antes de empezar el día laboral,juntarnos con los  supervisores para ver la actividad de proovedores que teníamos en el día,nos daban aliento y apoyo moral,luego ejercicios de estiramiento muscular como pre calentamiento....ir a buscar el escanear y empezar la jornada,tuve muchísimo compañerismo de parte de todos y lo que mas me costo aprender fue a recibir la mercadería de problem.... igual todos siempre ayudaban mucho.                                                                   "
good,Best job I've had hands down miss working at a family friendly place
good,Working at Walmart was a new experience and different. Helping elderly unload their carts.
good,"meu dia era super corrido eu era operadora de loja mais ficava mais no caixa aprendi que nem tudo que parece é o que me decepcionou foi a gerência que cobria muita coisa errada mas tirando a última gerência ,me dava super bem com os meus colegas de trabalho e eu gostava muito do meu serviço aparte mais difícil de tudo era preconceito de alguns clientes mais sempre tem alguém com uma palavra amiga e a parte mais agradável é essa o companherismo dos colegas de trabalho."
good,"Benefits great, training great and if you are a fast learner with the speed to keep up this is the job for you."
good,A typical day at Walmart involved a fast paced great work experience. I've learned to deal with customers on many levels and occasions. Management Was Very Poor ; Attitude And Very Little Work Experience. Co-Workers Very Motivated. Hardest Part Of The Job Was Dealing With upset customers when management weren't around doing there jobs. i enjoyed conversations with my customers and the smiles and compliments of others.
good,Everyday was a learning experience. I was happy to come to work...
good,"A typical day for me was going in and getting my job done which consisted of wearing a smile, greeting/helping customers. I learned that keeping a very positive attitude and being very patient will take you far in life. I got along with my co-workers and managers very well and was always willing to do what it took to keep our store up and running, safe and a first option for the people. I was often acknowledged on how well my attitude and job performance was while working or just visiting the store on my personal time. There really was not any hard task on the job but if I must say it was trying to keep a clean station after customers repeatedly put merchandise in wrong places but I didn't mind taking up the responsibility. The most enjoyable part of the day was being able to help customers/co-workers and leave them with smiling faces."
good,Had bad experience while working there. Did not get along with management nearly at all. Had quite a bit of costumer conflict due to mistakes. Did not really enjoy going to work.
good,"What I learned and what was the most enjoyable part of he job were getting to interact with all walks of life, diversity in people, customer relations with employees and customers."
good,"A typical day at work consist of checking out customers, greeting them with a warm smile and breif conversation, and cleaning all work stations and spills. Management and CSM work hard to satify the customers needs. Some co-workers were there for the benefit of working and some were there for a pay check. The hardest part of the job was working with co-workers that did not want to work. Besides the non working co-workers the job was enjoyable."
good,"I start my day by scanning my outs, counting my inventory and correcting any errors in counts. If there is an item that doesn’t scan properly I’ll put it on the UPC hotline to correct the problem for a smooth transaction for customer and cashier.  Than it is on to doing the price changes so the customer gets the best price for their dollar. First and for most, customer service comes before everything else."
good,"pressureless,calm all around inviroment, nice friendly people, staff,"
good,"* stock shelves "
good,Completing a list of tasks that have to be completed before you leave for the day. Day to day you gain experience on how to run an area as your own personal business. The hardest part of the job would be keeping in contact with vendors week to week to keep your area full. But I always enjoy working with my peers and other associates.
good,"Unloading and down stacking pallets and putting the products up on their correct shelves for customer convenience."
good,"Everyday in Wal-Mart was super productive, not one day that I worked here was ever in slow pace. I learned allot about the items/products in the departments they assigned me too. I also learned to put together displays. Management was good, no complaints in this area. I had only a very few co-workers that I was able to work with & some were very rude & others were very friendly & kind. The hardest part of this job for me was working with others that didn't do their job right or at all & who were very rude. The most enjoyable part of working here was learning about items/products & break times."
good,A typical day consists of about 13-14 hours.  There is usually 2-3 managers on my current overnight shift. My day starts with getting my freight unloaded and stocked in a timely mannner.  Getting the sales floor to look like grand opening by 7am.  The ability to multi task is not an option.  I still have to ensure that my sales floor is still productive as well as my cashiers and check outs.  My location is open for business 24 hours.  The customer doesn't care about the back of the building just their ability to find their merchandise and get checked out quickly.  But what goes on behind the scene is the only way to make that a pleasant experience.  I have about 30 to 45 minutes to access the store and plan out a shift. I have learned how to implement change and innovations within a fast growing company and changing economy.  I have learned how to get ordinary people to do extraordinary things.  My co-workers come from all walks of life.  Wal-mart is a true diverse and melting pot. The hardest part of the job is the high turnover and getting to know all of your people.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people live better and save money and taking care of the customers and associates both internal and external
good,"I was responsible for unloading the freight trucks and pulling the product out on the floor for the freight crew to put on the shelf.  I would often end up helping the freight crew for a couple hours instead of managing the inventory like we were supposed to do.  I had plenty of opportunities for customer service.  I didn't feel like advancing within the company was very rewarding, just because of the low pay.  the job itself was rewarding because it was a chance to serve the community.  my coworkers were often tired because it was swing shift and several had to have a second job to make ends meet but they were pretty easy going.  the hardest part of the job was knowing I was working hard and not making ends meet. "
good,"Photo Lab Manager"
good,You  had to provide good customer service. There was something new to learn always. Which was a great thing. It was very wasy to move up and be promoted.
good,"I enjoy working with my co-workers and management. A typical day is checking the payroll, training other associates and making sure all associates are current on computer training. In Personnel we also finalize the store schedule."
good,"Busy."
good,"Empresa con valeres institucionales muy marcados, interes por el empleado desde su ambito personal, optimizacion de resultados, buen coaching, ambiente laboral regular, objetivos y metas reales, apoyo de todo el equipo de trabajo."
good,Good place to work. As long as you do your job they will give you bonuses and raises. Just be prepared to work hard.
good,"aprendi a auxiliar al cliente y el acomodo de mercancia"
good,"I worked overnight. Some nights were better than others. I learned a lot during my years there. Stocking, recieving, backroom processing accounting and customer service. My co-workers and managers were excellent. The hardest part of my job was the holidays. But the mos enjoyable part was the learning experieces."
good,"Very busy workplace, the bakery could be very busy, learned how to do everything in the Bakery Department."
good,"I enjoy working for Wal Mart because of the people. There are days its hectic but we have a good team willing to help out anywhere at any time to get the job done. I've learned so much from all the different employees and we all became somewhat more like family who always have each others back. The management is always on key and willing to do their part to get their departments in tip top shape. The hardest part of the job for me was never having a fixed schedule which makes it hard to have a personal life but talking to management when something comes up, all of them are willing to work with you so you may better be able to have a personal life."
good,"The typical day at walmart neighborhood market consisted of long hours and great customers. Managers were always busy so the quick and effectiveness was limited. It is a big company so there were not very many co-workers that you knew. I think that the most enjoyable moments while working at Wal-Mart had to be the great customers. Many had their attitudes but I could always cheer them up with a smile and a great outlook on life. although the hardest part of the job was waiting for evaluations, I was always anxious to see how well i did over the months."
good,typical work day consisted of partaking in just about every job in the store while I was there because I was the only hourly employee that was cross trained for every department except apparel and jewelry.
good,Working for Walmart was my very first job and I am forever grateful to them. It was not easy but very rewarding. I learned a lot about customer service.
good,It started off great but working there almost 3years everything begin to hit the fan. They expected more of me even when I work hard. The promotion I always looking forward too always paid off to the ones who didn't do much work.
good,This was an okay job for a person that is already settled and pretty much has got what they want out of life!
good,"eu trabalhei 7 anos na walmart,e claro que aprendi muito com eles,a empresa em si e muito boa,nunca atrasaram o pagamento,os beneficios eram muitos bons,mas como sabe lidamos com pessoas,e isso faz a diferença,qdo troquei de setor ja nao foi a mesma coisa,muita fofoca,uns querendo mandar no outro,eu particulamente,nao gosto de trabalhar assim,sempre me dei muito bem com meus colegas,mas nao aguentava,mais esse clima todos os dias tinha uma fofoca.dai resolvir sair ate por que ia acabar ficando doente,nao tinha mais motivaçao para ir trabalhar.entao decidi pedir as contas.sei que precisei de muita coragem e apoio para fazer isso,mas fiz e nao me arrependo,ate por que nao acho justo prejudicar os colegas faltando,por que ja passei por isso,qdo nao vem um colega ficamos sobre carregados,fazendo o nosso serviço e o do outro.sai sem direito a nada perdi meus direito de sete anos,mas estou leve,feliz,agora estou aberta para novo desafios."

good,"I loved working with my co workers, and the public. Everyday was a different experience, Everyone was always so happy, and it was just a great place to work.."
good,Very fun to work and learn new things. Mangement didn not communicate well and often had conflicts with what associates were told.
good,"Sales and customer service is priority in the department. Mainly focusing on selling merchandise and helping needed customer. Newly incoming products needs to be reviewed for technical specs and as well promoting sales and customer tech support. Zoning, stocking and making sure all products are accounted for, falls under management as well as store department associate. Co-workers are specialized in different aspect of electronics such as, computer, tv's, gaming, sound systems. Sometimes the hardest part of the job is to maintain balance in the department. As seasonal and holidays hit the electronic, things tend to get out of control. We focus mainly on balance of supporting each other. Co-workers and management make that effort worth awhile. Enjoyable timing have their moments such as, bonuses, parties and receiving thanks from the customers who appreciate what we do for them."
good,Everybody is really nice and helps you get thru a hard day of work.
good,"Wal-mart is over all a good place to work at. I've worked here for 3 years and have always felt welcome and good about the management, associates and customers around me."

good,Interact with customers and vendors; provide customer service; maintain that all merchandise is in stock and on sales floor. I am constantly learning better ways of doing certain task that make my safer and easier. Management is great that help me with all my concerns and my co-workers are like my second family.

good,Working for walmart can be a great experience if you are willing to listen to people talk about their on-going lives. You interact with different kinds of people everyday which is very interesting. The only thing that isn't enjoyable is when the lines get backed up and people have to wait.

good,There is no such thing as a typical day at work. Everyday is different. You receive your assignments at the beginning of every shift; and that is subject to change. My co-workers are great. Every one tries to help. The hardest part of the job is trying to get all your assignments done. The most rewarding part of the job is being able to help the customer find what he/she wants.
good,"I suppose if your a single person or if you're with someone who is also working then this job is fine. but for me personally, being the only one in my household working, this was an unsatisfactory job for me in terms of pay."
good,"There was always customers to help, the department had to be organized every 2 hours it was a very busy department. Other departments needed assistance with resets, stocking, and setting displays.you get the opportunity to gain experience in order to move up in the company."

good,"They only give me in total 8 hours a week and I come in only 2 days a week, they’re very slow as well. But the workplace is very diverse and I feel no judgment whatsoever"
good,A typical day was coming in to work and being greeted by co workers and having a team meeting about our daily plans. So as the shift progressed id gather the carts or carry items out for the customers. Attending to the best customer service i could achieve.
good,The time I've spent through Walmart I've throughly enjoyed. The atmosphere is great and management is really understanding at accommodating with your schedule.
good,"hay muy bueno con compañeros de trabajo, prestacio"
good,"I was happy with working here, but it was temporary and I was unable to relocate. The Transportation manager was the best manager I have ever worked for."

good,The crew I worked with was very nice and I feel like I could of been myself at work. Sometimes we would get there and the backroom wasnt set up for the days. But days that they were the day went pretty smooth.
good,It's a good environment. Just lots of things to learn. They like you to be cross the trained in all the departments. Just in case someone else is busy or there isn't someone there to cover there department.
good,"Loved working at Wal-Mart,  the scheduling is fair. The management is very professional!!! The job is very easy and manageable, no matter where your placed. There are multiple opportunities to move up in the company which is a plus."
good,"It's a very outgoing Job,I was there 8 years. It's probably good for a college or high school student. Out of 8 years I only made it to the pay rate of 11.50 not really where I wanna be at in life at the age of 32"

good,"Se aprende mucho trabajando en Walmart, hay muchas áreas para aprender"
good,I was a team worker. I interacted with many people handling their transactions and customer service thru out the whole shift.  A fast pace at many times it was unusual when it was slow.
good,Near the end of my time with WalMart the corporate level was changing for the worse - taking more and more control of store level operations such as scheduling. Advancement at that time was possible and the culture was good.
good,Descent benefits but the pay is low for long time employees. I worked there 10 years and was only making a penny more than an employee in the same position was making after a year.
good,"Challenging; yet rewarding position.  This is very new to me and on a daily basis I am learning something new.  Trying to keep up with my workload while assisting customers can be challenging; but, interesting."
good,They are very good at working with your schedule especially if you're in school. The environment is pretty diverse you meet all different types of customers and associates.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. During my time there I met many different people and made a lot of great freinds as well. While the job is a bit demanding and fast moving I happen to enjoy that line of work that keeps me moving.
good,Great team to work with very understanding and love to help out when they can they are all about customer service and they love to make sure your okay and like what your doing far as your job
good,"Walmart is fun fast and prouductive . It teaches you to be organized, hardworking and a team player. The most enjoyable part is making the customer smile and enjoy the experience"
good,I had to abruptly move out of state do too family issues. I called everyday & even spoke with my manager everyday. Too keep him updated. He told me He would take care of my transfer and my point system & did not. Which led me not to be able to transfer and ending in termination.
good,"•	Recommend, select, and help locate or obtain merchandise based on customer needs and desires."
good,"I learned how to unload a trailer in a limited time, learned how to focus on meeting my production, provided great training, learned every department."
good,"Working at Walmart had its advantages and disadvantages.  If you are in a department with good management everything will flow smoothly. You might hit a few bumps but for the most part its manageable BUT, if you are in a good department with a bad manager everything can fall apart. If people think the management is bad their not going to want to do their job."
good,Overall my experience with Walmart has been a pleasant one that helped me with many things outside of just work. Such dental and health insurance which helped me a lot after getting out of school.
good,"greet customers, check them out make sure that found everything they needed, clean, restocked, customer service rep, cashed checks answered phones, taking care of customers needs."
good,"Job was overall a great place to work , with very little nicks. I loved working in the job field I was in . Also gave each employeee great benefits and a discount."
good,A typical day at work you stay busy. Managment is always available for questions and concerns. Everybody treats everyone with dignity and respect. Always fun. Plus the benefits after ninety days is worth staying with Walmart.
good,This place is not too bad to work at. The main thing there was very rude customers that think they are right and steal stuff. On the other hand some management took favoritism on a whole other level.
good,Go into work do what I have to do and go home. Put out stock for the customers. We need to put out 35 cases  per hour. A customer is always right when it comes to the truth.
good,"Unorganized management, the employee were kind and fun to work with but management never seemed to know what was going on or how to handle certain situations."
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers and also my coworkers very much. I did not mind getting up and going to work every day. Unfortunately the management team made it a difficult environment to work in, making uneducated decisions which affected how I was able to work and how my coworkers were able to also. At that time I saw the need to branch out to a different company that I could grow and learn with a safe friendly and encouraging working environment."
good,The hardest part of the job is being new and trying to tell an old veterans what the manager's expect. They think because they have been there longer you can not tell them anything. A new hire have to step in let them know that their is always going to be a change and that we would have to adapt and accept new challenge that we have to face in order to help keep our department organize and cleanness.
good,It's not a bad job and it's fairly easy depending which department you're in. The people are friendly and good to be around. It just wasn't the right job for me. I was unhappy there but to no fault of their own.
good,Walmart has a great minimum-wage great benefits the only thing that's not good is the management because sometimes They can be mean and sometimes it they do not treat their associates right
good,I am not going to lie.  We got to stock work hard and listen to our Walkman's.  The music always kept me going. I was checker and customer service.  But I liked stocking more because I could move more.
good,"Oppurtunity for growth, exciting and rewarding, helpful to employees in time of need with no discrimination, advancement in a reasonable amount of time if employee applies his/herself"
good,Supervised all cashiers and cart associates. Daily cash distributing and drawer audits.

good,It was very stressful and required alot of time if you are there for a paycheck its a great place to work.they have made alot of changes after the years I worked there ...I would not do it again based on all the availability changes they have made
good,"Well when I worked at wal-mart in Siloam Springs, it was was fun and I had good opportunities like almost going up as manager. I took one test and failed, I was going to take it again but I had to move. I moved to Joplin Mo and tried the store up here. They weren't bad but they didn't make me feel like a family.  Siloam Spring Wal-mart treated qually and also like a big family. I think that was the thing that was hard on me was losing a family that I made at the Siloam Spring wal-mart."
good,It's a great job to start out on. You learn to do more than your hired to do which gives you great opportunity to move up. I have learned a lot from the two years I been with Walmart. I started as cashier gained great communication skills an dealing with difficult situations
good,Walmart is a good places to work if u are good with people if not don't work there some people can be very difficult but just smile through it and call a Co worker for help but they pay well and give u great benefits

good,"A typical day at work includes helping customers frequently , lifting , etc , i've learned the right way to interact with customers on a good or bad day right or wrong, management is very helpful and understanding, the workplace culture is awesome its a good place to learn and experience new things, hardest part of the job is looking for misplaced items, and lastly the most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers."

good,I felt welcome. the pay was good. i made some amazing friends. I miss working there and I would definitely go back in the future if need be. Overall a good environment.
good,"Mis actividades como cajero, me permitieron desarrollar mis avilidades de trato a las personas así como el trabajo en equipo, estar bajo precion y ser cuidadoso en mi trabajo para no ver perjudicados los ingresos."
good,"This store was recently open, and I was trained from the bottom as a stocker. I showed my motivation and determation to promote which I promoted three times. I had an eager to become a store manager but I built up to a support manager position. I realized about Walmart is not paying enough for this position."
good,fast paste and I learned a lot the management was good and the workplace culture was ok there was nothing hard about the job and I enjoyed my place of work
good,Good places to work.closeto my home.raise in pay every year.very relax atmosphere with high ups open to suggestions from employees.always keep you informed with meeting everyday.
good,"Met some amazing people thru out the time I was there. My typical day at Walmart consisted of either getting the bathroom cart ready for the night or getting one of the machines ready, whether it was the scrubber, buffer, or the wax machine. I learned how to properly use each one of the machines, the scrubber, buffer, and the wax machine. The management was pretty good people. The workplace itself was pretty laid back and chilled. Hardest part of my job was shifting from day crew to night crew, but after a couple weeks I was able to make it work."
good,Walmart has fun people to work with and a good environment to be in. Walmart has a great 401k plan and stock options that they help pay for. Thank you.
good,"not best place"
good,"I'm not gonna sugar coat it, it is a great job for a college student, because it shows you what you are working to avoid. minimum wage is what is commonly available, although the minimum wage is rising in my area. the hours do not pass quickly and you are either busy or not. and the hours of standing around doing nothing do not balance out the sudden rush of surprisingly often angry customers. when i was a cashier they would be disgruntled about my not discounting items to negative cost for them. when i was a customer service desk worker they were mad when i wouldn't return things with a Goodwill receipt.at walmart, the customer is never happy, no matter what you do, but you still try your best and they leave a little less angry at least, so you hope. the management will do their best to assist you when they can and they do a very good job of helping you when you ask."
good,A typical day at work goes by very well. Not to much happens at night and the work not too hard for us. We all do a pretty go good at our jobs and get everything done on time.
good,"Es un ambiente muy bueno , no hay discriminaciones y hay grandes oportunidades de crecimiento laboral"
good,At the Return Center everyone work as a team.  The Management was good to work with the assonant and make sure the work environment was good  and your got overtime.
good,"i was always busy and i enjoyed that, but the managers there did not seem as dedicated as the employees and they are very hard to contact. sometimes the work place could seem unorganized but the customers always were satisfied."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart, I caught frostbite in the winter and couldn't take a couple days off. Store managers would tell us to do one thing & our team leaders would tell us to do another and then get frustrated with us when we only did what was asked. There was a couple of times where team leaders wanted us to do tasks after signing out. Great benefits, easy job, lovely pay, I enjoyed the guys who I worked with."
good,Good customer friendly love work with the ppl love stocking help bag ring up people push carts clean up at night after work was done stock the bags 😊
good,I moved from cashier to CSM in like 6 months. Management was decent but the good thing about Walmart is they like to promote from within so room for advancement is there.
good,"Fue una de mis mejores experiencias laborales, se trabaja en forma permanente había solo 10 min descanso en 4 horas laborales, los colegas eran muy competitivos y no era un trabajo solidario. Siempre se pedía mayores logros, lo que hacía superarme."
good,Overnight stocking fun easy always being moved to new areas see new product all the time learn where everything is in the store. Everyone I worked with was friendly
good,"Great place to work. My manager was amazing, she was so understanding and helped me overcome a lot of obstacles that I was facing. I hate that I had to leave."

good,"I have worked here twice and the very first time I did, they were very confusing with doctors notes. Plus, when I was pregnant they refused to transfer me to a different department"
good,My experience at this pharmacy has been great and made friends with my coworkers. The company pays for all your costs to become a pharmacy technician.
good,I overall loved my job but management have its pick and chooses on who to hire and fire.  Walmart store 1206 which is where I worked was very very busy typical busy day would more like me on a saturday or of course on holidays.
good,Enjoyed working there when i first started out. As years went  by new managers came along and things got worse. They talk to you any kind way. They have no respect for you what so ever. They dont pay us over time we work.
good,Just do what's asked of you with no complaints and always give good customer service . I would still be there if it wasn't for a hardship of the family problems at home I'm always been resolved but I really love working there flexible hours good pay good benefits great people
good,I really enjoyed the fast pace with this job and found myself very helpful an interactive with my customers. I started out as a cashier but quickly advanced to CSM. I also worked for some months in the cash office when the help was needed.

good,"In a tipical day at work I was doing around 9 carts of recovery;"
good,its all about work and how efficient you are as a worker they don't care about about associate / manager relations unless they like personally.
good,We started at 10 o'clock. As soon as we get there we break down pallets and separate everything. usually we work 1 to 2 isles. Everything would've been done quicker if everyone pulled their own freight.
good,"even though the pay wasn't up to par at the time, I really enjoyed working for Walmart. it was a fun working environment with a diverse group of people from different backgrounds."
good,"Typical day at work, cashing customers out as they came through the line. Co workers were mostly army wifes, hardest part was dealing with young ones that came in after midnight just to raise heck"
good,"they walmart I used to work at was fair, they would take advantage of you if u let them. some of the employees and managers were ok, most of them are rude and stuck up."
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for with benefits and job advancement and compensation to go along with it. It is a work filled day packed into 8 hours but its worth it. A typical day is a steady pace of work flow, I learned how to deal with various personalities different situations with the job."
good,I enjoy my work days at Walmart. Great pay for a small amount of days worked.I also enjoy the great benefits that they provide for the employees.
good,Os funcionarios trabalhava de acordo com o horário de trabalho proporcionando melhor qualidade de vida.
good,"A typical work day would require a heavy load of re-merchandising an re-setting the store.  learned how to multi-task between the customer and work. Management wasn't the best, very miss-managed, and lazy. Hardest part of the job, was dealing with the managers. Most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers."
good,"Work everyday was hard and busy. I learned how to do things that cashiers do at the front end of store. Management is okay, and it was hard the first time I started working there, but I got used to it. The employees was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,I would go in a 10pm at night and get off at 7pm the next morning. I would stock shelves and consumer goods. I learned about proper organizing and how to pair up items.
good,Working for Walmart as a Door greeter helped me to always be on my best customer service behavior and interact with customers the best way possible.
good,"A typical day will working at Walmart is calm, productive and there is always something new to learn they also have a wonderful management program which inspires associates to pursue a challenge."
good,"You get reprimanded for the smallest inconsistency in your job performance, managers are a lot tougher on you than most managers I've worked with at other stores, but the pay is good enough to support yourself and/or a family and there is little to no health risks involved."
good,"A day at work would be on the computer all day bringing  down our number in the portal. I learned how to do the m3 and gained a lot of computer skills. The best part of this job were that our three breaks we took were completely paid for. There was nothing hard about this job, I loved it and wished I was still employed here."
good,A typical day as cashier: I greet people ring up their items collect money or card for payment and send them on their way. I have learned to be very patient. Management varies as this is a training store. My co-workers are most of the time team players. The hardest part of the job is having a different schedule each & every week. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers I meet along the way.
good,"walmart is my first job working here was my first experience and i got to learn many things such as hazmating merchandise thats been damaged taking care and making sure its been proper taken care of. working here has been awesome i got to met new people and how to get along and being able to work together in teams, well i dont think working here has been hard its actually taught me good things i love being part of walmart every here was great vibes positivity"
good,"Very easy job, easy to learn, people are easy to work with, management sometimes considerate."
good,in the work I did at walmart I was in the stockroom moving boxes and we had to use ladders to carry the boxes to high shelves. the boxes would be heavy most the time and it would have been safer if lighter boxes were carried to the top and heavier boxes on the bottom of shelves. Falling off ladders could have been very easy at this job.
good,The easiest part of the job is having interpersonal skills and learning how to interact with customers
good,"Typical day would be helping customers and stocking the shelves.."
good,"The day starts off with coming in and clearing the trouble shoot and resolving the problems with prescriptions. Either it being too soon to fill, insurance problems, waiting for doctors, or just double billing. Then it is time to input all the prescriptions that have been electronically sent in from doctor offices and drop the called in prescriptions from the doctor offices and faxed ones as well. While completing that process I take customer, doctor, and insurance phone calls as well as taking care of patients at drop off and pick up as well as helping the customer questions on locating the items for the store. Later on in the day I complete the return to stock that is the medications that haven't been picked up after ten days and put them away. At about that time its time to receive the orders and drop them into the systems and put them on the shelves and fill more prescriptions until the day is over. I have learned how to be a pharmacy technician and the medications names and uses and so much more from the time I entered this exciting field. The pharmacists at my store have helped me so much in guiding me into where I am now and continuing to teach me new things day to day. The hardest part to my job is  sometimes having to find other associates in the store for other departments across the whole store. But it is an enjoyable position to be knowing that I am helping people get better from being ill."
good,I would start my day by cleaning around my area to make sure everything is ready for my customer to come through. While checking out the customers items I would communicate with the customer to feel comfortanble and to make it feel as if their time in line goes by faster. I learn how to deal with hostile situations like having a unhappy customer. First thing I would ask them what the problem is and see if theirs anything I am able to do to fix the problem. My co-workers and I would enjoy our day at work by making one another smile and do not let the negative energy get to us. My management was always there for me when I needed them like when I first start they helped me learn all my customer service skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually breaking the ice with the customer and being able to talk to them and tell jokes. Hardest part of the job would have to be the lack of employees during the busy day. Their would be 3 clerks working for checking out 70 or more people and we were not allowed to ask to help.
good,A empresa oferecia oportunidade de crescimento.E pude ter o privilégio de adquirir muito conhecimento atuando em varias arias sem que isso se configurasse desvio de função.
good,The co-workers were amazing at Walmart and it was a great experience for me i learned so many new things. Thanks to everyone there who thought me new things :)
good,"es muy laboral en los dias de quincena,atencion mucho a los clientes y noi perder la cordura"
good,I enjoyed working there you would have busy days and slow days and the thing I learned while I was there was you have to be very respectful to customer even if they are rude to you. the management there was great the co-workers some was fun and some was just to they self alot. The hardest part on my job was the long hours and the most enjoyed part on my job you got off early sometimes.
good,Walmart is a great place to work I only worked overnight. the MGT was the best and i loved  my job if you ever want to work overnight wal mart would be the place to work.
good,A typical day at work for me is having a smile and being able to help others when needed.Being a leader to others such as team work with a complicated task and knowing how to get it done without complaining.I like a management that appreciates the work that their workers do and letting them know.The hardest part of the job is there is no hard part just do what is ask and get it done right and it will not be hard unless you make it hard.The most enjoyable part of the job is Just Doing It When Asked and Do It Right!
good,"My days at work would be the best, because of my co workers and customers. everyday was great for most customers but this was something I had to deal with while working for the public. I was always trying to make my customers smile even if it didn't look like they were having a bad day. I learned a lot not just from my co workers but from customers as well I learned things that I didn't think I could do. I also learned how to create a relationship with myself and to customers to keep them coming back for more service at my store. The hardest part of the job was getting through to the customers that was always angry, The most enjoyable part was being able to get the job done no matter what happen throughout the day."
good,i liked going to my job daily and working i learned alot of things and people.i enjoyed some of the people and really enjoyed my job and i worked the overnite shift and like that shift was a great shift to work
good,"This job was very stressful. This was mostly because we were a new pharmacy, understaffed, and had a high volume of customers. Constantly doing 4 or 5 things at once. I enjoyed the staff though. I also enjoyed helping customers."
good,"learned how to use a pallet jack "
good,Just about everybody who works here is nice and easy to get along with. Working as a sales associate for apparel was hard but easy at the same time once you get used to it..
good,The management was very nice. I enjoyed working there and hope I can work there again this summer.
good,walmart was good pay was okay they cut hours alot and at times be a little unorganized.
good,Walmart is a great place to work. The pay benefits are a great thing there. The people are also a great benefit. I love the fact of the quarterly bonus and personal experinces
good,A typically day at work is challenging such as stocking freight and having to have it done in a mannerable time. During my time at Walmart I have learned that the co-workers work as a time to present the  when you best results and the managers also help participate in stocking freight. The hardest part of the job is having customers that are not pleased regardless of effort that is put into pleasing the customer. I enjoy working alongside my co-workers and in many departments of the store.
good,Its been a lot of typical days working at wal mart you're dealing with a lot of different type of people and their attitude. You just need to know how to handle and deal with people working in customer service industry the key is Patient. and i learned to have patient whether its face to face or over the phone. Any job i have ever worked on i have always had a good relationship with my mangers because they where always able to depend on me. i socialize with my co-workers but never got to close because I come to work to get my job done . My hardest part at work would be if we where short of worker which causes more stress on me but i always mange to get by. My most enjoyable part on a job is payday.
good,"This is a great part-time opportunity for students. Scheduling is flexible, and due to the traffic of customers, the day progresses rather quickly."
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting all the associates along with customers while walking to the back room to clock in. I would than go to my designated work area and start promptly on any tasks given by management and finish them in a timely manner. Working for Wal-Mart I learned various skills such as customer service and team work. As far as the management team, communication was a common issue. I would have one manager telling me to start on a task and another manager telling me to start on another task. My co-workers where the most helpful and team work played a very big role for everyone. Working at Wal-Mart was never hard majority of the associates never failed to lend out a helping hand. I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart because of all the different experiences and people you will encounter."
good,Meet all kinds of interesting people. Much room for advancement. Decent salary and good bonuses.
good,a typica at convergys was answering phone call listening to people comment about the sprint comany. i learned how to be patience and listen to the customer and try to help solve their problem. my co-worker were all friendly . the hardest part was sitting down all day. the most enjoyable part of the job was talking on the phone with all the client and just being in a fun work place.
good,"Fazer as tarefas dentro do tempo, respeitando todos os amigos."
good,-A day at walmart it is what you make it to be
good,It was very busy and great being apart of the Wal Mart family. I mean every job has its problems that should have been fixed. I just think that they should have hired managers that love their jobs and that did it the current way. Wal Mart was really unbalanced and very rude and not understandable.
good,A typical day at work is when im putting out all of the freight and working helping customers at the same time. What i've learned is Customer Service comes first and the rest will fall in place so that you can finished what all needs to be done and completeing your task.The management is sedomly rated at WalMart because you have different managers telling you different tasks.The co-workers they are all above and head of me and they are doing what im trying to do besides all of the hours are gettng cut. The hardest part of my job is when they only schedule 3 people to close and that isn't enough for the 3 of us to take our lunch at the correct time but we all manage to make it as a team using communication. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things and meeting the world because you face different ones each and everyday.
good,"I work at the rockwall,tx location where i work overnight. Where i pick the items out the bins. To take to the sales floor to there departments"
good,Loved working with the customers everyday. Something new everyday.

good,e uma empresa otima foi muito bom trabalhar la os funcinarios sao atenciosos e gentis nao tive dificuldade sao otimas pessoas
good,With the last position I held at WalMart as a IMS Member the night would start with getting the picks out to the floor before two oclock. Atfer the picks go out to the floor it was my job to go out to the floor and check to see what over stock is coming back to the floor. It was my job to neatly put the items away in the back shelves and organize the back room.
good,I would either open or close the deli when I did work and throughout the day I would fry and prepare foods and also slice gourmet Meat/Cheese. In the night I cleaned the deli top to bottom and in the mornings would get get everything set up and cooked for the new day.
good,Greta place to work and i have been working for a year i love working there
good,Well i worked for walmart from 01 to 12 and it is a great place to work and hard to leave. As far as a typical day is you clock in and go straight to work you get 2 15 min. breaks and 1 hr. lunch. i learned a lot about hazardous waste processing and hazardous material shipping among other things.
good,a typical night at work would be stocking shelves. making sure the store was clean and organized. Management is great. They are all willing to help you as long as you get your work done. Some co-workers are tough to get along with. theres nothing really hard about the job. The most enjoyable is the environment in general and being able to help customers.
good,"Very busy, also fast paste movement. But very productive . Loved the atmosphere although fast paste it was very fun when I got the flow of the work."
good,"Helping customers, and stocking freight. I have learned skills such as working in a time consuming manner and helping customers everyday. I report to managers when I have questions and concerns rather going ith my own judgement. The hardest part of my job is working on holoidays when sales and special products come in. The most enjoyable part is making people smile and helping out."
good,My typical night is stocking product to the sales floor and helping customers. I have learned over the 6 years I have worked for this company that it changes everyday and the customer is always right.
good,a typical day at wal mart constist of me going into work 10 pm and getting off at 7 am. i done anything to keep the store looking good.
good,A typical day at this store is a steady flow of customers. But the work here is fairly easy to learn. I have learned how to interact with a variety of customers. The mangement were good people. My co-workers were very easy work with. The hardest part of the job is nothing it is a very easy job. On the other hand you have to learn how to process those WIC vouchers. After doing it a few times I was getting the hang of it.
good,The management would probably be the best I've ever worked with.
good,"This is a very fast paced environment retail pharmacy. It is very busy the majority of the time. It can be stressful at times, but if you work together, the teamwork is a major plus to getting a good days work done!"
good,"Loved working here for the past 9 years! But with so many company changes over the year, it has become severely understaffed which leads yo more expectations and less teaching."
good,"Good place to work, i have issues with the pay grade and how the raises work, but other than that its a good job. I do enjoy working at Walmart and i think its a good place."
good,You're on a point system and cant miss work. Management at my store would lie to you. The work was easy and fun. But I got put in the hospital and it pointed me out no questions asked or compassion at all. So overall it's a great place to work as long as you dont get sick.
good,"Good Distrubtion Center there in Plainview, Tx "
good,I will like tu work in another company they are good people and they like to work together thats what I listen work in team work together you get better
good,It's helpful if you know the whole store that way you can help any customer .The Walmart app helps a lot but some items are online only where customers think they are in stores.
good,"We must work all holidays except Christmas holidays are family time"
good,"Horrible managers"
good,Sempre muito bem recebida nos meus emprego sempre pontual e correta com meus patrões
good,Walmart was a great place for me to interact with customers and to learn about the customer service. The bosses were amazing and I always felt like I was treated great!
good,I liked working there i got to create a plan bond with the team create and include every ones ideas into a plan and get alot of work done that was hard and rewarding work. Got to be involved in another stores remodle. Graduated acadomy. Worked in lawn and garden. Was running the self cheack out. Got to as well help work frait and whatever elce was important to get done as well as bonding with every one in the store.
good,"Very fast paced.  You must be able to multitask and not take things personal. The stress level can be very high at times because of the workload they want done on a daily basis.  Management needs to take more time and listen to their associates when they need them.  Wal-Mart has endless job opportunities and they do promote within the store if you want to become an Assistant Manager.  The most enjoyable part of my job was teaching, training and being there for the associates."
good,i enjoyed working there but was too hard to get there and after sept I had to quit because i need rides there and it was hard to make my parents drop e off
good,"I loved my time at walmart, if I hadn't started college I would have stayed. They are very workable with appointments and life needs. The people a are great and I have no complaints."

good,"this job pays very good but from a female stand of view, I would not work this job or want any other woman to. You are CONSTANTLY moving, lifting, and stacking merchandise weighing from 5lbs to over 60lbs. While having to stack them ranging from 3ft to 7ft high, while being timed because you're on production."
good,what i learned at this job is team work and good communication skills is very important on any and all jobs. always set priorites goals and establish a symtematic course of action for self and others to ensure accomplishments
good,"Great company, manger is very understand and always there to help and assist. This job with well around your schedule and any unplan event that may occur ."
good,"muy bien, buenos bonos, buenas utilidades, mal trato de altos mandos."
good,"Working at Walmart can be stressful but it can also be relaxing at the same time. On an average day customers come in asking for a particular item which is pretty average, but the same day other customers walk in complaining about not having a particular brand of that item and it can be quite stressful."
good,"walmart supercenter was a life changing job. learned different places about the store, learned about production and stocking shelves for customers. also learned about customer service."
good,"Walmart is a very busy company, with a huge customer base, and a wide range in class of customers. Very busy with customer service and controlling inventory for each department."
good,My overall review of Walmart is that it’s a good career building Environment and lots of job opportunities for people all around the world. ..........
good,The hardest part of the job was listening 30 to 40 lb crates above your head. they have good hiring people and they are very good at what they do . It  was nice working at that Walmart.

Service Desk Associate/Cashier/Electronics Dept. Mananger/Online Purchasing
good,"The job itself isn't hard. I pack items purchased online and mail to store and or customers in a production environment daily.  If item is damaged before shipping, I make the necessary changes to correct "
good,"fun employees, always a chance to move up the ladder. really enjoyed the break system they had set up. discounts after 6 months of working. management cared and were fair in all aspects."
good,"Walmart was an exciting ever changing place to work.  The pace was fast, and the training was intense. Walmart is every bit the  equal opportunity employer it claims to be."
good,It was a good environment but management didn't communicate well with each other. One manager would want me doing one thing while another would want me somewhere else.
good,Chaque jour il y avait des tâches différentes !!!!
good,"Some managers are very nice n willing to work with you hours are not consistent "
good,"Te motivan pues lo consiguen desde que llegas a tu are de trabajo, te saludan como estas,como te sientes en reunión de cinco minutos te comparten números,logros su cultura en donde el cliente siempre tiene la razón."

good,"I've been with Walmart for a few years now, and have worked at two different locations. The first store I worked for had an excellent management team and I was promoted within months of being there. All of the staff there was productive and it was fun to go to work. The Walmart that I work with now is much different. The staff is friendly but not nearly as productive as they should be. When issues are brought to the attention of management you can tell that they don't care. I've been disrespected by a coworker multiple times with no response from management. Your experience with this company varies by what store you work for. But there are many opportunities to promote as long as you work hard and show up."
good,"I worked here for a while off and on. and they still know me by name evrtime I walk in the door, I am glad they feel that way about me. I think management needed improbement. but I loved ken!! miss him!"
good,Una buena empresa para empezar a generar experiencia laboral
good,Es una empresa sólida y con excelentes gerenciales pero muy poca oportunidad de crecimiento laboral y obtener tiempo completo en la compañia.
good,"I have worked at Walmart for many years. It is a good company that treats its employees well, and the working hours are manageable. But I want change my career."
good,Here you will be picking items off the shelf and putting them on a pallet and then taking them to be wrapped. They pay is really good but be ready to work long hours.
good,gostei e fui muito feliz de ter trabalhado na empresa fui reconhecido e tive acolhimento necessario quando precisei.
good,The company really needed remodeling so we work very hard to make it work out.And the company is know looking good.And the people that work there theyy where ok .
good,"I enjoyed decorating cakes. The meat department was okay until they started putting everyone else work on you. I learned how to do cakes, I never did before. How to be patient no matter how customer approached you. Management was good and work place was good to work in, everyone worked together."
good,Good day typically everyone's for them self you have your own register just get in a zone AN get the job done. You work hard it's always a chance for supervisior position
good,"I helped customers in the garden center, helped assemble furniture, and worked as a cashier. The manager was great,to work for and gave encouragement. I learned how to handle many situations and to be patient with the customers and help them look for anything they might need."

good,Long periods of standing but great managers and co workers. It's all about speed and great customer service. They are also willing to work with your schedule .
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. Managers are really professional and they didn't mind working around my school schedule. I would recommend anyone to work there.
good,"It was a good job to work but it was not what I wanted. There was good days and there was bad days but overall I did what was expected of me, without issue."
good,Work at a steady paste very nice invironment. Don't mind helping other find things around the store if needed customers make the day go by fast by keeping us crew workers busy with there needs. Hanging up clothes putting up shoes on shelves to sale in store
good,Was a nice place to work until they tightened their belts. Not enough help left to work a department that needed youth and muscle
good,it was a fun workplace they just didn't want to work with your schedule the customers were friendly most of the time you will normally stand on your feet up to 8 hours a day management was nice
good,Overall Walmart is a good job that pays good and has great health benefits. Management isn't the best but they are better than most. Most problems are solved quickly and you get lots of second chances. Walmart is good with helping boost your career and gets you great scholarships!

good,"I liked this job, but I got sick and could not work in a deli anymore. The manager was a good understanding man. I wish I could go back but I know I can find a better job."
good,"Best Place to work for, everyone is very knowledgeable and respectable, they will even make sure you have a schedule that suitable for your lifestyle or you can switch a day with your co-worker as long as you let your manager know"
good,"it was horriable, i worked with my mother in law, she was controlling and always making me go to the stupid clients . my hours were short  "
good,Empresa multinacional que atende por oportunidades que são supridas por aqueles que buscam a oportunidade. Um dia cheio de desafios e metas a serem batidas dia à dia. O aprendizado que trago   é que cada dia é uma oportunidade de alcançar novos desafios. A gerência sempre nos dava o suporte imediato. Os colegas sempre motivados a garantir o sucesso da empresa. A parte mais difícil era buscar possibilidades quando no momento não conseguíamos alcançar a meta estabelecida. E a parte mais agradável era a satisfação de nossos clientes.
good,"My co-workers there were the best. If I didn't have them, I wouldn't be able to survive there. The hardest part of the job was making sure  all the products fit perfectly out on the sales floor and watching 6 other registers at the self checkout. The most enjoyable part of the job was having people to talk to and work with. Also when customers come into my lane to check out because it makes the day faster."

I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the people I worked with, the management team was awesome. Although, my time at Walmart was cut shorter than I thought, I am sad to leave this job behind, but excited for what the future holds."

good,"A typical day of work as a cashier/money center associate would start with a brief discussion with my manager about the work I was expected to do for the day. Sometimes this would consist of the manager telling me what register I was working at and nothing more. "
good,"- good pay"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, conoci a demasiadas personas , lo que no me gusto fue la prepotencia que tienen los gerentes para pedir ydar ordenes,"

I enjoyed all my customers and made sure that they was satisfy with there purchases and that they find everything that they needed. I learned great communication skills and customer service skills. I got alone with all my co-workers and managers. I was a hard worker and always on time. When there negative energy, I still kept a smile on my face to brighten up the day. "

The things that i learned while working in this department is customer service, transferring and receiving incoming calls, team working, helping each other our when needed, cashiering, inventory etc. I really love  working with my co-workers they are very fun and we always work together as a team and help each other when needed with customers. The hardest part of the job is customer service when it gets very busy because you have to run around like crazy to catch every customer, including when you are working as a closer and the only person in the department. Overall it isn't that bad when you get use to it. The enjoyable part of the job by working in electronics is learning new things of each product."
good,"I liked how busy you could be throughout the day. Unfortunately, when we had truck the night before coming in the morning. It was a lot to deal with and only 2 helping associates between 2 departments. Managers were not helpful when it came to working with your schedule."

good,"great place love the residents, very kind individuals, learned many things about each resident and their backgrounds staff very helpful and supportive."
good,Was a good place to meet and greet new people. You were always busy and lot of good employee's. Management was good and co- workers were very nice and friendly. Hardest part of job was keeping and finding good employee's. Moral at one time was good but as time goes on many unhappy employee's.
good,Punch in sent to customer service to help other customer service rep get line down clean area. Then go to register to help other cashiers get line down.  Replace items return back on selves.  Clean work area. Management is okay.  I work well with others so I do my job as I am told .  I get along with all my other co-workers we work as a team to get it done.  The hardest part of the job is working with some difficult customers. But most of them just want you to listen and try to help them with their dilemmas. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people.  I am a very people oriented person.

good,"co workers and managers alike were amicable. Some supervisors were overbearing however, I found my overall experience to be sufficient. If eligible I would establish employment with this company again."
good,"My honest opinion about working at Walmart is that it's a good first job, but can use some major improvements!! It was mainly  the employees that needed to be changed."
good,Management is very understanding and willing to work with you on your schedule. I am able to go to college full time and still work good hours at Walmart.
good,Walmart is a great place to work every morning I got up ready for work because I was glad I had a job to go to a work hard and I had a good crew to work with
good,"Can be very stressful to meet production requirements, but managers are great at helping as much as they can.  If you can make it past your 90 day probationary period, its easy."
good,the only hard part about working there was tat the customers can be very rude and you have to be very patient. and when you a part tie they play with your schedule so much.
good,Work your way to the top. You can develop rapidly. Walmart is dedicated to training their associates through their academy. Paid training to ensure you have the skills needed to perform your job.

good,Pack cookies off conveyor belt. Work is consistant and nonstop. Hard to keep up. I worked hear for 6 years. Left because of attendance. The best part about this job is the paid vacations and benifits. And watching all the cookies we make from scratch. The worst part of this job was packing quality cookies and keeping up with the speed.i learned how to pack at my own spee.d and to pack quality cookies. I also learned about the company and how the machined work. And thier different products

good,A typical day at Wal-mart Super center would be Productive and fast paced.I have learned great customer service to ensure each and every customer.My Co workers are all fun and energetic which we all have great team work and we work hard together to keep our Walmart successful.The most enjoyable part of the day is helping others find what they may have came in the store for.
good,A typical day would be talking with customers and slicing they're lunch meat. I was always very gratifying an I enjoyed making friends with some of the customers. Over all it was a good working experience and I learned a lot there.

good,this is a good job for everyone it teaches you to mulit task and work with people and customer i enjoyed working here they worked with school and the hardest part would have been to deal with management because they never gave straight directions but i was a cashier and sales
good,learning new thing everyday and still having fun doing it. enjoy working in different depart and meeting new people make people feel good about something they brought.
good,"Good place to work. Good pay. We strive to serve the customers with satisfaction. Good service. Friendly faces and warm smiles, great savings on all departments"
good,I would not recommend this job to any they not care abouthe employees they have they do not treat their employees the do not respect their employees they have 5 day policy for being absent from work they do not take doctor's note
good,There was no concern for the worker. Too big of a corporation to really care about its employees. Wouldn't take complaints seriously. Unless made by a customer.
good,Didnt like the co-workers they fought alot manger didnt understand i just had a baby and want to be home for her brith amd made me almost miss it he gave me four days off
good,"I work their for 14 years in the hopes of getting a job promotion to a department manager. I tried for the last 5 years and applied to every single opening. I even asked for department manager's help, and took everyone's advice. Not one promotion ever came my way. Then I found every single department I asked to help me was telling my salary managers false negative reviews of my job performance because the department managers were afraid that I was going to take their job. I had a salary manager tell me that when I was ""acting department manager"" for a week that handled it really well for how much my department trash talked me. There was loads of jealous and competitive because I learn really fast and could handle a department manager's job with breeze. There job really not hard. So i quick after 14 years because salary manager would not give me a change to the career department managers being jealous of how well I could handle their job when I asked to do it when they were not there."
good,Great company to work for but the management there is bad and can be stressful. They are rude and disrespectful at times and it’s no teamwork. They have a nice minimum wage pay though.
good,"Wal- mart can be an exciting & fun place to work for, however, store leaders need to be more engaged in their associates. Support & communicate change and make it a one on one interaction with certain associates who find it hard to understand the why' s behind the change. Follow up with your associates who have legitimate concerns. Walk side by side even when it is great, not only when there's opportunities. Celebrate the good and encourage associates, appreciate associates, drive a positive, trusting workforce."
good,"It was a good place to START working at in the beginning;however, you learn really quickly of the double standards the management and groups of people have."
good,This is a job for a high school student or retirement it was not a job for me and I don’t have anything else to say about it. So I’m sorry I feel like there should’ve been more sympathy for others than themselves
good,"Management did not care about their employees. Schedule is flexible, but not enough hours given, Pay was not worth all the work that you have to do. Working daily with rude customers."
good,"Hobbible mangement not enough pay to be dealing with rude people. Will bring outside people in a higher position before reconizing the employees that already in the store,"
good,In highschool they had me working even in school hours and proceeded to dock me and write me up knowing I was in school. The customer base was terrible and we got spat on and hit and there was not anything we could do in worry of losing our jobs.
good,"Walmart is really not a bad place to work if you really need a job. I was a cashier, so I had set hours and duties.  Some people that work in different departments are taken advantage of and made to work until all work is done and then do not get overtime."
good,Not family orientated lack of training drama in both departments not clean ran poorly can't miss work even if your in hospital or your child is sick they do not care about you or your family
good,"The company has an opportunity to pay wages that are comparable to what big corporations pay, but the workload and pay don't balance out. overall this company will have a job at all times."
good,The company has no type of understanding when you tell them you don't have baby sitter if you ask for more hours they never give them to you it just wasn't a good fit for me at the time that was my first job
good,"I work with great people, but the long shifts are horrible. I barely see my wife now. Lot of great costumers, very few rude customers and some are just a pain in the a**."
good,I worked here for almost 2 years. I think this Walmart was just had a bad manager to run it. I spent my time taking care of customers like Sam Walton did in 1962 but that's not how its being done any more at Walmart's. I quite working here to get my education.
good,"Love seeing all my customers every day and helping people throughout the day, loved working at the registers and keeping everything clean"
good,A typical day at work would be clocking in getting a Gemini and printer and seeing what pallets are ready to go outside. Finding a member of management to open the bay door so that the ICS associates can bring pallets of over stock merchandise outside to be binned in the trailers. Then go inside and start on picks and audits for the rest of the day.
good,pushing carts and stocking them is a good job but not in the summer. there was some health problems that occurred which lead me to the termination of the job. Wouldn't mind doing it again but not in the summer.
good,"I came in did my job, assisted customers. I was always treated like I was uneducated and inexperienced because of my age."
good,I was a college student so the late hours were tough. High stress and low pay.
good,The hardest part of the job was working in the domestics department and being able to get all the freight out by myself when I had about 6 or more pallets at a time
good,"I did maintenance work daily,pushed carts,helped customers,"
good,Selling memberships and meeting new people bad things are they lay you off at the end of season and you may not be called back to return to work
good,"It was a nice place to work, only down fall was them not being willing to move me to days."
good,Was a great environment when it came to meeting the customer's needs.
good,Working with customers in any way I find enjoyable. I've learned how to be a cashier. Most management is good. Good co-workers. Hardest part of job is inconsistant hours. Helping customer makes my day at walmart.
good,Being a Garden Associate during our down season with plants I was able to visit other departments and become certified for those areas as well. This helped the company because if there were people that did not show for their shifts I was called upon to fill the need. Managers would often call upon me because of my willingness to learn new things and my positive attitude and awesome customer service.
good,As cashier my is to greet the customer with a smile assist them the best that I can. The hard part of my job is when business is slow and you have to find something to do.
good,Decent pay but they dont give a beeeeep about you. Hours vary by demand. Took away good benefits. They make you work harder for those who choose to be lazy.
good,I had family issues shortly after I started working at the walmart company. They weren't very helpful or understanding of how serious the family issues was even though I kept explaining to them what was going on.
good,Walmart is a busy and high paced job. It’s has its good days as well as bad. Management could use some compassion. However getting hours was never an issue.
good,"No tengo beneficios, muy pocas horas de trabajo..."
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for i just wish workers were recognized for their work.  I'm not saying give us a plaque but a hand shake or ""great job"""
good,A very different work experience. Everyone gets along very well and they usually encourage working together and asking questions. Advancement is always an option.
good,"Lo que corresponde a jefaturas son muy clasistas y solo le dan el apoyo de crecimiento a los que estan en su argolla y no sacan a concurso los puestos lo hacen a dedo. "
good,coming in and restocking the shelves the going on with our daily duties as cashier for thr rest of the night then taking an hour lunch then back to work for the rest of the shift.
good,Es buena empresa para un rato  hay medio tiempo y completo
good,iworkedthere 2 time and it just did not get better there .they treat you like a child you have to ask to go to the restroom and they don't beleive  in family frist and some thing has to give
good,"While my almost decade of working at Walmart Canada brought some good memories, the managers in general were not great to work with.  I found myself everyday being told a million different things by every other manager but none of them would talk to each other before talking to us and therefore there was such a lack of communication within the management system."
good,"a typical day at work for me was working on the cash register and meeting new people on a daily basis. i enjoyed my days working as a cashier, i learned time management i also learned money management as well as customer service management. my workplace Environment was very diverse. i didnt have a hard part of working at walmart. and the most enjoyable part of working at walmart was meeting new people."
good,Don't get me wrong Walmart is a great company to work for but the Walmart i worked at was full of it. Everyone talked abut each other even the managers. They were lazy did't want to do their jobs and they were always worried about what another person had going on. There was no really hard part to it beside them talking all of your personal time and making it Walmart's time. Only thing i did like abut working there was the pay and 40 hrs every 2 weeks .
good,I love working at Walmart. Getting so many different types of people daily. Great co-workers the only hard part is when a customer is in a bad mood and trying to cheer them up.
good,"You would come in and no one would be there. "
good,"I am a cashier, so my typical day is standing behind a register cashing customers out, creating conversations, making sure that they have a great experience at Walmart considering I am the last person they see before exiting the store. I have learned a lot while working at Walmart. Some things I will take with me in the future and other things I will not. Management and co-workers are usually easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers whether they are young, middle aged or older."
good,I wasn't happy there at all they made a lot of promises but never made good on them and did not want to work with me when I was going to school and working there
good,A typical day was doing tons of different thing as son as the day beings. I did learn how to give great customer service and keep calm during rough situations and how to keep calm as well as with managers that were never fair and unwilling to help you in any way shape or form. The hardest part was not having a set schedule working odd hours or just never getting hours and the pay was so low. The enjoyable part of it was interacting with different kinds of people.
good,typical day at work some days are more busy then others if they move you arround to difrent departments .co-workers are great people to get along with and always willing to help others.the hardest part of the job is completeing work task when being moved arround to help in other areas.
good,"While working for Wal-mart isn't the worst in the world, I am thankful that I at least have a job. However I am working 40 hours a week and am completely refused full-time benefits. I am in search of a full-time job which includes benefits of a full-time employee. I learned that customer satisfaction greatly reflects on your performance, my coworkers are extremely funny and hard workers they make the work place a cheerful environment to be in. the hardest part of the job is when you are completely busy and nothing seems to slow down and the registers all break down, but the customers seem to help you stay at ease and make light of the most difficult situations you cannot control. the management on the other hand are hardly ever seen they don't really interact with the employees nor the customers."
good,this walmart is not up to par they don't care if you have young kids they don't take in consideration about u
good,"Hardest part was dealing with some of management, and the company itself. Co-workers were fun and always willing to help if needed. I was trained to be a Customer Service Manager. I enjoyed dealing with customers for the greater majority, and like every other retail out there, you have a chance of getting a pretty miserable customer. Usually not hard to deal with, but kind slows the flow."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart as a cashier was okay. Good place to learn customer service skills and patients. I enjoyed the rush hours to keep me busy, working at the customer service doing returns and money center cashing checks but the hardest part is they do not hire Full-Time unless you have worked there for almost a decade to cut down benefits. your job schedules is all sorts of hours, you never have a set schedule to work and you'll probably get about 4 hours a day. But you become kind of a family with your co-workers which helps makes the time go by a little quicker. I loved my supervisors they where the best always kept me on my toes."
good,"i learned how to move freight and rotate it, and i was even a leader of temp service people for a short period of time during the remodel of the store. my coworkers were great to work with made friends just had a health issue i had to resolve"
good,"All the Employees hours was given to them off the computer selection."
good,"your typical day at work varied on who was manager that day, if it was a good manager. one that would listen to problems, or wouldnt mind helping you with something your day would turn out well, which was RARE! managers there DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE. most of the co-workers talk about you behind your back. the hardest part of your day, managing 15 things on a list at once while trying to help customers and do your every day duties."
good,I have worked for this company for a very long time but they do not care about their employees like they use to.
good,they work u like a dog and dont pay u enough. i was hired as a cashier and was constantly moved to sales floor
good,"Really like working here,Good people here, They allways willing to help"
good,Working for Mr. Sam was a pleasre i really enjoyed the time at walmart. the only reason i left was to work at the hospital and make more money.
good,Building and repairing bicycles
good,"When I was referred to take a leave, store manager wouldn’t accept my sick pay as a way for me to still be able to feed my family and pay bills. Was basically told to suck it up and come back to work. I ended up having to quit my job and find a new job closer to home and less stressful. Now on EI."
good,Management had a lot of problems. The decisions that were made for person placement on the main sales floor was unreasonable. I enjoyed working with some of the coworkers but even then most co-workers had problems getring along.
good,"They should do away with the point system. It is Not realistic for a single parent household. There is room to advance, if some management would step out of the own shadow."
good,I would come in clock in and go to where ever the managers told me to go and I did whatever they wanted me to do.  We never went on any breaks that weren't ran by the managers first.  When it was time to clock out we made sure our area was clean and ready for the next person to take over.
good,"Walmart was a great place to work but the management was bad the hours where unless you worked upfront, but the other employees where nice they helped you if you needed anything."
good,A day at work is typically busy. Walmart provides multiple job to do per day depending on if a person would like to get out their comfort zone and become open minded to other job descriptions such as myself I try to help in all departments it helps me explore skills I’m strong in and skills I can work on.
good,"No longer family oriented, the company as a whole is undergoing constant changes. Instead of staffing properly associates and management are given more and more to do with less and less staff."
good,Worked there while I was in college. They worked with me around my classes but didn't give much free time. Always had to request off if I wanted a day off to do anything. They worked me as close to 40 hours as they could so they wouldn't have to give benefits.
good,I gave multiple managers a school/and non-profit(Curricular) schedule and still got penatilized for showing up late for work. They didnt have any compassion for my responibilites outside of work.
good,El ambiente es buenon la paga no tanto no exigen mucho y no tr apoyan para crecer laboralmente hablando no te apoyan para estudiar y las horas extras que te quedas no te las pagan .....
good,"It started out good, but management is lazy, they do not care about regular associates. There were MULTIPLE issues there that the whole “open door” policy, isn’t worth it."
good,As a cashier just remember that the customer is always right.Always smile and greet the people shopping remember always be nice and thoughtful. As a customer service rep. just apologize for whatever is wrong and ask if there is anything you can do to help
good,"walmart was a fun and friendly place to work.  Most of the time it felt llike your were workikng with family.  There were times when our equipment would fail to work but we were trained to do our job without the use of electronic devices.Our personalities and customer service skills were put to the test daily, but we always had our management team to back us up when needed."
good,As a company Walmart based upon Sam Walton was very good. The atmosphere is salaried managers vs hourly associates. Very strict availability requirements.
good,loved working with members.Every store is different but management need to have a no tolerance policy towards negativity and be more concerned when an employee comes to them with problems with other co workers
good,I believe in hard work and having a common ground and understanding on the working conditions working there. Respect each other on the sales floor and take care our people on the sales floor
good,"Busy workplace never boring gives you a chance to work in different departments and experience different departments. Long hours and hard work, but not enough pay for the accumulation of work"
good,"Wal-Mart is A Great place to Advance But The Con Is Their Manly point system, which is why they have a high turn over rate. The hours are long and mandatory but the pay makes you accept it"
good,When I was told When things slowed down at work because I was mangmet I get hours first that was not true I lived 40 mins from place an at times all I got was 4 hours they need not flow through on their word
good,working at Walmart was a great experience and working with great associates and management. its a great opportunity to work at Walmart because you can move up to a different department in the store.
good,"The managers lie to you about moving postitions throughout the store, and the managers are rude and inconsiderate about their workers. You’re not allowed to have any overtime or they make you cut it at the end of the week"
good,The new attendance policy is much smarter for the company but sucks for employees. The open door policy is a joke. I was wrongfully terminated and brought back 2 days later once due to the store manager fearing the repercussions his foolish department manager had caused. Starts at $10/hr tho so good min wage job!
good,Management are childish and start drama along with the associated other then that Wal-Mart is a fun place to work. Customers are your main priority getting them in and out fast
good,Hard to deal with all the people.. Occasionally we got free cake. Cashiers are treated like the bottom of the barrole.  WE handle all the money and deal with the people but we are unappreciated.
good,"Most Managers were rude , csms were rude not all but most , never got my breaks , when i was ready to clock out and shut down my register cause my shift was over csm would act stupid and send more customers over"
good,"This is by far the worst company to work for. Pay is not good for what you have to deal with. You cant move up unless your ""friends"" with the managers.  They say one thing and do another. Its just not good foe your health."
good,"It is really unfortunate to work with people who hate what they do. The management would fire anyone who wasn't happy or in my case, ""doodling"". If you enjoy standing still for long periods of time then this job is for you."
good,I didn't mind the actual job I was required to do. The management is very careless and so are many of the employees. I feel I did not get paid enough for everything they made us do. I did my job plus many others.
good,I started as a regular photo lab associate and worked my way into management very quickly. I loved my job and clients. I looked forward  to going in everyday. I didn't like getting hours cut or the constant turnover but i received many useful skills that I apply to life daily.
good,Working for them was not easy sometimes. Management was not that great. The hours were ok. Most of the people who I worked with were great. The management would not listen to the associate concerns.
good,"Stocker,warehouse,responsibility,honesty,punctuality"
good,"Walmart is great place to work. The job it self is nice ,your hours are consitant and in some case you many even get more than normal . If you don't and would like more you can add them to your schedule yourself ."
good,Overall it was a good company to work for.  I would work for this company again.  I did enjoy my time with this company. The workerand customers were awesome.
good,What you to do your job and someone else job. Should give out more job advances to employees that has really been a good work. Don't work there employees as if there are the only people they have to do the work.
good,"Work was good, coworkers were okay, management sucked. Typical work day was doing whatever management had that day which was usually stocking even though the job description did not include that."
good,I was my first job. They didnt like to keep the place clean. The manager was always rude. No benefits no raise.Work long hours with no good pay. I never had a social life always working.
good,While you were working you were almost always in a different part of the store. You were able to learn all types of jobs if you were willing to help out. Management was always helping out on the sales floor. Your co-workers would help whenever they were able too. Hardest part of the job would be when the customers were always yelling at you about something that was beyond your control. The enjoyable part of the job was hearing all the stories the customers would tell you while they were checking out.
good,Wal-Mart is a good place to work but management needs to do a better job with the associates and try and be more understanding of people needs.
good,was good working with nice people but my hours were not so good because sometimes i had to work 2 hours only because work was slow and i lived too far for low houers
good,Need more hours. New schedule every week. Managers who work do not get the props. This place is big and has many open department. Good place to work more than one department.
good,I learned to work in team work. How Walmart runs. Keeping it stocked. This job required many different assignments which I had no problem performing.
good,I really liked dealing with the children and taking care of them. The management was o.k. As far as my co-workers they worked well with the children.
good,I was doing upper level management tasks and wouldn't get the position or the pay.  I had to come in and set mods for new merchandise stock new merchandise give tasks to other sales associates and make sure the back room was cleaned and organized to the best of my ability.
good,"I had to quit because I was not allowed to switch my hours. My need to switch my new schedule was because my husband is military and HIS schedule changed. Therefore my need to rearrange my shift was neccessary. But due to being a fairly new associate, I did not have the go ahead to do so. And O was told that they would have to let me go. Dissappointing because as a Veteran it was my first job post Seperation."
good,I really liked the customers and not so much the management.
good,"Wal-Mart is good as a first job, or as a very last resort. My experience Management was HORRIBLE, the employers didn't care and most of all If you want to work with customer service then this is a job for you."
good,"GCA was just a cleaning job, we did not do anything else except that. I liked that the supervisor that I had was straight to the point and he got work done when it was time for it to get done, he did not procrastinate. He had plans and he stuck to them"
good,Sufficient work place. Need to be more strict on employee hygiene when in the face of the company.
good,"During a typical day I would help hundreds of customers in Lawn and Garden load their cars with their needs such as mulch and soil, along with plants, and materials for their pools.  I learned a lot while being there such as how to handle a high demand of peoples needs and how to multi task efficiently.  The management at Wal-Mart was very entertaining with working three on two off each member of management in my department would always have different visions of what they expected making the job challenging at times.   My co-workers were great and always willing to help and go out of the way for one another.  The hardest part of my job was the constant changing minds of management which would make projects harder when they couldn't agree on an idea.  The most enjoyable part of my job was no two days were the same and I got to always work with people getting to help them always made my day!"
good,Great temporary place to work. The position is always lively and the customers and associates all relate and work well with one another. 
good,Really none of the above can do this job any good. They promise certain people that they where perfect for management and they don't get that position.
good,"Co workers great, Learned a lot of retail experience, Management was not great, Hardest part was management, Didn't really enjoy much of the job, Typical day at work."
good,"A typical work day was to clock in, check sells from the day before, emails, mods that needed to be reset, and anything new that was changing for the department. It was always a pleasure to have to regular customers come in daily. There was always one to two people that was just keep the day going by trying to get over. Being the manager of the department and the customer didn't want to deal with me I would always satisfy them by getting my manager. There were even times that I got phone calls on my day off to ask me questions about certain things. Having to do can orders and they had to be in at least 24 hrs ahead of time if it was a simple one, if I couldn't do it myself I would ask a cake decorator to do it. When needed help in the deli I would go help out over in that department. I was with this company for six years and worked at the same store so knew the store like that back of my hand so I could help out wherever I was needed. The highlight of my day every day that I worked is when I could send a customer off happy because they got what they came in the store for plus more and received great service."
good,The customers and co-workers are great. The pay is ridiculous and the assistant managers and store managers have their own agenda which does not include the average worker. It's a good place to get you foot into the retail door but I would not recommend staying too long.
good,"I learned alot of my client... The management are very poor ,my co worker is very nice ,hardest part is none , enjoyable part when my client are happy w/ my work."
good,Use to be a good place to work for because they priorities families.
good,loved customers
good,It was a great place to work but if you are hired part time their is no advancement to become full time. That means if you are not full time then you can not get all the good benifits such as 401K.
good,"easy going job, management wasn't very helpful, and there wasn't a set schedule so I wasn't able to spend consistent time with my son"
good,"Personally the company as a whole has a lot of good things, but when it cause to be family oriented and a caring company to family values they suck! There Medical benefits suck! The only thing I can say that is good was there stock purchase plan and retirement option or 401!"
good,It wasn’t all bad.   The people were stuck up and only looked out for them selves.  I stuck to my self and did my work.  I helped customers find the things they need and reach high shelf’s to retrieve what they wanted.
good,As a manager they allow people to steal products and the next day you are forced to refund the money to the thief. No I'd no problem you can get up to 50.00 just grab a item walk up customer support bam 50.00.. policy changes needed
good,They don't care about there employees. They work us to death and expect us to do stuff that's not in our job code. They talk crazy to us in front of the customers.
good,Helping the customers and thanking them for shopping at Walmart . Make sure that they leave with a great experience and hoping that they will return to shop again
good,"The associates I worked with became family in a few short weeks, as well as the department managers. They really cared for each other and taught me everything I needed to know, in a way that will always stay with me in future endeavors."
good,i enjoyed working  there but somethings was not as good as they say on the commercial like good benefits.you do not get benefits unless you are their for a year or full time and the work schedule are not flexible.The pay was good but they did not give enough hours.My problem was management very unfair but pay was good.
good,Compañía muy competitiva pero con pocas oportunidades de crecimiento en PUERTO RICO
good,"Bad management, no communication or respect. Walmart was not a bad place to work for. Walmart was the first retail job I worked. Walmart gave me the opportunity to become a great customer service representative"
good,I came down with walking pnemonia and they fired me it wasnt anypros or cons or nothing really good about it because it was a neutral job. Couldnt talk to many co workers.
good,For the years I was there I was promoted at least once every year or close to and I was promoted 3 times with in 3 and a half years.Wal-Mart needs a union now it's has become a bad place to work and not understanding at all!
good,"Es un trabajo estable y monótono, es entretenido y hay buen compañerismo, el sueldo no es bueno al principio a menos que ya tengas muchos años, el horario no es de mi agrado, pero tiene flexibilidad para poder estudiar."
good,"it can be stressful, but fun to be there most day. I take care of the self check and clean. i enjoy be around people. Walmart has been good to me for three years."
good,"Walmart started off as a great job until the switch of departments and shortage of hours . As one of the hardest workers , I expected more hours than I received. I contacted several managers but they all gave me the run around"
good,"Left not happy, Worked 2 years y until the working condition became too stressful. Too many bosses, each telling me how to water flowers. Last bosses wanted flowers to be watered by a bucket, impossible. since I left hoses are provided."
good,"Company culture going through much change. Care and concern for management and hourly associates has diminished over the past several years. Life work balance is way ""out"" of balance."
good,"I was unable to change shifts after working over nights.  you were aced on a island  help was sometimes unavailable. "
good,Work is work have no real complaints about the job schedule could have been better. The environment was not bad. Could have been more understanding!!!
good,i used to be a regular deli employee. they used to make me do majority of the work and let the people that worked there longer than me just sit back and relax.
good,"Walmart was great to work at, at first. As the weeks went by it was just awful and unprofessional and honestly the employees such as the managers were often rude and racist."
good,trabalhava mais na area de recebimento e expdcao segunda a sabado domingo hora extra
good,A typical day of work at this walmart was awful. The employees above cashiers never worked to their full potential to help them with their issues. The management wasn't really all that great either when it came to helping employees and customers.
good,I would love to work back with them if they give me 40hrs a week like I was getting when I first started. And I would like at least 12.50hr. And give me a fixed schedule
good,Liked working here except for when I needed help I had to wait a significant amount of time before a manager came to assist sometimes they wouldn’t come at all. Customers are normally friendly
good,"Era um puxado,as vezes compensava os outros."
good,Managers are always pushing employees to do stuff that they are not familiar with. Managers have bad attitudes when they are needed by an employee. I would not recommend working for this company they are corrupted and only the worst employees are promoted into management.
good,"They do not treat their employees very well. Management had poor communication skills, kind of felt like you had to be related to a manager/support manager to fit in and get treated right."
good,"Hard work but have to do what they need done, very poor management, no raises, no paid time off and short breaks. Feels like competition with managers."
good,"Working for WALMART 15 years all I can say is it has changed a lot. I miss when I first started. Things were much better, I don’t think Wal-Mart promotes that work life balance."
good,i hated working there. it was a waste of time and there was no opportunity to advance. also the pay was really bad for the amount of work they expected you to do.
good,"-Management didn't know how to operate correctly"
good,"I learned customer service job operation,forklift trained,I have held and done many things in my time for Walmart to many to list from truck unloaded to stockman"
good,I had a nice time Stocking the clean shelves for the Walmart in Eugene off of Green Acres Road. Great team and people. Everyone at the walmart I worked for loved me working here. :-)
good,the employes are treated like we were nothing  here. you cant make any mistakes at all other wise you get in trouble. worse place to work for all togther. the benifits are really  good depending on how long you have worked for the company.
good,"good place for a student or for someone that wants a second job, not enough to make a living and no benefits that would make you want to have a carrer there"
good,"Tienen mal ambiente de trabajo , no se preocupan por el empleado."
good,Wal-Mart like any where else can be very busy and overwhelming. But it is very exciting to work along good people and to be able to serve my community very proudly.
good,"It was low stress as I was a cashier. But the hours were more than 40 a week, even though they kept me as part-time."
good,"Malgré les parfois longues journées de travail, l'ambiance était toujours plaisante. Les employées sont chaleureux"
good,Son muy estrictamente con el personal sobre su seguridad
good,lots of dirty work conditions and homeless outside. minimum wage  for a very labor intensive job. management is quite poor and there is no drive to improve the workplace.
good,Managers often walk around the store and check up on the Associates progress in their area which is not a bad thing but when you work alone with 7 pallets in a below zero freezer you slow down and when your too slow you get written up so managers can easily push you into a corner with too much work and basically force you out the door. It happened to me.
good,The management aren't very good there. They act like they care about you but deep down they are only for their favorites. One of the hardest things about my job was seeing people not have enough money to buy all of their groceries and when they had to put them back.
good,I really don't wanna say anything bad I was fired for breaking a window on accident. Everything else it was a great job fast paced which I love. .....
good,Working at walmart was nice for me. I like the experience but  they do have alot of rules that can be easly be broken. But over all it a vibrant environment.
good,i learned alot how to stock shelves broke my foot got fired it was fun nice people got good breaks pay was decent bosses where ok to work with i met some cool people.
good,"Mornings starts out slow, cleaning my area, trained customer how to use the Self Check Out Registers. CSM(Customer Service Manager) loved it , working with customers , solving problems for them. The hardest job I had at walmart was working in meat department, down stacking 3-6 pallets of meat and placing in the bins, boxes were very heavy."
good,"I was a cashier at wal-mart. As an employee I felt we were being watched like hawks. I would price match for customers, then get called to the back getting accused of price matching for my friends and family, when it was advertised on television and in the papers. There were no benefits only for full time employees. Only 4 cashiers were full time. all the others were part time. There were no over time, if you were over your hours. you would get sent home or take a longer lunch break."
good,"I worked as a Pharmacy Technician for almost a year. It is very stressful, and the Pharmacy Manager, or Pharmacist do not back you up. They do not encourage you to learn more, or try to get your PTCB license."
good,Different rule per the store managers.But I gain a lot of great thing from this company. Hope for better experience and great opportunity when I move from Orangeburg.
good,"Good benifits. Health and vision. Dental not so much. Good bonus at times. Pay is good. Walmart is all about you taking the next step to farther your career  "
good,A typical day at work consisted of assisting customers and restocking shelfs. I learned customer service skills and how to balance a register. The hardest part about my job was when customers price matched items to prices from other stores.
good,"Overall typical customer service job. You take the good with the bad. And as most jobs, you do a good job and they give you someone else's job as well. I personally enjoyed being a cashier even when the customer was having a bad day."
good,"My experience with this company was almost a year long of torture and bullying from my older coworkers, and I did not stand for it so I left the job. I worked hard everyday to get all of my daily tasks done, and I still got looked down on. In regards, I learned how to leave an unhappy environment, and how no matter how hard you work, sometimes people just wont appreciate you."
good,"Typically a good place to work, fun and fast pace."
good,THey work the good workers to death. THe bad workers get away with it but as long as I got paid I ignored it until I got injured and was expected to still work.
good,what I do feel is that this should NOT  be a required field!! I am pressed for time and need to finish my application before work. I will never use indeed again. big mistake
good,"Não perguntam se pode fazer hora extra, apenas não fecham seu caixa."
good,Great people Also great customers clean enviroment poor management they have no sympthy for anyone even having doctors excuse still count against you! associates always were smiling at one another drama free work enviroment
good,The biggest problem working at Walmart and maybe the only problem os management other than that the job wasnt that bad i worked with alot of good people's i liked doing my job but management pushed me 2 far
good,"Dinamica pouco agradavel.."
good,"Did not seem like a bad company. I just happen to work at a bad location. The Riverdale, NJ location is racist, the managers are liars and they are very nasty."
good,"The location I worked had poor management from CMS to ZMS they all played favoritism, and were inconstant with directions. Employees practiced poor work habits and productivity was below average"
good,"was a great place to work at one time, until unfair treatment. good customer relations great working there until things changed, managers were stupid and dumb ! no fair evaluations"
good,Bad management schedules are really bad and you will never have a social life i will never work for another wal mart again.
good,The pay and hours were alright . tried to move up but the managers there werent very good .  i would handle all the electronics there . help customers out and train new people. Never got paid to do what i did so i left .
good,The work was hard and the pay was decent.  I enjoyed my co-workers very much and it was a fun job while I was there.  I worked there for almost a year and left because the hours were not feasible for my family.  I would still be working there if they offered set hours but we were required to work all over the place and it interfered with my time with my family.
good,Good place to make connections. Management shows no appreciation with no room for growth. worked at the mississauga location and management gives you false hopes of growing with the company but do not actually help you move up.
good,"The people that were on my team were very genuine, kinda, and humble. The work was sometimes hard and other times confusing. Promotion would seem to be based on favoritism sometimes, although those who did stand out would be rewarded."
good,"A normal day ash a cashier, you think it would be easy, but not at Walmart. You are constantly dealing with managers expecting you to do the work of 5 other cashiers, while pushing credit cards and handling unruly customers, piled on to making sure no one in your line or self-check is stealing. Its a lot to handle. Some days not even your higher ups know whats going on with the front end, it can be mass chaos, but most days I do enjoy my job. The other associates are a joy to work with, and there are days where you meet the customers that make working there just so much better. If you do work for them, don't expect bonuses for about 9 months, and don't expect any type of benefit for about a year."
good,"Long lines, Angry people. People dress like bums. Most of the people that work there are stupid. Cashiers do not work hard and Management is hard to help when needed,"
good,"It's a ok company need better pay scale, The people i work with in my Department are like family and they are fun to work with."
good,"sem muitas chaces de crescer na empresa, mais uma boa harmonia entre os colaboradores se respeitam sabendo os seus devidos lugares e cargos"
good,"It was a part time job. We were not allowed to speak. Learned how to work in a pharmacy, management was hard to deal with. co-workers were nice. Hard to get a good pay check.  working was enjoyable."
good,I am glad for the experience that I have obtained while being an employee of Walmart. I am glad that I learned to stick to what you know to get through some trying times. I have gained a lot of friends and also a lot of business contacts. Walmart taught me that if I work hard in the end the hard work will pay off for me.
good,A cashier is a good job and you learn people skills its a great job for a college student just something I don't see myself doing years and years from now.
good,"My job is very easy I have learned how to do bill pay,cash checks,excellent customer services,send money and etc.The hardest part of my job is working with lazy people.The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help people."
good,Working at Walmart was a new experience for me. I do not suggest anyone who is in college to work for them. They do not like to work around your  school schedule.
good,".help customers/ take orders"
good,"While I enjoyed working with my co worker and serving customers I had some difficulty with management. I did not feel that management wanted to invest any effort on there employees. I was a cashier most of my time there. I would run register, the service desk and do some stocking of shelves."
good,"I checked out customers as they came to my line. I would make sure they got the better prices. Make sure all merchandise is in an eye catching way. Handle money,"
good,managers treat you like dogs and you get terrible hours and a terrible pay for the amount of work you do.
good,I delivered news papers 7 days a week  had the rest of the day free and made good money
good,I clock in at 3:00 A.M every morning. I would find a tellzone get my keys that were needed to open the doors to let the vedors in and gain acess to their stuff. Make cardboard bales at the baler. I would go to lunch around 9. Come back and clean my area. Finish any food claims that are left. Go to the office a hour before my shift was over and file paperwork and enter it into the system.
good,I don't like how they don't work with my school schedule or they just take you off the schedule with out notice
good,All in all the Wal-Mart store chain isn't such a bad place to work. The only problem is when certain store manager's get greedy and keep their store understaffed to the point where each person does the work of six employees.
good,"Meeting the needs of the customer. Ringing orders, bagging sold items, and overall customer service. I learned to find my voice when asked for input on the quality of service this job provided to a wide customer base. The management team often had hidden addenda's, only to look out for themselves. Co-workers were often there one day and gone the next, leaving a huge turn-over for the company. Short staffing was often the hardest part of the job, especially during heavy traffic months. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to and getting to know the regular customer base."
good,"It is a great experience working for walmart and being exposed to all sorts of departments, customer, and employees."
good,Buen ambiente laboral. Con orientacion al desarrollo personal en el area de logistica
good,"Typical day is pretty busy . Usually I'm at the express line and that's 20 items or less and then we have our self checkouts so that customers can ring up items on there own with our supervision . Most of the managers are pretty cool , very friendly , and outgoing . My co workers some are pleasant and some are not . We all have all our different personalities . There is nothing hard about the job to me it's just having to deal with rude impatient customers on a daily . The most enjoyable part is making the customers smile a bit before they leave because you never really know what anyone else is going through."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be, taking care of customers answer any questions or concerns they might have and bring it to the store managers attention. customers are always right, i believe if it wasn't for the customers i wouldn't have a job customers pay my bills."
good,"As a sales associate i did everything from managing inventory, organizing product on the store floor, encouraging customers to buy a product, helping them find what they're looking for, and ultimately ringing them up at the cash register."
good,"I have worked for Walmart now going on 3 years.... I loved Walmart and never had complaints until I transferred to my new store... They have me in grocery and I am only able to work 20 hrs a week because I am a full time student taking 15 credit hrs... One thing! I am rating the Grocery department... It is very demanding and what makes it worse is you have over 5 managers that act like sharks constantly putting you on new tasks for the most part of your day... When they tell you to do something, you better get on it fast and work, or they will start to eyeball you... Most of the time, I have little time to slack off... Bathroom breaks, sitting breaks, ect.... you get the point... If you work for Walmart, stay out of grocery because you will have more than one boss that will be setting you to a task every 30 min to an hour... The worst part about the position I am in is that  they time me... When they give me a task, they say "" you have 20 min to complete this task"". Half the time I think they are joking, but thy are not... I learned this the hard way... It is not a chill job... Everyday I have to work hard for them or risk getting a warning for not being up to pare... It is really hard sometimes, even when I am at full speed, and doing great, no one notices my hard work to say ""good job""...I think they are targeting me because I made school my first priority and made Walmart second due to my availability.... they tell me that sense I have experience from my other job that I should work faster and better than the other two guys in my department... They tell me that they expect"
good,"I wasn't getting enough hours.  Managers were quite rude to employees. It had decent pay.  I learned how to read the price tag numbers and how they stock.  The job was fairly easy and the work shift went by fast.  Co-workers were mostly decent, some were also quite rude thinking that no one can work as well as they do."
good,"A typical day involves arguments within my department over separation of duties when they are not clearly defined for us. Also being called up to the front registers is a daily occurrence. My co-workers are generally helpful, but sometimes can be very rude and lazy. The hardest part of the job is remaining calm with your managers and co workers arguing around you."
good,"Bar tending can be very fun and a good money maker."
good,not a good company to work with. They dont care if you get hurt. get mad if taking time off.
good,Had to stock while trying to take of customers. That wal-mert is very difficult to work for. there is alot of poltics. Reminds alot of high school. 
good,I am very grateful for the temporary position they offered me.
good,"In the beginning, I enjoyed going to work. I was greeted with smiling faces. I would clock in, and begin my day. I would pull carts of product out to the sales floor restock my outs, and adding any new items as needed."
good,the job was really not hard but it was fast pace sometimes and i liked that i like to work hard it makes the time go faster. i waited on costomers and baged there items and answered any quistions they may have
good,Wal-Mart is a decent company to work for. They just need to hire people for management of stores that know what in going on. And management that knows how to communicate
good,Needed some better management teams that work with overall coverage of service floor. The schedules could of kept employees from quitting by finding out what they wanted to work and covering the service floor....
good,pay is LOW. alot of coustomer abuse with no management support.
good,"loved my job and what i did was very good at it, my cashiers loved me.. i was their superior but they liked me no matter what i had them do.. we were all very reasonable.."
good,What I learned from working at Wal-Mart was that their is many companies out there who strive to be the best not only for their clients/customers but for the people who put themselves out there to help those goals be met. Wal-Mart was defenetly not one of those companies.
good,working in a timely manner. learned how to sort and ship. my co-workers was easy to work with. the hardest part was getting tere.
good,"always fun,we always learned to get alone. the management was cool, and the hardest part of the job was getting there."
good,Walmart would be a nice place to work if management was all on the same page and you didn't have 5 different manger telling you what to do and end up on the wrong side with one because of lack of communication skills.
good,"A typical day would start with zoning my area, checking for pricing errors, stolen goods packaging, and things needing to be sent to claims. My main job was to sell licensing for hunting, fishing, and recreational areas for the State of Kansas. My direct manager was very knowledgeable about his department and the company in general. He worked very hard towards training me for a management position. Getting to know co-workers is difficult in a job that has a high turn over, and employer expectations are unrealistic and unobtainable. I greatly enjoyed the opportunity to learn multiple departments in my store and participate in special projects."
good,a typical day at work is overworking past break time. co workers never help each other the best part of the job is cashiering helping people and when its busy its challaging and the worst part of the job is the mangers the raceist and not enuff pay.
good,"A typical day at Walmart is not so bad"
good,"Stay being a customer. The point system suck, they think people never get sick or the car break down. Picks and chooses who to help. Manager looking out for their own friends and not help all associate's."
good,"It's time for a change, in order for me to progress, the company is not the same anymore, and they are getting rid of long term associate. In order to get a vacation I have to build it up throughout the year, plus all the new associate they hire will get the minimum wages and I get nothing even though I make above that amounti"
good,"Some of the ASMs need to be replaced "
good,learn how to work at a fast pace bag merchandise properly clean my area and made sure it was stocked with bags at end of shift. communicate with customers and co workers
good,Ok job just was very stressful. One supervisor would tell you One thing then another would tell you something else then to find out is all over a power struggle.then their where times when you would they would take cashier
good,Was asked to learn other areas and efficiently get work done. When customers would ask questions management tasked us with solving them quickly to get the store tasks done quickly without delay. Work was to be first and then customers and then family.
good,With the new program they are running there is no communication with management on what is actually the correct way to do things. I was constantly correcting management on practices and policies that they told me.
good,The job is very stressful with very little management support. My coworkers were very outgoing and made the job tolerable. I personally left the position because I could not get full time days and was consistently put on afternoon shift.
good,"Over the last few years i have noticed Walmart eliminating jobs in favor of machines. More currently they have been combining jobs together to reduce staffing. In the past you might have been responsible for one department while now you would be responsible for two or three at a time. "
good,"Work here was okay. Pay was okay the job was chill, and the raises were ok too. it was always busy the hardest was pulling the skids and also carrying big boxes."
good,Corporate kept on increasing our orders and there was no way for us to accomplish the orders. I worked there for about 4 months and the management changed 4 or 5 times. There were occasional times when I was treated like  a manager. Customers got mad at us even though there was nothing we could do to solve problems.
good,"Management at walmart sucks, they want everything done but don’t want to do the work so they make the peons do it and we just don’t get the pay we deserve."
good,"A typical day consisted of the same routine, opening, setting up, restocking and customer service. I learned what I was supposed to do quickly and tried to do more than what was asked although I felt a bit used."
good,"I've    learned a lot and am ready for new challenges  and to meet "
good,To much drama management gets away with whatever they want...walmart doesnt care about their emlployees i wpuld never want to work there again it was just a paycheck
good,"This was a good job if you just need to get your bills paid. Not really a place with too many benefits, atleast not when i was there. If you enjoy working face to face with customers, then this is a great place for you. I loved being able to provide above and beyond service for people. The work culture was very similar to a highschool. But i wasnt there to make friends. i wanted to be the best at my job and eventually i was able to become top csr. My manager at the time though was very two-faced. She wanted you to succeed in your face, but she didnt keep confidential conversations from you to her confidential. i would overhear her saying them to other of the team members about other peoples personal lives. The hardest part of my job was enduring the gossip in the work place. Not about myself personally but about my co-workers.i was glad this was only a temporary job."
good,I just wouldn’t work at Pittsburg California Walmart until they update everything from the floor to the back room so associates to management they need some in proving
good,It was a good job it no infrastructue management was lazy poor working conditions poor pay for the work required nice co-workers paid every 2 weeks didn't like it
good,the culture at walmart isnt the best. if your lookin for a company that will care about your work life balance than this is not hte place for you. if you just need a job to get by and can do remidial work than go ahead
good,It was an easy job but sometimes the customers can get to you with there attitudes and it makes it a little stressful they would some times yell at you for no reason and take out there bad days on you
good,"Low pay, no benefits, fast paced, no room for advancement. Wouldn't reccomend this job to anyone trying to make a living. Maybe high school kids or someone wanting very part time."
good,the management was quite flexible and helped to advance in work place.the work culture was great with fun colleagues that made working really fun. the timings and schedule have scope for improvement.
good,"I was too young at the time to understand how to manage a job. But Wal Mart taught me a lot. Had to be let go since I had strep throat and was advised to not be around anyone. I was too late to bring in my note. Other than that, great people, simple tasks, break rooms were okay, restrooms always clean, basic uniforms, great hours if looking for decent checks."
good,"Poucas oportunidades, muito aprendizado , empresa boa porém mau gerenciada , funcionários com pouco treinamento"
good,Good people working hard for not enough pay. Your fellow workers become your family. I worked for Walmart in 2 locations for a total of 4 years. I am a faithful customer as well. They do give alot back to the community and if you work full time you do get limited medical coverage.
good,"Por se tratar de uma multinacional, espera-se que haja oportunidades de crescimento e desenvolvimento, entretanto o caminho para chegar mais longe e para atingir uma promoção é muito árduo, dependendo muito além da capacidade profissional do empregado, mas principalmente do relacionamento e contato que ele tem com aqueles que podem promovê-lo."
good,"Walmart for me was a very temporary position that I chose to work over several years during holiday seasons. I found the customer interaction to be very enjoyable, but the inconsistency of hours and shifts was difficult to manage."
good,Keeping your department stocked and zoned is priority. Greet every customer with a smile and offer assistance keeps them coming back. You should know where to find the most ask about merchandise to provide the customer with the best shopping experience.
good,I really liked working there but it is always one person on the slicer in the deli. Duties should be rotated so that the staff can accommodate every task at hand.
good,"Many of the associates are hiding in backroom or doesnt do anything but taking breaks or hiding behind shelfs in toys deopartment. The workload was very uneven, many times no restiocking was doen at the eveningso you had to do that in morning shift at the same time manage customers."
good,"on your feet constantly, have to watch the whole store pretty much. its Walmart. i was nice to help customers though because i seemed to be the only one helping them."
good,"I liked this job. It was very easy, it was rewarding when you caught someone stealing, good pay for little work. They often had me work over night to help the cashiers. The coworkers were very friendly and helpful. If you have good customer service skills Id recommend working here. I was fired because I missed too many days for a medical reason and they didn't accept my doctors notes for days excused."
good,"Very good experience, flexible hours to work, they adjust the sxhedule to your studies but difficult growing opportunities and hours vary too much from week to week. Also very bad personal life and work balance."
good,"Fast paced and stressful. Had a manager who used foul language all the time and screamed at people. Most of the employees were stressed all the time due to this. The work was okay, but could become stressful if the customers were cranky."
good,"If you keep to yourself and are about your money over the drama you will be very successful at this store. You get in, work, listen to Managment, offer help out in diffrent departments and stay busy during your shift and you will be left alone and respected by co workers and management."
good,I have worked as a cashier at Walmart for one year now. I enjoy it of course but its time for me to further in my career. I would also like to make more money than I am currently making at Walmart.
good,Great people work there management needs to perk it up a bit not very friendly make you feel like you are bothering them if you ask them to help you with a problem
good,"Walmart as a company is not bad, but the location I was working was from managers to the staff they chose. The store is run on favoritism, not merit. Although they have great benefits."
good,Gerência incompetente  que não sabe separar vida pessoal e profissional.
good,i worked produce and i learned everthing in less than a week but things started to take a turn when all the managers started feuding. which called me to not return to work until i had received a call which never came so i never was able to return to my job which stills has me on the schedule i feel i was tricked out of my job.
good,"If you're a good people person, you get to develop friendships with coworkers and build rapport with customers.  I've got a stable of customers who come in to specifically talk to me and have me work with them.  It's a high-stress, low paying job and you don't get holiday pay if you work a holiday.  The sole exception is Christmas when the entire company's shut down for a little more than 24 hours."
good,Good place to work for college for someone that does have a life. Walmart is no longer a family orientated company. The want too much out of their associates without the pay.
good,"Management was horrible, personnel things she runs the show. If you kiss enough rear then you'll make it far! Job wasn't difficult physically just draining"
good,They were very rude and annoying and they always had something to say about anything you do . Management was very rude and they don’t appreciate their employees
good,"a typical day at work consists of doing your regular duties around of inconsistent redirectives and management changes.  You come in and not always work where you are assigned.  In the middle of a project you are call away to help in a different area be cause of  an absent employee.  Managers and supervisors still demand the work that you are expected to do gets done.   This is done with out doing any overtime.      Most managers may help but usually there is not enough employees to the work and lessor managers end up work 2-3 hours overtime.  "
good,I was a department manager in Electronics department and was always felt insecure and demeaned by my management team. I am a hard worker and have felt over the last of my 15 years with the company that they were trying to get rid of all the full time associates that had been there for years to make room for part time kids they did not have to pay as much or give the hours to. The first 7 years i worked there was so different very family oriented and great benefits to the employees
good,We were always behind for under staffing /trucks where late/did'nt always use the staff we had well enough to complete the managers expectations.When the New Store Manager Brought In His People Everything Went Sideways!!!
good,They have a tendency to let people go before 90 days. But not alot is asked of u. It's kinda strick but was kinda fun. I would work here again but they never really went with what I told them I could do when it comes to time. Like I tell them I could work mornings and they would put me in afternoons.
good,"Loved my job but my family time was not enough wish they would have considered that more and gave me a shift change like I wanted ,other than that it was a good job"
good,Walmart has its ups and downs. The management is not good at all they talk down to you like your a child. They pretty much refuse to let you move up in your career.
good,"A typical work day ...lots of walking, 4 to 6 miles a day. Most management are basically bullies, most new hires dont care about working just playing on thier phone all day. So your pretty much a babysitter. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day without breaks. the most enjoyable part is meeting new people and the few kind courteous customers that you deal with."
good,Poor Mannagement and way too much back stabbing and gossip. Its always an issue dealing with scheduling and work hours. The adults continuously acts like children.
good,When I started working here the store was brand new. Store manager was new to it all and the store was a mess they had to do a complete clean up shortly after the 1st year. But I had work at other more established Walmart and they were not that bad.
good,"The problem I had with Wal-Mart was management and racism in the workplace. I'm a white young male, Wal-Mart accepts everyone which is good but during my time there I worked with a lot of middle eastern individuals and managers who seemed to have problems with the workers that were white but never of their own race. Was very annoying and made coming to work seem like a nightmare."
good,The  management didn’t care about medical issues or anything serious. Never gave overtime. Always putting their favorites before the other workers who actually did their job.
good,It isn’t like it was a hard job. Well sometimes yes it was but it was a passable. It was ok hours and good pay. But the hours were really really jot flexible.
good,tiene buenos turnos.en lo personal trabaje muy tranquila con un buen grupo de trabajo y jefes.
good,it was a fun medium paced job to have at first but when the mangement sits around and doesnt help anyone with what they want done and just except people to get things done when half the time we dont even know what to do
good,"The fast pace that they expect of you is a little unattainable, but the people have always been the best part of the job."
good,"It was exactly what I'd expected. A demanding, low paying first job fresh out of high school that required little to no skill. They give a lot of hours but service is slow and and there isn't much direction. The worst thing is probably being left to deal with belligerent customers and the overall grey atmosphere. But it's a decent place to gain work experience. Good for outgoing and friendly people."
good,"Walmart would be a fantastic job for high school and singles with no children. Due to there schedule policy your work days very weekly, never having same days off not even together. You will be scheduled nights and days in the same week with days off as much as 7 days apart. With children it makes it extremely difficult to find daycare to accommodate.  You may be hired out for a particular department but will float all over the store making it difficult to receive quality training.  The lack of training is Walmart's biggest problem with keeping employees."
good,Walmart will hire many people. They do not keep employees because  of how they treat their employees which is not well. The culture of Walmart is not much opportunity to advance unless you know the right people. Over all not a great place to work if you would like to be treated like a human being and not a robot.
good,i disliked working there and the management didn't care for the lower employees they treated them very badly. No benefits were actually given at the time of employment.
good,I enjoyed working at walmart and i would love still be here is the hours where different. Thy didn't give any hours and as far as an outside life you barely had one
good,Daily work started out setting up pallets in the back bay and unloading a 200 plus piece trailer in 3 hours and then stocking them on the shelf. Very fast paced job.
good,I worked for Advantage Solutions at Walmart. enjoyed serving and taking with customers. No one hassle me and I got along with Walmart employees. It was part time and I enjoyed working my hours and days.
good,I love most employees i worked with and i like some managers but.  Walmarts tough to work for. They are good for hrs but give a extra day off after asking u to come in to do overtime. I think thats not fair. If ur asking someone to come in for overtime why u gonna give them a extra day off that they dont need.
good,I am not sure how they are now with being under new management. But it was a really fun place to work when I was there. I would go back if I ever need the money.
good,"My experience wasn't a bad one hard work for low pay, but they pay more than minimum wage. as a Cart associate we were expected to do all carry outs and pull carts into the building, but they wouldn't hire but a few of us. There is always an overwhelming amount of work load. little to no actual training. Maximum stress job."
good,It was a month long temp job. It was an overnight job and I liked that. The management was cool and made sure the job was done. The drive to and from was not in my likings but since it was for only a month I felt with it.
good,Es  buena empresa se puede hacer carrera ay un buen equipo de trabajo es una empresa donde uno se siente bien pero lo malo q cuando uno pide ayuda a cosas personales no apoyan mucho.
good,"A typical day at work for me includes having to compensate for not having enough employees to cover all departments. For example, if a Sporting Goods associate is scheduled 1-10, their lunch is at 5. If I am also scheduled this shift, that means one of us has to take their lunches/breaks late or early. It can be frustrating, especially since it's expected."
good,They would over staff on days that were typically slow and under staff on days that were typically busy. You were expected to help with grocery stock when there wasn't any customers at check out. Unsympathetic management when it came to illness or injury.
good,Was a good job but the management was very controlling and demanding of its employees. Other workers were very fun and the environment was a cool one and it wasn't difficult to learn the job as there were many others to help show me the ropes during the time I was working there.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart Supercenter most of my co-workers were great to work with. I did have 1 nasty person of management!  I was not there long enough to have to Report the problem to Human resources or Store manager, Overall It was great pay and benefits for the short time I was there in 2015-2016"
good,"Walmart is a Multi-Billion Dollar Retailer and has changed the landscape of retail worldwide and employs millions of people, but is true employee satisfaction exist? I don't think so because employees are underpaid and overworked."
good,"Empresa muito boa,por tanto com algumas falhas mas jamais deixei de comprir com meus deveres profissionais"
good,Did not like my zone manager and she didn't like me and she accused me of things I did not do ! I worked alone most nights and she expected too much for one person when people shop all night !
good,"I worked for them for 2 yrs. Manager sent me home with the flu and then gave me verbal warning for missing a day.  Gave me a $0.40 raise for my 2 year evaluation, fired me 10 days later for lack of productivity but said,"" you can reapply in 6 months.""  I will never apply there again."
good,"Meet customers at entrances, direct them to the specific department, handle returns and perform other assigned duties, according to shift and location."
good,"Work was great, needed to have more hours and more pay for the job I was doing. Enjoyed working with community of people daily, solving problems and making sure everyone was happy."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart, but I expected more from the job, employees, and benefits. Wal-Mart is a big company and they always have new employees."
good,"I mainly was a cashier and tended change, I was promoted to the Deli department and worked with the cold cut meats and cheeses and/or worked the fryer."
good,I loved my job loved the customers but when it came to getting help there was none and you could almost never find a member of management when you needed them. The lack of communication was absolutely horrible you never knew what was going on.
good,it was easy but the management was a mess and the CSMs picked favorites so when it came down to actually doing their job they did nothing and expected everyone else to pick up their slack
good,It's a good place to work at just management play this favoritism thing and if your not on that listed you don't have a chance of staying on as a temp
good,The management for pharmacy should be patient care focused Not money focused. Pharmacist should be able to work in their scope of practice and make decisions without reprocusions
good,They have their favorites those are the ines that benefits from the company. There's so many fake ppl including mgrs they ignore your health problems from their own associates don't want to deal with accidents that happen or offer help only insist you write accident report no offers to hospital or if you go on your own then they get on you.
good,Almost three years to the company and I fired after the new point system.  Walmart does not care about your health and well being and they have tried to get me to risk my life to go to work in a snow storm.  Other than that I did my job very well brought customers in and provided excellent customer service. I know my work ethic will be missed
good,"management was not follow through with anything they said.not getting fair treatment for certain employees ,like being in high school but the managers that were like that are all gone now"
good,Very simple job. Don't think you get paid enough for everything you have to do. Managers were unprofessional . Hours were always being cut . No benefits.
good,"unorganized, unfair, bad  hours , good pay, hardest part of the job was trying to make the lines go by fast , management was un fair and had favorites"
good,No  tuve posibilidad de poder desarrollarme ya que la empresa se basaba en amiguismo . Y solo pocas personas podían ascender o aspirar un poco más
good,Cashier is very fast paced. U meet a lot of different people. co workers are okay. I feel like management needs to communicate better what they do. I did enjoy working there.
good,"My typical day at work was usually never typical. When I was a cashier I would go clock in, scan my badge and it would tell me which register I was supposed to go to. I would basically just go to whichever register my csm told me to every day there was hectic and unorganized."
good,"I learn how to handle a large crowd. I give customers the help they need and show them where things are located such as: the restroom, chargers, blankets, food, pharmacy. The best part about my job is making the customer happy with their service. The hardest part is when I have to tell them that we do not sell that product anymore."
good,"la parte mas difícil del trabajo, fue la tolerancia del abuso del los puestos superiores."
good,"A Empresa é boa de se trabalhar, tem um ótimo convênio médico.,"
good,It was ok Loved the people I worked with but management needs improvements the hours were ok hated that you had to work evey weekend while other people i had set scheduled
good,"Although it was a fun environment, for the hrly pay they should have baggers for each cashier.  The way the bagging area is set up can be dangerous for customers and small children (eye level when turning the bagging table).  My customers made my day worth the work, so many kind souls."
good,The best part if being a Personal Shopper is the interaction with the customers. You also get to hear first hand from customers how they enjoy the service and also ways to improve the service.
good,"Poor management, good customers majority of the time not a good company if you wan to advance in life because their main priority is the customers."
good,You have to be a people person to work here .No one wants bad customer service when they are trying to spend their money .Its really hard to get people to work with you with them talking down at you .
good,i leaned from wal-mart is i have always be as kind as i can. i guess i would say wal mart is 50 50. i would say some people are helpful and kind but most of them are just out for themselves.
good,well its walmart so theres nothing to special the managers are all about there selfs and make sure you slave your butt off for your 8 dollars an hour
good,"I worked with many people throughout each day I worked, I usually worked in the mornings and would leave about mid afternoon. The management was very strict on what we did. The one thing I enjoyed while working at Walmart was working with amazing co - workers."
good,"operated cash ,made sure clothes racks and shelves kept in good order and stocked .made sure the work station was kept in good order."
good,An average of 2 tons of freight to be moved by myself and zone and get buggies up and bin any overstock and pull pallets to the floor and and to the back with out electric pallet jack. I learned how to better work while in pain. My co-workers were lazy and in there own click. The hardest part of the job was constantly being lied to every day about every thing. The only good thing was that it was a good work out and it paid just enough for me to eat well.
good,I love my job but do not care for compensation that I receive.Believe this company plays favorites and hard workers get passed over.
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and our bond even though the work load was unreasonable at times. Very difficult to get promoted/transferred without kissing a few along the way.
good,"A typical day at work included working picks from backroom, helping customers, helping management accomplish tasks, driving forklift to clean up back of store, getting pallets out of the steel using the walkie stacker, throwing trash out, cleaning up spills, taking care of other departments while associates were on break, putting up returns, zoning departments, setting up for the truck, helping unload the truck, delegating tasks, receiving and sending packages, and picking packages for site to store."
good,"Loved working in a customer service business, but others shouldn't be working for wal mart if they don't like it there. Some showed customers they didn't like it and that is inappropriate."
good,The Typical Day Is To Get In Check Your Task Unload And Sort All Pallets In The Dairy Dept. After That We Proceed Too Start Stocking The Freight. Management Was Really Good And As Well As The Coworkers. My Most Enjoyable Part Of The Day Was After Our Last 15 Min Break Cause I Knew There Was Only 2 Hours Left Too Go Till The End Of The Shift
good,"Just a typical warehouse type job. I unloaded trucks in a group and then went and stocked the shelves. Management did not really bother us much and we were left to do our simple task. The co-workers were usually okay, but the turnaround in jobs like this means you have no idea how long someone will be around."
good,can't advance very quickly no matter how hard you work or bust  your butt. but great co workers and great food. they suck with their scheduling and don't take any of your requests into order. refused to move me for no reason suck at communicating movements. don't allow for growth.
good,"Walmart is a last resort kind of job. they pay what they want. theres no over time.Some walmarts let customers steal and lose bonuses. and at quite a few walmarts teamwork gos out of the window. the managers are worked like slaves, so of course its taken out on the rest of the employees."
good,I had fun working there. I had alot of the same costumers each time they came in they always went in my line. They where regulars. It was hard working there but I loved it. Some management played favorites.
good,"a typical work day would be assisting customers in finding desired products, answering questions and concerns to the best of my ability, occupy assigned areas which included cashiering, stocking, and money center."
good,The management was all over the place. You work all night night slept all day long . It takes strong people to do this job. It was a fun job lots of cute guys.
good,"A typical day at work would involve hustling, you would definitely meet people who will come and go. high rate of employee turnover, you will meet some nice co-worker. One benefit of a part-time work is the 10% off any item you purchase from the store."
good,"my typical day would consist of clocking in going straight to a register logging in to that register and cleaning it then going ahead and assisting customers. The managment there was not professinal at all they disrespected all workers or at least all cashiers. "
good,"they worked around my schedule, i was a full time college student and they were very easy to talk to and deal with!"
good,"I typically would never work there again, and I feel like the management wasn't  properly handling the situation correctly and the place itself needs order."
good,"I very much enjoyed meeting new customers everyday, and learning about them as well as talking to them. The hardest part of this job was the under management. There would be times where only 3 cashiers would be available for 100 customers. The hardest thing to determine was to figure out; do I take my time so I do not make mistakes with customers money and items, or do I try my hardest to get the lines down as fast as possible? Dealing with other workers, in any environment, but especially here it is important to remain professional and negate talking about your personal life. This goes for management as well, maintaining a professional attitude, and remembering that this is in fact a place of business."
good,The job is good and once you get to know your job you are on your own. They train you for about 3mths no matter what you are applying for. I liked working as a deli associate.
good,"•	Demonstrated outstanding customer service "
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. Nothing to complain about. Just a normal job.
good,"I have learned how to better understand people and communicate more clearly with the customers. Walmart is a friendly environment with some room for advancement. The hardest part of the job is working late hours. But, the most enjoyable part of working at Walmart is the friendly environment."
good,the management would never help in most cases if a crew needed help and would get us in trouble with the daytime managers
good,"could use more training on the job,very busy workplace, to many mangers and not enough workers,"
good,You get yelled at for no reason by the front end managers. Cashiers are watched constantly
good,the recognition there is non existant unless your an oder filler other than that your a nobody and are treated as such by upper management
good,The customers at this store is one of the most challenging things. The jobs themselves are relatively easy.
good,"Reviewed daily reports for errors and recover shrink, and got with the merchandise managers and assistant managers with what errors were found to make sure that person is trained properly and report weekly to the Store Manager."
good,"The typical day is clocking in a 4pm and unloading 5000 parcel from 2 different trucks on a manual line belt and placing these parcels on pallets in brick formation for security and safety.  After an hour lunch for 3 hours transporting pallets with manual pallet jack to different locations throughout the store, stocking shelves, and cleaning back room.  I've learned that my body was(past tense) more out of shape than I had realized.  I realized that there are employers such as USPS, FEDEX, and UPS that pay almost double for what I do, and I realized that I'm worth more to the right company.  My co-workers are great and have made one excellent friendship.  The majority of the management staff that I have had the privelege of working with is awesome and very army like which is good most of the time for result driven work and completion.  The most enjoyable part of my job is getting tired and sweaty with the guys and girls on the belt and trying to have a good time with them."
good,"stressful work environment, although I have been trained on power lifting equipment and learned how to push my team to get the job done. I don't get paid much and my schedule isn't very flexible."
good,"Janitorial duties,  cleaning floors,  cleaning bathrooms,  Keeping store clean."
good,Alot of employees are underpaid for what they do...Management can be a little to relax and not follow through on their threats.
good,"Walmart was a great place to work part time while attending college. Fairly easy to learn, nice work environment, management for the most part was nice and friendly. Great pay with many increases in the short period of time i worked there. Although now as a customer i know the store should not look how it does, definitely does not look how it did when i worked there. Shelves were always stocked and always had items people wanted, now you can never find anything you want and the shelves are always half empty"
good,"llega uno a la tienda tiene que ir por reportes de ventas,agotados y productos vendidos de mas a ese reporte se le llama negativos despues de eso tiene uno que llegar a acomodar mercancia revisar exhibiciones uno como jefe limpieza,surtido de mercancia agotada en piso de venta llevar el control de los asociados de sus muebles a  acomodar pasar horarios,nomina y acomodar lo que es bodega y piso de venta"
good,"-buen humor al empezar el día laboral. "
good,"There are descent coworkers, plenty of awesome customers, and a few who aren't so nice. The best part of the job is the interaction with most of the customers, and the worst part are those few customers who do not know how to treat others."
good,I learned a lot here and would love to go back because I really enjoyed what I was doing.
good,"My typical day at work starts by checking my scheduled tasks. Then go-backs have to be put away. I start straightening the shelfs that are  the messiest (like rugs and waste paper cans or towels on the floor). Product on the floor can be a safety issue if not taken care of right away. Then I check to see if critical picks have been pulled for my departments, and put them away. When zoning, if product has been put in the wrong place, I will correct that before going on to other products. I am very detailed oriented. I really enjoy the team work I have with my co-workers. It gives me a feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day. The hardest part of the job is having a closing shift one day then pulling an opening shift on the next day. My greatest pleasure comes from helping our customers. Many customers will come in the store and ask for me to help them. When I have finished with them, many times I will turn around and there are 2 to 3 more customers needing help. As the economy has changed, many stores are having fewer people on staff, so it is essential that we can help the customer locate their products. Happy customers bring in repeat sales. That's how we grow our business."
good,"Loved my supervisor... Really cool person"
good,"A typical day at work would be, I will clock in attend the nightly meeting. Get the things i need for the night. Then go task in, then start my duties."
good,Cleaned the whole store till I lefted. Workers were mainly childish. 
good,I learned all different kinds of areas in a grocery store. There was never a slow moment or a dull moment.
good,Its a wonderful place to work but changed management to often
good,"When I worked there, it was a fun ""team"" feeling. They were able to give me a decent schedule to work around my toddler."
good,I really disliked the policies and procedures. I had a really bad manager and supervisor.
good,"Stocking, unloading truck, customer services, greeter, cashier, stacking pallets, wrap, unloading pallet into store off pallet."
good,"I would work at the service desk and stay busy and sometimes they would send me to work something in the store because I was knowledgeable. Which I enjoyed. And I enjoyed working with the customers. Some co-workers worked hard and others didn't. The hardest part was telling management what they need to do in front of the customers. They would ask right there and the customer would get mad,saying if they don't know then they need to square them away."
good,you get little or no training so learning from others is a strong part working for walmart and never knowing too much always being able to learn new things
good,stocking at walmart will keep one busy. i had the hardest section that most people never wanted to work. i loved my section and completed may work every night
good,Era a muito bom trabalhar la gostava muito pelos amigos que fiz e clientes pois adoro lidar com pessoas o ruim é pessoas que se acha no direito de humilhar o funcionário no pois tem um pequeno cargo melhor que o seu.
good,I learned the P.O.S. system and how to greet customers with their purchases. The training was precise and to the point but the actual hands on experience was like being put out on my own with little assistance from other cashiers or CSMs.
good,Great place to work temporarily. Feels as if the company likes to shift people around very often.
good,Management only cared about the store. If you got sick on the job
good,I worked for walmart and lost my job because the store got in trouble because they sent me to a training seminar its a good place to work if you look into all there polices when i was fired they could even make it lagit there so called open door police is ok if you never have to go over the store mangers head if you do good luck get a hold of anybody and its probly doughtfull they will do anything and store manger will most likely blame his manger staff so like walk on ice at a lot of stores if your in management that is..
good,It was ok; but the problem was the management. There were too many of them and too much confusion. Plus too many of them wanted to lead so there wasn't a clear plan of action because each one had a different approach.
good,Very interesting place to work. Management is not on the same page. Learned a lot of management skills. Didn't interact with co-workers alot stayed to myself. Hardest part of the job was management not being on the same page.
good,Liked company but the management and corporate people were not very considerate and handled things poorly
good,"The company Walmart is a great company with good benefits. The only set back is that the store that i was employed at had the worst management i've ever seen before. And there is no use in the company having a human resources hotline because they offer no assistance at all they tell u to follow certain steps. In all i loved working for the company, but the store i was employed at was just bad."
good,"While working at Family dollar I have had to call the police several times because people would come in and steal. The job was hard work everyday, weekly inventory off the truck on to the floor. Employee was replace monthly. While working there I learned quickly about stepping up and taking the lead."
good,I typical day at work for me is walking to my area and taking care of customer returns and money transfers.
good,Leaders are encouraged to be abrasive and set unrealistic expectations. Leaders hold managers in the store accountable for results that are not always possible and have no consideration for extenuating circumstances.
good,I really think that walmart doesnt care about there works they treat you good in the beginning after a couple months they cut your hours then expect you to stay there
good,"The store I was at was really good. The biggest problem was management they were never wrong, and never did wrong by us. I had really good hours and pay. They liked making us do other peoples job as well."
good,"salary is low compared to other retails, too much workload on employees with pressure to perform , understaffed to save money , bad temperament of management they have no respect for staff working under them."
good,management was around but would just walk around and not help at all. working there wasnt fun and there was so much drama and it felt like people were on sides and seperated
good,"Wal-Mart has been a great place to work at. I really loved my co-workers and even though the management is a little hard to work with sometimes, if you treat them with respect and do you job well, then you should have no problem. Best advice I can give to new employees: work hard, be extra friendly to co-workers and management"
good,I feel there is not much room to grow once you have become certified. There are other interests I have for the future to grow and explore more options.
good,Bad environment place to work public customers are very rude and disrespectful also poor management poor communication also non responsible associate that do not complete their tasks
good,"So they do not like to give you the holly days off."
good,On a day to day basis I am helping customers meet satisfaction. I struggle to know common rules or policy because the managers are all over the place.
good,Hired for one job but had to do another job for MONTHS before getting to do the job I was hired for. Management was very poor. The pay was also less than significant
good,"I really enjoy helping my customers, I really enjoyed my coworkers.I really don’t like that they pay you actual vacation pay for holidays. They really didn’t care too much about my family that was very disappointing, but overall I enjoy what I did and no matter what I did with joy peace and love."
good,The other associates are like a family and the benefits and pay are decent but you go no where and the management have their favorites. I feel like I am at a dead end and am gonna go nowhere and the management just tells you stuff to make you feel better but never follows through with it.
good,First I should start by saying that Walmart has taught me many things in the workplace. Some good.. Some bad.. Just Do NOT think you can be lazy. This place can be a great place to work as long as your management knows what they are required to do.
good,it's great working at Walmart. Great people to work with. the only thing I didn't like was the scheduling. really liked the 10% discount card employees get after three months.
good,This company pays well but if you are not committed to this company 150% and are not hard working ..don't apply .....management  is horribly unorganized and never stand behind what they say .very misleading
good,Pretty easy job. Easy going workplace. Nice people to work with. Great managers. Nice pay. Would come back if they asked me to. I have nothing else to
good,"Too many managers "
good,The managers are unapproachable and unfriendly!  They change policies and procedures without any notice and don't explain them!  You have to learn hands on by yourself!  There is no opportunity for advancement and if there is I haven't witnessed it!  I was excited almost three years ago when I began working at Walmart!  No I feel like I'm  floundering there!
good,It was hard work you get some co managers a  store managers that are power hungry they would give you unrealistic time goals not enough staff and expect you to work all this crazy overtime and I get paid for it
good,"As an apparel associate I walk an average of eight miles per night  The job is very fast paced  most managers are not well trained, and too young to serve in that capacity"
good,Never was given the hours needed. They were way to strict with policies. And very rarely was given more then 20 some odd hours of work each week. Thus making it hard to pay bills and such.
good,Just be on time ...and come to work..do your job. Be motivated..be a team player..Hard Work Pays off.one day you can be a store manager.makes sure u read the policy...
good,in my time at Walmart I had very poor management that forced more work than the scheduled team could manage. They consistently degraded us because we weren't working as fast as they wanted us to work. they were very selective of who was fired (so you better be on their good side). The work was easy its just hard working for managers that don't do much work themselves and put you down all the time.
good,The job I now have is awesome. But the job will be going away soon and I will lose pay. Walmart Always has a way of taking money away from their associates.
good,"I enjoy almost every coworker, but upper management is absolutely terrible. They are disrespectful and look down on you if you aren't management as well. Many do not speak to you directly if you do something wrong, and they send your direct supervisor to do it. It's extremely trusting, and it makes it difficult to be able to discuss a problem with them."
good,"The Heard this was making sure that the wearhouse was clean and Maintain. And make sure that the customers are happy. "
good,"working in the pharmacy was  great it was like our own little part of the store. "
good,"I would sign in and go straight to the cash register I was assigned to.Then my supervisor would inform me of what needs to be done at that time,if there was anything specific.My main job was to help the customers with whatever they needed and to cash them out I always kept my self busy doing things or just and dusting.I got along with the coworkers great. I learned that the customer is always right. I have a very friendly attitude so I didn't experience but one or two disgruntled customers and was told by management that they were like that to everyone. The best part of the job was meeting new people every day.And the regulars too. I looked forward to seeing my regular customers on a daily basis."
good,I threw 2 trucks a day for the same pay as everyone else they dont recognize the  hard work of many associates and management makes shir to keep hiring in there circle.
good,No  job  security  you can work hard and still get no where so y do so .They has a buddy buddy system if you are not in the dm face which he does not talk to you as an associate he is not friendly at all. He  has to like you in order for you to advance.
good,"Working here was a very good experience, I was able to move up and threw the job very quickly. I worked in the deli, the meat department and stocking aisles. the pay was very good and the did give raises."
good,"Would recommend to friends and family very easy workplace, everything is taken slow and steady but somehow gets done. Manager is alright, but scheduling is pretty vague, closing 12 am one day and opening 6 am the next"
good,"I came to Walmart as a retiree working part time.  No advancement, lots of discrimination, and favoritism.   To many chief and not enough Indians."
good,Working at Walmart is cool it isn’t that bad. Some staff help you and some others don’t really care about you. They just care about them which is totally cool as long as they don’t come say anything!
good,Management in general doesn't communicate with employees or other management in a beneficial fashion. Half the time the right hand has no clue what the left is doing.
good,Great people but upper management within the store structures are very shady. It seems the more you strive to learn the harder it is to move up.......
good,working here has been a challenge I have never had to deal with before... management is not very friendly majority of the time … a lot of associates are the same … this is the second store I have worked for and the first was so much better … management took care of their associates unlike this store
good,Walmart was a growing experience for me i learned alot from the time of me being in there like how to greet customers and attend to there needs and questions. I learned how to interact with co-workers. Also communicating with managers on the right way to bettering my work experience
good,El horario no es muy conveniente pues es un horario comercial y para el cierre no hay mucho transporte
good,"Bagged, wrapped and packaged purchases based on individual item and customer requirements."
good,I worked there for 7 years. I definitely had opportunity to grow there but the work atmosphere was not the greatest. With a real support from management I believe it could be a great place to work.
good,The management team wasn't the greatest. They all told you something different and you would get in trouble for what the other one told you to do. But I loved my coworkers!
good,Very fast paced stressful job. Managment un the pharmacy is lacking any empathy for customers or employees. They have a ridiculously high turnover rate2 are
good,"Walmart is a good place to start but I wouldn't go as far to say it's somewhere you want to stay. Management isn't very helpful and you'll work yourslef in the ground for pennies and nickels. Can't beat the health insurance though, or the friends you'll potentially make woeking here. However, your family will pay the price because if you do your job well they want you to stay over and then make uou cut it because there is no overtime allowed. You won't be home as often as you are at work."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. Training was thorough but more times than not if I had a question or wasn’t sure about something there was hardly any management around to ask. I’d work there again if there were opportunities for advancement.
good,The job was nice and it was mostly a very independent job. The management was rough and they had a very strict attendance policy with no sick days. Overall an ok place to work.
good,I worked there as part of the back room put away team first and it was pure chaos. Later they had me as a sticker and it was easy work but the management wasn't the best to work for.
good,The good thing is you can learn a lot from here. It's a cool place if you move up. And don't just stay in the same department. Try to move up are ask to if any other department need help to learn more.
good,"Massive fortune 1 company, so you ARE expendable. But your are paid fairly and they usually are flexible with things like schooling. Multiple options for various jobs so there should be a job that works with you."
good,it was easy work good for someone fresh out of high school in college or just not needing too much money to get by..The management try to treat you like you are a kid tho.
good,"Clock in and printout our mod sheets to set new mods, than we will pull everything off the shelf and space the shelves and products on the shelf accordining to the diagram.  Than clean up get rid of overstock items and deleted items that are no longer on the mod.  Than we would face or zone products forward to ensure a easier sale to the customer."
good,"A typical day at Wal Mart consisted of clocking in, meeting in the stock room with the manager that was there. Depending on the day there would be a truck to unload with 2000-3000 pieces in it. It was a friendly environment to work in. The hardest part of the job was picking up heavy appliances."
good,If your area has more than 2 people in it you can guarantee that you will be moved to a different department for the day. Trying to get a managers help always seems like pulling teeth and it bothers them to help.
good,I work as hard as I can but if  underpaid I’ll look elsewhere for employment but I’ll never quit without a 3 week warning. Also there communication is beyond poor and people don’t do there job and sometimes others are blamed
good,The hours for my position are not really flexible. I can only keep my position if I work nights and its really hard when I have a family. I feel like the skills no matter the level are the same and  I want to work in a place where I can develop more skills.
good,"With the limited upward mobility, toxic managment, and grade school bikering it made the most sense for me to go into business for myself. I don't have to worry about a manager that has to prove he knows more. I actually think the one best way was an amazing implementation, I just think they have to roll through the old guard to get adequate results. The bickering, and rumor mill, while policy is in place to prevent it, it is rarely enforced. Though they will hire just about anyone, and they don't drug test until you get to Management, or have to drive specialized equiptment... and it shows."
good,the management tell you one thing then they do some thing new they change the rules when ever they want to to fit them when you take a leave to take care of family they tell you there going to be there for you then they f you over
good,And I like working with some of the people and another thing i like that we got a discount on all of the stuff and I like stocking  and putting  the things on the shelf and my department in house were and that we got paid every two weeks
good,"Felt like I was under a microscope, where management was concerned. I enjoyed dealing with the public, and assisting customers. Most of my peers were good to work with."
good,"A normal part of the day was dealing with leftover stuff, and trying to get processes done with no help.  But your co-workers was the best part of the day."
good,"I would come in, clock in, get my register assignment"
good,"Welcoming work environment, helpful team members, management could use an upgrade on their attitudes towards associates but, over all a bitter sweet work place"
good,Walmart was a good place to work I had fun going to work everyday they don’t pay as much but I would only recommend this job to young adults you have to get to work on time or you will get a point added
good,I would recommend this employer if you are looking for a second job or a job that is not your primary source of income.  They don't give many hours and they work on a points scale for absences.  The management is uncooperative and unconcerned about you.
good,"Started out great, then stopped being scheduled for work. Other than the scheduling issues it wasn't that bad of a job to work. Easy to do, not stressfull"
good,"As a part time employee you are not offered benefits until you have been there a year and then you couldn't afford them anyway."
good,My store has been a revolving door of assistant managers. Some managers want their team to cut out people by lying about each other. Some managers actually care about their team and want them to succeed.
good,"I learned a great deal while I had the privileged to serve so many fine associates and customers at 1751. I came to love the workers and they taught me so very much. I worked hard, but I enjoy working hard so Walmart was a good match for me. I love serving others and building people, so Walmart was a great place to hone my skills. All the best to anyone reading this post who is from 1751, your are awesome!"
good,"-horrible management."
good,"I liked working at Walmart sometimes but the days drug on and even if you are sick or hurt badly with a doctors note, they do not care. They do not care about their employees."
good,"Stayed busy, always on the move, worked a lot with face to face with customers.  Assisted member with returns, sending money and as well as receiving money."
good,"me mantuve trabajando en walmart por 7 años ,pero la verdad que yo busco algo para superarme tanto a mi como a mi famila y se que esta desicion de cambiarme y irme a trabajar a europa,suecia. me ira michp mejor ademas de aprender a conocer otras culturas y ampliar nuestras mentes y lograr emprender un gran desafio al irnos de chile."
good,"I process 200  invoices a day . The atmosphere here is laid back, and always changing. People arent on your back making sure you are getting your work done . There is always a need for change."
good,working with Walmart will not be a hinder if they didn't make it one. walmart is suppose to be family based business but they dont interact as one. they are all on throwing one another under the bus no one is considering building each other up.
good,"I really like working at Walmart, but I have requested to be transferred to cashier/sales associate due to a physical condition where walking is extremely hard on my one ankle."
good,Not the greatest work environment. Work so much for less. Managers don't care about their workers or jobs when it should be taken seriously at times. lack of real management.
good,Working here had its up and downs. Management went down the drain and was constantly being to strict and unruly. Coworkers was the ones that mad this job barable
good,"everyone is very nice, job can be stressful at times, but that goes with any job. not bad pay, downfall is the hours, a lot of evenings and weekends for newer employees"
good,"Working at Wal-Mart brought me a great sense of self-accomplishment for the first 6-7 months of working there. Thankfully I was able to be placed into Electronics which made my job a lot easier than most given my knowledge of most, if not all, electronics that we sold. "
good,the job is easy but the culture of the company is what makes it difficult to stay with the company. They tend to promote people with very little education and knowledge to over see departments.
good,"NO chance for moving up ,customers complain about one help (cashers) can't keep workers and Ladies should not be unloading trucks  and pulling heavy loads"
good,Try to pick a shift that works with life style. Try to pick a job that is fast paced we jobs you get bored with. The management is not to reliable. They say stuff and never mean it.
good,Overall my experience was great working for walmart.Very fast pace and your always busy so time flys very fast.Especially holiday season is when i worked so it was very busy in walmart cant complain.
good,"Lazy management, , with a select few workers bearing the brunt of the work. Promotions were largely based on whether or not you were liked by a manager, rarely ever was anyone promoted based on their ability to do the job."
good,had an incident with my car broke now and couldn't make it to work and accumulated too many points but can't wait till I can reapply for this job have to wait 90 days to reapply
good,my frst few months were a blast until they started cracking down on everyone and we weren't allowed to talk to each other and we got yelled at for almost anything they could think of
good,fast paced work environment. The pay could be better. Management at the time could have led by example a little more.  I did make great friends while being there.
good,"There's not much to say, its a Walmart Store. They will work you like an Ox and pay you pennies. Usually the management is extremely unprofessional and underqualified. It's a job if you need one."
good,"Not enough time at the site to evaluate."
good,"They allow me to be a very independent person as far as me making decisions of my own.  I am able to teach and train (develop) other associates as well.   I don't need to be micromanaged on any given day.  Majority of the employees are team players.  Work on the computer and on the sales floor through out the day. "
good,The overall job as Cashier was brief and is becoming obsolete now with self checkouts and mobile pay options. Door Greeter was nice as it gave me the chance to be friendly and sociable to customers coming and going.
good,"we would load / unload trucks, bring in store merchandise and set it on pallets. at the end of the night we would bring it to the floor for it to be stocked.  I learned to work hard and fast.  The management was fair. the culture was good. The hardest part of the job was pulling the heavy pallets. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team."
good,Not flexible with hours and days off. No sick time or vacation time offered. Hard to get a raise there. Only recieved discounts on certain items. Discount price varied on different items.
good,"not willing to work with hours of family involved employees.I watch my  grand kids and it conflicted when I was needed to babysit, my family is first and job is 4th on list, I want to work but also be there for family when needed"
good,"Atendimento aos associados, bem gratificante."
good,When I worked at Walmart the pay for overnight staff sucks the management talk to u like u need them or the job and they wanna rush you to put the stuff up on the shelves because they are short staffed
good,"Walmart is a good place to work for a first job. The management is good, the pay and advancement opportunities are not good though. The hardest part of the job was the lack of work and life balance."
good,"A typical day at work included bringing cash to the register from the cash office and opening the shop. i would then go to the back room if there werent any customers and begin to work freight or organize and keep an eye on the counter for the rest of the day. "
good,"Typical day was usually 9 hours, 1 hour lunch break. Not all managers were bad most of them did listen to your problems with the job. Once you're trained for your position everything goes smoothly because you dont have to interact with the manager much"
good,You can be removed from your hired position and placed on another shift without warning. The store cut my hours in an effort to make me quit. When I went to the manager about my hours I was told either pick up maintenance shifts or work the part time hours I was given.
good,"I find working at Walmart takes a special person. You may think it’s easy but it is not. It mentally and physically challenging. I’m blessed to have this job and try not to get to caught up into the drama that also comes along, but the customers are who I go into work for that and my family."
good,"It was great for a first job. I just didn't have enough hours, and they didn't offer full-time positions. I would have still been at walmart if they offered more to their employees."
good,The Wal-Mart I Was Employed By Was In Switch From A Bad A Store Manager To A Disrespectful Even Worse Store Manager.  Her Attitude Provokes People To Jump Out Of Of Line or Perform Unsual Acts In Thus So She Can Have A Reason To Terminate You
good,"I was a temp but they didn't allow for flexibility in the hours i needed for school, so when the temp position ended, I was terminated,instead of being kept in. They trained me in everything an they put in in a place that i was most comfortable/productive in,"
good,This was a great place to work however the management was very non supportive or helped with anything much. My co-workers were great and always supportive and available to help when needed.
good,management is not one of the best attributes for some of the store in the company. not every store is the same. They are know to be pushy with the mastercard on customers.
good,Good pay. Great co-workers. Not enough hours. Your able to climb the ladder  nice place to work. Loved being a cashier meet new people and talking to everyone I got to know everyone in town.
good,"Uma empresa mediana, local organizado e limpo, com funcionários agradáveis."
good,Working for Walmart has many advantages however work life balance is not one of them. As a salaried member of management I was told on multiple occasions to work over 100 hours in a week.
good,In the beginning it was nice. Then a manger who switched over didnt like me and cut my hours. I was making almost 700 every pay check. Now its 300-400. I can't take care of my family on that.
good,For the first few months the job was ok but then as I started working a lot of the managers that we had would pick and choose there favorites. It would make you feel left out but that’s why I just stayed to myself.
good,I Haven't learned much working at Walmart because i have many skills. Hardest part of the job is the radical hours. never a set schedule. you can not plan a life. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the great people that work there. They are wonderful.
good,"I enjoyed working at walmart, but the manager did not like me, so i wasn't able to be promoted or move up with the company. The store owner was absent  bit and hard to conact. I did not like being singled out."
good,"Walmart has this stupid point system that messes your life up."
good,"Una gran empresa, lo que le afecta es el liderazgo de los altos mandos, pero en área laboral es estable, son flexibles en horarios, y si ven empeño y esfuerzo creces."
good,Ive never been lied about by so many co workers and had as much drama and people asking costumers come in to fire me as i did in this work place due to two boys. i relay hated working there.
good,"El equipo en general era muy bueno, te brindaban la confianza y la ayuda suficiente para progresar en el puesto."
good,"It's great as a first job but once you leave and get something better, you'll never go back. If anyone works here I'd recommend searching for other jobs while there as it really isn't all that great."
good,The work load far exceeds the time allotted to complete each task. The pace is very fast and unorganized. Usually each shift is poorly staffed putting added pressure to the team. Management not helpful.
good,the manager there started to fire people over little things but other who was doing way worse thing got to stick around and it wasn't easy getting hours after a period of time but kept hiring others to work there.
good,"Walmart is a fast paced place to work, i worked as a unloader. To start the day we would unload the trucks, stack merchendise on pallets, then take pallets to floor in a orderly fashion. we would then sweep floors and audit merchendise the rest of shift."
good,"Walmart added more stress to my life than it took away. They only allowed 3 absences every 3 months or you got fired. The management team I had as an inventory control specialist was amazing but the store managers and higher ups were bias and hateful. I would not reccommend it to a friend but then again, it all just depends on the location and who your managers are."
good,"When you work hard and as long as I did 2 1/2 years to be exact and you are used by management to run multiple departments they give very little positive feedback even when they know what you are up against.I think they need to First, Teach and train. Next let them have time to learn it. 3rd, thank the ones that are really trying hard."
good,"I was there for a year and had 3 other positions including cashiering, electronics and cart pushing. I made a mistake and they sent me outside. They treat cart pushers with no respect. i was told if i left for a family emergency i would of got fired... I would 5 star recommend to work inside but never recommend the outside."
good,"there was of specific manager that I could never seem to get along with. She would treat me differently from everybody else. She told me I couldn't wear leggings to work one day, but the very next hour, she was telling a cashier that she liked her pants. (They were leggings. )"
good,"Not a bad company as long as a good manager is there. Company is rather boring to work for. Mostly repetitive work, stock this stock that, help.that person help this person"
good,They had a smidge of customer service quality. Used profanity all over the store. Even made me feel awkward. People are very immature talk about innaproprate topics all day. I mean come on people its a family friendly store.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was fun when I first started, then they started changing management and hiring/firing so many people it got to the point it was a punishment to come to work then the pay wasn't the best for the job you had to do. If management didn't like you they would make sure they prevented you from getting you raise on your eval."
good,Clocked in went to the customer service manager and she would give u your assigned registered to go to for the day. If we were not busy would go help out on the floor.
good,"These are my experiences on my tenure working there. Yes, there were a lot of instances where it could have been so much better as far as how daily operations. All I can say is, ""It is what it is."""
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart but in the customer service department it can be very stressful because customers come into, service because they have a problem, whether it's returning or exchanging, customers can already be upset and take it out on an associate."
good,"For starters the managers were picky and would do unnecessary things on purpose just to make you mad. I had gray hair that they made me change (but it wasn't stated nowhere in the dress code anything about hair color) because it wasnt ""apart of dress code.""  The managers were giving out the lunch breaks late and Walmart is filled with drama. Only thing I didnt have a problem with was the pay."
good,Typical day at work is getting ready to stock  shelves and pulling the ballets of work out on the floors. I learned when stocking you must  be a team player meaning helping each other to get the job done in a timely manner.The hardest part of my job is working with co-workers that don't pull there weight. Enjoyable part of my job is knowing I have a job to go to.
good,ive heard many stories about working at walmart. i can only convey mine... my crew and managers are the best ones i have ever worked with. my only issue is medical (knee problems in both knees). other than that i like the people i work with and my management team is second to none. if i had to refer a friend to walmart for work i would recommend my store.
good,"The management at Walmart was friendly and helpful for the most part. They made sure that the break room was somewhat entertaining by having a TV and a comfortable atmosphere. The job itself was very stressful, fast-paced, and unorganized."
good,"The work culture is somewhat confusing.When I worked as a cashier I all felt vunerable. cashiers where not supply with tools to identify bills under $50/100 bills. However there was breach when customer use money where the numbers on the 1,5 and 10 bills where counterfeit and the cashier was fired.Eventhough the store had 24 registers and only 2 cashiers on a major holiday, so the priority was to get the lines down."
good,Job security day in and day out. Still always something new to interact with every shift. Friendly staff and inviting customers. Many departments offering new positions every week.
good,"A typical day at Walmart was usually stressful. I learned to work as a team with my coworkers, work better with customers and ways to become a better cashier. The management could use a little improvement in some areas."
good,"It just wasn't a good fit for me, I don't think I will strive best as a cashier. Lots of hours if needed, part time working full time hours with no benefits."
good,"My Day is always productive and i learn a lot ever day, but management sometimes makes your day go slow, but things get hard, and once the past picks up things are great."
good,MY experience at Walmart was up and down. I've known great performers and poor performers. Both suitable management and the non suitable. As I would imagine its a normal way of operating for retail.
good,"This is the more run down store of the two. it has a lot of good dedicated employees. the management team isnt great for asking for help but you do what you need to,"
good,Purposely work you the max amount of hours until you can't have full time benefits. Can only miss two days every like six months and are only allowed a five minute late flex for points.
good,"The overall work is fun to do, if you enjoy organizing. Wal-Mart is a great company with good benefits. The only real complaint I have is that the overnight assistant managers humiliated and harassed, and even threatened me. Upper management would not do a thing about it either. I'd say that if you can put up with that, go for it  it's a fun and rewarding job overall."
good,i felt nothing like i was told in the orientation and pride they said they will have. felt free to do anything worked looped holed hours and didnt have a life with low pay.
good,"In my 5 years at Walmart I have taken every opportunity given to me to advance and moved up from a temporary  associate to a assistant manger. Walmart does not treat their mangers well. The training is poor there is no help long hours, days off are switched all the time hours change and the mangers above you go through the same thing it is a 24 hr job. Having a family and working at Walmart is a hard balance."
good,I worked at walmart for a little over a year. Always got paid on time. I enjoyed the job very much. I did not much care for the the management. I tried to avoid them as much as I could. I would go back but I have had a hard time being rehired..
good,"The pay is good the benefits are great you get discounts and there really is a lot of room to grow and succeed, I've seen part time sale reps turn into full time department managers and still climbing."
good,"Productive work environment in a typical work day. Learned to work with others, adhere to a schedule, use leadership to learn and communicate tranportation practices."
good,Productive and safe place to work. Awesome training. Great staff. Learned a lot like how to count a register. Very fun place to work and very calm for first time employees.
good,"Gostei de trabalhar, mais a atençao com o empregado é muito pouca."
good,Good job would love to work there again if I could I enjoyed the people and the customers.its long hours. Needs to have snacks for employeesthat would be awesome
good,"The first place I worked at was nice. I got promoted and relocated and that one was horrible. I hated that walmart. Rude customers, and management sucked."
good,Management is all over the place - some are childish. Hardest part of job is dealing with obnoxious customers because the customer is always right. Good experience to have so you won't take retail workers for granted.
good,they work you hard.  But you must really kiss someones butt or play the political roles to get promoted or advance at the store that i worked at.  I myself was passed over 3 times for things and i trained the people that were advanced before me
good,I loved working with most of my coworkers. I liked working at night so the store was not that full. It was very hrd to keep up being a single mother. The pay is awful and management is very uncaring.
good,"Ok enviroment, lots of good people culture is definetly corporate. As. With anywhere various pros and cons. They could focus a little more on workers and that would lead to higher employeee retention."
good,"People I didn't even know were very rude to me. These are the employees that work out on the floor. They act like they are better because you are just a cashier. On top of it, they try to boss you around, and are overall rude to everyone. To top it off they are rude to customers, and then the customer comes to the front to pay and they are angry and take it out on you."
good,I seen them get rid of people like it was nothing. Even people who were there for over a decade. I feel that they don't pride in taking care of their employees who have been with the company over a long period of time due to them making so much so they let them go.
good,"Enjoy meeting people, but not a place for advancement. Management cooperative when hospitalization was necessary. Not enough hours to and no full time work . Many turnovers"
good,The actual workings of the job i miss but management lacked in what needed to be done as requested by the employees i.e. pallet jacks needed to be fixed and months would go by without resolve. The crew that i was working with made the job great we could joke and have fun but still finish the job before scheduled and as an unloader the job was a workout everyday kept me in good health. The hardest part of the job wasnt really all that hard but stacking the pallets you have to be good at tetris.
good,"There have been too many managers in the one store I worked in. If you were to average it out, management is below par. There have been some good/very good managers, but when opportunity knocks, they walk out the door. It is not that easy for the average employee."
good,Management was HORRIBLE ! Bakery department was amazing. Bad with understanding personal life. I was pregnant when I worked there and they were not understanding
good,"Very quick-paced, not worth having to deal with angry customers due to the fact that there is not a lot of registers opened. Managers taking a while to find someone to relive you to go on break/meal/ home."
good,"I loaded & unloaded trucks,shrink wrapped the items. I stock pallets then pulled them to floor to be stocked in it;s rightful spot. I also pushed carts."
good,Typical day is different everyday. I just say be prepared because you never know what to expect. You are how you feel and act. Nobody is perfect but it is how you deal with a situation that makes the whole situation change.
good,"Good company and good experience"
good,The work can be too much for one that wants to stall on the job but the money is very good although the pay is bi weekly. Also the off days can be random throughout the week.
good,on your feet all day they just want the work done your feet hurt and you work short if they would be nice to the people that work they won't need help all the time and pay people more money I would have stayed there not
good,"Al ser práctica no era remunerada, los horarios son muy extensos, pocos beneficios, poca continuidad de trabajo."
good,"This has to be one of thee most normal jobs I've ever had. Ex: You work like a 9-5 kind of shift just stocking your department of the store, making sure it stays clean and organized and assisting customers. Yes hours are long and hard but worth it when you get your check. Always talk about money among the staff. At time it does seem dull and boring but you gotta keep working. I loose my mind when I constantly here the stores music playing, cause it's a soundtrack of songs put together by corporate and at the end of the day I've memorized the list and lyrics to each song. Not like I've purposefully did so, but it was burned into my skull since I was there all day long."
good,typical retail position. 40 hours a week. Stock shelves and help customers. Multiple levels of management which micromanage your activities. Very rarely able to complete one task before you start another task
good,"Nights were quiet worked with a team member, at times felt alone and definitely stressful, every night was loads of work. Too much orders of the same product and shelves were full and backroom was being overflowed with overstock items."
good,"the managers don't treat their employees very well, very good people skills. not as safe of a work place. they provide good care of their employees. pretty good place to work."
good,"its a nice place to work if your in a pinch or it's your first job.it will keep you busy, and the people are nice to work with. The customers are nice for the most part."
good,"ive been working there for almost 3 yrs "
good,"Often low staff management will not help when needed"
good,Training lacks a bunch but when trained it is good. Other than the lack of training it is a decent job to get started and if your doing good and keep learning new things you can move up quite quickly
good,I learned how to work a cash register and check people out quickly. Management was always nice to the employees. There wasn't much that was that hard about the job other than dealing with the public.
good,I unloaded trucks in shipping and receiving it was a good job I always like to be at work I was working a shift 4 to 11 it was the best job I had but I don't know
good,Nothings perfect. Managers arent the best. Ok place to work for depending on location staff is friendly and caring. Dont work with you very much on set days if you change availabilty you get less hours. Even if scheduled for full time.
good,"They worked with my college schedule fairly well if given at least a week in advance. The problem was I was told multiple times after passing the management test that they would find me a management position or training position. Two years later, still nothing. They just baited me with a possible promotion but in the end they never even let me try out other departments."
good,Pays the bills and taught me alot thru out the years. Management was ok nobody is perfect. Working there had its ups and downs like im sure every job has.
good,Walmart needs to hold a training at least once a year for the managers to teach them how to handle customers as well as associates. The managers in some stores are never on time when it comes to opening up certain departments for vendors and customers. Cashiers and customers have to wait several minutes before cashing out because money is not prepared on time. If a customer has an issue and wants to speak to a manager the customer is kept waiting to at least 20 minutes for a manager respond.
good,"fun workplace, meet a lot of great co-workers, management needs some major improvement and more respect for their employees. Other than that Wal-Mart is wonderful."
good,"Walmart is a very good place to work, the only thing about Walmart is their management skills are terrible. The CSM are careless and rude about employee and customer. The Head Managers are also Jacka** when it come to helping other with a situation or needing time off for a family issues. Walmart could be a great place if they hired some more people who take their job serious and equal to others."
good,"I loved working for the law office.  I was able to work on my own, at my own pace.  I worked with awesome co-workers.  The only downfall was the amount of stress placed on us daily."
good,"Walmart is a place of loud and friendly people but in reality I'm not fit for retail I'm really into sales. I learned how to mix paint , make keys and even cut fabric but there's levels of respect and people don't to much care about."
good,Wal-Mart was a good place to work. Management was very organized and always knew how to help when needed. when other positions were open they would alert us all.
good,Deil saleas werehouse cashier it was nice to work at walmart it was a little hard but I did it walmart is a good place to work nice co-working I like work in the deil
good,My job was to stock the shelf and make sure its all zoned and unload trucks as well I did not mind the job some days it got to me a lot but it was a ok job.
good,"i started here as my first job at the age of 14, i had alot of great experiances and met lots of new people, i worked hard everyday and become manager at age 17. A change in store managers is what made it a hostile environment. people are treated so cruel."
good,A typical work day is busy. Its what you make out of it. Being able to finish a task and put a smile on someones face or just see someone leave saying thank you gives a feeling of accomplishment.
good,"Enjoyed working with the customers and other co workers. Long and tiring job, Carts are heavy, especially when you had to push by hand..If in extreme weather, you would stop for a few minutes to catch you breath, the manager was yelling for you to get back out there.You tear your clothes, gloves and get drenched and sun burned. Lunches are too long. I don't need an hour for lunch, so you are actually there for 9 hours and paid for 8,. Never knew which manager was which. Didn't get my raise because of computer malfunction, then had to do computer work all over again and still had not gotten. No set schedule. I worked every holiday since I started. I felt like a robot just circling the parking lot for carts."
good,"Working here is nice as a good starter job. But I wouldn't make this a career. Not enough money to support a Family with only 20-30hrs, $9 an hr......"
good,"Fazia o registro e empacotamento das mercadorias, atendimento ao cliente e ajudava em funções no interior da loja."
good,"checking out customers, doing returns and check cashing along with stocking if needed breaks at appropriate times, usually pretty quiet"
good,My co-workers was the most enjoyable to me because it was like I was working with my family. It was fun most of the time a little fast paced but I liked it. On slow days we had to find stuff to do like clean or something to make the day not seem as if it was dragging.
good,Wal-mart is a wonderful place to begin in the work field. Thay are able to help you build and cultivate skills you previously had and the structure to their daily routine is upbeat and finely tuned within a working store environment. 9am morning meetings where they discuss the plan for the day and the sales from the day before. However the staffing is always lower then the needs of the store call for.
good,I learned so much about every area of the store i was in. Able to move to any area I wanted. Management is supportive in teaching and helping me advance. Multiple opportunities for advancement.
good,"I Worked Overnight, Had Our Nightly Meeting. Then Went To The Floor And Started Working, Good Night If They Give You All Your Freight For The Night, Bad Night If You Don't Get All Your freight At The Beginning Of The Night."
good,"There was never a consistent schedule, I was never given  the time to take the mandatory test, I would ask every day if i could take the test and was always told no. I was let go but promised my job back because i had to call out more than 4 days in a row because i was in the HOSPITAL! They said that I could have my job back but would have to Reapply. On top of that no one can work full time, not even the management . I never knew when i would work or for how long and being a disabled person trying to get back on my feet this made things very difficult for my home life, I missed doctors appointments very often even when i had requested the time off."
good,"I liked most aspect of the company, but Walmart needed to be better organized and treat their employers better.The management had favorite employees who were treated better than others. I was doing a customer service manager job, but was receiving a cashier's pay. The hardest part about my job was working with irate customers. I ejoyed working with many of the other cashiers."
good,"I've worked for Walmart on and off for 10 years at different locations and it really depends on your management team. Store mangers can either break or make a store. They have gone up in wage which is amazing but good luck with them and their polices on call in's."
good,"Walmart is a place where good job experience is gained but not a place you want to stay long. Working at this Walmart you can see the problems in this area, had problems with keeping the kids in the store paying customers, a lot of theft in this area."
good,Good company to work for if you have lots of time and energy. Pay is not so great. Need more money for employees who dedicate their time and life to such a large corporation.
good,Walmart was a good time pass. Customers were always right which was not always right. Walmart came bfore education which wasnt the case. I wouldnt go back as it stressed me out.
good,"serious job, serious environment long time career with alot of room to move up  friendly staff dedicated to making their customers happy long hours"
good,"I really liked my supervisors that were directly over me and my area of employment."
good,"Typically when employed at my location, my time there was bittersweet. There was certainly so much good affiliated with working here, from ample mandatory breaks, easy scheduling and capability to pick up shifts, friendly coworkers, helpful atmosphere when newly employed, and many perks of being an employee of wal-mart. As I had stated there was alot of good from this company, but unfortunately it was also accompanied by the bad as well, such as poor communication from management to their abundant staff, lack of supervision of the staff, the aforementioned ""perks"" (i.e. Only receiving them after being employed for a period of time longer than either 90 days or 6 months), all of this gave me some mixed emotions about my specific store. Overall It was a good place to start."
good,"el dia a dia del trabajo al principio se te complica pues no tienes idea de como se labora en la empresa pero al transcurso de los dia vas aprendiendo "
good,"e uma empresa que eu aprendi muitas coisas fora minha area de trabalho,onde convivi com pessoas diferentes e vc aprende, a respeitar seus semelhantes,aparte mais dificile e ao mesmo tempo a mais fácil e lidar com o publico."
good,"My day or "
good,I guess it depends on which Walmart because they are all different. I've worked at the Grimes and WIndsor Heights locations. My favorite one is the one in Grimes. I felt like I was more needed and I was actually in a department. At the Windsor Heights I feel like im just helping out In each department.
good,A day at Wal mart you really didn't know how your day was going to be I had a lot of rude people coming in my line but I would just smile and ask them how their day was and if they found everything okay I enjoyed a lot of my co workers management on the other hand was very hard to get anyone to help you if you need help and the hardest part about the job was not having enough lines open to ring customers out when they would have about 10 to 15 cashiers there a day
good,The overall management stinks. There is no communication between departments. If the managers did't like an employee there was no advancement . Employees not getting along.
good,"Easy to open the electronics department in the morning, had a lot of cleaning and stocking to do. Around 1pm it would customers would come in more and I would attend to them. I learned more about electronics , also learned a bit about management ."
good,"The store itself is a more or less toxic environment for people who are planning to advance in the world. My job was akin to the task of sisyphus. Every time I'd fixed anything, it was ruined immediately."
good,Good place to work if you are just starting out or are in High School. Not a suitable job for someone with a large family and needs to take time off for personal business.
good,A typical day at work consist of ringing up customers at a fast pace. I learned how to have patience with customers. Management is okay they try their best. My co-workers are very nice. There isn't a hard part of the job for me. Something I enjoy the most when doing this job is conversing with customers.
good,"At Walmart they really don't ask for much. You come to work every day and do your job. Just like any other place for work for. Walmart does not pay a lot, but its a decent company to work for."
good,"I absolutely loved working with customers and taking care of their needs. The job itself was a great learning experience and a lot of fun. Unfortunately, after I had my daughter, I was unable to return to work based on the fact that hours were not guaranteed and varied way too much."
good,"Id been working for walmart for 7 years, i had enough of the cutting hours and poor management. Seems like everyone is only concerned with getting a big bonus."
good,"Dealing with the public and staff was all was interesting. and creative."
good,This was my 1st time working Retail. Wal*Mart has great Sales Associates and Front End People. The days were a steady flow of merchandise to be stocked. I enjoyed working Freight.I can use a Telzon and Printer as well as a pallet jack and baler. I can read upc codes and do full mod set ups. Learned to pull as well as bin.I also learned to Cashier and quit enjoyed that...My favorite part of the job was my co workers and the customers.
good,"Wasn't a bad place to work. I got to choose my own hours, and I got to meet many people that I wouldn't have talked to if I didn't work there. The only problem I had at that wal-mart was I didnt feel as if I was needed whatsoever. Maybe just a personal thing."
good,Slow environment. Drama full. Management isn't fair with reviewing termination reasons.
good,"Would have been better with better managers. The actual job itself wasn't bad, I liked being able to work with the customer and my co workers were great. Over all besides management it was pretty good."
good,"I would have to say there has been a great appreciation for working in this company. This was my first full-time job after high school. There was little real life experiences that I was aware of that Walmart helped me realize. I learned to work with MANY different customers and mastered social interactions as well as social skills. I learned problem solving skills, and even how to think outside the box. The pay was not the best, and the work was overwhelming, but the experience was amazing."
good,"Working at Walmart is fast-paced, but also a great environment."
good,did not like working overnights compensation was not good for hours worked
good,"Not my favorite place to work, had a hard time trying to get hours in as well as going to school and it just seemed that management didn't want to work with me, though I did love working with the people."
good,"it was highly stressful, couldnt talk to management ever, schedule seem to change without notice what so ever. it was difficult to move up the chain in the store. felt more like just another person instead of the store caring or acknowledge how much work staff does."
good,"Wal-mart is a very challenging place to work, but it does haves its perks."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,it is like working for a grocery store but selling other goods
good,"Good part-time job to just get some income. Co-workers were the best part. Managers could be good or bad, just depends."
good,They are good to work with.They try to work around the schedule.
good,"A typical day is busy and fast paced, at any given time you have to cover a  sub-area or your work area, send associates to break or take a complicated customer concern with thick skin and find an absolute resolve swiftly. I learned a lot. I learned how to be more courteous and empathetic to all the things customers are concerned. "
good,"With new schedule your Work/life balance is very poor with very little weekends off"" (in 122 reviews)"
good,It was a job that was okay at times workload was always heavy so you really had to come to work with plenty of rest
good,I have nothing to comment about Wal Mart. I do not feel they are sympathetic at all about missing work due to illness of any kind. Every thing else is okay at WalMart except for that in my opinion. You have the opportunity for your pay to go up every six months. You get occasional bonuses.
good,"	Provided excellent customer service"
good,typical day was for me was to unload the trucks that came in daily and transfer them to the sales floor. select items to go to sales floor and inventory. I learned how to balance/select from the inventory in the back room. Some of my co-workers were the best people I have ever work with. the hardest part of my job was when a lot of my co-workers want to call out from work at the same time.
good,"I love Wal-Mart and Wal-Mart's customer's but this entire company needs a clean sweep done on all of their management! This company is already HUGE and still has so much potential but it will fail eventually if someone doesn't redirect management soon! Wal-Mart needs to be more customer oriented and show appreciation for customers, at least acknowledge them!!"
good,4 stars it is been great experience working for this company and meeting the great people. I can only say good things about that particular store I worked not all Walmart in general.
good,"A typical night at walmart overnight is just work work work.. I've haven't learn anything about this company.. That Mgr like to disrespect the associate and get away with it.. Some co-workers are great to work with and some are not.. The overnight crew is not that hard what so ever, no l do not like my job. Its just paying my bills."
good,"Working the register and working in five different departments before I moved to overnight stock was normal. After I moved overnight, I was expected to work my department, maybe two more, still work a register and have everything done before I went home. The hardest part was having to work my department  and these other areas while getting in trouble with management because I didn't finish my work. Unfortunately, this is a company wide problem."
good,"very busy, I learned how to work better with customers, management could be better, co-workers were mainly amazing, hardest part of the job was an unsteady schedule, most enjoyable part of the job were the people"
good,it was very hard for me to even be able to see my son working this job. ten hour shifts over night. they work you down to the bone but it paid kind of okay. i loast a lot of weight working here too.
good,"Walmart is very fun to work for you will have a good time. I learned how to be a good manager and lead a team of guys to victory. Management was not together, to much micro managing. Co-workers made the day go by will help out when needed. The hardest part of job was all merchandise for the season change would pile up and have no place to put it."
good,Ambiete laboral muy pesado dado a los diferentes subgerentes de las tres areas y a los conflictos o chismes laborales.
good,"A typical day of work consisted in processing returns, exchanges, money transfers, & customer issues. I've learned how to deal with a lot of money, different personalities, and different ways on how to go about certain situations. Management was very good. My co-workers were very outstanding. Hardest part of my job was having to be on the phone for up to an hour with Moneygram on a transaction that wasn't successful on there end. The most enjoyable part of this job was fulfilling the customers needs."
good,"greet customers"
good,working for walmart on webb chapel is very diffcult and the management team was not helpful at all there was no proper training
good,"This one night my mothers house caught fire, i was off and a shift leader penciled me in to work when i came to let management know i would need a day or two off mseeings how all my clothes burned with the house.i wanted to get my check to get some clothes and a room. the shift leader told me i was fired if i couldnt work. Again i just told her what just happened, the fire trucks where still at our house you could litteraly hear the sirens still going!!!! Really?!"
good,Waiting on all types of customers with millions of different views
good,gostei de poder atender as pessoas e desenvolver minha comuniçáção com o publico e tb desenvolver novas abilidades.
good,They are a very good store. I enjoyed working with the people in my department but I felt there were way too many employees and it made it difficult.
good,"It was alright. For the most part it was a good and comfortable place to work. Some of the managers could have been in tune to what was going on, but other than that the company was a great place to work"
good,"I love walmart, the invironment, the customer, the employees are also great as well."
good,"Would go clock in and get your assignment for the shift you were doing. Unfortunately I did not learn anything new at this job,the management was not as professional as what I have experienced in the past from former jobs. The hardest part of the job was dealing with allot of gossip which I don't like at all. Once again the best part of the job was meeting new people and making my customers happy."
good,This was an overnight position with great employees but horrible supervision.
good,"I liked working for this company, just certain employees were a little difficult to work with and for."
good,é uma empresa boa de trabalhar so que o salario é baixo e nao tem muita valorizaçao no plano de carrereira na empresa aplicado.
good,The management paying favorites was not the best experience or when they are garbing you as well.  It was a great place to work and always keeping busy.
good,a typical day is hard buy I miss my co worker they mad it a fun place to work
good,well i would start my day by checking to see if i had any pms.that were due if so i would start doing my pms alot of times i would stop to catch a service call  then go back to working on my pms  then i may have issures with some of them like on forklifts where i would have to maybe change brakes and replace brushes in motors. i would all so help my coworkers if they needed asisantence on what ever they were working on.  also ran weekend shift for about 2 years as the only mechanic on site.
good,"A typical day would be base on if there was a truck that night,if there was a frieght needed to be process and push to the salesfloor daily.Customer service had to be provided no matter what was going on.Management mostly work against you no one was on the same plan which caused and causes much confusing.The hardest part of the job was working there knowing you could be let go for just about anything weather your fault or not and most can from fellow workers it was never the customer.But to put a smile on the customer face was the most enjoyable part of the day."
good,"customer service, water flowers, cashier, stock shelves"
good,"My shifts are mainly filled with clean up from the entire day that didnt get done by the previous shift. Have to process all claims (toxic waste) correctly which is a tedious and lengthy process. Making sure all department returns are put away neatly, as well as trying to zone the merchandise to look neat. Stocking freight is a task that is on a need to do kind of basis. Customers routinely ask for specific items that we are out of stock of on the shelves, so i will go do a quick check of our inventory and see if we have it and retrieve it for the customers. good co-workers are hard to come by. but I make do with what i havle and am stil able to get the job done efficiently."
good,"I was a cashier in lawn and garden. I loved learning about plant, trees and the products used on the lawns"
good,"First started out as a cashier and then during holidays would end up in Jewelry department for translator. I then was asked if I would like to apply for the opening for the position? I took it. I liked that we could advance in this company. The only thing I didn't like was the management, I had a problem and went to 7-8 different managers and they did nothing. Instead I had a D day. I didn't think it was fair."
good,My typical workday consisted of:
good,"very productive, fun workplace. learned people skills, learned how to deal with different situations."
good,"Overall nice place to work except management wasn't always the most friendly and you never knew what days you would be working. Schedule constantly changed, mid-shift hours (11-8) took up most of my day. Weren't very good hours since I am a parent but would be ideal for single person."
good,Work was enjoyable but management was unorganized and indecisive.
good,"The shift would start out at 10 pm and it would start with a team meeting. We would then be placed in a department and be dismissed. I learned how to take inventory, stock shelves by using upc's and a telxon. I also learned how to use a pallet jack and a cardboard baler. The managers were good at their jobs and helped whnever they were needed. Some of the co-workers worked hard but others hadnt done their job so I would stay late to get the work done. the hardest part of the job aould be to meet the time that you are given. the most enjoyable was to be able to work and conversate with the other workers and I loved doing my job."
good,"Pretty good place to work, But not a lot of job security. Get information from the customers what they needed for their car. i data in put into a hand held computer and that sent it to the tech's and they do what the information on the computer they use. and after that i test the tire pressure, clean out their car. drive the car out after the tech's changed the oil/put on tires / rotating the tires."
good,I liked my coworkers but the management was horrible well at least at my last Walmart but I guess they did there best.
good,Managers have favorites they look out for while issuing trailers to unload. Productivity requirements hard to reach weekly.
good,"Working as a cart pusher, i felt that we did not get any respect. We had to endure the hard weather elements. I have learned how to treat customers with the outmost respect, i have made several friends. My typical day was 2pm-11pm or 1pm-10pm"
good,"The managers might all pull you in different directions, swaying you from more important tasks to different areas of the store."
good,"Uma empresa onde temos a grande capacidade de aprender sobre varejo, os departamentos operacionais são abertos para visita e aprendizado, um excelente local para se adquirir experiência, os valores da cultura são diariamente cobrado dos colaboradores."
good,WORK WORK WORK. That's all they want you for and they don't take into consideration your school schedule. They just give you your hours and expect you to work them even though you explained to them several times that you have classes.
good,"enjoyable place to meet people and provide them with great service, as well as friendly associates and managment"
good,I was hired on to work the Christmas holiday. I was told it was temp and I knew that it might not be perminate but when I was told to go home and that they no longer needed me I wondered if they could have told me how I was as a worker and if they let me go because they had to many workers... The managers were not easy to talk to and seemed frustrated and I don't feel like they trained me enough so that I would know my job well enough
good,"It was a team work environment, every day you learn something new."
good,a typical work day is very busy. I enjoyed most about the job is meeting new people
good,Fill Milk and Eggs. Talk to Dept manager for things to be done.
good,always busy i learned cash register management never listens to you
good,not a good place for frist time workers very fast pace management or very understanding and the co-worker or fun to work with
good,I am a cashier and I enjoy helping people this is what I do. I learn to deal with different types of people and my management is always working only available if there is a dire emergency. My job is not hard at all.
good,A typical day for me would be taking a brief walk by of my three departments that I managed. Speak with my associates to see if its any thing that they need or if there were any concerns that they had. Then i would proceed to scanning my bins and putting out my frieght for my departments.But the best part about my job was helping my customers and the hardest part was trying not to get overwhelmed.
good,Fun workplace and interesting customers; fun to interact with repeat customers.
good,loved working with my co-workers we all worked nice together helped picking out clothes and setting up models.helped customers find outfits and shoes.
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work for, the management is very poor and not as helpful as I would like them to be in most situations."
good,"Alguns colegas são pessoas ótimas, outros são arrogantes e nem olham pra sua cara. A gerência não é nem um pouco boa pois ele apenas se importa com a loja e não com os funcionários. O local de trabalho é ótimo, o problema é que você não exerce apenas uma função."
good,My co-worker were easy to get along with and they would always be there to get you a helping hand.
good,"When I arrive to work. I walk around my department to look for outs and scan them to see if avaliable in the backroom. I am trust with price changes and mods. I mirco manage some other associates, they came to me and ask what to do."
good,"I helped maintain the counts on all the overstock the store had. I would pull items as need to replenish the shelves. I helped with stocking and preparing all the merchandise for the new MODs (Displays). I helped maintain the cleanliness of the back room as well as the store when I was on the sales floor. I would also help any customer I can into contact with while I was restocking or on the floor at anytime. The management there is typical management. they do rotate the departments they manage about every 6 months or so so it is a little trying to go from the standards and rules one one to another. My co workers were willing to help and understood the tasks we needed to achieve and were willing to team up to make sure that they all got done. The most enjoyable part of my job was working in the back room I loved the ""behind the scenes"" aspect of it. I loved being able to really see how the company works from that end and I loved my coworkers."
good,long hours and very minimal rewards the managment is not helpful they point and you shoot employees are rude and lazy they dont care lots of favoritism with managment.
good,"stocking the cake case, decorating the people cake orders, cleaning, taking orders, making suggestions to the customers. I learned how to understand what the customer was needing without them trying to explain it all, co-workers was very helpful, i really enjoyed the look on the customers face when they received their order and it was done better than they had expected, especially the children, hardest part of the job was always a dissatisfied customer."
good,"Wal-Mart always claims to be a ""family"" company; but the moment you need time off for a family emergency, you get written up. A typical day at work was fast-paced and energetic, but stressful also. Management sucked. They were never willing to help and when they did, they berated you. They refused to work with schedule changes or time off. My co-workers were great--mostly. The hardest part of the job was remaining calm and patient and keeping a smile on my face when I just didn't want to. The most enjoyable part of the day was seeing my regular customers who always put me in a good mood."
good,"To hard to advance, I exceed expectations for evaluations, but I just can't get up the ladder as well as I'd like too."
good,"parttime management didnt like to do there job i meant lots of friends, i learned bout being a better customer service"
good,I loved my time at the farmington location. They always worked with me on my hours. Most of management was easy to get along with. Very close knit crew.
good,I love working there.. I think its a great learning experience for the real world.
good,they worked with my schedule and gave me a work schedule that fit my needs.
good,Fun place to work. Co-workers were amazing. Management needed more work on getting the right information to other management. Communication was not great.
good,I miss the coworker I had met at walmart I wish I could get my job back one day I love workin for Walmart
good,"I loved working there, great place, the majority pf employees were nice, easy to get along with. As far as management, needs to improve a good amount. The environment was very laid back, I made a lot of friends and learn many things as well."
good,Love the job. Management leaves much to be desired. Pay is not sufficent to survival if single and on your own.
good,"If you are attacked and defend yourself you will be terminated."
good,After my first and only promotion there wasn't anymore opportunity for advancement. The constant changes leave positions eliminated and job security is rare no matter your position
good,"It's a beginners job. I didn't see myself retiring there. Overall, the supervisors were fair with life outside of the working environment. They were able to work around things."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart’s different departments that gave me more experience from counting  and balancing the registers daily, sales associate whenever needed and  greeting customers"
good,"A multi facet position, that is the ultimate human resource representative. Requires flexibility and ability to adapt quickly to change and encourage it."
good,Love a lot of the people that worked for me and the community. At times I felt that some managers dictates the mood in the store. It was easy to leave for my own sanity. If you find the right store you will love your job.
good,"Walmart a great job to work at you have your days but I wouldn’t trade "
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart just interacting with customers and coworkers, I enjoyed most of my day, helping customers in everything they needed. I learned so much from customer service, and training the company provides to keep our focus on what we should do. I didn't find anything hard about the job itself. Managers were the only ones that really didn't like to interact with the employees, they only interact with employees to give orders., they didn't talk to employees in a friendly matter, I like all my coworkers, we were all hard-working employees."
good,"This was a good company to work for and the benefits are good. Unfortunately, management killed the old company culture. High turnaround due to a stressful enviroment and job security."
good,"Company allows their associates to try new things to ensure they are in a role that fits their interests, but primarily skill sets to be successful.  In recent years there has been a lot of change in how we work, which is a driving force for the Company to move forward to achieve the best possible outcome for their share holders."
good,"The jobs can be wonderful if associates could communicate better. Managing is a big thing that needs to be fixed, there is no mutual agreements. Employees get pulled all around for areas they do not work in."
good,"Overall walmart paid amazingly for cashiers. However i was in school, while working here. The manager did not listen to my finals schedule and scheduled me during 3 finals. Had to quit because she wouldnt change the schedule and move me off of my finals times."
good,"If you like having a obvious top down chain of command, then Walmart is the place for you! management can be a pain sometimes depending on the store, but otherwise a calm atmosphere."
good,My job at Walmart isnt all it use to be I have been trying to get moved into another area of this store since February of this year and to move up for management you have to take a test which i feel is stupid .Im tired of working with certain management and getting hollered at daily
good,Best introduction to retail and stocking there is if one is serious due to the high volume of customers and freight. More difficult and rewarding than the other options out there.
good,"Walmart is a company that benefits people that are looking for a career. It offers benefits such as stock, 401k, insurance and they even have a partnership with several colleges to help you get a degree."
good,"I mean its walmart.....The pay is decent ,but management is not fair and most of the employees at my store were snobby. The pay was pretty good I guess it was just the people"
good,"Coworkers were relaxed and willing to help each other. The fact that there are many different managers means that they will each give different directions to employees and you will take the blame if something is not done for a different manager. Pay, however, is decent for the job."
good,"-The management was bad and all over the place"
good,"Uma boa empresa,mais mal administrada."
good,No 10 pra empresa gostaria de volta a trabalhar lá na empresa de novo e minha cara lidar com o público tratava meus clientes bem
good,"First location was a market and i really enjoyed and moved up quickly. Then i went to a supercenter and nothing was in order. Everyone one wasnt on the same page, no communication. 1/10"
good,"Most managers were very understanding, approachable, and willing to listen to the concerns of their employees. The store is always kept nice and clean, and the customers are very friendly for the most part when asking for assistance."
good,"At first, it was stressful since you get to interact with rude and unkempt people. And with people who try to steal goods from the store and people who curse. But I tried to adjust to these kinds of situations. It is hard as well when it is already your time for a break and you are too tired and hungry and supervisors tell you to wait for your replacement as lines are long. Cashiers are also the ones who bag the items even  for customers who bring their own bags to the store. They just throw their bags on the belt sometimes rudely and expect you to bag the goods for them. "
good,Wouldnt let me switch positions after 2 years when they claimed I could after 6 months do not reccomend for long employment. But for short term or if you can tough it out being lied to go ahead
good,Hours and pay are horrible. No family life. Retail is one of the hardest jobs a person can have. If you are not a people person you shouldn't work there.
good,Walmart's pay is comparable to other companies.  Management are always there if a problem arises.  Staff is friendly for the most part.  It is an easy job to learn.
good,While it was alright to work there and i love it. It was too far for me to travel to everyday and they really didn't care if you had to take public transportation you were to be there on time even though the busses didn't run at the time they schedule you there. It's really stressful but worth it.
good,Its a ok place to work need better management but pay and insurance was decent.  Management Needs to communicate better with each other i would work at a different walmart if i ever decided to go back
good,The particular store I worked was poor managed overnights. I would recomend working here if you need a job. But not a career. They dont treat people the same. They have favorites. And friends come first. They dont alow you to interact with customers over night because they have a strict freight per hour worked program. Then when a customer complains they write you up or pull you into the office.  But if the walk the floor and see you
good,"Working at walmart was very intense.  They have horrible managers and some were very unprofessional, some had no compassion at all.  Most had bad attitudes.  Most didnt know how to talk to employees.  If you get a good manager then working at walmart was good."
good,"This company is unfair in a lot of ways, they say one thing then do something else, when "
good,Tiene muy buenas políticas el problema es quienes es tan ala cabeza de las tiendas el salario es muy poco y demaciado estrés laboral
good,"I wouldn't mind returning to Walmart in the furture, but it is kinda luck of the draw. Some stores are awesome and some are not. The turn over rate was fairly high in my store. After 6 months no one in my orientation group was still working there."
good,"Walmart was an ok job. "
good,The expectations for work performance are reasonable and most of management is easy to work with. Job advancement is not always fair. Co-workers are usually easy going and fun to work with.
good,"My job was very stressful, upper management was horrible. I felt like there was zero communication between associates and management. A lot of people didn't want to do their job. That being said, the pay was more then enough to get by."
good,It was and ok place to work it was just the different managements in the store that you worked at everyone was not equal if younwas and under dog you was just that and thats the way they treated you as that.
good,I ended up going to work super sick because I couldn’t afford to call out since I’ve only been working there for 3 months and they let me go because I had a seizure on the clock. They told me to bring a doctors excuse which I did and they told me I did not have a job any longer. The management was awful when I worked at this Walmart. I know all Walmart’s are not like this and I would love to work with them again. I loved my job and I enjoyed it! Being a cashier is tough but I loved it.
good,"Working here taught me how to be patient, with both customers and supervisors, even though some things may not be fair. It gave me more experience with working with people and different cultures."
good,Walmart is a good retail job if you get with the right management. Unfortunately i got stuck with a bad manager. I had nothing against him as a person still say hi in public and ask how his day is going. But as for a manager i cant work for someone who takes your hours and doesn't pay you for the ones worked. Lying to customers was something i caught him doing multiple times. I left the job because i was told i didn't have much time left.
good,Great place good people to work around and have a good time together I've been there for almost 6 years and there is definitely room to grow with this company
good,This job is good for people coming out of high school Orin it . It helps get some of the basics of growing up and being on ur own.work wasn’t to hard ether good starter job
good,"Wouldn't stay for too long, but overall it really isn't a bad job. Just make sure you look for something better while you are working there. But again not bad overall."
good,Empresa muito boa mas possui muitas coisas pra melhorar o trabalho dos funcionários
good,"If you are willing to commit a majority of your life to the company, you can move up in the company. There are too many regulations on every process within the daily routine and they change every few weeks."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to start a job, offers good learning opportunities for all the employment team. The benefits are ok, I don't think the best but they do offer some sort of benefits."
good,I really loved the job just the managment team was not the nicest  of them all and they had no means for growth eventho i was really one of there top dogs!!!
good,I enjoy my job at Walmart. I wish i had more time with my family and friends. I wish there was more paid vacations as we all do work very hard. Great benefits and bonuses!
good,walmart is ok for teenagers who are just starting out however it does not pay the bills of a working mother. there was no room for advancement when i was there.
good,Working with the associates teaching and training is amazing. When you can see the lightbulb go off and know that someone has learned because of you is the best.
good,"recently Walmart has undergone several policy changes that have severely changed the way associates operate at Walmart. the new PPTO system cut the amount of absences we have in half to replace it with an earn able currency only to use this as an excuse to coach people for using because of ""Productivity"". weather its management abusing power or a bad system remains unclear"
good,"My typical day at work is a meeting before unloading trucks then after unloading trucks we have a 15 minute break. Then we run freight until lunch. After lunch we continue running freight. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at the Neighborhood Market.  But management would tell you one thing,then turn around the next week and tell you something different.  I was never clear on my actual duties for my job as they would constantly change."
good,"Had terrible management, when orders piled up people got short as well as being the main store.  We were always handing out supplies to other small stores or running out."
good,"A typical day consisted of getting up to your till, and being yelled at if you brought anything other than yourself (such as a book or something for when they weren't busy - even if its homework). I learned that it doesn't matter what you do right, management will always play favoritism and choose others over you. Workplace culture was virtually nonexistent. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the awful managers, and the most enjoyable part of the job was going home."
good,"Working at Walmart was hard work, physical and emotionally.  If you needed to take a bathroom break outside of your normal break time, it was frawned upon."
good,Every day i walked in empting a eighteen wheeler full of stock for this company while tweleve to fifteen people watch so they can sort it instead of help. My managers didnt even know how or when i would get paid. And HR LOST MY LAST CHECK FOR A MONTH AND A HALF.
good,"Will never return to Walmart you have no life once you become management cant plan anything with family cause you might have to work a double, you work every weekend and holiday"
good,"Fast paced, stressfull environment. Most associates are friendly,  There is a high turnover of employees due to stress of job, theft, and strict attendance policy."
good,was an okay place to work in. but little job security. a typical work day depends on the shirt you work. the evening shift is usually the most stressful.
good,"My shift starts at 1pm every day, I have an option to clock in 7 minutes early  .After I clock in  "
good,the entire managment team sucks and doesnt give any effort to make the store better in any way and micro manages the whole store and the store is falling apart
good,Friendsly and always busy environment. Working to help customers everyday with a smile. Organizing and stocking sleeves with merchandise. Handling cash and cards at the register. Managers are easy going but also expects the person to get there job done.
good,I would be promised to be promoted but it never ever happen and I kept getting told that I would get promoted over and over again but it would never happen!
good,"Walmart can be a good place to work for young employees, and older employees. For a person trying to make a living, Walmart is not the best place, depending on the specific store. I have worked in 2 locations, and have noticed in some stores it is easier to move up in rankings than others. Also, everyone gets the same annual raise, which is unfair because some people work harder than others such as myself. It is not all bad. The hours fluctuate, sometimes they are great, other times they are scarce. The my share bonuses received ever quarter of the year are a plus as well."
good,"Foi uma experiência ótima trabalhar no Walmart ."
good,Typical day at walmart would be me getting assigned to a job for that day. Which would most likely be shelf stocking . and scanning the foods to make sure there in the right places.
good,"i honestly cant say much about it really, the managers dont really communicate on what to do, the associates helped me 90% of the time. other then that a typical day is just stocking, helping people find things, and backroom stuff"
good,A flexible work environment that keeps employees in the know regarding company changes. Management follows strict guidelines regarding employee development.
good,"A typical day would be assisting costumers to find what they have in mind to purchase. Being courteous and smiling was one of the best things. When people come in with bad attitudes you still have to smile was kind of hard, but over all customer service is a good thing."
good,Wal-Mart is a good paying job. But you work alot it's hard to find a family life. They are not very understanding with you home life. They would decline my requests for days off. I had to work the day after i had surgery because I would get fired if I didnt. But that's not every Wal-Mart or every manager. Most managers were understanding but some weren't.
good,"there are too many things I would have to say about this company that drive me crazy. Therefore, I will refrain from listing all of them. It was a decent college job but I will not stay here."
good,"A typical day at work was typical, really pretty much the same. "
good,"The job was fun i was a cashier but got let go because of a family emergency and i had just got hired 2 months prior.the pay was minimum wage.but your there for 9 hours 8 hours on your feet  and a 1 hour lunch break.as a cashier you have to do test on the computer and if you dont pass everythong within 90 days your fired.crazy right.the hammer lane location in Stockton,ca sucks.it was always dirty even as an employee i was cleaning constantly because the people who did cobacks where not putting the items back.people only work here because you can get  40hours plus"
good,I have work at Walmart for 2 years I started  straight out of high school It was a good first time job it has its pros and cons a pro is I really like my coworkers and my  Manager  works with my schedule con is Management never seem to be on the same team
good,I worked at walmart for 10 years and did end up moving up however the management doesn't like to give promotions very often. Its not about what you know at walmart it is who you know and how well you get in with the managers there. If they like you then they will give you more options for promotions and time off. But if they don't then you're sh** out of luck.
good,I did not care for the management on the 3rd shift. The hours were long and it was hard and dangerous working in the freezer. The time allotted for stocking was unrealistic.
good,The job was easy and  fun.  I got lots of hours until they started cutting everyone’s hours.  My customers loved me and I enjoyed serving them as well.  I love doing customer service.
good,walmart was one of the best jobs ive had im a great customer service person so it was a great fit for me and there was never a slow moment always busy
good,"Walmart was okay to work at. The pay was decent, my coworkers were friendly. Management was inconsistent and poorly executed. I'd recommend working here as a secondary option to other jobs."
good,"1st year very stressful,have to accumulate pto and  no sick or emergency nor accidents are acceptable.you recieve points if 10mins late,leave early or sick and call out 4points automatically terminate"
good,"Walmart is a decent job with good pay. It depends on your department, store and manager. Some managers are awesome, but a lot of them don't care. Overall, worth the pay."
good,"Wish there could have been better pay/low pay starting as cashier never got any raises//always felt like i begged for more time and managers were always nice respectable and trying to get the time for you if they had any time i was notified, just wish i recieved hire pay was all."
good,"There was always a lot going on and a high demand that needed to be kept. There is always something to do, something to prep, or someone to help.It's a great place to learn how to multi task"
good,Multiple managers do not everyone was 100% on the same page. Pay was decent. I didn’t like have to work weekends and not getting time with family and friends.
good,"It was an alright job. I was working night shift stocking shelves. It is very demanding on the body. At night, it was hard to stay awake. I ended up sleeping during my break."
good,"I enjoyed my experience at Walmart overall. I only left because while I was pregnant, I had a lot of problems with management compensating for my medical condition."
good,"This job was just basic grunt work. The people were always rude, and used us as examples for failure. Definitely not a fun work environment, but definitely a place that cares about your well being."
good,"Although I was a trusted, liked employee, my job was compromised by a rule that made me terminated. While I did a great job, this rule had all management hands tied."
good,They need to tell you when you are doing something right as well as wrong. More consistancy in management would be helpful. The associates in your department weren't necessarily to help you.Tthey had their own jobs assigned by management above you.
good,It was a joy but the way it’s set up it’s unfair if this company was more understanding to people’s needs it would be good.i would love to go back but nah
good,"when i worked here, the pay was good but the managers were terrible. nothing was really organized and merchandise was over ordered, meaning they ordered a lot of products even when there was no space to put anything. only really good thing was the pay."
good,"Work there for three years great company, customers are great.  Very reasonable with break times and pay is not confusing. The most difficult part of working at Walmart is keeping up with the workflow it's a very fast paced environment it requires quick thinking and hard work. what makes the work environment more stable is having good management without that then your store won't run very efficiently."
good,low amount of on floor help. forced to complete multiple tasked that should be management job. need to have professional knowledge of all electronics.
good,I actually enjoyed the job very much.  The combination of low hourly wages and no benefits is the killer there.  The schedules are very inconsistent so you cannot count on anything.
good,Grandfather had been airlifter to the hostpital from Mississippi to memphis anfd had to have emergency heart surgery i already had friday and satirday off but they would give me sunday off. I asked my manger she told me to come see her before i leave she locked me in my face as she walked out of the door to go home
good,I like working there I need more hours and a steady schedule.  I get to help a lot of people better their vision.  My manager is good to work for.  I have learned so much about the eye in order to help fit people in the type of lenses they need.
good,The management sucked. The people worked with was great. Just the management. I worked in the deli. I cooked and dealer with customers. The hours were ok
good,Walmart was a great job although the training was contradicting. The store manager woulf teach our position one way and department managers would teach another.
good,"Walmart is a very nice job, the pay just isn't very good. When I did work at walmart my manager was very mean & inconsiderate.  There were days when I was in the hospital for the flu & I tried to return my doctors notes & they told me THEY WEREN'T going to accept them, So I was left with points, which caused me to be terminated."
good,A typical day is pretty laid back because the work is not that hard. The managers make your job harder than it may seem. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the managers.
good,"Jobs are demanding due to customer volume, but laid back until holidays and special events.  Physically demanding at times.  High turnover in management and employees."
good,"Good place to work but some of the other employees weren't that willing to help you if you needed it. But most of the time they were helpfull, and showed you the correct way to do something. The managers were the same way most of the managers were willing to help and wanted to see you succeed wanted to help you excel in the position you were in to push you to move up in the cumponey. But there were others who just give you the least amount of training to get you started and that is about all they do and they aren't all that helpfull when you need it, or don't explain the tasks to you and expect you to just know what to do."
good,"My time at Walmart, for the most part, was satisfactory. However, the closer my departure from the company came, more problems began to arise. I continually received conflicting instructions from managers, who in turn, reprimanded me in turn for choosing between who’s orders to follow. This mainly came into play when concerning overtime."
good,Vision center management never held accountable for behavior and was very judgement and like to gossip and make fun of other employees with other vision Center associates. Very unprofessional and never held accountable.
good,"I was always blessed, worked with wonderful associates but encountered some difficulty with amount work versus  associates availability. Overall I am very grateful for everything I learned and for all the opportunities."
good,"Walmart is  a fun place to learn and grow. its fast pace and always something to do. the down fall is Managers. they are always on a power trip and most does not even try to get to know you as a person. Like I said not a bad place but poor leadership in most areas."
good,"Hardest part of the job was trying to balance work and school when the manager wouldn't work with your school schedule. His opinion was since my classes was online, I didn't need any extra time for school work."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Like any job, there are good and bad things. I try to focus on the good things. I do A LOT of walking and enjoy helping customers and answering questions about anything electronic or computer related. I have a great deal of knowledge of both."
good,Un excelente ambiente de trabajo como empacador voluntario
good,I worked at Walmart for about a month or so. It was around the holiday season so it was temporary. I didn’t have any bad experiences though. I would have applied again but It was my senior year in high school and I started college after graduating.
good,"Working at Walmart is not for everyone.                                       "
good,Walmart is one of the most global companies ever. There is never a non working moment when younare on the clock. It is a very fast paced business and place to work.
good,Walmart is a great first job for teens to get a real feel of how people act and what a terrible job feels like to really motivate them that this type of job is not a job you want for the rest of your life. All in all it was a terrible experience but a great opportunity to learn.
good,"They paid you well , but it was faced paced management didnt really have your back , and very competive . A typical work day was coming in check cake orders. Get a hair net on wash hands get the cakes out that i needed . Start orders get them caught up answer to customers and try to get back stock before the end of my shift ."
good,I really do love Walmart i have been their for sometime now and i love what i do their. i love the people and the workers in come cases.. the only bad part is i don't like the mangers their. they act as if they are better than you and they talk down on you as if you are nothing.. they are not about the customers and that's the sad part. all i can say if Sam was here he would be very upset.
good,"Greeted Customers as they entered the Stores, Sweep and mop front end areas (including Cashier Stations).  Painted Walls and different areas around store.  Assistant Managers would stop me and have me do something else, then the original manager would be angry at me because I had not finished, tried to explain, but only the Store Manager would listen, but it never made a lot of difference over a short period of time it was right back where it was."
good,I worked in a couple different departments and I had fun it was a good learning experience and I enjoy working the different departments rather than just staying in one. Other associates were good friends too.
good,Une bonne atmosphère de travail et un environnement
good,"I struggled to expand my horizons, change positions, and even get more hours. The manager I had was a jerk, but the other managers not above me were wonderful people. I don’t recommend sticking around for a long time, but it’s a good temporary workplace."
good,"Policies are always changing and it's kind of annoying. It's typically very fast paced and stressful. If you're a people person that works well with chaos, this is for you."
good,"I started out as a cashier. Then the spring of 2018 they grand opened the online grocery. I became a personal shopper for locals in the area. We shopped for the groceries that they ordered online and then delivered to their car. I learned all about that aspect but not much else. Minimal training. The management did not care about you. I felt picked on numerous times, and there was favoritism that was blatantly showed. The hardest part of the job for me was working with people who were not professional or wanted to be apart of a team."
good,My job as a cashier was exciting because i was able to meet new people and work on a team and learn how to make customers happy. Another plus I learned to work in the customer service area. Which was new and exciting.
good,Walmart would be a great place to work if the pay was good. The store is not manage right. If the managers would listen to their department associates thing would be so much smoother
good,Way to easy for management to gang up And run u out. Like they said who’s badge u think their going to believe? Not all are bad but the ones who are team up and protect each other.
good,"Every day was different as I was a cashier and a sales associate.  While working as a sales associate in the frozen/dairy section I also served as a backup cashier and helped unload trucks.  Just about everyone is very friendly and great team members.  There was nothing hard about the job, I would have just like to have had fulltime hours.  I loved the diversity in being able to help out in other areas of the store, and mostly assisting shoppers in my area."
good,Some of my managers didn’t show up so I would have to take on the position and it was really stressful whenever I couldn’t do things that only a manager could do
good,"The best part of this job was having the chance to work with customers of all kinds. I always loved finding those people who you made such an impact on they are willing to seek you out over anyone else."
good,"Easy place to start for people looking for a first job , or wanting to learn and do different things . It’s a very fast paced workplace , gotta be quick on your feet & a quick learner"
good,"It's a good place to work, there is no pay increase after your first 90 you get one pay bump and that's all you receive. It's a nice place to work for something full time or even part time. Benefits im not sure of."
good,"I really liked my job.  If the co-manager would have stayed out of the backroom so much, id still be there. I understand they have to inspect & consult, etc, but she was riding us, like we werent doing our job! We were! They just order waaaayyyy too much stuff!  Expects 15 pallets of overstock, that gets sent out nightly to put on shelves just to come right back to the back because it is too much of the same thing, to be binned every night or 2 nights, along with the new stock daily. No. Cant be done, sorry."
good,I loved my job. But the hourly workers aren't acknowledged as much as the salary. The absent policy is terrible. But working with new customers and the fast pace was great for me.
good,It was more of a teenage job and I am looking to pursue in a career where i can move my way up. I would bring merchandise from the back and distribute it out onto the isles.
good,Its was a good job for beginner not good for someone trying to leave a good life and provided to there family and still be able to live and not from check to check.
good,It's an ok first job. But you shouldn't let the managers and or the teenagers get to you. As long as you come in clean and stay clean your fine. But cause problems and you'll be in some serious trouble.
good,"As an associate at Walmart we were like family but as the company grow and diversify, we lost the caring for the associates. "
good,"It is a good company to work for, unfortunately management needs improvement. I would have liked to stay but there was no improvement or help at all for me."
good,"Easy job. Management is OK."
good,"The management at the walmart I worked at was terrible but the people were really friendly and super helpful if you werent sure how to do something, its honestly like a family."
good,"When the store was busy it would make time go quickly. Breaks would be delayed if management forgot or there wasn’t someone to take over, even if it wasn’t busy."
good,i believe that my time at Walmart was good not that stressful it was just the time there was too little and they didn't even bother in calling you back or considered you when re applying .
good,Great as a company to work for but  do to bad attitudes  poor management and poor leadership skills (assistant managers and personnel) it would be a last resort if ever in need of a job
good,no benefits cutting hours was working 20 hrs a week now 5 hrs a week. not enjoyable always stressful poor management doesn't treat people equally do not care about employees
good,"I am specific about workplace at Walmart in Forest Lake, Minnesota. I worked briefly with them and I can say in CAP II the management style was intimidation from the supervisors on performance. They set targets that are unrealistic. For example, you are told to stock shelves with 4 pallets of cereals in 3 and half hours. Their timing is one minute fifteen seconds per carton. This time takes into consideration walking to pick the carton from the cart, scanning the carton to find the quantity on shelf and location, and then stocking the goods onto the shelf.Most time the scanner will tell you that you have more quantity on the floor but when you do a physical check there is nothing on the floor, The inventory record is just not accurate,"
good,"Job it's self is alright, management and culture are the problems here. Management pushes people until they quit and do not care about their employees."
good,"In the pharmacy Department they took away fun atmosphere when new management came it was more strong serious atmosphere if  professionalism be on your p's and q's dot your I's and cross all your t 's. Every day you came into work it was something else new whether  if it was a new sop you never heard of that was being enforced or the preference of the DM wanted a certain look and a certain workplace,"
good,"I worked in the dairy/frozen area of the Superstore Walmart downstacking pallets, and placing refrigerated and frozen groceries into the walkin refrigerators and freezers and placing the overstock into the larger refrigerators and freezers. I learned how to keep up with the work pace continuously in a timely fashion. The management were, for the most part, micromanagers and treated everyone like children. The workplace culture considered customers first and right all the time. We had to keep an eye out for customers which needed help and the managers expected us to leave our stocking duties to assist them but also complete our stocking tasks completely. Dealing with the managers was the hardest part of the job. Most of the time, my most enjoyable part of the job were the customers."
good,there were some managers who didn't get along well with everybody but overall the experience was okay. its hard to move to a different department. I liked that we were able to get discounts.
good,"Working for Walmart was a good experience, everyday wasn't terrible. I enjoyed my co-workers in my department but the supervisors and managers were extremely difficult to deal with."
good,"You're in charge of the register you're working with. Keeping track of the money. On busy days you better be prepared to not move from your spot for the minimum of an hour. I've learned to work independently. At Walmart it's all on you, there's no depending no someone else. When you do have a question there is a manager right there to help instantly. The hardest part about working at Walmart is the amount of time I spend with my family. I get one day off during the work week and work every weekend when everyone else has off. I enjoy working during the busy hours. I like the fast pace environment and communicating with customers. I enjoy the family feel at Walmart."
good,It's a stressful place to work if you're an assistant manager or manager. They have good benefits and depending on your position the hours for your schedule are pretty good. They have a lot of long-term Associates that enjoy working for them.
good,In the bakery I learned so many things about breads and cakes that I never thought about. The older ladies in the bakery were really kinda and patient if you had no experience.
good,"A typical day in jewelry is always fun with assisting customers in finding beautiful accessories to wear or finding wedding rings for lovely new couples. Although the work environment with other associates can be difficult, as when a new associate comes into the clique, they either welcome you or decide they want you out."
good,"Managers are encouraging. When you try questioning them  they get butt hurt & someone always losing their job, & its not their fault . God forbid you have an opinion or think for yourself, they'll find any reason under the sun to fire you. Doesn't matter that you do your job and you do it well, they just want minions that do what they're told. They set ridiculous unattainable goals and expect you to do it with no help."
good,From what I see some people are really trying to make a living. Then you have those people that are just walking around doing nothing. So as a costumer ask if someone are myself if we need Help
good,I was told it was easy to advance. I took the job and learned to the best of my ability and when it came time for promotions I was told that I had not put in enough hours to get a vacation or any insurance. My schedule was completely open and had no restrictions. I was there everyday I was scheduled so lack of advancement was the company holding me back and not wanting to promote. If you don't want to promote then don't offer it!
good,"Great starting job. Entry level, should be willing to learn  and not lazy if this is a place for you to start. Hours could have been better but definitely can grow as a person here."
good,Go to work and do your job.  If you do not know anything just ask someone whose knowledgeable about the job.  I really enjoyed helping the customers and being available for the team.
good,Good teamwork while unloading trucks and out stocking on the floor. Breaks were a good time to relax and get to know the other associates. Whenever I had a question it was easy to ask a member of management.
good,"The support and communication is poor. This is a busy and exciting place to work, but overall a let down. You can make good money here if you have a thick skin."
good,Fast paced environment.  Many meetings scheduled throughout course of day.  Multiple levels of management with decision rights which slowed down development process.
good,Empresa varejista com grande oportunidade em vendas.e crescimento mas precisa mudar algumas politicas.
good,review sales and payroll from previous day and see what the current day sales and payroll are.  
good,it was a nice job i was matnace there on days was able to move around the store at my own pace to get everything clean in the store and as long as it was done there was no issues with that.
good,"A typical day at Wal-mart is from 7 am-4 pm. "
good,"I enjoyed the work, so many people coming and going all time. i asked repeatedly for more hours and consistant schedule. I was flexible and could go in for anyone who was sick or needed off- but they didnt allow that. i never had a chance to advance to full time permanent employee because i feel they hired too  many employees at one time. i  needed more hours and better schedules."
good,A good place to get experience working in retail. I had good and bad experiences. Most of my good experience was with my co workers. One of the managers I worked with would like to micro manage certain individuals. Though unfortunate it is an okay place to work. I would go back if the opportunity presented itself.
good,The environment is fast paced and you always have something to do. My issues with the job are with the employees and not the business itself or their policies.
good,"i met a lot of good people their and had some run'ins with the type of work it is. i always felt confident in my job and safety though. Most of my time there was outside the building., keeping public safe and ready to assist inside Lost Prevention. I would have like to do more inside the store, with the blend in approach."
good,"Not to much to say, about them. Wal-mart will make you hard, with good pay. However, it a good job with great benefits. Great schedule to work with..."
good,"Atendente de caixa era passando os produtos do cliente no caixa. A rotina era normal "
good,"I have nothing bad to say about any one that I worked with, or management.   The company just did not work with the schedule I needed to keep for my family."
good,"I worked with a lot of great people but the management was lazy and bias. I, as a part time cashier was training other people and helping the managers (CSMs) do their jobs."
good,A typical day at Walmart would be very fast track. You're in contact with a lot of people constantly moving. Managers are always near for reassurance.
good,I found Walmart to be somewhat contradictory of itself. I did learn how to handle difficult situations and always gave my best. This company was just not right for me.
good,Hardest working and best employees are treated like junk. Their 15 minute breaks are watched. Employees are childish and y’all behind your back. Good with schedules after you remind them only a thousand times.
good,"alright place to work if you just go do your job and go home. stay out of the drama and it'll be okay, to be honest its better to see for self. my review is just of my personal experience."
good,"It was always the same thing while at work. I didn't learn much, especially not from the managers. Management was always being unfair and didn't know how to speak to their employees as individuals at times. The workplace culture is okay. I mainly stayed to myself. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up and bringing pallets to the back at the end of the night. The most enjoyable was the hour break."
good,"Hard work for little paay, never have enough people in any department to keep up with workload. Repetitive offenders as far as dress codes, some people are dirty looking and smell bad and no one says anything to them"
good,"Lo tipico del trabajo era hacer la misma funcion de cobro"
good,Poor pay for the 5 jobs I was required to do there. Upper management was virtually non existent when it came to support. Definitely a corporate mentality. Stepping up in the company was a very difficult process with too many hoops to jump through.
good,"It's the same thing every night stocking product and zoning product the manager isn't bad but could use people skills, the hardest part of the job is dealing with the manager and the support, the most enjoyable part of the job is that its fast paced and there is always something to be done."
good,"sometimes its fun cashiering when it gets busy. workplace seem to be running smoothly as its easy to know where you need to go because all you do is scan you tag and it tells you which register to go to. Hardest part is trying to get change or need manager to override something, it sometimes takes them forever to get to you. enjoyable part is time goes by fast and makes it fun when you are helping customer out."
good,"Worked at wal-mart for almost three years. It was a rough job but I enjoyed every minute of my time with them. Yes, management sometimes was very pushy but I pushed back in the same manner, especially if I knew what I was doing and all worked out for the best. The only thing I am unhappy with is how I was relieved of my position with them. They don't tell associates much about the attendance policy except that if you go over a certain number of days they are forced to fire you. However, they don' t tell people that they have about two weeks to input absences into the computer system. This makes people who have memory issues have to walk on thin ice. "
good,I have nothing to say. The store manager had a terrible management skills because he lacked the ability to effectively communicate with his employees. Everyone was always on edge because of this.
good,"Do not recommend this to be your final job stop, there is a very high level of stress due to poor staffing and poor management capabilities or support."
good,"Most days I stocked, bend overstock, helped customers, pulled from back room and helped front end. I learned to be as fast and accurate as possible. Very few of management helped on the floor when it was needed but the one's who showed they cared for us helped as often as they could. They understood when we would work our hardest and didn't complete our task. They stood beside their employees. I always enjoyed the people I worked with. We was our own little family. The hardest part of my job was staying awake. I worked 10 P.M. to 7 A.M. and I never could get myself on that night schedule. The best part about the job was the people I worked with."
good,You typically have to learn and preform more tasks then  your job description requires. depending in whatever location you work at there is favoritism.
good,"It's not a bad job. It's actually pretty easy. However, their 6 month attendance policy is absurd. I didn't have a issue there I just don't think the attendance policy is fair. And on federal holidays you get paid regularly not time and a half. I don't really know if that's legal"
good,It's a nice place to work but management is very disrespectful and unsympathetic I worked through out my entire pregnancy and was at work the day I was due with my daughter and they didn't want to let me sit down at all.
good,It was not enough for me to stick around an deal with the managers an associate that only have groups of friends that all talk about you if you don't hang out with them an get you fired
good,I don't like it because if I'm sick I can barely call off . Also the breaks are based on favoritism . The money is ok but not worth the labor . Just isn't something I'm into anymore.
good,Working at walmart there are many different jobs and thus every day is different. My days were usually spent stocking the meat department from 5am to 2pm. Walmart taught me what a retail job was and how to work accordingly. Management was for the most part alright I however did not get along with my direct manager. The hardest part of the job is honestly just getting along with the boss if you can do that it's smooth sailing. The most enjoyable part of the job are the coworkers a lot of really nice people work at walmart.
good,"I worked my butt off for this company. I have a child whom has been very sick. When I applied for leave I was denied after being off for 2 weeks and told to come back immediately and to take the coaching that would ultimately lead to my termination. Instead I gave my notice effective immediately. "
good,i loved my job at first. but when the store manger thought he was the king he treated his employees like garbage. i work alot of overtime to do my job and some and he was still a nasty man. couldnt even tell anyone good job or anything and when you did a good job he took credit and fired alot of people making the job more diffcult. no one wanted to work with him.
good,"A typical day was fill cases and get skids off the floor by 10am"
good,wal-mart management don't communication with each other you tell one manager something  and the next manager gets upset with you about something because they didn't communication with each other. they expect you to work hard all day and when you need a break they look at you like you haven't done any work.
good,"good place to work and good advancement opportunities.  you have to be willing to work, not be lazy.  be on time and do as you are ask.  always opportunities to move up and better ypurself"
good,"At Wal-Mart, the managers will do things and blame it on you just to cover themselves. I've seen a lot of people come and go in my short time there due to their managers giving them a schedule to follow and the system sets them another (but them telling you to listen to them). It was really chaotic working there!"
good,"Working at Walmart was enjoyable. While the holiday season was stressful, and the work sometime monotonous, the co-workers ans flexible hours are what made this job. Most managers are hard-working and understanding, co-workers are friendly and nice. If not for me relocating, I would have stayed. The pay needs to be more though."
good,"Be prepared for conflicting answers.  The way things are presented in orientation compared to reality are starkly different.  You have to be prepared for prejudiced it does exist there.  It is intense work and you are often left with questions and conflicting answers and managers who are unwilling to take responsibility for their part in something and  that can lead to you getting written up,"
good,"i love come to work at walmart, the co worker work like well oil car we laugh cried celebrate we share like a family its an awesome to work, but when it come to manager they don't have there employee back at all, I gotten spitted on by a customer and my manager act as if it was okay for this customer to act this way cause he spending money in the store, she tell me to take care of the customer, take care of the customer REALLY"
good,"I loved the customers here...I ran the sporting goods department, ran the register, put out the inventory...loved the work it was just the pay is why i had to leave.."
good,"At Walmart I was normally on a register all shift, with a 15 minute break and a 30 minute lunch. I would stock the small shelves of last minute eye catchers for the customers. Handling cash, credit card, and check transactions."
good,Managers leave you alone as long as you're doing your job correctly. The pay is awful. It was a great temporary job. They lied about benefits during hiring. Make sure you get information in writing.
good,"Ótimo período de aprendizagem, a empresa proporciona aprendizado em todas as áreas, basta que o funcionário esteja disposto à mudanças."
good,"I liked working at Walmart. Some of the workers are really nice. Some not so nice. The same can be said about the customers. Management was shady with employees and merchandise. They are anti-union. They believe that their ""open door policy"" works, but it doesn't. But all in all it's not too bad of a company to work for."
good,"The company isn't a bad place to work. There are some days that are stressful and some days not. It really depends on the management at your location. If management has corporate stressing them then they are going to stress you. Which is understandable. But certain managers power trip and make working there difficult then it needs to be. Sometimes they want certain results with little  staff. Which is impossible. I had an overall good experience.Good pay, decent hours,paid time off, and discounts. I left because the management team changed.The new team is rude and overbearing. Also they took away paid holidays and gave us floating holidays."
good,"The best thing about walmart was the coworkers, i worked with alot of great people, it was a very fun job and i enjoyed every minute, it was hard work sometimes but i enjoyed working in electronics since that is what i enjoy doing on my free time"
good,"It is never a dull moment, there are 911's that come up everyday and they need to be addressed for the benefit of our customers. Most of the time you feel overwhelmed, so if you have anxiety issues, I do not recommend an ASM position. You will learn anything and everything about merchandising, weights and measures issues, fire code etc. all through experience and mistakes. "
good,"I love my role with the company but the position is underpaid and upper management don""t put the associates first. You have to work long hrs in my role."
good,Wal-Mart is a great company to work for. They do care about their staff and most of their needs in the work place and daily life. I would recommend working their to others.
good,"The job there I worked there as cashier was okay just not for me, the reason my employment was terminated was too many occurrences , or sick days, i did a considerable amount of work. how ever I prefer doing hard labor instead of talking to people."
good,"cashiered, stocked, customer service."
good,"walmart could be very stressful at times but mostly it was good. i made some good friends that i am still in contact with today, management was lacking at times"
good,I liked working at walmart. I wish they were more understanding about availability. And i do think the wal mart employees should get paid more for the work they do
good,"Walmarts not a bad place to work, i just did not enjoy it.  It seems like no one ever gets moved up, and not very many people get along with eachother."
good,"Customer service isn't easy but it was a good job to have, very organized when its comes to scheduling, breaks, requested days off. Management could've been better"
good,It was a fast pace work environment which I enjoyed during rush time. For cashiers there were challenges involved to keep friendly competition to ensure positive but efficient work enviornments.
good,No ofrecen salarios competitivos y requiere un gran esfuerzo de trabajo.
good,"If they want they move you from your work to the cashiers or to another place,they are very inconcient because they want all the work ready and the store clean for the end of the day but they constantly move you."
good,"You better be prepared to work hard daily, if you want to be successful.  Be willing to change your goals for the day on a dime if you are directed to."
good,my work week consisted of days minimum and sometimes 6 or 7 days a week and no less than 12 hours a day on most day.  I didn't have much of a home life balance with work and didn't get to spend time with my family due to the excessive amount of work hours a week.
good,"I enjoyed my job there but it was the management that I didn't like it was alot of favoritism there ."
good,Was a good intro toward working retail. Made our department number one in our district . Made it fun for my coworkers and this resulted in better sales in sales form previous years .
good,was not a safe area to work. the sercuirty wasnt doing their job well. they dont allow overtime when u go over they make u take time off. the managers leave you hanging cause they only schedual one manager for the whole front of the store and the managers in the back dont help
good,I would have stayed working for Wal-Mart if the wage was better.  I enjoyed the people I work with and most of the management staff. After I was confronted on 3 separate occasions about advancement and it never happens well lets say it was time to move on and find some thing different after 10 years with the company
good,"Although it started as en enjoyable part time job and appeared that advancement was possible, I have found that it is who you know and who likes you that gets you advancement.  The hardest part of the job is the constant changing of shifts.  The most enjoyable part is the customers that like how you do things often will wait just to get in your line.  The like consistency and good customer service."
good,"Management at Walmart plays the game of favoritism with specific employees they're quick to write up employees for just about anything or yell at employees and make fun of them. I've worked for the corporation for over a year and I've been in the office multiple times being accused for the most random things however I won't go into full detail. I love working for walmart, but working with the management team at Wal-Mart store 61 is a joke. If you enjoy being harassed and chewed out for false acussed accusations than I highly recommend this job."
good,I feel like they had favoritism versus helping the good workings become better successful business associate.  Also a lot of racism and confusing disagreement between mangmement and associate.
good,Manegment is shocking. Employee morale is bleak.  If you're able to shut your mouth do your work and take a lot of criticism from terrible management this job is for you. They will take your soul and your social life but they'll pay you for it.
good,"There a some jobs that require a different breed of worker, I would classify myself as a go getter, get it done kind of guy. To work for a company that doesn't recognize the extra effort is futile."
good,The work was easy but the management was hard to find and hard to talk to. Good people bad communication. Company rules where broken every day with the punishment to the rule breaker
good,"Mostly depends on how you'd like to make it end up being--more or less, it's not for everyone. And most of the time it can be rough to work in that environment, but it's a job--doable."
good,"Worked many years with the company as an Assistant And Co Manager. The market I spent the most time in never had core issues addressed. Instead, there was a long parade of market managers that would replace store managers over a 2-3 year period before they were ultimately replaced themselves."
good,"I really loved working with all the co-workers and customers. The only reason I don't give a higher rating is because I was fired for being out for 2 weeks. At that time I was hospitalized. I called and spoke with a assistant manager, was told my job would be fine, just bring a note for your doctor.  Did this and thought everything was fine. Then on December 29th. I was fired for being absent to much. I was used for the holiday season and the discarded."
good,"As a cashier you tend to stay very busy, even when you have no customers you organize. You meet great people and stay busy, you do however stand for long hours, lift heavy boxes, have those creepy customers and csms/ manager are slow"
good,Good company overall. Several stores have select issues. Several market managers have select issues. Many of them have been out of the stores for too long. Major disconnect between stores and executives.
good,They are a good company to work for if you need to make meet. I don't recommend making this a life time career. I worked at two different locations over my 5 years one was a great experience the other was not!!
good,I would not recommend working here for anyone. Unless you are a college student. And needing pocket cash. Their breaks aren't as long as they should be. And i believe it should be offered to pay your employees more.
good,"It was an okay place to work. Not much room to advance for some. more room for others. okay benefits. Hour lunches and 2 paid breaks."
good,it pays you money and you normally get your hours. but you will pretty much only be hired part time regardless. which isn't necessarily ideal for some.
good,overall great coworkers had fun most of the time I was there slow advancement but its well worth it. the company is an awesome place to work to get experience for future jobs if you don't want to stay with the company.
good,"Working for Walmart you learn how to do price changes, zone products on each aisle, how to put the cardboard boxes in a bailor and how to work the bailor the appreciate way. You will began working with pallet jacks and learning when the right time the pallet jack should be used."
good,I had some coworkers that where happy and some that hated Walmart because of the advancement restrictions. they where not fair with other employees there.
good,Good company to work for depending on management . I like my experience working for the Walmart company. I did not like how senior staff in management only looked after one another rather than it's individual employees
good,Working at Walmart did help me to grow... I already enjoy serving and waking with people in General so that is all that mattered to me. Was making sure the guest where taken care of. :)
good,Enjoyed working for Walmart. Arrived at work at 9 am and proceeded to do the morning paperwork. always ready to help customers who stopped in for adjustments etc. Using the Boss system that Walmart provided I placed all orders for new eyewear.
good,"Lots of pressure to finish work, threaten to ""coach"" (a write up). It is enjoyable though, day goes by quick, simple and easy to learn for a first job."
good,"A typical workday consisted of unloading trucks, making an inventory spreadsheet, uploading spreadsheet into database, putting inventory into correct location and loading trucks."
good,"Worked with a lot of good natured people, but they do expect people to do more than they can within a shift.  Do not provide all the people necessary to have a quality store.  Morale tends to dip quite easily."
good,"Turn around was awful. People quit unexpectedly, leaving co workers high and dry to do things alone. Made the job very stressful."
good,Typical work day lasts about 8 hours with an hour lunch. Customers can be rude. Must be willing to lift and know proper lifting techniques. Management is sometimes not on the same page as each other.
good,i loved working as a cashier here...but there were a lot of employees that took longer lunches than they are supposed to. cashiers are well managed but other departments need more structure. someone could literally come in and punch in and leave and no one would know
good,Handle cash transactio. Help customers to cash out transaction and help them with each item they  are purchasing it by bagging their items putting them in bags.
good,"My usual day isGreeting customers, ATM & cash transactions as well as check cashing, customer service."
good,Being a cashier at walmart had its ups and downs. mostly down. The customers dont understand that you sometimes have a break and no i can not just take you because you have only two things. they dont understand what it is to be fair. management barely trains you. but you do get your money in the end. if you have thick skin you will make it. A High Tolerance level is needed.
good,I was a customer service manager when I worked at Walmart. Management wasn't too nice and very strict.  I worked there for 3 1/2 years and topped out at $10.15 per hour. I loved the job because it was fast paced and I love customer service and working with public.
good,Its a good job to advance in. The staff is friendly and professional. Some customers are rude but thats with any job you have. Overall a great place to work.
good,"It was a quick filler job, easy to do, easy to manage, and good enough to pay for gas as well as groceries. However! DO NOT use this as a lifetime career or go in thiking you can get such a thing. Their plans are horrendous and they have applications for food stamps for EMPLOYEE'S in their own stores and recommend you getting them as soon as they hire you. They pay you abysmally unless forced to pay a wage by state law."
good,"I had a supervisor that would tell me to go to lunch and come right back, after I came back she'd tell me I forgot to do something that she never told me to do. It was terrible. I didn't quit because of her, but to be completely honest, if I wasn't moving I probably would've eventually quit because of her."
good,Need better management but a nice place to work. I seen many people from all over the place. I met new people and new chances. It wasn't hard work or too physical.
good,It was a typical day at work. The work wasn't hard but it wasn't always easy. Anyone can work and learn something new. Enjoy learning about life of Walmart.
good,"I do not feel the same about the entire company. Having been employed by Walmart on three different occasions in 4 different states, and 9 different stores, for a total of nearly 15 years, It is a good company to work for. The store I currently work for management is terrible. They keep you where you are if you make them look good. Development of potential is almost non existent, but the company as a whole is much better."
good,I would recommend this job for people who want to rise up in retail experience. There is tons of opportunity.....But make sure you are single and handle stress well.
good,Walmart is a great place for people that should work a temporary job; it also promotes teamwork even though it's evident not everyone will participate.
good,The workers weren't that bad to work with. Just always had to pick up everyone else's slack every single day. Which made me feel like I was actually working for $10.50 an hour.
good,"They don't want you to have a life outside of Walmart they don't take know consideration in the fact you health problems, kids,or death in the family . If you can't come to work know matter what its a point."
good,"Walmart is a workplace that gives employees many chances to grow up to the next level."
good,Muy buena la empresa estable  y coordinante solo q el ambiente de trabajo pesado seguri imss trasporta ya noche empleado general vendedor ciudad de mexico cuajimalpa de morelos 3800 al mes
good,"worked well with others, walmart provided me with a flexible schedule to complete a 2 year degree in petroleum technology at west virginia northern community college. i will be graduating may 2017"
good,"Buena empresa para crecer, seria, comprometida y responsable."
good,"I learned to deal with all types of customers as well as coworkers. Management was okay, but not the easiest to deal with. The hardest part of the job was actually a slow day because once zoning and cleaning is done, there's nothing to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was having friendly customers and coworkers to help get you through the day."
good,i learn how to make thing in life easy for myself. i work for myself. i love my co-workers. it was peaceful in that work place.willing to work with you.
good,"The current Wal Mart that I am working at seems to lack social skills. The management there fails to realize how important the workers for them are. They do not seem to lead by example. Instead, they simply order them to do impossible tasks for a single worker."
good,You always have something to do with the mass amounts of customers. You also get to meet a wide variety of people. Many different positions here means you get alot of different types of experience for furthering your career.
good,Its an ok place to work as long as you dont have anything unexpected arise in your personal life. They treat you pretty good until things come up that are out of your control.
good,Different and challenging. I am a unloader I go to work to have fun and work with my team. Seeing different everyday learning something new everyday can be fun.
good,"6-8 hour work shifts"
good,They are horrible in the country area better in city areas. They are judgemental when you come from another state also. I enjoyed working with them in Chicago IL. I got to be a part of them opening a new store. They gave me multiple new experiences. I got to do so many things. Building things and learning things.
good,"It was great to work with fellow employees; they were very friendly and supportive. Not much room for advancement unless you knew someone. They do not hire anyone for full-time work, only part-time. They do not offer benefits unless you work full-time. You have to work at least 35 hours per week for 12 weeks straight in order to be offered full-time employment."
good,"Palm Springs store was more fun, friendly, caring than Barstow store.  Barstow made me wear long sleeves to cover up my cancer scars because they said that it was too ugly to look at!!  The heat from those registers plus long sleeves was awful!!!  "
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart aside for there being too many layers of management. And you might have 10 or 12 people over you telling you 10 or 12 different things. Some of the management is chill and some of them need to work on their people skills. I enjoyed working in produce more than cashiering. It's not a bad company, just not a good fit for me."
good,When I first started working there I loved it. I was getting 40 hours a week and my manager called on me for anything that needed to be done. I was finally being noticed for the hard work I do. After about 8 months of working there hours got cut for everybody. I was working maybe 15 to 20 hours a week sometimes less. It got really stressful when things did not get done in the time frame my manager wanted. He would give me a list of things to do as soon as I got there and want everything to be done within 2 hours and it look nice and neat and organized. I loved the people I worked with we treated each other like family.
good,"Nice place to work,workers are friendly work environment is nice,the works is fun just wish you cloud swich positions before 6months would be nice.overall a great place to work."
good,if you don't mind working whatever and whenever and you make it up to full time if a position is needed but you can still get the hours and never be considered full time and if your not flexible with your availability than they will definitely cut your hours. There is a little favoritism but if your looking for a career move patience and quick on your feet is good. Its walmart not too hard but then again not so easy day in and day out
good,I loved working there but the probation period is horrible and it's very strict some of the workers were lazy. It's a very fun environment to work in.
good,"No holiday pay, no benefits unless its been 1 whole year. unreasonable requirements for even a 1 dollar raise cant complete necessary computer work, which they avoid since once completed is when you receive your raise.."
good,"Management didn't respect employees. Breaks were neglected. Inhospitable environment. I had to move a cross town, I ask for the day shift so I could get daycare for night shift, and unpack new place, management denied the request. I was told there were no hours. I was offered lay off to take care of stuff, they fired me instead"
good,"Management needs to learn how to communicate better "
good,"Great co-workers to work with. Mangers can improve their communication with employees. Growth is possible, but it may take many years and an understanding manager to help you grow"
good,It's was a good job in general but I hated the fact that I only got to work 3 days a week an not enough hours on the days I did get to work...an it's biweekly pay
good,"j'ai appris a me servir d'une caisse"
good,"Processing photos, packaging and labeling, cleaning machines and mixing chemicals."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work you learn all types of things there if your up for the challenge, Me personally working for walmart i learned how to be more patient with people, how to great them, and take care of there needs, i learned how to do money orders, and send money through money gram, The only downfall to working for walmart is sometimes when there was a problem with scheduling or with a customer the managers would look the other way and act like you didnt tell them anything or they say they would fix the problem or the situation but never would."
good,"A typical day at work for me would involve me being extremely busy! I have learned so much and gained so much knowledge working in the photo center.  Like creating canvas's, mounted photos, custom photo albums, calendars and much more.  Management works effectively and efficiently when it comes to various situations within the workplace, I have a strong team of managers at my current store, they all work very hard to ensure that the business is ran accordingly.One of the things I love about Walmart is that it employs all race and ethnicity's making it a great diverse company to be a part of! For me I would say the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are upset about there online and pick up today orders that are not yet available. The best overall experience I have is working with the customers everyday. I'm currently a photo lab associate, and I simply enjoy the pleasure of helping individuals and families create lasting memories that will last them a lifetime!"
good,La gerencia cambian muy seguido eso mismo te dificulta un poco el poder trabajar con cada uno de ellos. Así mismo aprendí y desembolso deanera exitosa.
good,"El ambiente entre los compañeros es lo único bueno ya que por lo demás la paga no es buena y todo personal que es cajero debe dinero, adicional que el tiempo extra que labore nunca me lo pagaron"
good,Salaried Management is so unaccesible for employees. Job advancement is a thing that is very unheard of. Employees come and go like water. Depending on the time of year whether not you get the hours you need or get excess.
good,I enjoyed working there. My co workes is what made it fun and I enjoyed talking with customers. I liked bringing in customers to my line and getting them out as soon as possible.
good,"It was a good job, they have taken away holiday pay and they like to cut hours severely around the holidays to line their pockets. They don't really like to work with you on hours, they want nothing but open availability. the fact that they refuse doctors notes makes it kind of hard to keep a job if your elderly when they don't like to schedule off for doctors visits.if you can get past all that  they are a okay company to work for."
good,"Job did not work with my school schedule  the managers where mean and did not respect the workers in was given task the was not in ,your job discretion"
good,"Es una buena empresa para aprender a trabajar bajo presión, ademas de que te dejan operar el equipo como el montacargas para que aprendas a utilizarlo"
good,Usually people don't appreciate being approached about a credit card while they are shopping at walmart. At this job you learn to be a people person and learn to take rejection.
good,"i did not agree when management ask you to stay over on weekend instead of giving you the pay make you take it off doing the week"
good,Its ok somedays are busier than other and the with have you work in more than one department at once but its ok. Sometimes I would have to but my lunch short because of the departments I'm working. Good thing is you get an hour lunch and raise every year with good work and every 3 months a bonus but overall its a good job.
good,"It's a great. I get good hours, my breaks are on time and acceptable. Their is opportunity for advancement and there are so many positions to choose from."
good,Working behind the deli is a very hard demanding job but I found to enjoy it some. But there are a few inconsistencies like your schedule and being called in on my days off on a regular basis. But my co-workers were fun to work with and my managers were also really nice.
good,It was a nice work environment because i dealt with the customers. It was always fun to look forward to making people that seemed down or sad a way by brightening their day with a joke or just good service.
good,"Working at walmart they say there a christian store but do not give parents holidays off they give it to those worked there longer everytime even if they dont have chilldren. You cant move to a diffrent job with out passing your examinations and most of the time they give need emprovement when u do, also if you get need emprovement you wont get a pay raise ."
good,My only issue with this job was that I felt like management didn't listen or care about complaints. Everyone on my team felt like they saw us as work horses and not humans.. so I guess it depends on your leadership. Walmart it's self is a good company to work for.
good,"The Wal-Mart Clinton store was a good place to work.  The people and management were nice and not hard to get along with.  However, the Wal-Mart culture is not a good fit for anyone that wants to have a family life.  Wal-Mart also has corporate rules about employees that mean you don't count as a person.  No matter how hard you work or how dedicated you are to your job if you fall afoul of one of those rules you are out."
good,Good place to have a first job or a temporary fill in job. Management doesn't really communicate and they just kinda wing it most of the time. Customers are generally rude
good,"No help, no support by management. Management never got strikes for anything wrong they did. I ran all produce and the meat wall for 3 months solo, then they hired 3 people I had to train."
good,always busy always knew what to do for my day.  Enjoyed working as a team. also bosses were good to work for. worked with on hours needed to work let me have sundays off.
good,"While the general experience was good, the management I experienced was superior. However, with that said the policy on absences was asinine. Dr. excuses were not considered and for example: you get the flu, your ""points"" would get used up fast. You would be considered for termination very quickly."
good,It was cool for a first time job but they let me go because I was going to school. Management was alright but it was a pain in the butt to get your schedule done because they had u do it 3 weeks in advance like wtf.
good,"I was a cashier. I rang customers out, while counting money, exchanging change, interacting with customers, making sure my lane was clean and organized."
good,At Walmart a typical day is getting right to work on the floor Walking through fashion what needs to be done such as making sure things are organized and presentable for the customers. Helping customers with their questions and concerns is a huge part of the job. Its important that they have they are helped and that they have a good shopping experience!
good,"Its ok got cashier position.  Love the fast paced work, I do better when timed and it was great I tried being better than I was the day befote with my speed when scanning."
good,Managements rude. Other employees were great. Worked as a team. Supervisors were great. Majority of the associates put customer needs first. Always willing to help. Management should take more time to understand associates family needs.
good,The company provided a team oriented atmosphere which helped in growth in ones career status. Took part in understanding employees needs but never found out or noticed if they took action for them.
good,Work can be stressful if managers make it that way . Most times of the days there's more work to do when it starts working up to the weekend . Returns are very hard to accomplish by midnight but with teamwork it can be accomplished.
good,"Working for Walmart is okay for a first job or something just on the side. The management is okay. Its easy to call out. They tell you if you are going to call out for one day, you might as well call out for three days because the three days will count as one (weird I know)."
good,"I've worked for Walmart three separate times, and only during my last stint there have I spoken to the store manager. The raises are mediocre, however the bonuses are decent. Advancement is a joke, unless you're a favorite of someone in upper management."
good,Very nice work environment. Management was always quick to help new employees. Schedules were set but could be changed upon request. Laid back uniforms to fit the comfort of the employee. Adequate lunch breaks.
good,"Fun place to work, good co-workers, good hours. I do not have an immediate supervisor watching over me at all times and I have time to help  other associates with there work load."
good,"Un dia laboral era lindo porque me gustaba lo que hacia, compañerismo maso... la parte mas dificil al comienzo aprender a tratar al cliente, con el paso del tiempo a hoy eso es lo que mas aprendi el trato al cliente.."
good,"Even if considered full time, still would not have very many hours. First couple of days after beening hired are training consisting of watching videos and answering questions on line."
good,"There is lack of supervision and management troughout the store, there is no guidance throughout of what our job is. Working with the co-workers is beneficial, the hardest part of the job is pushing in enough working carts into the store. The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart is talking to the customers to receive satsifying feedback on what to improve to the store and with the employees."
good,"the people at nite work there butt on store all stress because managers when morning people only playing around ."
good,"clock in, make sure work are is clean, greet customers,ring them up help bag and thank them for shopping with us. i learned that not everyone is going to be in the best mood but always try to put a smile on their face. my co workers were all around my age so the work vibe was always wonder full, mangers were also very professional."
good,"Me enseñaron muy bien, es un ambiente muy agradable pero tienen mal manejo del personal y se les están yendo"
good,"i have learned how to use the register, handle money, customer serves skills, answer the phone,and basically learn how to run a gas station."
good,"falta direccion de coorporativo, pero es personal, no general"
good,"management did not exist."
good,"This location, just like the title says, has to constantly hire new people in order to replace those who quit, because they can't stand the place, or get fired, because they fail to meet Wal-Mart's already low standards."
good,Benefits were not good and the pay was not enough. Supervisors change the schedule with out letting employees know that it was changed on the day before .
good,literally worse management team ive ever witnessed. management frequently doesn't put forth the effort to allow for proper customer assistance and then chastises the associates.
good,Walmart is a fast pace work place and that is why I loved it I like to keep going all day I'm not one to stand around I like to keep moving .  my typical day at work was coming in at around 5am and helping bakery bake everything then walk to my department and help deli open before 8am and do ordering for deli and bakery I will set up my mods make sure everything was up to osha standards and help out my department and bakery stock both floors put away loads and clean most of the time I would be there over 10 hours
good,"This was a part time cashier position during Christmas season. Employees and customers are very friendly.  Management has its ""clicks""."
good,the management there was horrible. they didnt do their jobs properly and had favoritism. let anyone do whatever they wanted to do besides working.
good,I would clock in and start my job. If i had a question about anything my co-workers were happy to help me. Management was great. Everyone interacted with one another in friendly conversation.
good,"I learned so much, how to stock shelves, work a cash register, handling hazardous material. Management was very strict. I got along well with all of my co workers. They were all normal people just like myself. The hardest part of the job was was cleaning up the parking lot of the carts and dealing with car battery co exchanges. Most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with the co workers that knew exactly how you feel."
good,"clock in grab my MC40 and start scaning the back room"
good,well as far as management was bad they didn't treat workers with respect .but I loved dealing with and helping customers
good,"I supervise a large amount of people on my team, we unload trucks, stock, load all the freight to the sales floor, we have to be motivated all during the day. I learned a lot, I love working with people that I can help make them better"
good,"Loved my job and my job description, however leaving and moving out on my own let me know i was no capable of working third shift with a five year old and a baby."
good,Wal-Mart treats people like numbers instead of people.if management were better people would not complain.and if you go above and beyond theres no reward
good,"The first person to get to work is a coworker of mine that makes the early morning donuts. When my job is to maintain the bread I get to bake the bread, put the bread in bags, and serve the customers while also stocking the floor with new product. When my job is to close the bakery I typically have to breakout the bread that will be used for the next day, clean all utensils and machinery in the bakery thoroughly, assist all customers, take inventory and stock the floor. This job taught me many valuable lessons such as cleaning quickly and efficiently, approaching customers that were children, food sanitation, and I was also taught how to organize my workstation. My coworkers were enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was making bales out of the stores cardboard for recycling. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to hang out cookies to the children that came to the bakery. However, some if the associates tend to gossip and it does get annoying."
good,"customers  and heping then handled cash  created layaways, heiping customers with layaways, and payment kept a clean register area"
good,"okay place to work, there is a lot of different managers so it does get difficult when you have so many telling you to do this and that"
good,"Walmart is a super center were you get to meet a lot of employees.You get to get close to some of them and become friends. I believe every job out there is a hard job, but when you have your coworkers and managers that help you, it becomes easy."
good,"The management gets way too caught up in work and will sometimes forget that cashiers and regular associates are people as well and that they started where we are at one point. When they do treat you like people though, they are very nice and make you feel like you're working with a big family. I did love it there."
good,"I liked my job until I became de-motivated by unfair management practices, writing you up with out first coaching you, expecting you to know things you were never trained for, giving out impossible tasks with inadequate employee coverage to do it, etc. "
good,"My day at work consisted of folding clothes, keeping the ares neat, also helping the customer. On the job I learned how to become better at multi-tasking and also how to develop better people skills. Management was very tight, meaning slacking off was not allowed."
good,You get used to seeing the same friendly faces every week and meeting new people. I learned many different ways to give change. My co-workers were always friendly and efficient. the hardest part of my job was the standing still in one place for long periods of time.
good,Managing 10-12 employees and handling two different parts of the department being garage and retail store. Most of the co-workers were great and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was the long hours as a manager and not alot of time for home life.
good,A typical day at work is keeping the parking lot clear. gathering all carts from the parking lot and putting them in the bay. when business is slow we assist in the truck and stocking. i love working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is when the mule dies and everything has to be hand-pushed.
good,"my typical work day is taking prescriptions from patients, entering all prescription data in to computer, translating prescription information into sig code, create or modify patient records.  fill prescriptions by counting, pouring tablets liquids and creams, labeling containers and operating scanning equipment.  process information for third-party insurance claims and identifying situations requiring pharmacist's action and resolution.  operates cash registers."
good,"seems like being here in Alaska walmart seems to behind in compared to the rest of the world. "
good,"Overall, working at this place was a nice experience. I met friendly and nice people out there. I made a lot of friends of different ages, it was fun."
good,"The Walmart company i worked for, was so cut throat and if you weren't friends with anyone. You didn't have a chance to move up"
good,Overnights was no fun but overall I liked the job I got to do what I wanted an we ran a good store it all depends on your store manager
good,"Fun work place that is not all about the numbers but good time management and customer service. I had a lot of personal growth and development. decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company,"
good,"starts out with checking the days events. I learned how to handle money and greet everyone. scan, bag and hand products to the customers. the hardest part is keeping everyone happy while working."
good,"A typical day of work would be using the cash register to check items out, dealing with cash, cards, and a variety of people. I worked at the service desk some and that was my favorite part of working at Wal-Mart. Management was not very set. I did not even know when I had a new manager because they did not make that very clear. The hardest part was dealing with rude customers but it was not too hard. Just smile and tell them to have a nice day."
good,"I've been w/ the company for 12 years and was effected by the recent layoff. I wasn't so upset about the layoff, but the presentation of the layoff, was a different story. I felt as though I was being terminated rather than laid off."
good,Co workers are kind work was not hard typically as a manager (front line) a lot of walking which is good and you get to speak with a lot of different people.
good,"The work was hard and steady.  Management was reasonable, but the micro management got on my nerves.  The people I worked with was excellent."
good,Sasha is very bossy and management knows it she's the problem child there. Management is very strict on helping you go to school.
good,"Misturavam muito vida profissional e pessoal,os encarregados não davam muitas oportunidades."
good,"Too many bosses but I got connected to my present position through the same department.Also more lifting than ever in my life, I was able to familiar with so many medications."
good,Very good pay but not worth the sacrifice of work / life balance. you have to put more of yourself into this career than you do your family.
good,Nice place to work if you need a job or are a student. People and nice. Management team needs to b e let go and a new team rehired.
good,"minha avaliacao e simples eles eram muito rigidos com as coisas aprendi tudo com pessoas que ja trabalhavam la o encarregado nao sabia de muita coisa,mais nao tenho que reclamar la poque foi ali que eu tirei muitas experiencias profissionais"
good,"Overnights were expected to do more and received no recognition. If you did a ton of work you can expect someone else to take the credit for it. If you want to move up in this company you need to know how to kiss up to your manager, and you better not work overnight."
good,I liked working at Walmart.  The staff was upbeat and fun.  we were often understaffed and had to pull people off the floors. There was not enough hours I was looking for full-time hours.
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for. They strive to provide flexible hours, friendly managment, and room for advancment within the company. The only complaint I had with Walmart is there LOW PAY. For being a such a large company with profits in the billions they pay their employees barley above minimum wage."
good,Good company with little to no growth for hourly employees.i learned an was brifely crossed trained on scissor lift and electic pallet jack
good,It was a great environment to work in but as time passed there was less employees to open and close the store. All tasks were put on two or three people while there was hundreds of customers. Supervisors would call in most of the times. Management would not listen to supervisors when they told them they needed more cashiers. Upper Management had no clue how to help cashiers with the register maybe only one manager out of all five of them. Other than that co workers were easy to get along with and I made great friendships from Walmart. Enjoyable part was being able to talk to customers and see them happy. Hardest part was when we are under staff because I would always have to run back and forth trying to assist customers and employees as if I was supervisor and I wasn't.
good,"A typical  day at work is coming in putting car into the bay, and cashing them out at the cash register.                                      "
good,"A customer support person should respond quickly to satisfy the customer and understand their situation.  You must be able to evaluate information, and handle questions and complaints to communicate clearly, both in writing and orally as well as speak in a way people can understand.  It is important to have a “thick skin” and be able to handle complaints, especially when handling unpleasant customers.  You may be responsible for keeping records of customer interactions and transactions, recording details of questions, complaints, comments, as well as the actions taken.  You should follow-up and make sure appropriate changes were made to resolve the customer’s problems.  Accuracy and an eye for detail will help you handle matters in the best interest of both the customer and the company."
good,Working as a work study help me organizes my school and personal plus earn money at the same time. I enjoyed working as a work-study.
good,"Greet customers and Check all customers out. Help customers who have a problem with their product, try to get them to get a different product before refund. Was a layaway associate and help Electronics bin and scan each item for audit."
good,Walmart overnight stocking is a very physical and active job it was mostly unloading heavy pallets and the management was very poor due to the way they treated all the employees with disrespect instead of encouraging.
good,good place to work minus not getting good benefits or job advancement opportunities.  Management is pretty good about working with you if something comes up or you have an appointment.
good,"Go in to the board and see if boss has put a list of things for me to do for the day. if don't I pretty much jump in and start taking pick carts to the floor with item for the different departments and rotating and stocking items on shelves, making bails, sweeping and cleaning back room using pallet jack to move skids around in back room,  making stack bases and end caps with different items to display through out the store. unloading trucks, binning items into proper location in back room doing returns for my department which is consumables.  Go to other departments to help out when my work is done or being called to help out. I am busy from the time that I get their to the time I leave. You never stop learning everyday I learn something new or find a better way to doing. Suggest Ideals that I have to my boss , she helps out . I like working with my co-workers because we work as a team and get are jobs done. The hardest thing was knowing where everything is located in the store. Is meeting and helping people while stocking."
good,la exigencia que se pide en la empresa hace que te vuelvas una persona responsable y capaz de mostrarte firme ante las adversidades que se te puedan presentar en el transcurso de tu jornada labora y hacen de la persona mas capaz.
good,"I met a lot of great people during my time at Wal-Mart and got along with everyone great. I learned a lot about retail management and product management. "
good,Was a great experience for customer service and gave me the experience of working in stressful situations. You will deal with many different types of customers and situations. Very large company with many job positions. great co workers.
good,I had amazing co-workers and the customers I cared for was a blast. Management was easy to work with. The only complaint I Have is that they don't pay they employees enough money.
good,"good place to work for first job, not good hours though they will cut your hours. but easy work and decent pay. long lunches lol"
good,Needs better team work to be executed among the staff. Does not accomodate for issues at home or sick children. bkklhkligkj bkjhuiguk  bkhkugukgkjhk
good,The managers/ CSM's were very helpful when I had an issue. I just wish that I could have picked up more hours and had more job security.
good,I never stop going my breaks are often late. They are massively under staffed and need to train their management and staff better.
good,"Typical day would include clocking in, and working on register. Hardest part of job was they did not take doctors notes and they expected you and your family members to not get sick. They have strict attendance policy which being a single mom is hard sometimes. I loved the friendly co workers and I enjoyed the customers."
good,"I was a vary busy in certain hours. Cashiers have the hardest end of Walmart. We had to deal with all kinds of customers from happy, upset, angry, and sad. As for Management i have had better its a hit and miss on that. I had more fun meeting new people every day or making the customers day just by listening to them and giving them the service they needed and wanted. I have had customers come in and looking for me in the lines to check them out. That makes me feel amazing knowing they like how i work and know they get the service they were looking for. I was a never dual day at work."
good,"hard work good benefits non steady hours room for advancement learning opportunities constant contact with customers, cash handling, freight, stocking shelves, inventory audits, pricing checks"
good,"el trabajo es facil y practico "
good,"I enjoyed the employees. The different cultures, to find so many interesting people in one place was refreshing and new everyday. I wish the salary was better, I would have like to remain."
good,"Ad by WebsteroidsXXA typical day at work with wal mart starting in at 8:00 in the Moring and end at 10 pm and that's an early day.... As soon as you hit the front door before you took off your coat . the Co Mgr would be on the radio yelling at the over assistant manager asking why didn't they get this or that done or why isn't the store zoned phones would be ringing for call outs or customers would asking for something they cant find, associates would be asking what needs to be done first thing before their price changes got done I would say get the back room started until I get my notes for the day from the store and Co Mgr at 9:00 am we would have our Mgr meeting to get the notes or yelled at for what we didn't get done the day before because the store got busy ..9:30 we hit the backroom and sales floor with freight that needs to be packed out .I would then catch up with my dept Mgr and pass them their notes go count deposit after that go walk my dept met with my sales floor associates walk off my food service areas for time and temps, I loved my job the associates were the best most of them the only thing I wasn't happy with was the bulling from one upper Co Mgr she was degrading to associates and missing out on so much family time"
good,"I worked in the garden dept. I would check-out customer , answer phones and questions regarding our products in the garden center and the cost, I would replace any missing stock dust all the shelves"
good,"Uma empresa otima,que ensina seus associados a fazer o certo e trabalhar com qualidade,porem ela coloca pessoas não capacitadas para estar em um cargo de liderança,a unica parte negativa da empresa seria o salario."
good,Most days I just showed up did my thing then left. Nothing out of the ordinary.
good,Poor management on the lower levels and poor compensation. Scheduling was always a problem and was never consistant
good,"this is a good job, the co-workers were friendly. the management wasn't really up to par. i enjoyed all my customers. a typical day is very well and easy. this is a easy job. flexiable schedules"
good,Not enough money for the hard work done. Never have enough people on staff. Make one person do a task that is meant for 2 or more people. Manager quit on us during the middle of the week. Nice co-workers.
good,cashiering many people and helping them with anything. being in sales made me a better person. co-workers were great
good,"Era un empresa muy importante pero les falta mucho la cultura hacia el asociado y no que fueramos nada mas solo trabajadores ya que sin nosotros la empresa no marchaba y la gerencia no se daba cuenta y habia mucha desconfianza entre los empleados"
good,loved working there just moved away. could do anything they ask me  to do.
good,"Typically I sell merchandise and set up cellphone contracts. I've learned inventory management. I get along with the majority of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is trying to pull a 55"" tv off the steels in the backroom. I love communicating with and helping customers with their needs. Management could use a little work. The scheduling is terrible, and there's a major lack in communication between the different managers."
good,"Typical day is fast paced, required to do different things on a daily basis from stocking, zoning, lot, cashiering, customer service, complete go-back duties, watching self-checkouts, maintaining check outs, greeting/helping customers, resolve price matching/complaint issues, spot mops, claims, hazmats, as well as cleaning spills. I have learned many things working with Wal-Mart from cashiering duties to performing hazmats and continue to learn new things when required to. Management is strictly professional on the sales floor and within increasing business performance, however, behind the back room and fulfilling employees requests is lacking. Co-workers are friendly, most gossip, but get along face-to-face. The hardest part is managing personal time with work. It is difficult to balance it out with the schedule they tend to give you unless you are an open shift. The most enjoyable part is the co-workers. Fellow cashiers tend to be there for you and are supportive of issues that might rise. Most care for one another. However, all is set aside and all perform very professionally on the sales floor and all assist customers."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. It was a good part time job for me. I liked talking to the customers as they came in and as they checked out. As a cashier I processed their items.
good,"So the company is okay to work for, though management is no where near what it should be. To consumed in minor details that the larger matters become more transparent to them in the long run. Constant changes are made for minor reasons while matters of product rotation, supply, and demand seem to be waning. Lower level supervisors are easy to get along with, but the higher up a position is then most likely the more difficult it is to relate and work with them."
good,A night of work was showing up at 10 pm and then leaving at 7am. I would look at a map f an area and then based on that map change all of the product to their new locations and change the price tags accordingly. Typically and area would take around 2 hours to complete.
good,learned a lot of new things keeping customers happy and keeping store clean.
good,"Its an ok job, for part-time, and you stay active. Great people to work with. Its a very detail-oriented job, and you have to work at a fast pace. My days there were some-what ok."
good,"A typical day at work at Wal-Mart varies, some days are easier than others and some are extremely stressful. Management doesn't know much about what is happening in the facility, such as higher ranking personnel harassing employees. I also found that (even though they are not supposed to) they would force employees to stay well after their assigned shifts to finish work, then cut their hours the next work day. And with a shifting schedule, it is hard to have a life outside of work. Not to mention being scheduled alone two out of five days a week in a department that requires at least two workers, and being expected to complete all work."
good,"Long hours, under appreciated. Upper management does not appreciate hard work and dedication."
good,"A typical day I clocked in, went out to the floor to see if any freight had been left from the night before, put it out or labeled it and put it in the stock room.  I got a Texlon and did some ordering if needed, cleaned up as I went, helped customers as I went.  If the department manager had a list for me to do I would do it.  She taught me a lot about how to run the department and what to do to boost sales. I usual worked at least part of the day with another associate in my department.  We always worked well together.  When I first started it was hard I worked both jobs head start in the morning and Walmart in the evening, at first it was just an escape from head start, and all that was going on there, then it was all Walmart. where I worked there was two department managers and they had two different teaching styles.  One was furniture and one was domestics, it was crazy but I got through it.  The best part of my job was the customers.  They were kind and understanding.  I would walk around the store before I clocked in to learn where things were and if there were any changes.  I loved my job, I couldn't wait to go to work.  After working three years of both I decided to just work Walmart.  So I dug in and learned as much as I could.  I think I got more out of working there then any place else."
good,"A typical day at work was that you recieve your task in the begining of your shift, and you made sure each task was finished by the end of your shift. Task could include cleaning bathrooms, taking out trash throughout the entire store, waxing or mopping the floors, clearing all buggies from parking lot, resond quickly to accidents or spills, or whatever else asked of you to do."
good,"I liked Wal-Mart, they train you well and there are lots of opportunities for advancement."
good,se trabaja bajo mucha presión y no es correpondido con el salario.
good,"On a typical day i would help customers in customer service, do bank deposits, and make sure registers were correct.I also made sure cashiers in every deparment had what they needed to coplete their part in customer service. Team work was important in ths job.  I enjoyed my work enviroment due to my regular customers and people I worked with. The hardest part In this job, which is in any customer service job is dealing with rude customers. Patience and empathy is necessary to complete this job successfuly."
good,Great co-workers but no real leadership to keep the boat above water
good,"There will always be deficient areas in a place of employment.  Walmart is a decent place to work, I just know that my future does not reside there, after graduation I plan to move elsewhere and i look forward to another place of employment"
good,"The pharmacy is the best place to work in the store!"
good,fun and easy at your own pace meet a lot of fun people working there
good,typical day at work was okay.i did learn a lot from the supervisors and workers who have been there over the years.management team was okay even though we barely spoke to them.some of the coworkers were lazy and taking longer breaks then they were suppose too.most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things and servicing customers.
good,"This job saved my family when I needed a job the most. Great if you are willing to work a lot and be the ""dog"" and not get advanced no matter how hard or what shift you take as a convenience to others."
good,"Quite day at work"
good,"Cobranças elevadas, porém é uma escola profissional excelente pra quem encontra o Gerente correto pra trabalhar, parte dos profissionais tem receio de ensinar e perder seus cargos, empresa estável mas não possui equilibrio entre vida profissional/pessoal."
good,"I can only speak from my experience at the Walmart where I worked. The some coworkers were great. The management was horrible. We were taught about the ten foot rule. The only time the managers used it was when they were with visitors from other stores and home office. They had their favorites. The coworkers that the management favored would do little or nothing while everyone else had to work harder. They say there is an open door policy. I don't know about that being through. You have to chase the managers down to ask them for anything. They would not work with anyone with scheduling issues. I had to stop going to school just to keep my job. That may seem like a choice of my own. At that time, I greatly needed the job. If I had known how it was at that Walmart, I would have never stopped going to school."
good,I did like a lot of the people I got to work with. The day goes quickly when it is busy. Breaks and lunches are always given.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be getting out all the bakery, deli, and dairy products for the customers and showing great customer service. I have learned so much while working for Walmart such as reading labels, printing labels, ordering, price changing, etc. The management is decent, could be better. The co-workers are great, most of them are pretty easy to get along with. The hardest part would be making all the customers happy, when we cant do some of things that's against the store policy. The most enjoyable part about my job is helping the customers out, such as finding items or just being a blessing to them by speaking to them."
good,c'est le fun travaillé a cette endroit mais ont fait pas assez d'heure
good,"Wal-Mart is an okay place to work for a first job, good training in most areas and helps to have a very good work ethic."
good,"The typical work day was hard work and stayed busy. I learned how to remodeled wal-mart and much more. The management was hard on me at times but, I got the job done right. My co-works some were rude then others were very helpful if I needed help. The hardest thing was getting everything done right in such little time. I enjoyed looking at what I accomplished work wise."
good,"A very fast paste enviornment."
good,The job was okay i had some problems with the manager there. But the other managers were nice and polite but that one manager just didn't like me for some reason. My job was to work on dairy knocked it out and had good experience with people there.
good,"Working at Walmart is a new experience everyday, I get to meet all types of people i have the best co-workers and the management team is awesome. The hardest part about my job is dealing with different attitudes everyday from the customers, and the most enjoyable part is to actually get to interact with the different people."
good,"I worked at Walmart for over a year as a photo-lab technician.  I got to be more than a cashier.  I had many responsibilities such as filing, printing, cleaning, cash sales, customer service, and lots more.  I had to keep machines clean and full of supplies.  Management was a bit weak in my department.  My department had no manager at all for several months and the success of our department depended completely on the few employees that worked in the photo department.  My co-workers were amazing people who are now like family to me.  The hardest part of the job would be heavy lifting.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be handling items such as old film, and peoples personal photos that held their most precious memories."
good,"Greeted customers with a friendly and positive attitude. Ran register for customers when done shopping, Answered phone at customer service desk as well as rang up damaged material and did returns for customers. Cleaned and straightened work area as needed."
good,"a typical day at work usually begins by checking in with you manager. follow and complete task given. you will always learn something new everyday due to assisting different customer needs. management have their balance sometimes great and sometimes not so helpful. As an associate we are involved more with customers on the sales floor and as myself involved behind the scenes as well, due to the knowledge that i carry and continue to learn. The hardest part of the job would be not having patience,  due to high volume of different customers and complaints to satisfy their needs for their purchase. The most enjoyable part would be , Meeting new people and making them happy by having the product on the shelf for a great shopping experience."
good,I loved working at walmart but when I spoke up about being treated unfairly I got yelled at so I finished my day and quit my job.
good,The associates become your family. This was a great first job. I loved working with the public. However the income was not enough to live on. I am hoping to find a job just as great as this one was.
good,every thing is good but i like improv my self but i can't do there.
good,"management is bad"
good,"company went out of business "
good,"Great way to start as a first time job, taught me a few things I have taken advantage of for other jobs."
good,"A typical day would see a variety of customers with returns, exchanges, financial transactions and complaints. Managers vary in application of company policy leading to non standard outcomes on occasion. Always on the firing line cast as the ""bad guy"", which is also toughest part of job."
good,you learn alot from this company and the job is not hard. most management are okay.
good,I am Handling apparels and home fashions (Primary responsibilities) Handling of the customer service desk and Profit Prevention Cell (Additional responsibilities).
good,i worked in many departments but overall make sure you keep yourself doing something they dont like you standing around or talking to much to someone.
good,if you like working fast pace all day everyday this is a great job.
good,"I mostly worked the evening shift (4:00 p.m.- midnight), but I've come in on some mornings but that was usually to cover someone when they were on their vacation. At the time I worked there the store hours were 9:00 a.m.- 11:00 p.m., opened an hour earlier on weekends, if I remember right."
good,"I was able to use my love of gardening every day, be outside and work with people.. The management allowed me to do my job with minimum of interruption, and they respected my knowledge. In all it was a really good job which I wish could have been full time instead of only seasonal."
good,i liked working third shift but that was about it the management was ok but really didnt communicate with each other well
good,"I learned inventory controls, how to order certain departments, how to read planograms"
good,"Manage inventory flow, high concentration of customer service, and unloading pallets."
good,"Working at walmart wasn't bad except for the management and some of the customers. The pay was decent and the store discount, Sams club membership and medical benefits option, were nice."
good,"Constant customer service, always being on the move and knowing your products very well"
good,over night sucks. especially when you have the managers breathing down your neck expecting you to pick up everyone elses slack. lazy workers too. never picked out for your hard work.
good,Working a cash register and meeting different people on a daily basis. Friendly coworkers
good,"As an ICS associate you are supposed to be stocking the sales floor with the merchandise that needs to be stocked, but they have us unloading the truck for pennies on the $. We get no sort of benefits after 90 days. I used to work for Walmart before and I received ALL of my after 90 days and now they don't do it. The most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers and thats about it."
good,"sending and receiving money grams, cashing checks, training new associates, balancing registers, inventory, and opening new credit accounts."
good,I was an assembler at walmart. I built the bikes and displays for the store. I also helped put away the trucks when they were short handed. My daughter got very ill which led to me having to leave walmart. The best part of this job was that I loved the work I did.
good,"Meu trabalho era resumidamente, acompanhar os processos e procedimentos de todas as áreas da empresa, tinha acesso a todas os setores, acompanhava e inspecionava o sistema de alarme dos produtos e de todo o clube, era de nossa responsabilidade garantir o bom funcionamento e prevenção de tudo, fazia o trabalho de controle de entrada e saída de mercadorias, através de capitação de erros que poderiam sem por conta do sistema como também do operador, inventários rotativos também faziam parte da nossa rotina diária."
good,"O trabalho é excelente, convívio com profissionais é bom. A demanda é regular."
good,"my typical day at work was to request credit, smile, help customers, accept different methods of payments. the most enjoyable part of my job was interacting and meeting new people."
good,I like my co workers they are all willing to help you when you need it. This company did not tell my that when I was hired that they would be letting all the new hires go at there six month mark. I love working with the people I work with and some one the management but I wish I would have known they would have said something before I took the job.
good,"they cut hours and workforce, insurance rates go up. they do not hire full time employees anymore."
good,Overall WalMart is a good place to work. As far as advancement in the workplace it seems to me that as long as you have some type of college degree (regardless of experience) you can advance into upper management. I really enjoyed the customer service aspect and getting to know the customers and thier needs.
good,Responsible for stocking the shelves
good,"Working here was a great opportunity. I learned great customer service, how customers reacted to you if you just take your time to listen to their problem and do your best to help them. Wal-Mart always encouraged us to help the customer in any way that we could. If it meant exchanging a product or sending it back to the base company for repairs. All Management hepled you help the customer. If you had a question you could not answer they would get you the answer."
good,A typical day is always busy and I learn something new everyday. However the management are not that friendly nor the co-workers but I show up and get the job done right. The hardest part is answering some of the questions from the customers but I take care of them like I should and learn from my mistakes. Like any associate my break is the best or when I clock out.
good,Typical Day:
good,"Loja cheia,ser um operador cliente ,trabalhar em equipe faz toda a diferença."
good,"Enjoyed learning new things in the various departments. Good group to work with. Relaxed environment,"
good,"I didn't really enjoy working for Wal-mart simply because they didn't really take into consideration your family or your time. The work schedules were so chaotic it made it extremely difficult to have a home life. The people I worked with were great, and none of us could get a new way of scheduling implemented, so we just went along with it until something else came along."
good,i found walmart to be under what i thought it was i expected alot more from the people that worked there and got let down.
good,"Pay was ok , Hours ok but as long as I worked there , going in on days off when they called and so they couldn't seem to help work around my kids school schedule when my husband had to work out of town ..."
good,"A culture of it's my way or the highway,systems and protocol were there but rarely implemented."
good,I would review walmart as not a bad place. Just the store i worked at in particular there night management was not on top of there game and the store manager him self really needs to go through re traineing and look over his own hand book again.
good,"I enjoyed this job not only because it was different from what i would normally do but also because i met alot of diverse and interesting people there,i also found that a few people that i went to high school with worked there as well."
good,The management was fun and they all seemed to be under the age of 25.
good,Walmart is a great place to get your first job or to get back on your feet after you've been out of work for a while. i wouldn't recommend staying there very long though.
good,Fast paced-interesting place=good place to meet all sorts of people.
good,I enjoy working at walmart. My days was very long and I stayed busy. I was a cashier and we was timed on every customer.I learned how to be a better cashier under pressure.I also learned how to deal with difficult customers.The management team was a good team.They help when we needed it. My co-workers was very helpful.The hardest part of the job was working around the holidays because thats when the customers was the most difficult. I really enjoyed working with the people.
good,"A night at work would consist of running register, doing any returns that came in. We would also have freight to put away and the registers would have to be zoned. All of this would have to be done while management walks around to make sure the job is getting done. If management needed help on the floor they would take one of the two cashiers that were working at night to the floor. I loved the people that I worked with. Did not like all the managers but then again who does. The hardest part of the job was really running register by yourself and getting a line of people and having no one to help you run reg."
good,"I got along great with the other employees, my managers were somewhat helpful but still managed to get things done."
good,"cashier, had to help with store set up. stocked, faced produccts."
good,"Fun place to work, love to see the customers happy with their orders and how clear the stores was. The co-workers work as a team and didn't have no problems outside or inside the store with eachother."
good,Good benefits
good,wal mart is a productive working place that allows you to expnad and move up within the company
good,"se integra al area de trabajo y se comienza a laborar, me ha servido para manejar la valores, asi como tratar a la gente"
good,A typical day at work consisted of helping customers and helping other associates put away merchandise. As an associate ive learned its best to help people around you and to share your knowledge to the best of your ability. Management at my job wasnt the best but some of them were there when you needed them. As for coworkers everyone was really friendly and was always there for eachother like a family. The hardest part of my job was trying to learn other departments when help was needed.The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly coworkers and happy customers.
good,"Was there over a year, was let go right before my raise. Was written up for not being trained as a cashier, which wasn't my fault. Wasn't properly trained for forklift use. Felt set up to fail at certain points. But I always try my best to do what i am told. a typical day at work would be zoning, stocking, and setting modulars to please the consumer eye. learned a lot about apperal. management was mediocre, i honestly thought it could've been done better. My co-workers were amazing! always helpful, still friends to this day. Hardest part of the job was finding someone to work the forklift cause i was not properly certified or trained. The most enjoyable part was when i was left to my department so i could make my supervisor proud of my work."
good,start work at 9 to 4 then check customer out talking to customers
good,"Siempre se apenden cosas nuevas, pero el salario no es lo adecuad con el trabajo que haces, es muy desgastante y mucho estres para lo poco que te pagan, pero vale la pena para un primer trabajo y para tomar experiencias"
good,I was doing the same tasks everyday and no other new tasks where I could continue to grow and gain new skills.
good,enjoyed working here as well always busy worked at a fast pace they just didnt want to work around school
good,It seems like now it all about how much money they can make and they have let there customer concerns not seem to matter as much any more.
good,"I worked in the back so I didn't see many customers, but keeping the trucks unloaded on time and the merchandise on the floor was very hectic."
good,"I worked there yep, wasn't that bad of a place to work, Management was a good group of people, the associates really made the job fun and interesting. Overall a good experience."
good,"Wal-mart, during the time I worked there was very needy. I spent nearly all day working there as a cashier and didnt have time to myself or to study"
good,"I was there from when I graduated in 1998, until I left on good terms in 2007, when I moved to a different location. I liked everyone I worked with, made the job easier. Hardest part was there really was no advancement at the job, you had to know someone to get an advancement. This was a factory of over 700 empoyees at one time. And they kept laying off people when a newer factory was built in same area. They recently closed down in April of 2012."
good,A place where u can further your career.its a great working environment and the employers are very nice.I learned so much working for this company as far as how the beta business actually works.my co-workers were very friendly if I needed help I got it.the hardest part of the job was getting my self body prepared to b up on my feet all nite.the most enjoyable part of the job for me was learning new things and the friends that had grown very close to.
good,Opening ad closing of the store. Working in the cash office to ensure deposits are correct and the safe balances. Taking customer service phone calls as well as customer service calls at the service desks. Completing daily walk through of the departments as well as staffing.
good,"typical day at work depends on the day and time of the month, what I learned was patience and trust your own work nobody elses, managment was good, co-workers was normal nothing negative, hardest part of job bi-lingual, most enjoyable plenty hours"
good,"Good people to work with, insurance, long lunches, great breaks, management could be difficult, hardest part standing too long."
good,"A typical day working for WalMart Inc is fast pace and steady. I gained 5 years of customer service experince with WalMart Inc, beginning as a cashier & working my way up to a Customer Service Manager's position, where I left off with WalMart Inc. I found some of the managers to be a challenging to work with, but I'm grateful for the challenging experince. My co-workers where always a pleasure to work with and we were great as a team. The hardest part of my job I would have to say was seeing someone sick and not being able to sale medication to them due to them not having the proper identification or being under age to purchase the merchandise. The most enjoyable part of my job with WalMart Inc was meeting new people everyday!"
good,"used cash register to ring up purchases, took deposits and payments, labeled and shelved customer purchases for future pickup, worked with other employees to store and find stored orders, used hand held computer to record location of purchases; hardest part of job was locating some items, some stored in trailers outside store during winter (Christmas); Most enjoyable part was serving the customers"
good,"Very good place to work, good training happy fun people to work with."
good,"Put all returned merchindise back on the shelves, check stock room, stock shelves, help customers."
good,"I had a great time and learned many valuable skills working for and with walmart.I met alot of great and working people that know and truely understand the meaning of ""TEAM PLAYERs"" I will miss being a part of the overnight crew."
good,Evidence that size isn't everything. Company has wonderful employees that make the workplace enjoyable. Opportunities to improve the general culture to improve revenues exist.
good,It's fine for a job if your independent and do not have any children.
good,"Makes an employee want to strive for the customers. Gave me the feeling of wanting to go to work, meet the challeges and I suceeded"
good,i pushed carts but the managers had poor attitudes and walked around with their noses stuck up. not ALL of them but quite a few
good,I loved it at first and then after my second year and the store manager changed everything went down hill. They say that they are family oriented and they are'nt.
good,I enjoyed helping the customers it gave me a sense of purpose at work. I know that if the products are priced and placed correctly so that customers can find them I know I did my job well.
good,"As a courtesy associate, I handled carts and emptying the bottle room machines. It was important to keep an eye on the weather forecast to layer up and down as needed, and to wear the right shoes/boots depending on the day. It was rewarding work overall and being a team player really helped me and my co-workers succeed out there."
good,I have been at walmart for 3 years now it is a good experience we get very busy on holidays and i like it when its busy cause it keeps me busy somtimes...
good,I enjoy working with my fellow associates on the floor. I love being able to assist the customers. Currently hours are being cut and that puts a damper on things.
good,"The job is great if your serious about working. But if you make friends there, it can be distracting and you can lose your job, so it's better to focus more on the job than being social."
good,You are hired for a position but you're never in that spot you work on top of one another. There are some great employees there but a lot of people who come to work that want to get paid to do nothing
good,"Overall, walmart wasnt too bad to work for. I could deal with rude customers, and the work that needed done. But the store i worked at had terrible management. They were selfish, rude, and treated us employees terribly. One other thing i wish walmart could do is make different shifts available for people with families."
good,"Good place to work. It's hard work, but they hire mostly good people. Management is mostly good. You can almost always find someone to help with any problem."
good,"Walmart works like a family run business. They are willing to work around your schedule to a certain extent, but you cant go in thinking you will get weekends off or never work afternoons.  If you are realistic in your expectations you will get what you give."
good,"Wal-mart great to work for if you dont want to get to management. if you do need to play store politics to get in. if you just need a job that can pay your bills then, this is a company for you, they will cut you"
good,"I enjoyed my customers. Some of the Mgmt. helped you. I was sick alot with my Diabetes so i missed days. And i quit 2 times"
good,"It was okay, if you’re willing to give up your life to work for theirs. It was hard scheduling off for my friends funeral. They are not very considerate in my opinion"
good,The hours are not very flexible however the pay is worth it. The job is very comfortable the only problem would be the resistance in flexibility of hours. If you are full time you get 40 hours every pay period.
good,Walmart is on a point system and doctors notes are not accepted! 5 point and your out the door! No exceptions! Key event dates are 2 points and they fall off after 6 months
good,i think that Walmart can be fun and interesting but life there was chaotic. i learned what they wanted me to with key individuals and helped maintain a caring customer response.
good,"The Cap2 department  does have the most hours from the whole store so even working part time you can still get a lot of 40 week hours. I had school so i had to change my hours a few times. I feel like other departments they would definitely work with your school schedule however in my department, they kept switching my schedule to when i could not make it knowing I have school. My department had a manager who was really tough and stubborn and made it hard for us to work with sometimes."
good,transparency thought processes or processes lacking the attention needed to succeed within expected time frame.  still a great company to work for with great benefits for associates that chose to take advance of.
good,I like the company I love what I do overall but my store and the management team is horrible What I do fun I love making things look beautiful. I love making customers happy
good,This company lacks management that knows how to manage! No proper training and management rude to employees! Worst company I have ever worked for!! 😔😔😔
good,Overall Walmart was fair wages for the work the was done. Some of management was really out to help you as a person and not just as your manager. There was a really good Environment flowing between everybody. No raises were given unless you became manager. But easy job easy money.
good,This was a fun place to work. unfortunately if you're single with kids or just with kids it's very hard to schedule your family life around your working life.
good,Rude Management judgement but over all i  love to work there i had good times and bad times but mangers cant run the store the right and they treat us unfairly
good,O Walmart Brasil LTDA é uma grande  rede de supermercado americana. Porém bem conhecida no Brasil por ser uma das empresas com marcas de produtos vendidos no exterior. Mais segue as normas e leis brasileira do trabalhador.
good,There are various reasons walmart could do better. But nothing that is being visibly done to improve them. However I do still enjoy my position on a daily basis dealing with my regulars and giving them a smile to leave with.
good,It is very hard work and is physically demanding. It requires a lot endurance and ability to work in harsh weather (especially the heat). All in all though it wasnt that bad.
good,Company is what you would've expected from the largest retailer in the world. Schedule can be some what difficult to deal with during holidays times if you have a family. 14 to 16 hour work days are common during holidays
good,The job at Walmart everyone was under so must pressure that the environment became unfriendly even to the customers as well. I did not like the situation it put an employee in.
good,I normally work in the morning 7 am - 4 pm. I like it because it don't be a lot of customers in the store early in the mornings. I work in Apparel so I am able to get the clothes on the racks and tables.
good,"A day at work is normally a nine hour shift with a one hour lunch and two fifteen min breaks. I’ll go from each area to help out from customer service to pushing carts to cap team, it just depends who needs me and when they need me. This job taught me a lot more customer service skills."
good,It isnt the greatest place to work for. They do not work with you at all. It is all about the company and they say they are a family company and care about their employees but it isnt.
good,"Keeping up with changes "
good,"Each time a manager is replaced, the newer manager is more strict and treats each associate with further callous effeciency. They ""do their job"" but you work what they need, or you can leave. Doesn't matter how long you've been there or how good you do your job, you work when they want you to or you will be replaced. The humanity of the workplace is disappearing at an alarming rate. They will not give you a saturday off, even for a case like school. They expect you to work any and all free time in such cases. In this way, their ""true availability"" form is treated like a joke. They will change your schedule however they want without permission, and then will force you into a ever changing schedule by rejecting any ""true availability"" form that they dislike (no fridays, saturdays, or sundays off)."
good,it was very stressful in some ways. i threw the truck everyday and it consisted of throwing at least 25 boxes a minute. if you couldnt do that then you would work the line which was also stressful.
good,It’s a good job to get experience in working and pay is not bad. It gives you more information about the job career. Overall it’s a good starting job.
good,The job was good in the beginning when your body is fresh but the repetition boring tasks that are physically grueling will weigh down on you mentally and especially physically.
good,Gostei de trabalhar nessa empresa. Gostaria de voltar e ter mais uma oportunidade pois foi meu primeiro emprego como caixa.
good,"Times have changed. Things have gotten bad. No home life. Would recommend as a place to work, just not my facility. Time to move on and do something different."
good,"I enjoyed working with different people of all ages. My days would start by meeting up with my other management peers seeing where at in the team schedules pertaining to who had their breaks and lunches and who needed them next within the hour and coming up. Management whenever I needed them depending on the shift always took a while to come up front and when they did come up they did not always listen to what I would tell them, I would tell the customer no we cannot do that or we can do this instead because of our policies and then customer would ask for an assistant manager. I would call a manager up to the front, my managers would take over 20 minutes sometimes longer to come up front for the customer and then would not listen to what the situation is and would ask the customer. The customer sometimes would switch my words and say i refused to help them when in reality in our policies we would not be allowed to do something and then the manager would just give it to the customer because they don't want to deal with an upset customer. Making me look bad by trying to follow the policies of the company."
good,"Management was awful at the Marquette Store when I worked there. My department manager was wonderful and he truly knew his job and did it well."
good,"cashier,cleaned kept area cleaned and stocked. helped other employees if needed.always worked if called in.always helped in different departments if needed."
good,"Work is what you expect it to be, you get in your 8 hours doing what you're told. Wear comfy shoes, because you will be on your feet all day. Management isn't bad as long as you do your job."
good,They are very competitive when it comes to pricing on items for your everyday needs. They have really good quality clothing for inexpensive prices. They will refund just about any item if you are not satisfied with the product. This also applies to the food items as well.
good,The deli was stressful but it was fun. It was the hardest department to work at in Walmart so you get paid a dollar more. The hours were manageable. I cooked and cleaned. Some of the customers weren’t nice but luckily it’s a quick job to get them in and out.
good,"Can be a fun place to work, but a lot  of favoritism at the store I worked at.. Regular customers  small town stores. Stores are geared more towards on line ordering."
good,"Ambiente muy pesado y gerencia te hecha la culpa de sus errores y mas si el gerente es nuevo en el cargo."
good,"I worked at the store in Pagosa Springs, CO for two years. Great place to work in 2016. Now it's terrible. Bad policies and still bad management. Also worked at the Danville, IL store."
good,They were overly strict with schedules and kept putting me in for days I'd already ask off for appointments. Some of the younger employees were rude and would be very sarcastic about things to the newer workers which was very uninviting. I told a manager but nothing was done
good,Most employees are friendly and helpful.   The customers are a very diverse group.  I enjoyed helping the customers with their needs and questions regarding Walmart and it's services/products.  I would enjoy working for Walmart agIN.
good,Walmart was like a family. Everyone looked out for eachother.  The customer were great and the environment was amazing.  I would recommend it to others .
good,Working at Walmart was very difficult the balanced life and family because it was working overnight the difference from working overnight today's was only $0.50 per hour difference I didn't mind it working overnight I kind of enjoyed it but yet it was difficult to get time off you have to go through too much red tape just to be able to get that time off very difficult to get transferred to another department
good,"A lot of work is expected if working a cap position.   You will do your job,  then do other people's job.   Not a lot of positive reinforcement.   Managers are there, but always hard to find."
good,Great interaction with customers and really enjoyed job in working with them to meet all their desires for clothing they were seeking in apparel department.
good,Walmart was a okay job to work at. I worked there 3rd shift so didn’t have to deal with customers but our management was very rude and never helped with any problems around the job.
good,"My only problem with store 912 "
good,I would like to work there again after 12 yrs and I was  told I wasn't living up to there exspectation .so it's seems that it doesn't matter how long u been there or how long hard u work they want u gone your gone. Still I loved my job and my friends and associate's.
good,"Only part time, rules same as riverside. no room for advancement. Can not have Sunday's off. Hours are changed every three weeks, no consistent days off."
good,I loved the people I worked with but the management was horrible and didnt treat everyone fairly. I loved the long lunches and breaks that were given.
good,"Walmart is a good place to start working if you are thinking about a management position. However smaller stores, like mine, do not have many opportunities for advancement since people were comfortable in their positions."
good,Walmart was a pretty easy job I was a cashier there Walmart is busy on holidays but the other days it wasn’t bad the managers I had were very nice and easy to talk to
good,Corbin Walmart makes their own rules... but everything but management is great. I worked for 2 years perfect record and was fired because a new management member wanted someone else for my position. I got booted out for something very insignificant and sure enough was replaced with who he wanted.
good,"manual labor binning merchandise, scanning for outs. Dealing with clearance merchandise. Meetings with supervisors. and associates."
good,"Most of the employees at any given store are overworked. Most managers have no clue what they are doing, but there a several who are genuinely kind and have their employees best interest at heart. A majority of the time there an air of ""do as I say, not as I do"" between corporate, managers and employees. The more you point out their mistakes the more they don't like you. It is fast-paced, sometimes stressful, but never boring and that's the best part. The benefits are decent but don't expect to have an easy time getting days off unless you're the favorite."
good,Loved working at Walmart. I loved the customers and my coworkers. Meeting new people at the cash register every day and hearing their stories. Their caring attitudes. Management was terrible though.
good,Walmart was a good job I learned a lot. There management left a lot to be desired.  Very little communication  between workers and management. Also there was a lot of favoritism.
good,My experience at Walmart was a good job but not for a person with family.. If you like working evenings or early morning then this is a job for you.. I stocked and helped customers all day..
good,"Work requires ever-restricting work schedules. Management does not seem to take suggestions seriously. While emphasis IS on patient care and safety, conditions and requirements of pharmacists make it increasingly likely that errors will occur. Hardest part of job is being pulled simultaneously in multiple directions (i.e. Dr. calls, mandatory counseling, verification of every rx, opioid stewardship intervention and documentation, as well as ordering, maintainence of physical plant, associate feedback sessions, instructional time, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job is occasionally having a beneficial impact on patient therapeutics."
good,"I like my job but the pay is horrible and it needs to be changed!  Walmart is s huge establishment to only pay $11 an hour to start."
good,"you never know if you have job next day or not. taking away shifts, cutting down hours. no accountably attandance, overtime is only $ 3 more not time and half!"
good,Worked here for about 2 years before I had my second child. I had fun working at Walmart at times. When I was pregnant they treated me poorly. Had to work by myself a lot in the produce department when I was pregnant. They dont care if your old or pregnant theyll work you hard. But despite that they're an ok company to work for. Fair wages.
good,"If there were opportunities for advancement and a change in customer service management, this would be a great place to work. Store management is fantastic."
good,The job was ok after awhile it starts to wear you down. Management varries but overall it was a decent place to work. The work itself was easy but boring.
good,"Particularly challenging work. Management goals and deadlines are both lofty and based on the upper limit of the best employee's skills, and you will be compared to them. "
good,"Great place to work but nothing is done by the books, management always cutting corners and taking hours from one department to give to another, if you want a job where they’re going to give you 32+ hours a week Walmart isn’t the place for you."
good,I enjoyed the fast paced working environment. Customers for the most part were friendly. The store managers were always ready to listen if you had any suggestion or complaint. My work schedule varied from week to week. The pay is low and benefits are given only to full timers which is not many.
good,They hire yes men as management instead of hiring problem solvers. Takes someone with a great work ethic and a sense of humor to deal with all the entitled workers you'll deal with. Long hours and the pay is basically good enough so you just shut up and deal with it.
good,"Es una buena empresa para las personas que están iniciando su vida laboral, adquieres mucha experiencia, no esta bien los horarios y salarios son muy abusivos en cuanto a horarios y sueldos son muy bajos."
good,"Just like the off brand great value, the store is much the same. Its work that looks nice and pays better than its surroundings but it's just meh. If you like doing quizzes walmart has a training system in the back."
good,It's very stressful and they arent very compassionate with employees. Work place drama. Too much work expected for the time your there.all over the place.
good,Work was what you made it. I've learned how to send and receive money transfer.Management some was fair and there picks.The hardest part of my job was when we was short staffed and had to do it all on my own.The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people everyday
good,I was in the money center. It wasn't always busy so they would have me help in customer service or out on a cash register. Overall it's not the worst place to work. I had a minor issue with a CSM (customer service manager). She just didnt have such a positive vibe. she seemed very rude and inconsiderate of anyone that she didnt play favorites with. My job was simple and a higher pay rate but had a lot of responsibility. Also one week was only 32 hours where the next would be 38 to 40 hours. Made it difficult to keep up with bills. I would work 2 morning shifts and 3 evening shifts. not very good for my son.
good,Hard work which I do not mind but it was as if I was beating my head against a wall and trying to get noticed. But I never got the recognition I felt I deserved even though I worked my but off.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart the work was easy, I had consistant hours, and taking time off was easy. The only thing that made it hard were alot of the employees.  They were all negative and would just constantly not do anything. Then blame management for their write ups and things like that."
good,"Was overall a easy job but when u have a bad manager or a one that picks favorites is hard to work with or even be around, the discounts they provited were good for the type of company they are.   Hours were set if asked or needed.   Pay was good but no overtime ever"
good,fast changing fun environment hard work and hard to advance if you don't know someones in upper management always good people to work with customer service is and absolute must here
good,I was hired in the deli and I think I would’ve enjoyed it if they allowed me to transfer to a different department. I was told I would be making $12.50 and I’m making $11.50. They said the computer figures out your pay and they couldn’t do anything about it. You can’t transfer departments for 6 months.
good,"Depending on the day and hours you are scheduled the experience will vary. Usually the mornings on weekdays are not too bad. After 11am things will start to pick up and depending on how many managers are scheduled you could be having an easy time or getting yelled at by your customers. Weekends are a mess. The store is so loud, the lines are long, managers are doing all they can and customers still refuse to accept the fact that they are the not being ignored."
good,"The pay was pretty nice at 11 an hour, especially for my first job. Management at the time i worked there however was pretty dictorial. All the managers basically ran the store like a mob when it came to the associates and if you stepped out of line with one they all hammered you for it. There were a few good ones but the ones I normally dealt with weren't so."
good,The job is great. The environment is what Wal-mart lives off of. They want it to be as easy & simple as possible. yet the management gives you a hard time & want everything a certain way.
good,"Workflow/Management Restructuring transitional periods are very stressful if you are conscientious, intelligent  and productive worker. I am not sure why those periods are necessary unless their is a serious shortage of available workers, which inGaylord MI may have been the case. Management has lots of empathy but that does not change the fact that what is required to get done, no way can get done with the available workers and shifts."
good,"Attendance policy is unrealistic and even following the excepted guidelines for absences, such as unexpected illness or hospitalization and even bereavement, scheduling reflects noticeable changes in hours and shifts preferences"
good,"* Más trato humano hacia el personal "
good,Walmart is an okay place to work for . It’s very fast paced and takes adjustment. Manager are pretty fair. Customers can be a little stressing but a worker and easily calm them down.
good,A typical day at work is walking into 5-6 trucks waiting to be checked in. It usually takes the first 2 hours to catch up on all the vender's arriving. Managing your time is very important so you know that you have all your reports printed and out to other associates.     Then UPS Fedex and Fedex espress arrive and I check in all packages through handheld computer and then deliver to appropriate departments in the store. At the end of the workday I balance out all deliveries and make sure that all money is equal to deliveries for that given day.
good,This job was mostly a good start. The job itself didn't offer much but the experience and valuable life lessons were a great learning curve. Would reccomend
good,"I loved my job at Walmart and was very sad to leave. I loved how there was always something to do, and if I had any questions/concerns the manager(s) were there to help me."
good,no job security anymore. they do have prolly the best technician support of the big chains though. lots and lots of rules that must be followed or you will get coached (written up). all the budget cuts make them seem like they are gonna turn into walgreens espicially since their new head of pharmacy is ex walgreens.
good,Overnight Stockingwas fun but not for overnight with an hour lunch it was to much downtown and mad you so sleepy sitting for an hour. When an employee was threatening me for no reason and  I didn’t even know them management let them go but when there was another employee that was messing up my job and choked me on the clock because I peacefully confronted her about Lying on other coworker and myself and I made a police report management did not let her go. I didn’t feel safe and ultimately decided to end services
good,Walmart an great employer it's just management that is the problem with Walmart  it's not all Walmarts I hope. Managment  can really make it a Dead end job
good,"I enjoyed my time with Walmart. I feel that Walmart is a great company to work for, but most managers are less than pleasant to work with. I worked in several stores ranging from Georgia to Tennessee, all store are the same. To put it into perspective, I worked in the pharmacy at a store in Tennessee, the store manager didn't even know who I was, much less my name. The pharmacy was amazing. I loved my job as a pharmacy technician, and Walmart provided me the opportunity to become a pharmacy tech, while working in the pharmacy."
good,"Job was good, you work hard it pays off, your co-workers become family. Teamwork is a big thing at walmart good company to work for in my opinion. You do have to work holidays but eventually you get used to it."
good,"It was a pretty great place to work,other than one mngr being a witch.they good great breaks and free snacks all the timeit was a clean productive friendly/ and fair place to work for...had a covered smoking patio which was nice however I'm a freeze baby and wish it had been heated too"
good,"Management did not spend enough time working on the floor and seeking what the associates go through -- their frustrations, their  real work load. There just needs to be more presence. Too critical without assessing the environment in which the associates work."
good,"Sometimes the managers act like scumbags, but that’s whatever. I would 1/5 managers actually care about their associates well beings. However, they are such a gigantic financial conglomerate they can fire someone and have him replaced the next day. Just how it is I guess."
good,I like Wal-Mart I really do I just feel like he managers and other co workers there were not enthused nor did they care about the other employees. Nobody would speak or say good morning . Overall it was just a dull environment
good,"Decent job, decent pay. With better management and proper scheduling, could be someone's temporary solution to no income. However is short lived by no real help towards education, aside from yearly tuition assistance good towards only a business degree."
good,Advancement is all about favorism. The work enviornment is Ok but management can change the work flow. Not all are corrupt. There is a chamce to learn.
good,I would say do your job and go home . Most of all if you don’t know about their policy on calling in ask it’s helpful or if you forgot ................
good,"Loved working here, until I needed them to be flexible with my school schedule. That was the biggest downside for me. They claim to love people in school and will help them but I found it to be the exact opposite"
good,I have been working at walmart for almost 6 months now and it seems to be a place where it never advances up. It's extremely hard to move to fulltime position. They would rather have several part time employees than a few fulltime employees with benefits
good,"Typical word day at Walmart was very fast paced and busy. I learned how to do WIC vouchers, management wasn't the best because there was so many people that had to be watched. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers."
good,I liked working here except when I started I let them know I need 40 hours per week. They lowered my hours to 20 to 30 a week so I had to quit and pursue other jobs.
good,"Typical Day: check out customers, clean your area"
good,"Your basic retail workplace, fast paced and always busy. The cashiers were occasionally as sed to assist in other departments such as out on the lot to do carts"
good,It was overall a good place to work it just wasn’t compatible with myself. After the attendance policy was changed I couldn’t miss very many days and as a part time student I found it very important to be able to have a flexible schedule.
good,"Walmart all depends on what type of Employer you have."
good,"I started working at the only Walmart in a small college town in 2015 as an overnight stocker. There were not very many customers that came into the store when I worked, but I enjoyed my work in the evenings because the managers and my co-workers were pleasant towards me. I started working as a fitting room associate, and I was alone sometimes. I answered the phone whenever it rang. I did a lot of sorting and folding, and I got familiar with most of the products that Walmart has. I used the radio to communicate with the managers at that store whenever it was needed, and they were somewhat easygoing and relaxed most of the time. Then I moved to a fitting room associate during the daytime, and there were more people calling and asking for assistance with the fitting room but there were also more people there that I worked with, and that job was fairly easy. I moved to a cashier position at the beginning of 2017. I liked my job for the most part, but sometimes it was difficult because I would encounter a problem with the cash register, or run out of certain bills in my register sometimes, and need to get a manager to come to the register to help me, but they were often busy with other things, so I would have to wait. I moved to a different store and it was not nearly as nice as the first store I went to, it was much busier and the managers did not treat me very well because of a disability that I have. I was on some prescribed medication at the time that made me feel sick almost all the time, and I kept having to use the bathroom because of it, and sometimes I spent like 10-15"
good,"Working for the company itself had its downfalls. My manager is not the most personable person in the world and came up with every excuse on why I couldn't be promoted. I get positive feedback from my CSMs, but not her. I've been with Wal-Mart for 4 years and I feel stuck."
good,"Typically for people who like people and enjoy working or starting out in retail environments. Working hours always include weekends and the duties have a gray area. Employees are expected to help in other areas during peak times and can limit the time spent in their trained assigned departments. This cross training philosophy is helpful, but can exceed limitations of the departments. The perimeters the employee is expected to fill is all based on demand basis with all the department managers in charge and how well they communicate with one another. This process gets very confusing during holiday peak times."
good,"Amazing associates but corporate policy is AWFUL. The people who work and shop are for the most part amazing. Unfortunately the few bad apples spoiled the bunch. Not to mention the fact that they do not accept doctors notes, in the attendance policy."
good,"Walmart was creative and fun to work at and had many great coworkers for me to enjoy working with, while the management was not the best I did enjoy my self working for Walmart and it’s customers."
good,"Poor Management, inconsiderate to your life outside of work, but overall its a good place to work for pay and benefits, if you dont mind standing or strenuous work for 10-12 hours, this is a great stepping stone in life"
good,"It was a great place to work, the management was just very poor! the pay was good, could have been better in the department i was in, overall i would work at a different one again."
good,I would have still worked there had not been in the grocery area.  Too strenuous for my knees and back.  Other than that I would still be employed with them.
good,Unloaded semi trucks and stocked selves. I worked the chemical and paper goods section. I also helped customers find the goods they were looking for.overall it was a good job.
good,"Management sides with customers over associates even when associates are trying to follow the policies. It ends up being very hypocritical because if an associate did what management does they would quickly get fired, yet when management does it it makes the associate look bad. This enforces the customer mindset of “the customer is always right”, which causes many customers to act rudely. It is difficult to keep a job because there are so many tiny ways to make a mistake and be fired."
good,I loved working at Walmart. There was a lot if great people I worked with on pretty much any shift I was scheduled. I was responsible for the sporting goods department.
good,"I was happy with every experience working at Walmart, except for the store manager. I loved all of my coworkers and department managers! I was in the bakery and had a lot of fun."
good,It is a decent place to work. The management is constantly changing and so are policies. The discount that they give employees is one of the best perks.
good,"Starting out i took the role of the lowest on the ladder, Cart pusher."
good,this job was okay. i liked some of the people i worked with. it can be laid back and it can also be stressful. most enjoyable part of the job was when i was in sporting goods department.
good,It was a good atmosphere with employees. Fair breaks and lunches. No benefits or good money. No advancement options really. Hours.....................
good,I would like to work a Wal-Mart again if i got the chance but i would bring more to the table as i would want to learn more then i did when i was at my last Wal-Mart
good,"I recommend it for someone who is looking for an easy paying job. The day to day process in the deli is the same everyday besides the customers are never predictable. Management didn't do much besides checking off our close at the end of the night. Hardest part was the cleaning because everything had to be up to regulation and pretty much perfect, working anywhere else in the store was A LOT easier."
good,"Es muy divertido trabajar ahí, es muy fácil hacer amigos, pero, a veces se puede sentir un ambiente muy tóxico con los clientes y hay mucha dificultad de ascenso."
good,I enjoyed working at walmart. My reason for leaving was insurance was only granted to full time employees. I bordered full time with my part time status. I started having health issues and had to leave after losing my state insurance.
good,good place to work nice people being a cashier sucks managers need to get there acts together and coordinate better otherwise not a bad environment to work at
good,Working for Wal-Mart will test all your skills at once. The ability to over come adversity will help you in your job. Wal-Mart prides it's company on competition.
good,It’s really busy all the time they don’t schedule enough people and when people call off they don’t try and find someone to replace them for the day if they know someone is low on hours.
good,Typical workday includes being pulled in a million directions while trying to accomplish you everyday tasks. Must be able to multitask efficiently. Patience is a must have characteristic.
good,"I enjoyed learning new things and working with others, I do feel that they should pay more for the labor they expect, and I feel they should have a better management structure to help keep employees."
good,"Walmart is a nice place to work but the management sucks. The hours was great in the beginning but after a few months there they start to cut your hours. If someone called off they ask you to stay to "
good,"Im Still at Walmart because of my Customers, I have customers who liik for me. If a customer sees me in a different store, im asked you don't work at Walmart any more? I tell them no not getting any hours.."
good,"Walmart is a stressful workplace.  You are working 12 to 14 hours a day.  Don't give you enough time to do paperwork since you had to be on the floor the whole time you are on your shift.  Since I was hired from the outside, there was some assistant managers helped you understand more of the company and the equipment that was used for your job."
good,"A typical day at work: I worked hard, did all the jobs that nobody else wanted to do. Even the dirty smelly jobs. Somebody had to do it."
good,Health benefits are good. Company lacks work life balance. And provides no accommodation. You also get a yearly bonus approximately 1 and half of your monthly salary earned last year. And you also get a 20% discount on top of 10% discount throughout the year.
good,"En mi opinión creo que trabaja en esta empresa significa dar mucho para no recibir lo que uno da, en el sentido de las cargas horarias muchas veces son mas exigentes y no se ven reflejadas en el sueldo. También personalmente como trabajador part time (fines de semana), no se considera también la carga estudiantil, de universidad, instituto, etc. Aspectos que puedan significar un estrés en ambos ámbitos."
good,Very cool place to work its just that they don't really care about if you sick or if your children are sick or your personal life at all the want you at work no excuses at all you only get four points to use once they are gone they let you work full time the you fired at the end of your shift.
good,Not the best but not the worst job. At the time did not pay enough for the area I lived in. I enjoyed my coworkers but the managers were a joke. At least the one who they put over my area. She did not know what she was doing.
good,This is a great place to shop if you only need grocery type items.  Working there can be very dull or very busy.  Not a steady flow of customers.  They prepare work schedules for 90 days at a time with no changes available.  Not very considerate of employee availability changes.
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart  I enjoyed the people. It didn’t pay as well as I like to make a living. I am single with children and no child support. It’s hard supporting family on one income. Advancement was there either.
good,They have an established business and its not going anywhere. The pay is decent. But be ready for a lot of unasnwered questions. Walmart corporate makes all decisions down to store level and a lot of them make no sense. Their store management system is flawed. However they do provide more than average amount of resources for associates to help them when they are having a hard time. Applying for that help is a nightmare though.
good,"My typical day at work would consist of me unloading the truck, separating freight, and then running it. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to work with my co-workers."
good,"Working among people who could just stand there ( quite literally ) while you're giving it your all and make the same wages is infuriating. Management is all over the place, and I wouldn't trust them to know my left sock from my right. Very unreliable. But the actual work, at least in my department, was enjoyable. I loved my coworkers, most of the time, and I was good at my job. The pay is satisfactory and the hours are nice if you need to cash."
good,It’s a good job with hours and pay. Sometimes store in unorganized when I am off. Since working in the meat/dairy stocking area I have made meat sales go up.
good,"Walmart is a stressful place to work, but the high volume and stress level at time  is what makes it enjoyable. Everyone that works there are friendly and are always willing to help you improve yourself."
good,"It wasn't my favorite job, but it was alright. I don't really have anything good to say. And I don't really have anything bad to say. As far as I'm concerned, it was just a job!"
good,"For the most part, working there was satisfying. Helping people and the job of asset protection was rewarding. Management wanted us to do other jobs that hindered our ability to provide the security that was our primary role. (i.e. cleaning windows and mopping floors) It could be stressful when it got busy and people would get irritated with you, sometimes. But, you try and make their visit as pleasant as possible."
good,"Typical Day - stocking helping customers"
good,"Not a bad place for a temp job.  Stocked shelves, helped people find whatever they were looking for.  Helped people with all their items to their cars."
good,Working at Walmart gave me a great amount of customer service. Working with people also made me so great at communicating with people. Walmart is a fast paced and easy going work place.
good,"If you can't handle people being in your face then don't get a job at walmart. "
good,"As a cap 2 member you work hard to unload the truck, you work hard to move the freight to the appropriate aisles, you stock the  shelves and help customers where needed, other than that the day can be fast or slow depending on your pace and mood. Both of which improve the more you smile."
good,N/A Expected to work more than 45 hours a week.Workload too heavy at times. No work life balance.Some of the directors were not good at managing people.
good,"It was just work no play,some of the managers were always on their phone the only time they actually do any work is when the general manager was around or corporate was in the building"
good,"I was a cashier and they were decent at making sure you had what you needed to run the register properly, if it was slow Id go help out other departments and stock or do pricing changes and learn the customer service desk. Most managers were understanding with the fact that life happens  The hardest part of the job was not standing up for myself when a customer would lose their temper for as the customer is always right and I would be the one in trouble for it. I loved meeting new people and some of my good friends I met while working at Walmart."
good,"working at Walmart was relaxing for the most part, see people you know and nice coworkers and sometimes CSM , some of the policies could use tweeking cause most didnt stick with it.. advancement was not easy training is the best i have seen really helps virtual situations, DHMC could learn from that..."
good,Its slow pass sometimes a burst of people would come but slow no over time not paid enough to live or enough hours and they dont work with you with what time u need to work or not
good,"The job i had of being a cashier was fairly easy, but very fast paced. The great thing is that you get to basically just talk all day. There are some more complicated transactions, but you have plenty of other cashiers and CSMs that can help you when you run into problems."
good,"Lack of career advancement, low hours for full time employees. Needs better management. But it did have good breaks, that were fairly spaced out, some days were better than others regarding other employees, all the employees tended to get along well."
good,"This was a good job with bad rules, basically a job for a person with no family life, but it could be much better if the attendance policy was more reasonable."
good,I learned how to pierce ears got to meet alot of good people..i had alot of different job title's and i learned something new every time..They give a 10% discount
good,"Find from, changes and changes to policies and new positions being eliminated or changed bases on gossip from jealousy from other employees to being betrayed by management and give positions to people not qualified or fit for such positions but friendship and butt kissing will work best for you. Unfortunately hard work, responsibility, reliability and work ethic are not  qualifications for this company anymore. Had fun, enjoyed most of the time there but this company has changed a lot."
good,"Its a okay job for cash. Buy some place you are stuck in one stop with no Opportunity. Mrgs are lazy and dont want to deal with customer "
good,"Walmart was a decent place to work, paid very well for a part-time job. The main problems were, not enough staffing during busy times of the day-year. No raises, believe I was stiffed on my profit sharing, the head manager was very out of touch with what was going on in the store business wise. They claim to work with schedules for part time employees, yet I was being scheduled for times I needed to be at my full time job, when I brought this to their attention, I was simply removed from scheduling. I would happily work for Walmart again under a different manager"
good,"Stable Income for my family, some advancement. Will work a lot of hours as a salary management. There is a chance of being promoted if you work hard, and are honest."
good,was always busy working at wal-mart.making sure that the store was always clean and restrooms as well.i don't care for job myself.nothing i would like to do again..
good,"Working for Wa-Mart is ok. They do give you a discount card, which does help with buying things. Work life balance is ok. CEO is ok. IT jobs are mostly either being outsourced."
good,It’s a great first job but they don’t like to give out good hours. They are pretty lenient when it comes to tardiness. There are certain times when the employees try to push work off onto newer workers.
good,"My experience here began as a great place to work with happy fellow associates, flexibility in schedules, enough training and equipment to do my job correctly and plenty of associates to adequately help customers.  The holiday incentives were nice, as are the quarterly bonuses.  Medical benefits and family leaves are nice as well."
good,"Associates are nice, sometimes management works with you and your time needed off. Pay is good, they do work with you on your hours.."
good,Management in the store I worked at needs to fully reevaluated. I've never worked for a company in which you'll get retaliated against just for calling home office. They will write you up or find some reason to fire you. I feel as though if you have to do that then you know you're wrong somewhere
good,I liked it until I transferred to another Walmart and the management was rude. You do a lot of running around and making sure that the shelves are full for the shoppers. Some of the workers that work there should not have a job like some cashiers are very rude n dress sloppy.  I can never go shopping without a worker following me around and it makes me uncomfortable.
good,I ended up so stressed it was physically making me sick and none of my managers really cared and even gave me false information. Even my store manager didn't care if I stayed or quit and they shouldn't be like that. So I left.
good,"Understaffed over worked and no weekends off to be with family."
good,The management would be mad at me for getting the meat wall filled at 8:02 when its supposed to be done at 8:00 also they didnt have anything to say about the health problems the freezer caused and someone that worked there before me had the same problems
good,pay is good politics play a roll as most good jobs do but it's a good job to work overall Good employ's they try hard to push the insubordination on you every time they want you to do something.
good,"I worked there as one of my first jobs while I was in school. Management is questionable many times. They change often and they're learning as well, so they may not know a whole lot about what they are managing."
good,A empresa em si é boa porém o que a torna ruim para os associados são as lideranças
good,Not the easiest job but was good for a little while. Not always friendly but the work with the hard workers. Have good benefits and stock options. Good starting wage for younger groups
good,"A Walmart management position is high stress and a lot of long hours.Senior management expects and requires management to give up personal time on a regular basis.  Your life becomes your work, not time for a personal life."
good,When l first started working at Walmart I really enjoyed going to there then they startled changing .They started forming cliques. The lazy people were getting promoted. It was a mess..
good,"Walmart was a nice place to work however some of the managers was not family orientated people. They needed more training in dealing with associates"
good,"Walmart can be challenging if you are a single parent. Because of the attendance policy, I had to find childcare for my daughter when she had the flu, which was a struggle. They have an $11 an hour starting wage and diverse employees. It can be a fun working environment."
good,"Worked in one position 19 1/2 yrs; now they are eliminating my job. Feel like they don’t care and act like “out with the old”!!"
good,Cool place to work for during the day. Meet different kinds of people and the work is easy.I learned how to interact with different types of personalities.
good,This job is pretty easy to do but the management is inconsistent and unreliable. It is easy to get along with the customers and coworkers. There is not much to worry about safety wise.
good,This company tries to work people to death. There’s just barely enough workers to maintain facility half the size. The support manager will not let associates get their job done because this person makes the associates take care of someone else’s department. It is a counterproductive work environment.
good,Do the job get. Paid but look for something more while you're working there. There's so much more out there but use it while you can. That's my advice anyway
good,"It could definitely be worse. I would recommend my position, but you have to be fast, accurate, and good at time management. Everything has to be done when and how the managers want it. Pretty simple."
good,Fun place to work most of the time. Management needs better training on how to treat associates with respect. Pretty good benefits and HATE working on Thanksgiving
good,"the associates who work at Walmart are the best of people. they kind, fun and accepting. However the management intend on removing the people from the workplace and computerizing the whole shebang! the would like to be more like Amazon."
good,My assistants manager was a very unfair person. I constantly took other peoples shifts and did my job up and beyond all other customer service managers.
good,I enjoy parts of working at Walmart and other parts I don't. The CSM's aren't very friendly and its hard to find a manager to talk to when you need something.
good,"They worked with your life schedule, many departments to choose from. Working in the bakery was quite simple. I prepped and made bread, cookies and pastries. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers and taking orders and helping them find what they were looking for."
good,"Didn't like come work no more I hate the job don't care about family how u feel mom sick didn't care about it still, my mom could die  don't care about that."
good,Very busy with so many customers with so much product. Lots of cash handling.  Learned patience with the irate customers and that everyone is so different from one another.
good,empresa ótima para você aprender a trabalhar sob pressão.
good,"Fast pace environment work place.. great pay , if you like hard work and good disciplined job, this is it.. I like it...they try to work with you as long as you are willing to do your work.."
good,"Be bold"
good,"-Great for a first-time job "
good,"I used to work at a Walmart in another state, but I had to transfer after moving, and this walmart is so much worse than my previous store! My old store was organized, efficient, and a lot of respectable people that I call family! This one is UNorganized, the people I work with are not as hard working, and the managers are either really tough and rude or lazy and don't care what you do! The CEO of walmart even came a few weeks ago and said that this was the best one in the area! That's saying a lot about Walmart if my previous store was so much better."
good,"Stocking items and keeping my work area clean"
good,I liked working at Wal-Mart . The people kept it interesting.  The customers made my day. You get to knows the regulars and appreciate them. My coworkers were an inspiration.
good,"Empresa boa, mais o salario era muito pouco e nao tinha benefícios"
good,"honestly it was alot of things going on behind the the doors of walmrt, if one of the higher ups didnt like you they would make your job awful, i had a personal emergency that they couldnt accommodate me"
good,Bom e uma empresa que as vezes deixa a desejar e que ai acaba deixando o funcionar desmotivado.
good,"•Mostly always busy "
good,"as a photo lab associate you have to make sure the printers are running efficiently and keeping the work place clean and get all the photo orders done before when the time expected pick up "
good,working overnight you have to unload the truck when it comes and separate items by departments . Stock items in a timely manner so you can work another department .Hardest part is not having enough staff.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work, it can get very busy and stressful. I learned how to serve customers with fresh food. I would recommend this place for employment."
good,They always changed my schedule and never told me. I would think i go in at 1pm at times but they would change it over night and make me come in at 8am without telling me.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart for the most part. Daily cashiering and meeting new people. Fellow employees were fun to work with.  I found management hard to talk with and express ideas.  I also couldn't get enough hours to live on because they keep people at part-time.
good,Wal-Mart is a good first or second job for someone in high school. It is also good for someone new to this country to teach work ethics and see the diversity of cultures in this country.
good,"I enjoyed working for walmart, it was fun and relaxing even on busy days. I liked the hours that I worked and the were flexible.  The co- workers were easy to work with as well."
good,you literally are worked to death for peanuts. you never get a holiday with your family and most employees are lazy and don't want to do but the bare minimum. so its up to you. and then when everything falls behind because you do 12 jobs at once....
good,atualmente sem gerente a dinâmica de convívio fica complicada pela falta de profissionalismo de alguns funcionários.
good,The work at Walmart wasn't hard but the pay still was very small.  Walmart provided very little to it's employees and people with family did struggle a bit financially
good,"too many cut hours and not enough money "
good,"Walmart Stocker you work from 2-11 pm this gives no time for other activities by the time the work day is over you go home sleep wake up and do it again, the one good thing that I can say about the Walmart I work at all my fellow associates are very kind supportive and fun to work around If it was anyone else the job would not be as energetic as it is/"
good,I learned to deal various type people. Customers and co-workers. Not a place to work forever. The hardest part was the standing for long periods of time.
good,"Easy Job Not Really a lot of stress , it’s easy to catch on to nothing to hard for anyone to learn everything is mainly based on your common sense level ."
good,"Long days with short pay. Would've liked to have been able to move up along the company more but it seems it's all in who you know. That's fine, I've learned skills I otherwise wouldn't have known."
good,I really do not know what to say except now I know how many characters to use to say nothing. I have to continue to type and say nothing but this program does the counting for you.
good,Management doesn't communicate to one another. Sometimes it feels like people are just wondering around. The way that some of the member of management operate is not with the best of intention.
good,It was an okay experience. i really wish i could have moved up more if given the opportunity. i think i gained great customer service training working here.
good,its not a bad place to work at. if you do chose to work there i would recommend to not try to go after a management position until after work there for awhile
good,"Started out working overnight as a replenishment clerk, then moved up to department manager during the days.  Worked 4 different departments as a manager.  Enjoyed using my organization skills and dealing with the public."
good,Walmart is a very up and down place to work in. The best part of my job are some of the people I work with and customers I interact with daily. The managers in Walmart more the salary members really don't know how to communicate with others and come off very disrespectful at times. They don't know how to use words like please or thank you. Communicating with management would be the hardest part of my job. My daily job is very fast pace and very stressful. It is full with training others managing associates and doing others job. I have learned time management skills and customer service skills through my years of working for walmart.
good,My day usually started around lunch time which was typially the busiest time of the day. I would head to my till and start ringing people through. My main job was to make sure the customer was 100% satisfied. The hardest part of my job was promoting master-cards to unhappy customers. I met a lot of friends and made it a very positive front end.
good,"I loved working with Walmart! A typical shift include me putting away stop, answering pages,  giving prescriptions and helping customers. Management was an issue here cause they did not communicate changes and were very hard to talk to. I didn't find my job hard at the slightest bit and enjoyed all the staff members that i called some of my best friends. I also made a lot of relationships with customers."
good,Más de 8 hrs de trabajo y ni comida de dan vales de despensa
good,"Walmart has friendly employees and management is easy to communicate with being problems or solutions. Any department was easy to learn from, the other employees and bosses were eager to teach and make sure you knew what you were doing. It wasn't just do this and they left, they would stick around and help or guide you to the proper way of the task. With all companies there can be a bit or conflict, usually it can be deescalated through conversation or a third party deterrent. The hardest part of said conflict was when there is actually a problem with upper management. I personally would say this is the biggest problem with Walmart. When a boss trots around and just puts down other employees because they can!"
good,"usually show up to work, unload a truck for general merchandise receiving and then go stock some of what was unloaded. Management is often wondering around and not paying attention to their subordinates"
good,"starting out i was really enjoying myself i had a great time; then after a while the relationship between me and walmart started to wayne, eventually i had a customer service manager who REALLY didn’t like me (i later discovered he was terminated) i also didn’t like the hours i got from there, i rarely had a social life even though the pay was PRETTY good, i was always tired. but these are the only gripes i had with the place, i still rate it high enough."
good,Working for Walmart was a great experience for me. I gave excellent customer service to our customers and helped assist them in a friendly matter. I was a team player and enjoyed learning new tasks.
good,I love working with customers. I Also enjoy working in different sections of Walmart because I got to meet new people and learn about new products. It was amazing during holiday season because it was a lot to do.
good,Several positions in Walmart are not worth the pay.  Upper management does not motivate personnel to do the best they can.  The only thing that you can hear from them is everything that you do wrong.  When help is needed they will walk away from you rather than confront the situation.
good,Walmart is a good company but only in certain locations. Management always micro manages and gets mad at an employee because of not getting work done even though they were the ones who told them to do something else. Most locations have managers who do not know how to talk to people in a professional setting.
good,Great environment with great coworkers however management needs work. A typical day at work includes lots of easy yet rewarding tasks and the hardest part would be dealing with certain managers
good,Walmart is an okay place to work. They keep you busy doing things as well as dispensing duties. Immunizations take up a portion of your time as well as consultations and patient questions.
good,Walmart is great company to work for to learn and grow your working portfolio. They have a lot of opportunities to learn different skills in different departments.
good,"Usually had a lot of work, the pay wasn't bad, however, sometimes the work-flow was slow. People who worked as permanent associates don't treat the temporary ones as well but that is to be expected. The remodeling team had to hire on some outside temps as well, some of which caused a lot of issues among the workers because of miscommunications between management and staff."
good,"Many years ago it was a customer service driven job. Unfortunately, I had 2 supervisors one of which I worked daily with, and saw the hour ahead of my time arrived, and all my hard work done. The other caught me as I stood and waited for customers at the cashier desk."
good,"Great place to get started if you have never worked before you gain experience in many areas such as social interaction with many people and you have opportunities to move around the store if they're openings."
good,"I loved my job, most of my co workers. Didnt have any problems with anyone. I got to know my customers, very nice people. I was always busy in my job but loved staying busy."
good,"Although I liked working at Walmart, I was deceived,disrespected and humiliated by management.Because of this I left on my own accord. Worked hard and got nothing but negativity from some management and praised by others,anyhow it was a learning experience."
good,"I worked as a cake decorator for a while at walmart. I had fun learning how to decorate cakes, but I could tell everyone else at walmart was very stressed out. The walmart I worked at as well was understaffed. For one, at one point I was the sole decorator and it was very stressful. I actually left because the stress was affecting my schooling and life outside of work."
good,It was easy to move to different. The managers we nice most difficult part is dealing with customers. They give you good amount of breaks and able to pick up extra shifts.
good,"Uma empresa boa de se trabalhar ,mas porem algumas pessoas funcionário estragam a empresa"
good,"While working at Walmart can be a bit stressful at some times or slow an unengaging at others, the paychecks at least made it all worth it. The unfortunate thing is Management has the tendency to give people the axe so that they don't have to give them any of the benefits."
good,"If you were like me and did Loss Prevention, the supervision lacks, which is nice. Did pretty much whatever as long as I was able to meet shoplifter quota. Safety checks and catching criminals is basically what I did. Could be fun if it's not a slow store."
good,"Current assistant manager.  In charge of knowing and being able to do everything in the store, handling all customer and associate issues, being able to run all equipment, contacting other business professionals.  "
good,"Very busy and up beat vibe in the workplace."
good,A day at Walmart can be very hectic and fast paced. I learned how to unload and organize large amounts of freight and learned how to use a meat  slicer. Management can be iffy some can be great and other could care less. The hardest part of the job was trying to take over for a manager that left and having the pressure put on me by other management while being paid the same as everyone else. In any position if you work hard you will find yourself working harder then others around you and next to never getting in trouble for it even it its brought up. They do work great with any schedule/hours you need.
good,It is a good place to work but long hours. The coworkers are great and the managers are willing to listen to you. Working as a cashier is one of the best jobs I have had and I am happy to be working here.
good,"i would change oil, tires, balance tires, rotate and work with customers and any needs they may have. i enjoyed getting my hands dirty. i would restock all the shelves."
good,"If you want to work in retail and make some decent money Walmart is one of the better options. Work environment is a joke, but the higher average pay makes it tolerable."
good,Adorei trabalhar la aprendi muitas coisas trabalhando na rede walmart.
good,"good benefits but even tho they pretend to the outside that they care about their employees, they really don't  and will fire someone in a heartbeat, especially older employees with higher pay"
good,On the real estate team you will be challenged to strive for excellence and innovate ways to save money to live better. Networking is a very important part of Walmart and it is paramount to continuously grow your internal and external network. As the biggest company in the world you can have lots of opportunities at your finger tips but may have a hard time reaching them if you are not the perfect candidate .
good,as i would come into work i would immediately clock in meet wit with supervisior then report to my work station zoning and pushng carts throwbacks customer service
good,Each day can be an interesting day.  Good or bad.  Some customers can be a hoot.  And some can be a joy.  But overall it can be a fun fulfilling day.  You take each day and as it comes.
good,"Working for Wal-Mart was a blast at times but if management is corrupted and only care about themselves , your experience will be terrible. Pay is good though."
good,"The entire time i was an hourly employee, i very much enjoyed workign for this company. The support and opportunites were endless. Once I became Salaried, it became a bad work experience."
good,"Management is very rude at times, especially the store manager. Front end management is unfair and treats some employees better than others. Other than that, it's an ok place to work."
good,I would recommend this company for people to work but sometimes the management goes to there head and they think they can do anything they want. If you like being bossed around and can take this job is for.
good,It was sometimes difficult to complete calls due to lack of cooperation from store management.  Very fast paced with frequent schedule changes that were hard to accommodate.
good,"I made alot of good friends at Walmart, bit the expectations of the upper management was sometimes unreasonable, sometimes they were. I would however recommend working at Walmart, because it gives a good amount of experience."
good,Good place to start your career in retail operations. Plenty of opportunities to grow and succeed. Hard work and customer oriented approach is always appreciated by the managers.
good,I really enjoyed working at Wal-mart mainly so that I could help People get what the needed and helping them where I could. I learned a lot mainly good customer service. I would go back if I could.
good,My job consists of  lifting produce boxes and putting the food on the shelves.  I also am responsible for cleaning the shelves and the area around where the food is on the floor and also the back room where the produce is stored.  Management changes constantly at this job and each manager is different.  The hardest part of my job is the lifting of heavy produce boxes.  The most enjoyable part of my job is all the people you meet that come into the store each night I work.
good,Ok to work there but was supposed to be temporary. Many people lazy.  I work hard but many just do the minimum to keep their job which results in the other employees to work harder.
good,"This job was good in the beginning but quickly became a dog eat dog world. The people who were nice were far and in between, one manager there was nice though, he cared."
good,"Employees are good to get along with, free parking, there is bonuses.  Threy have thanksgiving dinner for employees,  and a Christmas party. They have appreciation dinners quarterly. They will work work your schedule.  And they incourage continued education."
good,This is an employer that isn't for the longterm career unless you already have management experience or are hired for management.The only other way I would recommend them is if you have no experience and need work experience.
good,"Esta empresa es buena para el conocimiento de varias habilidades, pero el trato hacia el personal no es tan bueno."
good,"The work is the definition of monotonous, the management is hit or miss depending on department, the atmosphere is welcoming and the flexibility is good."
good,"Overall, it was a great experience to work at Walmart. I learned a lot and gained great customer service experience. My managers, were very nice and scheduled me when I was available."
good,"Always short staffed, quota production was in demand at all levels, double duty for one pay, not enough pay for the knowledge of doing the task. Never replacement of employee calling in or being fired."
good,"Walmart's a good place to work, but off late there have been too many lay-offs and that throws off people's confidence in the company."
good,Thier rules of security are a joke and management needs retraining . the place needs a deep cleaning and more team work . the management should be willing to answer questions
good,"only why to get a head is brown nose Very ten years on job and I never got a head on job ,stayed at same passion , managmeat play faveirts to much  to much stress"
good,"I love working for Walmart, great company to work for but lots of hours involved when in a management position. The company sometimes overwork their managers due to the fact that there is no overtime as we are on a salary cap. Long hours and long work weeks and months"
good,Management was difficult because of miscommunications in the work environment when it came to scheduling which caused conflict. I was able to train new workers and gained valuable skills in regards to working with people from all walks of life.
good,management in     abbeville sucks. i worked overnight. I got terminated bc my house was broke into and that resulted in me over exceeding my absences.
good,"Ok place to work, some managers made it not the most happy enviroment but the work is east and the pay is alright. would be bettter if they had better managment"
good,"this job is vary fast pace load ,unload .alot of lifting  always going to different spots in the store stocking shelfs orgoanizing and keeping up with what new"
good,there are too many members of management all trying to enforce orders that don't line up.  that being said the work load is stressful cause of the expectations
good,My job at Walmart is multifaceted.  With each customer it's something different.  Most of the customers are very enjoyable to deal with. A very small percentage are challenging.
good,For some people  the job is OK the hours allow you to go to school  and  still be employed that's good  for a senior citizen the chance to be active is great and you still have the ability to make a difference in people's lives and that goes both ways  so Walmart is OK
good,I really like working at Walmart the only problems I truly had was how the manager treated the employees I'm likely to choose a job that have a team willing to work together
good,Was a good company to work for. At one time they cared about their management staff. Now it is more about the financials and less about the team. Work life balance is not as important as it once was.
good,This position is rewarding to help patients with many chronic illnesses and they are so happy to be picking up their medication and constantly thank you for helping them!
good,Contratar a más personas ya que tienen a poco personal
good,Treat their employees more fair raise pay especially on the front end I feel that the cashiers need to be paid extremely more I feel that there should be a little bit more Security in Walmart stores I feel that management should be more Hands-On with their Associates
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you are looking for a lot of hours. It is very variable  and they do not normally give time off when requested. I made pretty good money.
good,"Following rules and directions was paramount there. I was an assistant salaried manager and spent most of my time managing staff, scheduling staff, ordering inventory, hiring new employees, doing employee reviews, employee discipline as needed. "
good,No hours to give associates but hire more people. Makes no sense. They dont care for their employees. If you need a specific shifts you wont get it if you dont have open availability.
good,"So over all  I guess the day by day work is not so bad. some days you could go in and its extremely slow and not a lot to do. or not a lot of costumers that day. and other days, it could be insanely busy and your always on your toes. your up and down helping all departments and costumers. I learned lots while I was there. I was one of the few people to be crossed trained in the company. which for me was very exciting. I lived being sable to learn new things daily and being able to help fellow associates or customers. also felt nice to be appreciated from every angle.  its always lively with the people who are there no matter if they work there or not. I would say the most difficult times were needed to call out unexpectedly and not always having management understand. also not always the friendliest place to work in all the time."
good,"I loved working at Walmart for the customers, the fast paced atmosphere, and the hours in the beginning. I am sure that this rating does not affect all Walmart stores, just the one in Woodbridge, VA."
good,It's a great fast-paced place to work. Management is very flexible with you as long as you have someone to cover your shift. The culture of this job is great if you like working with drama. The hardest part of the job is working with other women and the drama and gossip that goes around. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to customers and getting to know the regular costumers.
good,"Keeping store clean"
good,"This job was actually more my speed, out of food service,  in retail but not. The main role of the stock man was to push carts. This kept me active to where it was less mentally draining, and more physically draining. There were a couple greeters and most of the management that would cause a stir in the parking lot, but for the most part we were left alone as long as the job was being done and in a timely fashion"
good,The store is very busy most days. In the fitting room the phone rings about 30 times or more a day. The hardest part of the day is at night having to fold 1000 plus shirts.
good,"I have seen some people get promoted that didn't deserve it and I have seen associates with over 20 years experience be ""walked"" out the door.  If you can't handle constant change don't work at Walmart."
good,"Working overnight remodel was fun, moving large loads, restocking shelves, trying not to beak anything... Overall, it was a good experience, learning a lot and having opportunities to excel."
good,Walmart is a big corporation that hires many people from a variety of different backgrounds. The job is not hard to do but the management lack structure.
good,"Grat place to learn from the biggest retailer. There is a lot of learn for your self on the individual tools but everyone is willing to teach. "
good,"Is quick paced most of the time, you will get done quick if the person your working with is willing to work if not you have to pick up the slack, this is based on night shift"
good,"Overall, it was okay. It had it’s ups and downs. Management gave me a few problem every now and then. But it overall it was a nice experience for me ."
good,"I always loved  working at Walmart. The pay has not been great for the many years of experience that I have in my position but it was steady and secure as long as you performed your job well."
good,I loved my job at Walmart until I seen the deli manager  changing dates on meats and never paying attention to what needs to be ordered....we are always running out of product....she never pays attention to directing the others to clean things that are in bad need of it...she has her picks on shifts which are her buddies...causing a certain few of us to have to close most of the time...I feel she shouldn’t be making schedules....that should be left up to the manager of our area....she has physical issues which cause us all to work her freight
good,I love shopping at Walmart it has everything you need no matter the situation. Stepping in Walmart is what makes me love to shop because it's a one stop shop. You can not beat that it's amazing ... So who wouldn't want to one stop shop in all major city yes yes yes Walmart... Go visit thank you for your service and employment
good,My job was responsible for pushing carts in to the corral throughout the day. Carrying a walkie talkie going inside to do any carry outs and maintaining a neat looking parking lot.
good,"Constant moving of product to sales floor-Most days you will feel like a donkey dragging product to sales floor day in and day out! Schedules are never the same way twice, no matter if you are full time or part time. You may close one night, only to come in first thing in the morning, you will not be able to work another job, even if part time. Pay is better than fast foods, and gets better the longer you work there! Eventually, leaving can be hard, as other retail will have hard time matching, but will take years to get there! You get benefits even at part time, some paid holidays, some paid time off, and some benefits, not a lot, but better than TARGET for sure! Customers are on lower end of wage scales, education and hygiene. Stealing seems to be a full time job for most and frustrating for store employees to witness hourly! Can be fun, make lots of new friends and ever changing lines coming and going. Mods change daily, as well as pogs and products! Be prepared to work, pull freight all day to sales floor!"
good,"waiting on customers daily . The least i hated about this job was that u go on break and u gotta come back to a new register. The most i like was, u meet different people."
good,Wal Mart is a good place to work. I learned to that hard work really does pay off. Management was great they did their job keeping employees customers and place satisfied. The place of work had many people of different race.
good,it wasn't a extremely hard job it was so long ago the the Walmart I Worked at was in Vegas and they and a pool table in the break room and gave us hour breaks but like I said that was like 6 years ago
good,"At the start of your shift you are assigned an area/s to stock for the night. Most of the time you alone or with one other person. They do not provide enough equipment for each worker so there is always a scramble at the start of the shift to get something to help with your work. The other workers do not like sharing so it makes it difficult to get your job done in a timely manner, then you get in trouble with management for not finishing. I did enjoy the hours and learned a few things: how to properly stock, bring overstock to the backroom and put it away. I however did not like the lack of training by the managers. They relied on other workers to train you and usually the workers aren't team players so they aren't helpful."
good,"There's a good chance to progress in the company if you are accepted in new roles. However,  managment shows a distinct lack of care for the employees and it trickles down to the point that even if you love your job and have a phenomenal work ethic starting, in no time you really could care less. The environment is very face paced but beyond that the work is quite easy as long as you do not care about your feet too much."
good,"Nice working environment for the most part."
good,No training what so ever. Expect employee to know everything about the business and condemn you for not knowing and provide little to no training to be able to excel. My supervisor was brash and had a terrible attitude.
good,"wasn't Very Calm had to take time off for different things never had time or money for friends and Family, didn't get time off for holidays, or vacation."
good,"A typical day at work involves engaging with the customers, cooking the hot case foods and constant cleaning up. Working in the deli and fresh food areas require a food handlers card and knowledge of basic, non-negotiable food safety procedures. Management can be very poorly constructed at times and it can be a hassle for them to find hours that work around your schedule both academically and personally. The most difficult part of the job would be when we're short handed on staff and trying to tend customers on both the deli and hot food case section."
good,It was pretty okay but for some of the things we had to do that was not our job wasn't worth it. A lot of the associates were kind of slacking a lot compared to some of us new employees. Things would have been way better if everyone did their job and did it right.
good,Steady work and for the most part you will always have a job. horribly low hours and low pay unfortunately. Other than that pretty good place to work.
good,"Hard to achieve full time status. managers can be over stressed and throw their workload on other, they will work with school schedules and military schedule."
good,They paid me good and the ours were fine but my pregnancy gave me blood pressure problems and they expected me to be fine. My department manager in the garden center was very rude and talked about her employees.
good,You learn as you go. The manager treat you like you in middle school with no respect. Only enjoyable part of the place just getting paid and overall provide best customer service you can do.
good,"I enjoyed the experience walmart has given me, I have had a chance to move positions and advance. However some management needs improvement, that's my biggest complaint, and the lack of the company to address manager issues."
good,"The pay rate was not good it couldn't pay rent barely utilities you would need two more jobs and Wal-Mart will take up most of your hours during the work shift they allow a computer to choose random hours that is not put in correctly or according to what You requested on Your application You never have the same hours so You wouldn't be able to have a second or a third job ... most of the benefits is good, I bought stock from there and they lost it, didn't care to replace or repay me for it... fun place to work for very helpful with school and advice giving if stressed out they provide a hotline for this"
good,"uma empresa prazerosa de se trabalhar, harmonioza e alegre."
good,"it was hard labor with little recognition for good workers"
good,"You work a regular 8 hour work week.  They sometimes ask for volunteer overnights for special projects.  The management is mostly young and inexperienced in management.  Very experienced in Walmart procedures though.  Advancements are given mostly on ""who you know."""
good,"Probably the worst company I worked for in all of my careers.  Hours are crazy (but that is retail these days).  No real on hands training, and most training modules out of date.  Management team are inexperienced and most sit on their high horse.  Lack of respect and trust.  Disorganized company.  No real future and no real advancement opportunities for most.  It was just a part time fill for me, as I am retired.  Would probably never go back and would not recommend anyone for employment with this company."
good,"Although it can be stressful, the pay is good and so is the job. The tasks aren’t that difficult to do and the customers keep the job fun. Managment can be unreliable sometimes."
good,when you first start working there they have you watch a few videos and then they just throw you into work and exspect you to know everything about what you are supposed to do they have some of the worlds worst hba managers in  walmart that i have ever seen for the to stand back and tell the sales associates to do there jobs for them and then stand there and grumble about it being done wrong then not even trying to teach or tell/show them how to do it but overall the most enjoyable part of the job was stocking shelves greeting the customers to help them find something and lunch time when i could set and relax without anybody grouching at me for getting something wrong
good,"Loading and unloading of merchandise, organizing the backroom and constructing displays.  Knowledge of heavy machinery was very useful.  Worked night shifts primary"
good,I like being a cashier but sometimes its very slow and sometimes its very busy. walmart pays minimal but pays better now. their beenfits were decent at best while the CEO is driving around in a diamond car probably.
good,"If I was asked to work for Walmart again I probably would. There was always something to do and you hardly ever had to stand around bored. You are able to learn whatever department you want as long as you talk to a supervisor about it. Which has to be the best part, they will teach you anything and help you advance. But they do not pay very well."
good,When the new general manager came in. We already what is goal was. To get rid of all the supervisors. Either transfer to another DC. Or you will be termed somehow. He termed all 18 supervisor with in two years. You never new if you had a job the next day.
good,The work is fast paced. I loved it because the hours fly by. The customers were friendly. Some managers were rude but other that it was an enjoyable worplace.
good,"i enjoyed working at walmart and being able to decorate cakes for children's parties, I learned a lot from stocking shelfs to learning to decorate cakes"
good,"Like any retail job, it pays well enough and is pretty consistent. The only reason I left was because I had to reattend school and the monotonous days were making me question my sanity. It's a very straight-forward job which is great that also means you are literally doing the same exact thing every single day of the week. I could only take it for so long. They pay bi-weekly and i was clearing 650-700 bi-weekly which was lovely at the time. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with management who thinks they're some sort of Gods. The job is so simple but the managers of course have to make it 10x harder than it should."
good,"a parte mais agradável era os colegas , nos tínhamos uma relação bem confortável !!"
good,"Management would promise promotions, then the company would re arrange managers and there were no follow through to what wa promised to employee by previous manager, so employees are always thrown under the bu and hours are constantly cut, not allowing any regular pay, If employee wants hours, they need to be availbale 24/7 to make a living, and work rediculous split shifts"
good,"Its a nice starter job for teens, you'll get a lot of experience in different departments as long as you keep busy which isn't hard to do the day fly's by. 1hour lunch breaks which is always a plus"
good,"Walmart is s good company to work for however hard work and loyalty seniority "
good,"Working for Walmart overall was good."
good,I was temporary seasonal worker.I worked graveyard as a cashier. Many strange things would happen at that hour it was interesting. I liked retail then elk grove was'nt bad.
good,"Open at 7am until 7pm none stop managing and productivity. Learned how to deal with high volume merchandise and staffing. Work place Culture save money live better (taking care of Customers). Hardest part of the job, Keeping all the shelves filled in a 220,000 sq foot Store. Working with Associates who are very hard working."
good,"Great customer service, very fast paced, family oriented, awesome savings. Very beneficial, flexibility, great promotional career.  Wal mart is a great career to have if you are in customer service."
good,i liked working at wal mart but there was too much favortism and the managers and supervisors there did nothing but sit around all day and i cant respect that
good,Working for Walmart is a great job to start off or if you are looking to become a manager. they are a fast paced working company. the pay ain't that great.
good,I would not work here if you didn't need to. The atmosphere and lack of character are prevalent. I was not respected or considered. I was constantly thrown around the store to different departments and was left to fend for myself after 1 day of training.
good,Management needs to work on having respect for others regardless of their status or level they are. There is also a lack of communication between management and associates.
good,"I had to take care of family matters. I liked the work, but I feel that with over 10 years of retail service, i should have been making more than min wage, and have been getting better hours."
good,overall ok........associates helpful andfrindly.managers  were ok sometimes.lots of improvement should be made to mantain standards. working areasto be improved .
good,Walmart job is you walking into work and doing what you need to do and leaving. I learned how to work as a cashier also work the costumer service desk.
good,"Everything your household needs under one roof cashier, giving breaks, monitor and keep front end cleaned prices are competitve"
good,"I really feel like Walmart is great company to work for but the people they hired to run the store aren't so great. The manager doesn't show any appreciation to employees what so ever . They can care less about the way they approach you and the way they go about things. When it comes to training associates there isn't proper training, But don't get me wrong overall I loved my job, great opportunies the associates I worked around in the Electronics department were great workers."
good,Es una buena empresa con un ambiente laboral bueno y divertido
good,I loved working for Walmart . It gives you the opportunity to lend that helping hand .. unfortunately I lost my job to new management abusing there power .. that experience made me not working for people . You do so much for them and the company and the couldn't care less .. Walmart employees are very disposable if you ask me ..
good,"Enjoyable meeting people, but were monitored by a TV camera every minute of the day,"
good,Everyone gets along. They are nice. A typical day is a night shift for me. I usually work a 4pm-10pm. So I come in and check my TMAC( which is a paper with all the people schedule on the left side and on the top going horizontal is the different apparal deparments) So I check the TMAC before I go and zone and put up returns for the area I am in.
good,"Good employees are disregarded for dumb people who do not do their jobs. The people who don't work are rewarded while the ones doing their own job plus the other lazy people's jobs get treated bad and threatened for not ""making times"" when they are."
good,This job is not for every one be prepared to work for every cent you earn the company it self believes in numbers first some days can be good and some days can be bad days.
good,"Wal-Mart was a place where i was able to balance school and work. It was an easy going experience, making sure I was providing quality customer service."
good,"I Learned A lot about how company's work.I learned a lot about customer service and team work.Some of the managers where a bit too much,but the jobs where fine."
good,the csms are very helpfull when having questions that need answered. The workers were very nice too. very faced paced. your work day seemed to fly by.
good,"No work life balance, A ton of pressure. Poor communication, Moral goes up and down. Expectations are always changing. No family time at all. Lots of yelling."
good,"long work shift, good pay. hard on the back sometimes. very cold in the winter and very hot in the summer. be sure to meet quotas for loading or order picking."
good,"A typical day for me would consist of:  operating the cash register, merchandising, restocking shelfs and floating to service desk when needed everyday was BUSY"
good,"My walmart was the tourist destination, constantly busy with long lines and loud noises and people complainaing, the old people were terribly slow and training new people was so hard to do in this setting. THe CSM's take a long time to reply to you so often you are waiting with an angry customer at your register with no way to move the line forward until one comes over. You do get a lot of trianing however"
good,"Company as a rigid Attendance policy that does not allow as excused absences such as Dr. Statements, traffic snarls, ER visits, etc... Otherwise it is a good place to work for the most part."
good,The did not afford me upward mobility. They did not show appreciation for hard worker. The environment was negative. There is favoritism shown by mangers.
good,"Es muy buena empresa, pero hay muchas cosas que deberian mejor. Una de ellas serian el trato de los superiores con los empleados."
good,It was a nice place to work and i received a decent amount of pay. The only thing i did not like were the managers i had because they were very unreasonable and not flexible with my scheduling
good,Brags you can have a career with them but offers mostly part-time jobs.  Lots of stress for even low level jobs. Just go to work push trough the day and decide if you want to try for management.I can get better and you can transfer anywhere there is a Wal-mart.
good,"You do a lot, for what small amount of money you get paid"
good,"I loved my job there it was great I loved my costumers! I had a problem with the favoritisum going on the fact your not allowed to get the same respect as others,when they say something they have a hard time keeping their word on it. they basically want all your time & to be available to them at all times"
good,Se trabaja muy agusto no hay ningún tipo de presión
good,"hard to talk to managers in effective manner of having your point of view heard and understood"
good,Enough work to go around to keep people busy. Learned different facets of the job. Management is fair and consistent. The workplace culture is open and fair. The long lunch. Being appreciated for a job well done.
good,"Just ready for a different work environment. things could be about better working here.  the work is a lot and we are really under staffed.  for the amount of work we do, we should be paid a lot more."
good,"Worked 4 years at walmart and overall it was a decent experience, learned alot, saw alot and made some change. I'd do it again but hopefully I'm on to bigger and better things. Jobs like this are only meant to help you float, nothing more."
good,The employee lounge is very nice. You get one hour lunches on most long days so you can sit in the lounge and watch the tv or nap in the comfortable chairs they have in there.
good,Loved this job but the pay was real bad .I enjoyed working with the costmers and doing the cakes bit the pay at the time was not enough for the hours I was working
good,The biggest thing this company has are its employees. I did enjoy the job I did but moving up was not for me. Required many hours that I could use else where.
good,I loved working for Wal-mart.  It was a friendly high volume  of customers.  I like to be real busy.  Management often pulled me for extra projects because I'm very fast at what I'm doing.
good,Very busy job. Always something to be done and then next thing you know your shift suppose to be over already and there still things to be done if day was really busy and almost constantly slammed with a lot of customers
good,the company give you Opportunity to have impact on communities.Submission is online and is very simple. Have CV ready. i would work for wal-mart again
good,"The work environment here is rather depressing, with very few good attitudes.  maintaining my positive attitude is a daily chore.  although there are a lot of over qualified employees, which is also rather depressing, I find that the real negative is that every single person there hates their job.  it is a common mindset, and it does not lend to a good work environment."
good,"The last store manager didn't have any people skills....didn't care about manager or associates. But benefits and pay are good, especially for managers."
good,Enjoyed coworkers kind of like an extended family. Very busy general manager was really a pompous jerk. (He got fired) big sigh for all!! Overall a good place to work.
good,"The company is great to work, if you are at the right store. Lexington Walmart is a great store to work but management could be a lot better. They do help their employees if they need it"
good,"Mixed schedule, only part time not much room for getting a second job. No benefits. Rules only apply to some and not others. Lots of lazy people who just do not care. They are only there for the check not the quality of work preformed or customer service."
good,As a cashier I was effective at finalizing transactions for customers calmly at a fast pace and still provide them with a happy shopping experience. As a member of the modular team I was responsible of breaking down shelves and reorganizing them at a timely manner. I was also an apparel associate and a people greeter.
good,"It really depends on the Walmart you work for. The first one I worked for was willing to work with me and my schedule. the store was well managed, and it was one of the best jobs I have had. However, the second one has not treated me well, is poorly managed and is unwilling to work with my schedule. Also the use the term part time loosely. sometimes i feel like I live there."
good,"Walmart is very big on keeping the customer happy, and being seen as a happy easygoing organization. They are also very strict when it comes to their attendance policy."
good,"typical job, was a cashier sometimes floated around to other departments, overtime was offered. typically had a 30 hour work week. management constantly rotated so sometimes it became an issue."
good,"Work enviroment was exceptional, hours were fair, but elevating in the company wasn't very productive, even though I fulfilled every requirement to move up in the company I was still in the same position with no future in elevating."
good,Me dieron de baja sin sentido sin darme la oportunidad de seguir adelante. Cambios de horario porque​ si. Yo quería seguir trabajando y aprendiendo. Quiero trabajar estar cómoda y sentirme bien en mi lugar de trabajo. Buscar un acuerdo con los horarios y  el espacio de trabajo.
good,Its a decent enough job to have while you look for other jobs. Lots of opportunities for skill building. Would not recommend to someone if they were not self-driven or lacked a good work ethic. Management is usually willing to work with you if you have issues. Its really not a bad first job to have. Just wouldn't recommend it as a career.
good,"Worked in jewelry a short time,ran register pretty fast paced customers were pretty friendly,management was ok hours were all over the place but that's typical with any job"
good,"Respect of associates"
good,Didnt reallynlike the job they wasnt a team player company need more company players on there team mangers played the favorite card all the time dont work here ever
good,It was a great experience where I was trained and positioned to lead teams to deliver quality software. It is a very competitive environment and be ready to move at a fast pace.
good,It was hard transitioning from solider to civilian. I enjoyed the time while i was there. Met a lot of good people and they were very respectful. Liked my night shift manager's
good,"My store really needs more communication because as soon as you walk in or clock in your automatically being told what to do by three people. I love the people there they are so nice, but i do believe that there could be more done."
good,"Calm"
good,"For those of you that have worked there, its Walmart.  For those of you who have not, be prepared to work far beyond your rate of pay and be underminded and overworked."
good,I left my life working at a store that didn't appreciate my work and effort. But at the same time I loved what I was doing and the customers I work for.
good,Its okay! i wouldnt try to make a career out of it. Overall my 2 years of being there it was so/so! like i feel like i could have been somewhere else.
good,Very productive environment and fast paced with people of all cultures and background. After working as a cashier many regular customers greet me by name and stop by to chat that which always made it a nicer day.
good,"They always kept you busy, they teach you how to do everything, but the managers really didn't know how to talk to their workers. They employers was very nice and helpful"
good,I work from 11pm-7am Monday thru Friday doing maintenance at Walmart we have different objective and things that we had to do every night inside and outside of the building
good,If you truly love being around people and pleasing people no matter what then Walmart is the place to go. The company isn't bad but dealing with Walmart customers you need a special set of skills
good,A typical work day was boring and not so fun. Had a lot of busy times and most often it was when we had a weekend party people who go and buy their camping stuff.
good,"Coming into walmart is fun having a super tiny vest that did not fit and shoving your hand inside a sticky soda machine to try to shake it a bit, that is how you make it work."
good,"When I was younger I remember Walmart being a place that a lot of people enjoyed working at. I decided to try it out for myself when I came of age and immediately regretted it. The management can't work together and instead of being consistent they only really care about everything when a ""big wig"" comes in. I loved my department  and was proud of my work. If the managers cared more about what their employees were doing right instead of berating them every time they slipped up a little maybe they wouldn't lose so many of their good employees."
good,Great experience ... But they Took me through a lot after i took a Leave of Absence . The work environment was ok could have been a better but caint complain
good,A typical day a Walmart is an up paste type of day. always friendly faces. The hardest part of the job is not being able to take a break when really needed if its a busy day.
good,"For income,  this pays well above minimum wage.  However it has it's ups and Downs but it just matters in what store you're located each plays it's own ways.  Its a great experience to meet new people though."
good,Retail is not a very high paying job - we know that if you been in it for a bit like me. But Walmart did pay me a decent pay and I got decent hours ... producing a nice check on payday - - compared to some of the other retail jobs I held since leaving Walmart. I liked the people I worked with inspite of management always pushing for more. I would go back to Walmart - if I didn't leave on bad terms.
good,It was a great first job experience. The way they treat employees is not the best but I cannot complain. The job was sometimes tedious but it did say so in the description.
good,Get in and get out on the floor with electronics or get in and go straight to the back and unload truck .. Management was somewhat cool and wasn't really no hard part and I enjoyed being around the co workers ..
good,The current store that I work in has very poor management skills over all from the top down nothing is done on time so when it comes time to do tasks everything is rushed and people get hurt and things get destroyed. There is no real training for anything people are just put some where and told to figure it out i would not recommend working for this store
good,it a great job for those that want to start with their lives. there is always a place for u to go as there is positions that are always opening up. Plus u have two other store that u can work at too.
good,"I love the work I do. But I am making the say money I was making in the 90s. It seems that upper management does not understand what is going on ""real life""."
good,Walmart is a great enviornment where customers come to shop and recieve excellent customer service to be welcomed and greeted by Walmart employees. I gained even more skills and and experience when working at walmart as a employee and a team player. It has prepared me and also given me such determination and dedication to bring promotional growth and great ideas and support by representing and presenting the company and organization to other markets and businesses.
good,"Management is good, the store is under remodel so it's a bit crazy. Other than that, it's a fun environment to work at and they're are fun people there to work with."
good,"I loved working at walmart i really enjoyed all my co-workers, sometimes the customers where not always the nicest people, but you learn to let a lot of things go that happen at the work place and you learn you cant take anything home with you or let it ruin your day, the managers are always nice to talk to and the CSM are the best! the hardest part of the job was being on my feet all day."
good,"Pushed carts in snow, rain, cold, hot days. Salted sidewalks. Did carry outs for customers. The job itself was not bad. Management was pretty good. All in all  not bad"
good,Employees are nice. Made a lot of friends and for that reason I liked to go to work. Management was not good. Always had a problem with the schedule and customers were rude.
good,"I love the company and i loved my customers . i disliked how the store management handled situations , the lay overs , and the gossipping by employees and management.  Overall i loved it but the management team insife the stores need to be more professional."
good,"Working in the pharmacy, you get to know regular patients, prescribers, and co-workers well. Being in such a specialized, small department within the store allows for a small company feel rather than a large corporation, but with large corporation benefits. Great 401K. Connexus system is very user friendly; wish you had internet access though to help resolve insurance issues and help with patient care/therapy. While most pharmacists are great to work with and allow you autonomy to efficiently do your part in helping patients, a few treat you like you're too unintelligent to even have a conversation with them about the weather and expect you to do everything for them like a servant rather than work as a team. If you work with a great pharmacy team, then you'll have a wonderful experience helping others."
good,I Spent 5 Years at Walmart and they let me go for a minor infraction. I was an assistant manager and I put everything into the company. I felt used and abused then thrown to the curb.
good,I worked beyond what was my job title and customers didn't have any complaints about me. Also I would help coworkers after I was done with my section. I was starting to leave how to set up logging in overstock
good,I enjoyed my job most days. But for the most part I HATED my job. No matter what I did it was never good enough for the managers that were there. I was doing my job as I was taught to do it and was forced to step down because all of a sudden I didn't know what I was doing any more. I was fired from my job for something that I had no control over... The most enjoyable part of my job though was working with the customers that came in and made the day so much better!
good,Doing customer service and taking care of your daily routines. Making sure products are on the shelf and seeing over other hourly employees.  Keeping the store clean .
good,"Typical day at work , stock shelves, help cashier if needed. back in my time walmart did not have the update technology. Unloaded a truck and pull merchandises to the main floor to stock shelves"
good,Work hard you see results growth within the corporation! I moved up three times in 6 years with the company management and security at multiple locations!
good,"Duties would include "
good,"Todo trabalho é bom, dinamicas de grupos bem elaboradas,atendimento agradavel, gerente lider que ensina com excelentes metodos, porém tinha seus prós, como alguns colaboradores desrespeitosos, etc."
good,"good stable company. good pay, good chance for advancement in the copany. one of its cons is that the schedules are computer generated. one gets good discounts."
good,"my review for Walmart would that the store it self is a good place to work and shop. "
good,"Overall great workplace,  but they don't allow for family life or church life...I need my nights & weekends off to give me time to spend with my immediate family and church."
good,no me parecio un buen lugar de trabajo ya que los jefes hacian maltrato contra varios empleados y tenia preferencias con otros
good,Good place to work at plus get new opportunities work around a differant environment and I like learning new things at my jobs I like to educate myself and move up in this work place and better myself
good,Lots of room for improvement. Salaries get better. The long hours are personally not for me but the company is dedicated to making the customers happy.
good,Ok place to work  not very good at letting you balance work with family time. Management  does not communicate well each other. Management is not good at following up with you when you have questions.
good,"Busy Enviroment"
good,"It was a fun place to work while I was there."
good,I worked in overnight produce but also know how to cashier and worked in the deli. When the produce take got there had to pull it back to the produce area. Also had to pull out all the bad produce and really stock it.
good,"A typical day at the Vision Center is printing off reports, calling patients to confirm appointments, making expired RX courtesy calls, verifying insurance, fixing and adjusting glasses, taking care of patients and costumers coming in with outside prescriptions, pretesting patients for the doctor, pulling and putting back files alphabetically, light cleaning, and zoning frame board. The hardest part of my job is when I can't fully help a patient or customer when the situation is out of my hands. The management is unreliable, and not being trained as well as I feel we should be. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I successfully help a patient, and the bond my patients and I make."
good,The managers talk about the cashiers right in front of customers. They are rude and don't like to do their job. Especially if the have to give a cashier change some managers or shall I say csm get mad about that.
good,"il faut être très productif , les salaires sont min."
good,"On an average Day: You come in and clock in and report to your station. Open the register and greet your fellow associates, You greet the customers and get their Info, meds, check the order is correct, collect payment and close the order. Sometimes the customer has to speak with the Pharmacist and you tell the customer as to where to go to do so. You will also do some stock work, see to it that items on the shelves are in order and straight. Along the day you work with Management and the other associates to make sure everything is going smooth. The most enjoyable part of the job is greeting and meeting so many different folks, learning about all the different drugs and their uses. The hardest part is making sure each customer is getting their correct meds."
good,"I've been at the job for 2 years, it's just convenient but the hours ruins your day. The employees walk around intoxicated, or high on drugs. They need drug test or random. I like some of the coworkers but some are disrespectful and rude."
good,This paticular Wal-Mart had just been built so when I started working here we actually had to set the whole store up which wasnt so bad. Schedule wise the hours was lways crazy and once the store opened I didnt get as many hours as I'd like. Management was new and seemed confused. They couldnt get it together so there was alot of confusion.
good,"My store in Suisun was alright. The Store manager was great, but the CSMs were not so great. For example, multiple cashiers would be requesting back up or some sort of help, and instead of acknowledging them, they would ignore them. Imagine having a line of at least 5 people and your supervisor ignores you. How well does that look to the guest at your register? Better training for all Wal-Mart associates."
good,"I made a request for a couple of other jobs off of the front registers and was told just cashiering positions were open, even though when I would walk past the the personnel door there were job postings up. I put in for Customer Service Manager because I had a good 3 years of experience, they past me up and gave the positions to people who didn't have any experience in the field. So I guess they don't go by how many years of experience in the field and the knowledge that you know, they go by how long you've been working at that particular store."
good,Well you have to know many people to get promoted  take on a lot of other job duties but able to stand constructive  criticism  it can be a great starting point for teens
good,I enjoyed working here I was promoted within 3 weeks after I was hired on. Every store is different but this one specifically I enjoyed my job. Great team work.
good,"Filed all prescriptions alphabetically. "
good,The work as a night associate is mostly easy...once you catch your pace. I haven't any complaints except within the co-workers in which I had to accompany on the floor and the pay wasn't near enough for the travel to and from the job....I worked to drive to and from...no extra income.
good,"I met alot of good hearted hard workers, but the managment was very disorganized when it came to anythhing involved with the front end of the store easpecially customer service where associates are usaully left to there own devices when it comes to solving problems with customers and the machines."
good,"Great except for the co-workers and the amount of time you're their with the schedule, 9 hour days. The job does pay well and they just raised the wages."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart, helping customers and meeting new people everyday.  Learning about the prospect of the retail business and looking to move up in the company as a supervisor."
good,"Dealing with a lot of people on a daily basis. I have now seen what other associates have to put up with from customers, you have to bite your tongue because people can be rude and mean. big turn over in co-workers. to me management not what it should be. The hardest part of the job is standing on concrete floors all day. The enjoyable part of the job is the nice regular customers that come in and come to where I am working to check out."
good,if they would pay more I probably would of stayed and the benefits if your not on your deathbed don't go to the doctor my deductible was 5000 dollars when I worked there
good,"Walmart is a very good company to work for, but their policy on attendance is bad and unfair to those who really gets sick and have health problems. This is what I got fired for, Taking my wife to the hospital because she was having pain in her stomach not to mention she is pregnant, I believe it was unfair and wrong."
good,The hours was great but managers wasn't all the way great . Great job experience though . Loved the hour lunches it gave plenty time to get your energy restored
good,Walmart has it's many ups and downs. Most days are hectic and a lot of people are only there because it pays well. You get pulled to do a lot of other things rather than your job. But my actual job I quite enjoy.
good,"I loved my job but the hours were horrible, pay was good, certain managers and Market managers can be very hard to work for."
good,"It was ok,. It gave me work experience and a way to support my family. I worked in matiance, learned more in fabric and crafts,  was learning paint. 99% of my coworkers were awesome."
good,It was a great place to work fun and I had I lot of co-workers that I loved like they were family and still do! Then I had a problem with another co-worker trying to start problems for me and when I took it to management they told me to just try and stay away from her which was a little silly because we worked in the same area I then asked if I could move to a different area and they said  all the other areas were full just to stay away from that in particular co-worker.
good,"Schedule is always different every week and management is hard to get ahold of when you need something urgent to move on with your next task. Not a fun job, but coworkers and some managers were polite and always willing to help."
good,"Counts sick and grief days against you, even if you call in. The people can be nice, but if a manager is having a bad day then you better toe the line, cause they'll come after you. The work itself can be fun once you get it down and, if you have OCD, you'll love it."
good,"Operate cash register "
good,"Interacted with people, first and last impression, used the 10 foot rule,helped customers with their purchase, restocked groceries, kept work area neat."
good,Como Jovem Aprendiz consegui passar por setores diferentes e consegui me destacar.
good,Learn how to work electronic pallet jacks and forklifts and develop good people skills management needs a little work on finding the right person to run the store
good,"what stories haven't we heard about Walmart. lt was good at first but then slowly started to see how the place was really operated. not any really help, favoritism and takes forever for advancement's plus benefits"
good,Walmart is not a bad place to work if you want to work. I have found that once you start working for Walmart it seems to consume your time. There is not much free time because you always seem to be working. The hours you work are long enough to take up your entire day. When starting out and Walmart and just being and associate they start you off in the middle of the morning and you work all day. There is no way to plan things before work or after work.
good,"This store was good because it was close to home. "
good,Instead of calling the employee into an office they would yell at them in front of customers which is disrespectful and not good business like conduct.
good,very busy store not well organized. management doesn't know if they are coming or going. very frustrating place too work. I work hard and enjoyed it....
good,"A typical day at work would be an overload of new freight that has not been worked by the previous shift, due to the store being under staffed. In my area i work all of the juice, water, and soda, three different rows. I have learned to manage my time wisely so that i can meet the deadlines giving in our nightly task. i have learn to listen and be attentive to details giving by the management. i befriend people easily so working well with new and old co-workers is not an issues. There is nothing hard about my job it keeps me busy throughout the night. Staying consistent working a box or two per minute is the key when stocking consumables. The most enjoyable part of my job is when the company cooks on specials holidays and randomly shows appreciation for our hard work."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be as soon as i clock in i'm up front helping with the cashiering and helping customer, usually I'm a casher but it depends on how slow or fast the day is. I learn something new everyday. My co-worker are very supportive throughout anything and they try to understand you on their best way as possible. the hardest day of the job would maybe being the only cashier with no help, and lastly the most enjoyable day would be finishing the day with the smile you started with."
good,"they just throw you out there"
good,"poor training, lack of guidelines, "
good,"I always enjoyed coming in to work, my coworkers was all up beat it was fun to learn different ways to do my job. I like to work with cars and anything to do with cars."
good,I think Walmart could have done more for me considering i have a disability.. i do like working alone and i get along with others very well.. i like to have fun and work at same time
good,"Good Place to work if you Have Management Supporting You"
good,Proceed to get on a register and check out guests through entire shift. Help guests find items. Hardest part of job was when needed help management was no where to be found. Best part was seeing a customer smile because you could help them.
good,Walmart is an organization that is all about the company. If there is a rule set it does not matter who died that rule is followed which can be good and bad. Upper management is very disrespectful to lower house and the organization believes lower house should deal with it and accept it.
good,I love Walmart but the management is not strict at all.  I wish they had more rules and the customer service is rude all the time.
good,Keeping My Department Standing Tall Making Sure I Have The Product So Customers Can Buy What They Want. Keeping My Prices On the Floor Right When They Are Changed And Keeping My Department Looking great
good,"Working with this company was a little difficult being the second job I had when I came to the US so alot of things needed to be learned. Some staffs and temps were nice, management always looking for boot lickers."
good,I started off as a cashier and worked my way to the automotive department as a technician in the shop. I learned how to change my own tires and how to fix flats and how to do an oil change. one of the things we didn't do was brakes and when I got reprimanded for letting a customer know where they could go to get their brakes done I decided it was time to find something new.
good,Working at Walmart was an experience like no other. The amount of expectations and work is what keeps me busy at all times. The group of coworkers I worked with is what kept my days fun and easy despite the amount of work.
good,It was not enjoyable having to work in the rain and heat all day while working alone for hours without stopping and help throughout.
good,"I first started working for Wal-Mart in July of 2011. At that time new hires still had ninety day evaluations.  At first it was a little hard to adjust to working at night. "
good,Typically a full work day I would consider it very productive and always busy. some days you may not get breaks when you are suppose to. While working for this company I have learned to have a lot of patience and that you can not always allow people to turn a good day sour.
good,Overall I came across some great people that I would love to work with again had some great sometimes time goes by fast just lack of communication
good,"I learned to work with the resources and time, provided by my employer, to the best of my ability to provide good customer service for all. I have learned to use an inventory system, as well as a touch screen cash register. I learned how to file merchandise properly and efficiently. I learned how to altar my communication style for each co-worker and customer to have an efficient and positive work environment."
good,Its a great place to work but lack managerial leadership. Some associates get little recognition for there hard work. Its a good opportunity to get know different people
good,a typical day at work is customers purchasing slowly in the morning and fast during the evenings. Co-workers are friendly. Safe environment.
good,the company is grate i enjoy going to work each day i'm just needing to grow as an employee. the hardest part about this job is the growth opportunities not being available.
good,"Dia completamente produtivo, afim de cumprir metas estabelecidas pela empresa. Ambiente de trabalho agradável. Líder imediato pronto para atuar quando necessário."
good,Walmart provides a new field of friendships with both associates and customers. Most of the co-workers are enjoyable to work with as in any job. same can be said for the management team.
good,Working for walmart was an experience. The company offered a great benefit package and I loved that but the management was not understanding at all. The management did not understand that the employees have families. All they care about was the production of the store which is understandable but need to care about the people of the store as well
good,Before the wage increase I wasn't earning much for hard work. Management was in desperate need of a fix for being incompetent. There is times you get d***head customers. I enjoyed what I did overall as the job goes. Employees were cool people(doesn't including management).
good,"This is a great job for somebody who's in school looking to make a bit of money.  I wouldn't stick with this job for more than two years, especially in the position I'm currently in."
good,I would help unload the truck with other employees. Then we would proceed to stock the shelves afterwards. I learned how to unload and stock shelves. Management wasn't too bad until a new manager came in. Co workers were friendly. Hardest part of the job was probably unloading the truck at a fast pace when there are different co workers to deal with. The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking the shelves.
good,"There was never a dull moment at this place, especially around Christmas. The hardest part of the Job was rude customers, this helped me build customer service skills."
good,A typical day at work consisted of getting to work and jumping right in andI enjoyed staying busy throughout the entire day.I learned prices of items I shop for often. Management was pretty dependable besides their scheduling. I had many friends for co-workers while working there. The hardest part of my job while working there was being scheduled to work at random times (ex. getting off work at midnight and then having to work again at six am.) I  enjoyed having a stable and consistent paycheck coming in.
good,Following directions Completing given tasks throughout the day. mixing paint duplicating car keys. good communication skills. The management was really far behind.
good,wal-mart was a good place to work got the hours i needed got messy but really learn proper ways to clean and putting bikes and grills was a line i liked working with my hands and tools
good,"Not many know what they were doing, but they all did the best they can do. Associates were very nice people,but the management was poor."
good,"there was sometimes the night manager she was very hostile possibly due to pregnancy "
good,"Worked in the back in Lawn and Garden, helped with seasonal. Put the right things in the right areas on the shelf. Learned how to use  the palate jacker, help mangers move merchandises around the seasonal sections at Walmart. The hardest part was areas that i couldn't reach or were too heavy. I enjoyed my coworkers around me."
good,"The work asked of myself as a custodian/store standards associate is not difficult by any means. Cleaning the floors and public spaces is necessary and, while not stimulating or glamorous, is something I am able to take pride in - seeing the extreme differences of the state of the store from the beginning of my shift, compared to the end."
good,"Proceeded to scan and count merchandise as part of the shipping and receiving process. As part of cross training, invoicing was also a part of the receiving title."
good,"Typical day standing entire shift, greeting customers. I learn to deal with different attitudes. Management was ok. Coworkers was friendly sometimes. No hart part is having to deal with rude customers face to face. Most enjoyable was assisting the elderly customers."
good,"I have learned/obtained all of the following:"
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is a fast-paced environment with many daily tasks to complete. I have learned that there is not many advancement opportunities unless you are friends with upper management. In general, the company is very short handed therefore, making it harder on long-term employees. The hardest part of the job is getting the daily tasks done with minimal people. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers. I have many customers that I personally help on daily basis and that is my goal to make customers happy."
good,busy productive lots of customers  short handed stocking changing price date checking  opening deli frying food slicing meat making salads and sub for customers orders and outside cases
good,"La empresa en general cuenta con poco personal por área, lo cual exige a los colaboradores a realizar la labor que debiera ser ejecutada por dos o 3 personas lo cual se traduce en que los trabajadores se encuentren desmotivados y estresados, asimismo no se preocupan de realizar una buena selección de personal y para que decir de la retención y trato al personal con mas experiencia."
good,"Meeting, greeting, and talking with the customers. Staying busy. Price matching and remembering codes for register. Good relationship with co-workers."
good,aprendí mucha a controlo de inventarios y control de personal fuye el trabajo donde obtuve mas conocimiento
good,"e um bom lugar para trabalha e fazer amigos "
good,I would make sure that everyone was doing what they were supposed to be doing in a timely manner. I learned how to manage time effectively to produce results and how to work with people in stressful situations. Management on the whole was informative and competent. The hardest part of my job was making sure a large amount of tasks were completed in a short amount of time nightly. The most enjoyable part of my job was the sense of accomplishment knowing that I made a positive impact in my company.
good,"My day at Walmart was spent cleaning, and checking for expired product, re-stocking merchandise. I truly enjoyed this job until management gave me a project that was impossible to complete.I would still be there if I wouldn't have got so discouraged while trying to complete this project."
good,"I loved working at Walmart, there was always something to do and I was always active.  I only wish I could have been full time."
good,"I made several good friends there,  I learned much about retail and also had three heart attacks there. decent about family and sick leave."
good,I always have a great day at work. I love being around people the managers are great my co-workers are great to be around the hardest part sometimes is dealing with angry custmers the most enjoyable part is when my customers leave satisfied
good,Working at walmart was very challenging. The management was not very understanding nor did they try to work with my scheduling. I loved my co-workers they were very friendly and outgoing.
good,"i covered both times that i worked at walmart in my review of them for the other time that i worked for them, the second time around was much better to say the least"
good,"Pretty fun place to work, like any other place it has it's highs and lows. You get to meet some pretty cool people that come through your register. Some coworkers are not so friendly and try to stab you in the back when they get the chance, but you also meet some really great people while working that eventually become best friends. Holidays are definitely stressful at times, but they definitely make up for it by providing holiday parties, bonuses and lunches. The discount helps when you have bills and still need to put food on the table and clothes on your families backs. I have worked there twice and I am still rehire-able. If I'm in need of a job and have no other options, I would definitely apply again."
good,"I was working at a Walmart that was changing stores, They were in middle of opening up a Walmart Superstore. I was working there for the holiday season. The management was fine. They had a lot of employees but at the same time they didnt. Every night we needed to do two cart runs to get the carts from the parking lot."
good,"Regular muito pouco organizada com horários"
good,This is a reliable and advancing company all in all each workday was a lesson and they treat most workers well the biggest disadvantage is the different aspects of management within the company
good,"overall it was a nice experience, they just wasn't really flexible with the remodel hours."
good,Upon punching in at beginning of day a meeting was held with managers. And I would begin to inventory merchandise  for restocking using handheld computer. Duties included cashiering and answering and assisting customers inquires.
good,"Everyday I walk into work and either start helping customers right away or help clean up the department. I help handle the freight, collecting for the department and putting it in it's proper place. I make food for the department; such as, sandwiches, salads, chickens and fried food. Management tries to help us out as much as they can but sometimes they give us a bit more than we can handle (low staffing). My co-workers are great people but are not always the hardest workers. I enjoy being able to move fast and get things done quickly but that is not always possible. The hardest part would have to be the lack of respect we get. I tend to do a large majority of the work and don't receive much appreciation. No matter what a day brings I will always enjoy helping out my customers and seeing their happy faces."
good,"this is an appropriate company for someone to work for who is just joining the work force. you learn to multitask, organization and social skills needed in a large number of jobs in today's world. Obtaining a higher position is something any one can strive for and climbing the management ladder can be very successful and rewarding."
good,Its a good workplace to work at for a couple years. Not a career place unless youre in upper management or corporate but overall Ive enjoyed my time here.
good,"Wal-Mart was consistent, we were always doing something. Making the customers happy was the best part of my job. Customers do not like waiting in long lines, therefore we had to do our best to get them serviced quickly, and successfully."
good,A really good place to work at but needs better management team and more workers. I loved working with most of my colleagues. If communication with management was better then the work would have been much easier to do and also need better training.
good,"Lets not kid ourselves, this is walmart after all."
good,The most enjoyable part of my day at work is being able to help customers find what they are looking for stress free. To be able to help someone completes the day and makes working in a customer service based job so much more rewarding.
good,"I come in to work and do my job which is reset shelves. I change labels, move products and put the products I removed as well as new products back on the shelf. I work with little to no supervision and I work by myself. The hardest part is when I have 3 or more Major resets due before the end of the week because some resets take 8 to 12 hours to complete. I try to complete it the fast and most accurate. The most enjoyable part is working with little to no supervision because I enjoy no distractions which means I'm focused on completing my job until break time then I converse with my co-workers."
good,great place to work but if you go to school they didn't wont to budge on changing your avalibility. lots of benefits. the are many positions to do in Walmart. going up in the company can be hard to do if they play favorites.
good,Coming from my experience one full day of work at walmart is enjoyable work. When I started I first was hired as toy associate during the holidays. I really enjoyed helping customers during that time.
good,"a empresa ta da possibilidade de Crescimento e promoções, porem os gerentes não respeitam horários de trabalho dos funcionários, abusam por ter um cargo maior e abusam da má educação. Não respeitam vida pessoal de funcionários.  "
good,"Long hours, no one set of rules for all employees, Must be consistant with their policies and proceedures to make ensure the most of their employees and for the company in particular. Willing to work in a fast paced environment, flexible hours and muti tasking has never been a problem. They also have to take attendance and puctuality more seriously again, to ensure the best service for Walmart. Wiling to go into further detail if required at time of interviews"
good,Walmart is a good job for anyone who is looking for a job. I liked working with the people that worked their which is why I worked there for 5 years.
good,"Not a terrible place to work.  As long as you want to work, and you keep your nose clean, you'll do fine.  Management is tough to work for, but it can be done...  For the most part,  the associates are great to work with.  I would say the hardest part of the job would be the conditions...  Either too HOT or too COLD and it is hard work. As far as pay and benefits,  pay is pretty good.  Benefits definitely need a little work, but at least benefits are offered.  To each his own."
good,"I have worked at two different walmart locations and have found that management varies greatly depending on the store. My newest store has a more open management style with the store manager and assistant managers knowing every employee. At my last store I would have been surprised if even 1/3 of the management team knew me by name. The opportunity for advancement is available at walmart and they offer many free learning opportunities, including college, ged training, and learning foreign languages that will allow the company to meet customers needs."
good,Loved working here for a partime job but there was no where to move up or to make it a long term job. The co workers were great while management lacked.
good,"stayed busy the whole time at work, made new friends, learned a lot about customer service, return policy was ALWAYS changed due to the customer satifaction but didn't matter about health regulations"
good,Good employer but tries to hold down expenses by forcing people to work part time.  Managers do not show compassion due to poor leadership.
good,"Have busy spurts throughout the day, all the cashiers keep to themselves, the only time they talk is if they know each other outside of work. There is a lot of favoritism, and people talk behind everyone else's back. Training wasn't very good."
good,"The day was extremely busy and usually ran short staffed due to payroll restrictions. Very hard to perform top notch customer service. Politics played a role in store management and very much ""Do as I say, not as I do"".  However, the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers who were in dire need of help and actually getting to practice my profession as it was meant to be."
good,"A typical day at wal mart is never the same i see something different everyday working at Wal Mart i have run across some of nicest people to the meanest"
good,Good Environment but management is not fair with taking days off or switching shifts with other co- workers. pay is okay but does not give many hours
good,This employer does not follow through with anything that is promised.  They promise that you can move to other departments to increase knowledge of store.
good,"OK to start it wasn't that bad my direct mangier in lawn and garden was actually alright, i actually miss working with him. The store ZMS ""zone merchandise mangers"" and store mangers where immature and really didn't know how do do there job, working there felt more like a high school ""click"" rather than a work place.  They couldn't schedule employees properly, so there where constant lapses in coverage, there was always like one person in 3 departments."
good,"if you can handle stressful and confrontational customers this is a job for you. personally i enjoyed working there even though there were some desperate changes that should have been made, on top of the difficult customers!! being there was like being with my second family in some ways. in the end i was unhappy with how i felt i was treated but over all its a fun PART TIME job."
good,I stocked shelves used handheld mach that helped with inventory and helped with location of products I loved my fellow employees got along with management I enjoyed much of my time there because of the people I worked with
good,"I Worked at Walmart for over six, It was funny I miss working there it was a fast pace helping customers out.They are a good company to work for  typical day at work  morning gets  busy  my coworker  all like each other  we work as team to get the job done  they hardest part of my job is dealing unhappy customers the most enjoyable part of my job getting the job done on time     ."
good,"A typical day at WalMart was very fast, hectic, and fun. I really enjoyed learning about the different ways people could pay for groceries. I learned how to cash WIC checks and other payment types. Management was definitely the worst part of my job, the manager of the cashiers never wanted to work with my schedule and always scheduled me for days I had class. The part I enjoyed the most was interacting with customers and co-workers because they made my day better."
good,help others who weren't meeting the set times for stocking and zoning. practice safe lifting and box rushing maneuvers.
good,Management in certain locations is excellent. However there are stores that have very poor management. It is hit and miss with this company.
good,"Although busy, coworkers were very nice and always willing to help. Had to be willing to suddenly transfer to other areas in the store but not without some help to get me started."
good,"Typical day is checking people out at a register, being friendly, making change, and bagging groceries and other items that Walmart sells."
good,instead of palletizing and wrapping everything Walmart just puts everything in there. From shampoo to kittylitter to coffee and every dry good product you can think of there is a lot of damage and destroyed goods in that method but its cheaper.
good,"When I worked at Taco Bell, they had this saying that they went with in order to deal with customers. L.A.S.T."
good,Wart-Mart is a ok place to work it help a lot of the older people get jobs. The only thing is at least half of their employees are conceded to be par time with no befits and can work 40 hours per week.
good,"a empresa nao é ruim "
good,A typical day was easy and laid back. Co-workers were friendly and helpful. Self-check was not fun to work very boring a lot of standing around doing nothing.
good,Walmart is one of the biggest retail companies in the world. I enjoyed working for them because of the opportunity to potentially grow in the company.
good,Job isn't bad but management isn't that great. Great insurance and perks for each associate. Hours can flip flop day to day but once adjusted its no bad.
good,"A solid place for a first job, but the management is all about the profit and they try to stretch the scheduling so they can reduce workers and save on hourly wage. The bonuses I've received are depressing like $100 for three moths of work."
good,"checar hora de ingreso pasar a cuarto de produccion para poner uniforme y recibir indicaciones en junta al terminar realizar los pendientes del turno anterior y terminando pendientes encargados surtido de mercancia atencion al cliente aprendiendo a tener un trato especial con todo tipo de clientes, y la gerencia era amable los compañeros todos eramos leales y la parte un poco mas dificil era cuando de ultimo minuto pedian apollo para otra area y lo q mas m gusto fue de que era un equipo muy unido y eficas"
good,"I work freight, order outs, manage a small group, clean and organize area,  Customer Service, answer phones, sell phones, type up contracts. change features,and attend meetings."
good,"typical day go in turn on all the televisions, make sure all the merchandise was not in the wrong place and nice and neat, make sure the high end merchandise was properly sercured with alarm boxes, spiders, etc,help out with cellphone center, photo center,sporting goods.i learned how to make a key,use a cash register. Management was alright i dont know what to say.My coworkers was fun to be around. most enjoyable part of the job was being around all the people and helping them out."
good,I got into work with a positive attitude and just do my job! Work with a great bunch of ladies and the hardest part of the job is nothaving enough cashiers for the Tech to fullfil their jobs.
good,Put too much stress on employees. worked the employees hard. typically had to do others work throughout the store. not enough employees
good,"A typical day at work usually consisted of coming in 10-15 minutes early to clean, restock bags and make sure there is enough cash and change to start the shift. what i normally learned is that sometimes been a speedy checker can sometimes not be good because you could accidentally ring something up more then once. the management and some of the CSMs aren't very good at what they do and that causes stress on the front end when they aren't properly informed of things. my coworkers are amazing and i made fast friends with several of them but the hardest part of the job is dealing with the one customer who is in a hurry and then talking on their phone while your trying to ring them up and they are to busy on the phone to pay you and the other customers get annoyed and say curse things but the most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers and just talking about their day."
good,"•	Proper money handling skills"
good,"Day at Work - Lay a way, cashier, helping customers"
good,Average place to work.  Decent salaries and work life balance if you are in the right job.  Not the same experience for everyone.
good,"The management is awful in so many words. Everyone comes to work with the weight of the world on their shoulders. Can be some good moments, but not many."
good,"Work is sometimes fast paced, hours would drop off or gain depending on the sales in different departments. I learned that working hard is very fulfilling and that every little job helps every big job. Management wasn't always readily available, but were usually able to answer all your questions. Most of the co-workers were great to be working with, as with all places some were not so great to be working with."
good,"Flexibility is offered at a minimum "
good,"get to work, get your equipment and stretch and start working."
good,I liked some of the people I worked with. I did not like when they made me stock the furniture department. Even after I told them I was pregnant they still put me in all the departments with the heavy lifting.
good,nice people and customers some good benifets takes alot of patients.
good,Walmart is a good place to work I believe I just had bad work experience. I worked overnight so it was slow mostly compared to daytime. I've learned patience and discipline. Management is very nice and will work with you with personal problems. Two of my coworkers where very nice. The hardest part of the was difficult customers.
good,"Working at Walmart has been a very stressful, and learning experience. "
good,Good place to start your first job or your last job. Nothing much to say that would make it stand out. Its just a simple job that asks for a lot but only gives a little back. Not to bad like i said.
good,"job was good, coworkers where good. Managers where inexperienced. It was a good and different experience. I don't regret working there but I wont work there again."
good,if your looking to advance into management its not what you know but who you know
good,Enjoy the people you are alway meeting people. It a job that really keeps  you on your toes for safety.
good,This was my least liked job. The manager at the time always had an attitude and brought her problems from home to work with her. Other than that it was alright. the customers were always friendly and nice.
good,"My experience with Trex is summarized in the old adage:"
good,The best part of working at Walmart are the customers. Their management however are very often hard to get a long with. It's very fast paced and they have very high expectations for a very low salary.
good,"I learned that you have to work hard to make progresss. very demanding job, but over all I enjoyed working there"
good,"I was a cashier, and it was alright if you liked standing doing nothing. There was to many management systems I never knew who to talk to about my issues with work."
good,"My typical day of work to open a cash register by counting the drawer.  Clean the area to make sure I start out with a clean register and belt.  Then I start helping customers by scanning their purchases and take their money to pay for the purchases they have made.  I pack groceries and keep the perishables seperate from non-perishables.  Most of the customers are great, but you do have some that are trying.  The hardest part of this job is standing for up to 3 hours without a break.  My typical workday during the week is a 5.5 hr day, with only 1 break which you have to try to eat in that 15 minutes.  Then I have an 8 hour day on the weekend.  You never know what your schedule is going to be and it is impossible to have a weekend or holiday off(other than Christmas Day) to spend with family."
good,"People i worked with were great, location was even better. i learned to be a warehouse worker as well as a cashier. I had very big responsibility."
good,"*Busy"
good,"every day was busy and constantly on my feet , lifting heavy stuff "
good,"There was a point and time that I did enjoy working for Walmart. I met some great people and I was learning a lot about retail and merchandising. there was lots of overtime and the money was great. Soon things got worse with bad  and corrupt management and associates. Along with that ,came bad customers which led to some of the worst experiences of my life,"
good,"This job is physically demanding, and meant for a much younger and stronger person. College Student. Stocking shelves is alot of fun tho. I like to make everything look very neat and straight, and full! I always have fun with my co- workers. We help eachother get through the night, and help customers together."
good,"For this to be the first job I have ever had this place was really good to me. The management there was incrediable, nobody tried to over run the place. I would come in on the days I was off just to see the friendly poeple at work. It was the best work experience I have ever had."
good,"Ótima empresa no ramo do varejo,adquiri um grande conhecimento em lidar com pessoas,direcionamento preciso das atividades ,trabalho coletivo para adquiri resultados."
good,"trabajo normal "
good,Fast paced but not entirely good. They hire people as part time to avoid giving them benefits. On the other hand the department managers were very helpful
good,"On any given day, I could be found stocking shelves or bringing low products to the front of the shelf for better visibility. I had some friends in nearby departments that we would help out whenever things got overwhelming. I learned that as long as you're nice to people, generally they will be nice in return, but there are several exceptions to that depending on personalities. Most of the managers usually stayed out of anyone's business and only acknowledged employees when there was a problem that needed attention. Although there were also some spectacular managers that went out of their way to make you feel comfortable and get the job done, there are always those managers that no one can tolerate. There were only a few at Walmart that I avoided, but only because they were very rude and made it obvious that they didn't care who they stepped on to get to the top. All in all, though, I must say that my coworkers and basically anyone else that I came in contact with while working at Walmart made me a better person and taught me many valuable lessons. The hardest part of the job was at the very end of my time there. I had just recently gotten pregnant and I was having a very hard time lifting and moving some of the stock. I wound up having to leave because of complications with my pregnancy. My absolute favorite part of the job was the people I worked with and the people I met. They have all become very good friends and I'm a much better person for meeting them."
good,Walmart is good but the employees are horrible and so is the work environment.
good,"The company gives you opportunity to improve if you become friends with the right people. Management is based greatly among favoritism. If you become friends with the right people you can advance. If you are not overly friendly, like me, and keep everything strictly professional you don't make many friends and will not get very far with the company. I do my job very well and that keeps me in the company but because I don't socialize outside the job i do not receive preference."
good,walmart is not as bad as people make it seem. growing to fast and promoting all the wrong people. customers seem to expect walmart to take care of everything for them.
good,I enjoyed most of the positions I held there. The management and company structure could use alot of work. The company doesnt seem to care anymore about the employees or customers as much as they do making a dollar.
good,not organized with the rules and management instructions.
good,"A day at Walmart is like a day at home but worse. What I learned their is nothing."
good,"Everyone's getting alone"
good,"A typical day at work was physically exhausting. There was never enough help, the managers were rude, and expected an unreasonable amount of work from one person throughout the course of day. My co-workers were wonderful, very friendly, supportive...like family. Working late hours, sometimes until 3AM was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the public."
good,I am the dept manager over frozen and it has a lot of work to go with it but I have a good job just want a change in the job
good,Staffing is an issue. The employees are great and work very hard. The hardest part of the job is operating with very low staffing. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
good,"As a sales associate, I learned to serve the public and gleaned my people skills."
good,it was okay got some good friends out of working there but some of the managers didnt care if u were sick or not and move u to freezer place when u were sick
good,This was a good just out of college work experience job. It was very busy and a fast pace if you can not handle rushes and never ending customers with little breaks this is not a job so you. I learned about the system used and how to quickly get people through the line with great accuracy.
good,"-hacer la junta de 10 minutos con mis asociados, pasar asistencia y productividades del día anterior, y supervisar el área para que el surtido, estibas y el emplayado fuera el correcto."
good,"A typical work day is working at a moderate pace an most of the people that work there are lazy so I have to pick up more of the load. But I've learned how to adjust, if only the management actually scheduled people we wouldn't have to pick up extra work. There isn't really any hard park to the job, there just customers and meat cutting. The most enjoyable part about the job is talking to some of the customers."
good,"I was first employed by the Wal Mart company and 4 months later I had to move, and havn't had much luck with stability the last year, but Wal-Mart has been good to help me maintain my job and even is working with me currently after I got shifted into a position I am not happy with to something that at least pays a little better in store, I don't feel that walmart is a ""great"" company to work for, but does help with stability."
good,was fun helping people with their need. i even fell like a hero sometime because people travel miles in search of something and when u help them find it they consider you their hero
good,"Great customer service skills,"
good,I enjoyed being employed with this corporation. They were very understanding and polite. I would most definately work at walmart again.
good,"I was employed with Walmart from Oct 2007-Mar 2014 and I enjoyed working for the company very much. I learned a lot of skills while employed here such as being able to handle customer complaints, answer phones, work as a team and most of all be able to have associates come to me for help when needed."
good,"I worked in the Auto department, Hardware department, and Download/Truck Unloading department. Everything is mostly individualized except the backroom truck download teams. I liked the Hardware department better because I was able to talk to many customers and practice my customer service skills to be very helpful and people would take sales or walk in my department area for more assistance. I liked helping and would complete my department zoning and desk requirements before assisting others in their departments. I made friends in different departments and help zoning throughout the store. The management worked on Wal-Mart's own promotion ladder for checking off training and trying hard to get noticed, but even if they got their payouts, they would overlook the people that worked primarily the whole store. The workers in the departments and downloading trucks are hardworking ethical people. The management was run by those that only see money and overlook and overstep the department workers. Some supervisors were college students aching for attention, got it, but then they were ignorant and only cared about themselves and their duties so if they got done then that is what mattered to them, they did not care about their team because they want to go home."
good,"I love my managers at Wal-Mart and co-workers. At first I was nervous about being on the register for the first time by myself but my co-workers and managers helped me learn by providing to all of my questions. I enjoy helping others with their needs so if the customer isn't satisfied with something, I do the best I can to help them. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is the customers. Some of them are so sweet and I love seeing a smile on their face when I help them with something. A typical day at work is pretty busy, especially with all of the extreme coupon shoppers."
good,"I just feel like no one on the same page there like as a team. I have learned to work with people a little more, learned the pros and cons of the management staff. The hardest part of my job is when someone talks to me like im crazy or dont belong where i am. The most enjoyable part are my co-workers who keeps my head up when im feeling down or weak."
good,Management is typically not easy to get ahold of when you need them.
good,a typical day at work go to the break room and wait after i had clocked in for the managers to tell us what was going on and how much frate we had I learned to enjoy what was going on around me and not let people put me down. Management was HORRIBLE. co-workers were very awesome and amazing. Hardest part of the job was staying up from 10pm-7am everyday except mondays and tuesdays. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting awesome people and meeting the friends I did.
good,The SCM could have been nicer. You have to work on their schedule. They do not compromise.
good,"Night was long, hours weren't enough, pay was too low. People were great, management was too. We got bonuses though."
good,Fun work environment. Opportunity to meet new people while on the job.
good,A typical day at wal mart consist of a great amount of customer interaction stocking shelves and multiple other duties
good,Walmart   is a good company  to work for if you are looking for  parttime  and no benefits.
good,"I worked as a cashier, many days I was at the self checkout register,."
good,Not too kind to outsiders from other states. Upper management was pleasant but personnel were rude.
good,"Lo mas difícil es la incongruencia de sus políticas con los jefes hacía sus asociados."
good,I love dealing with the general public.The management overall tries to solve problems when u have one.
good,"Individual store culture, unfortunately ranks higher than corporate culture and so while being a notable employer, there is unfortunately disregard of corporate rules and values."
good,"I enjoyed working in the photo lab, very fast paced"
good,"The work was hard and the coworker's attitudes were overall pleasant. The average day was nothing too hard for me to handle, but of course Thanksgiving and Christmas eve were tough."
good,I was not at this job long enough to really learn everything that came with the job.  The people and most of the staff was great.
good,"Just like anything else and anywhere else there were good days and there were bad days. Everyday was the same routine, and although it wasn't what most people would call fun, I liked that it was a bit of exercise and that if there was any ""work-related"" aggression it was definitely a place to move around and get some tension out. I feel that the managers were just like any others, they had their good days and their bad days just like us. The job wasn't what i would consider a ""hard"" job, although it was definitely a strenuous one. The hardest part was the first few days of learning where things go, and the do's and don'ts that you learn from experience. The only real challenges that I myself faced on the job was being tired from the  truck days. The best part of the day was when the guy throwing the truck would yell out ""WE HIT THE WALL!"" Every time we would hear that it would send us into overdrive cause we were ready to go eat lunch. All my coworkers were pretty cool. We all built a little bond back there and it made the job so much easier."
good,"I typical day at work consisted of taking care of customers' needs to ensure satisfaction. It also involved dealing with large quantities of money, answering phone calls, and team work. I learned something new everyday such as how to operate Wal*Mart's cash register system. Overall, my co-workers were wonderful, I  am a person who can get along with everyone and anyone. The hardest part of my job was definitely learning everything I needed to know in order to do my work proficiently and I mostly enjoyed working with the public everyday."
good,Working for walmart can definitely turn into a career for those who are driven to chase it. There is ample opportunity to move within the departments and recieve on the job training to gain nessecary qualifications and skills required to move up the ranks of the corporation. They do not like to hire full time and will make you spend at least a year or two proving to them you want it and medical benefits and pto are not offered part time employees but they do have other wonderful benefits offered to all employees such as tuition reimbusments for employees and spouses obtaining a g.e.d. or enrolled in college and 401k price matching. They do believe since most people spend so much time at work that work should feel like your home away from home and are very family oriented.
good,"My typical day consisted of me keeping everything in my department organized, and helping customers find what they needed. Some days i went over to jewelry and rant he register. "
good,"I do customer service, I return items and answer the phone and cash checks. The management is okay, it would be better if they listened to the concerns we have about our workplace more. My co-workers are great, we always help each other when needed. I enjoy pretty much everything about my job."
good,"Not the worse place to work. Plenty of variety in the work area but not much opportunity for advancement. Benefits take a while to get and pay is low. But I am never ungrateful for a job and there were some great people I worked with. Also some good management. There were some who seemed to have a power trip and would make your job harder but I worked at a good store. Unfortunately the pay was not enough to and make it by."
good,"Was pretty basic, minimum wage, hourly job. I did not have many problems, but I did not think the job was great either. Company policy for front end shift managers was restrictive on them and this often caused an increase in wait times for resolution of customer problems. There was not much bonding and teamwork between fellow employees. I came in, worked at my register, and clocked out. I did not leave with any memorable experiences."
good,"Wal Mart is an ok job. Not really one to make a career from unless you want to be married to your job. Not as flexible as they used to be, expects more from you then you get paid for."
good,when i started Walmart i was very happy to work there. over the years i have seen things that back up the stories i was told that Walmart doesn't treat their employees well.
good,A typical day involved first logging into the time clock computer and receiving assigned register. Cashiers are usually busy right up until the end of shift.
good,enjoyed working here learned alot would like to do this type of work again
good,"I liked the customer service and the coworkers.   When they had layaway I  liked it,  liked helping people find what they need."
good,"Typically on a good day, walmart is a fairly interesting place to work. You get to meet new people and even develope a knowledge of the regular customers. When staffed properly breaks, lunches, and ending times go rather smoothly.  In the case where there aren't enough people, you can find yourself doing jobs outside of your pay grade and job title. The thing I enjoyed the most were my coworkers."
good,"A typical day at work includes clocking in, going to my pallet, grabbing what I need for my aisle, and stocking it. I learned about hard work and how it pays off in the end, I learned organization from the stocking, and I also learned people skills. I didn't really enjoy the management at Walmart. They were rough around the edges with me toward the beginning and end of my employment, but they were okay. My co-workers were very friendly, although they did tease me a bit. The hardest part of overnight stocking was determining where the items belong, and the hardest part of remodeling was the intense cleaning. The most enjoyable part of overnight stocking was that I made plenty of friends that I didn't expect, and I loved the heavy lifting and being outside when I remodeled."
good,"It was okay used to be a fun, friendly, family atmosphere. They will work around your school schedule but, nothing else will be worked in."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and friendly associates.
good,I did enjoy working at walmart. I meet some great people and for the most part enjoyed my job. The management leaves a lot to be desired.
good,woooooooooorsssssssstttttt pppppppplllllllllaaaaaaaacccccceeee eeeeevvvveeeeeeerrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! never apply there the managers are rube and unprofessional.
good,Its a good place to work  . I have learned a lot in the past 2 yrs. working night and mid shift.
good,IT was a fun job to do every night. I knew what to do and it got done with out anyone looking over my shoulder asking me when is it going to be done.
good,One typical day I cook and serve food. Didn't learn much more its basic common sense things. The Management is decent could be better. Co-workers are fun and great to have there. Nothing is hard in the deli. Co-workers are probably the most enjoyable.
good,"started as a cashier,customer service desk,then went into management was over all cashiers ,ran a department did all the ordering and priceing"
good,"A typical day at work was unloading trucks each and every day. I learned additional and valuable ways to treat customers. In my opinion, management was okay. It was not what I use to in my recent work history. At work my co-workers were very helpful until I understood the tasks then it seemed like people attitudes changed toward me. The hardest part of my job was unloading trucks every day. The most enjoyable part of this job was me helping people."
good,"Not too many people came to shop at night, so we were able to get shelves fully stocked and help other departments. The night shift was fun."
good,I would began by preparing the hot bar! My coworkers were awesome and very energetic!
good,"One of the best retail companies with benefits, it's great to obtain skills. It's good for learning different positions."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great corporation with many opportunities to advance as much as you want through out your career. I was responsible for all cash registers, the money count, a team of 5, keeping the front end clean and presentable. I also dealt with customers when issues arose. The hardest part of this job was the hours were from 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM. The management team above me where always helpful and encouraging. This taught me to be an effective and positive leader/ trainer. This skill has helped me significantly in my other career. I acquired a lot of great co=worker friends that trusted and respected my leadership for success."
good,Not a bad place to work. But there is little to no concern for your family life it is about what they need.
good,i was harrassed almost daily by managment and direct supervisors and when i wasnt being harrassed i pushed carts from the parking lot to the cart bay. as a cashier i check people outr in the checkout line. as a garden center associate i cared for plants and all assets in the area and stocked shelves
good,"i enjoyed working here because of my co-workers, the management was mediocre, a typical work day for me was that i was given a list of projects that i needed to get done, and in the middle of a project i would get pulled and told to do another thing, then the managers would either get upset with me or talk to me about not getting my items done, i would have to collect the cardboard around the grocery section and take it to the cardboard compressor. i would have to rearrange sections of isles, while pulling product off the shelves and putting all new product up, while placing bar codes and pricing the items. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the management."
good,I have to keep area clean and straightened. Run register and bag customers purchases. The main thing is to assist customers.
good,"It's fun to work here but only as part time, there is no way you could live with the money you make from here"
good,"Walmart is a great starter job, but not a career job. There is no hard part to being a cashier. I am a people person and customer service comes natural to me."
good,I learned about different types of people.  I enjoyed catching theives and about the different types of personalities.
good,A typical day at work was alright except the days that we had visits everyone would get stressed out. I learned many new things like how to supervise my own crew and how to electronically pick merchandise out. Well management was not so great they would always be doing their own thing like they had their open door policy and they would not take that into consideration until you actually spoke wit the main owner of the store. The co-workers were fun to work with you learned new things from them and you also taught new things to them.The hardest part of the job was when you received a lot of trucks and you had a time limit for everyone of them.
good,management wasn't there they were always to busy to help if you needed them. learned how to be more independent on myself when it comes to learning how to do new things.  co workers were drama tried to stay away if I could.  the hardest part about this job was trying to find a spot for new items.  loved the work could do it all day everyday.
good,"Daily work load - day went quickly always something to do. Short on employees and staffing problems- never knew what you would be walking into when you came to work.  Enjoyed my job- hardest part was unstacking of boxes weighing 50 to 75 lbs each and up to 100 boxes per pallet with usually no one to assist you."
good,"chegar e desempenhar as mesmas atividades de todos os dias limpar ,embalar precificar abastecer e vender e atender todos cliente."
good,"My take on Walmart is they got good prices on everything,going to work i usually stock groceries overnight and clean,what i learned is how to have extra patience and deal with issues and not get discouraged from things i didn't agree with,management have some issues and i respect them all and their positions but they was always talking negative at meetings that drops people Morales if nothing positive is said,they did have some good ones they was very understanding,i love my co-workers a very diverse group of people that have good heart and kept me laughing lol,the hardest part of the job was dealing with management high demands,i enjoy my job when i get everything completed and that makes everyone happy !!"
good,Begin of the day was usually the hardest. Trying to get the employees in line and get them to do what the need to do. My coworkers out side of my job area was good helpful when needed. There was really never hard days I got every thing down so much it got easier for me to do my job along with faster. The management did have favorite associate. Which every job does have I under stand but to a extent
good,"- Stocking shelves and zoning assigned areas"
good,I learn from walmart was to change oil and tires. I did stock up can goods and etc.
good,A typical day at work was like every other day it started off slow and then towards the beginning of the afternoon it became busy til about 6 p.m. My co-workers were really nice and helpful to me and i could turn to anyone of them for help if I needed it. The hardest part of the job was if there was an issue and a customer was satisfied it would get frustrating trying to understand why they don't understand what i was trying to do to fix the problem. The most enjoyable part was being able to go to work and be happy I had a job. Management could of done a better job at their responsibilities.
good,"The managers, are what make the job horrible. The people that I work with that were not management were good and dedicated people to their work."
good,busy but easy going not much help as far as help in the parking lot when your pregnant. refuse to move you if you are pregnant and the manager was very rude to employees
good,"Too many ""Chiefs"" and not enough ""Indians"" ! Always told different directions by different Zone Managers when asking about things needing to be done ."
good,My day varies because my work shift is never the same because I work unstable hours which are not set. I've learned how to adjust to different situations quickly & how to cater to customer needs based on customer and situation while working at walmart. The management team is okay but it could be better. I enjoy my coworkers because everyone helps each other and looks out for the best interest of the the company while trying to satisfy the customers. The hardest part of my job is the unstable work schedule I have. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the smiles on the customer's faces when I have helped them resolve a problem.
good,able to go into work and start the day without any problems. is giving enough time to perform tasks the co workers and very helpful and easy to get along with enjoy interacting with customers
good,"Went to locker , put on vest, said hi to co-workers. Went to front to start work. The hardest part was if there was a short or an over on the money. Had to find it. Best part was I turned my cash draw over to accounting and say good night."
good,I work at night with a good spirit but the reality its to hard for me Im just 19 years I have all the energy to make it theres a problem I want to keep study but my shift it would be so harder than what it is. They need that person that can tell you if you work with me i work with you and they would help each other but not they dont that manager.
good,"On a typical day, I would clock-in, go to my manager, see what task needed to get done, afterwords I would get the task done, and help customers throughout the process of getting the task done.."
good,i enjoyed working there because i was able to take care of my kids and give them things they needed.
good,"Me dedicaba a cobrar la mercancía, después estuve de apoyo en caja general donde es gran responsabilidad."
good,"•	Customer Service Professional offering over 3 years of diversified experience and excellent communication and problem-solving skills. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of checking customers out and holding conversations with new people."
good,Liked this job a little better than my current job. Only thing that would have made this job better is the money I'm making on my current job.
good,"I enjoyed the fast past, always busy environment of working in retail. I also enjoy assisting customers. I learned almost all of my retail experience here, such as resetting entire stores, following a planogram, as well as using a telxon. "
good,"Era muito importante pra mim fazer parte deste grupo, pois no meu ambiente de trabalho éramos todos muito bem assessorados e sempre fomos ouvidos quando se fez necessário."
good,walmart was a great expierence. management was really good and they made it easy to work
good,Really enjoyed the work place and the people.  learned a great deal of information about GLS.  The management team was not the best in the world.  
good,"lost position when off on medical leave, had doctors authorization etc... they didn't take it into account. Was not qualified for FMLA coverage. "
good,productive and fun workplace I learned how to Stack and stock pallets
good,"A typical day at work is usually helping different customers with merchandise questions, battery exchanges, tire quotes, and looking up different items for automotives. Also sometime I will mix paint, help customers with bikes, make fishing licenses, clean up my department, and answer questions for customers who call. All my co-workers are really helpful and we all work as a team together. The management is'nt the best but they do their best to help out the associates when they get the chance. I would say the hardest part of my job is rude customers but I know to always act in a professional manner and if needed to I will get a manager to further assist the customer needing assistance. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping out customers with the simplest thing and just knowing after I figure out their questions and i assist them with what they needed I put a smile on their face and made them a little bit happier for the day."
good,"Responsible for efficiently and effectively running the electronics dept in a versatile and fast paced environment."
good,"Productive days."
good,"A typical day at work was the workers were not aloud to talk to one another and when we were not busy we had to do what they call ""Zone/Zoning"" which was cleaning around our work area. It was  a new store so not everything was put in an orderly fashion like It should have been. I loved getting to know my coworkers when we were able to talk to one another. The store manager there was great, never had any problems or complaints about him ever. The hardest part of my job, id have to say was getting hired to work only part time and would often work over my scheduled hours and at that time having an infant at home and coming home late and not getting to put him in bed at night would be my hardest part of the job but hey, that's life right? :)"
good,i learned how to establish great customer service and service for others.
good,"I would assign the crew of 9 the daily activities. The management was a supportive group of folk. The coworkers were a good group also.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with third shift customers, while trying to complete the nightly duties. Beeing able to do my job"
good,Wal-Mart could do better in all areas of employment and benefits.
good,I learned a lot to from certain manager that took the time to teach me how to better my self and also to move up. I learned from cashier to assets from Wal-Mart. There was no hard part of it and also I enjoyed everything of it.
good,"I worked all shifts, I was usually on the register checking people out.I was one of the fastest they had.I learned how to be on the register and other areas in the store.The mangers some knew what they were doing the others not to much.the hardest part of my job was putting up with customers attitudes and getting cussed out just about everyday.You learn a lot of self control.  "
good,"i would deal with the customers. at the counter, when I was doing the customer service part of the job. I switched to Loss prevention and this was the fun job I walked around as a secret shopper of sorts. I again worked with management to insure policy were being followed. I had to apprehend shoplifters in a safe manor to insure the customers, and employees were safe. I enjoyed working with the people that I did."
good,"The day began with a ""morning meeting"", then we were sent to the sales floor. Cashiers took positions to send previous shift home and await freight handling assignments. Coworkers were easy to get along with as long as it was kept professional. Most difficult aspect was learning to manage freight since I'd never handled inventory on such a large scale, but I learned quickly and was able to become an asset as opposed to a liability to my fellow associate."
good,"I worked as an overnight associate and couldn't say that it was the best place to be.... but it certainly wasn't the worst. The schedule was pretty consistent; I worked on register for a few hours, did some freight, took my break, did some cleaning, took my lunch, finished up my tasks, took another lunch, and finished any last minute things that needed to be handled before 7 am. I learned a lot about cash handling and what NOT to do as an aspiring manager/supervisor. I also learned a lot about how employees view a business based on rules and actions shown through different management styles. My co-workers were decent; we all had our bad nights but who doesn't? I can honestly say they were my team though, we worked through a lot of bad situations together. The hardest part of the job was probably the long periods of time when I'd have nothing to do. These were usually Sunday nights when we didn't have that many customers. I always got bored and tired really fast and it was annoying. The best thing about the job? Probably the people I worked with. If it wasn't for them I may have gone crazy."
good,They have you doing the out most ridiculous things for the wrong amount of pay.
good,"I met a lot of great people working at Walmart that i still have in my life years later. Although some management has their bad sides, i loved working here. Surprisingly I made a lot of money working only part time."
good,wide variety of tasks involved. Enjoyed working in the cash office.
good,A typical day at work involved me interacting with the customers in the Women's Department and Dressing Room. I would zone areas meaning keeping them neat at appropriate for the shoppers to shop conveniently at all times. I learned that the Customer is always right which was kind of hard to adjust to because you would be the embellishment of the customers. The most enjoyable was seeing the customer satisfied.
good,the supervisors are not fair the y play favorites sometimes you would have a manager that was right and fair with everyone but very rarely
good,"I love working back in Pharmacy but like every job there are conflicts. Not all the Technicians that work back fulfill there duties and responsibilities. Some of the Techs will ignore a customer and just walk away just so they dont have to get the register. I love working in the customer service field but i don't like working for a place that doesn't talk to there co-workers about the way they treat customers. If they didn't have customers, neither one of us would have a job. They are the reason why we have our jobs and we owe it to them to treat them with respect and try to help them with whatever they may need."
good,After clocking in and going to where I was assigned to be I was able to function in a manner that is already known. The hardest part of the job was when there was down time with no customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I had fun custimers to talk to.
good,The coworkers are nice and are fun to work with. I was a cashier ; interacting with customers throughout the day..
good,"At Wal-Mart I was trained on how to sell, repair, and stock the jewelry. I handled the customers in a responsible and orderly manner, to suit the customer's needs and concerns."
good,"good people, always something exciting, fun, fast learning experience"
good,This job was very stready. I really enjoyed being their and assisting the customers.
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart. I worked as a Customer Service Supervisor I love working with the public.
good,"get a pallet jack, pick up a couple pallets and work them to the floor.... repeat all night"
good,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart.
good,A typical day at work there was always something to do even on the slow days. I would help stock or return items from where they came. I learned that team work and doing the job right was very important along with communication and helping others if they forgot what to do. Management helped us when they could even if they had something to do that day and would answer our questions as soon as possible. My co-workers where like family and we helped each other if ever there was a problem or question. I was always willing to fill in my other co-workers with things they would miss at meetings. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to meet new people and talk to them and fill their day with laughter and satisfaction.
good,"My daily work is bring a good costumer services, stock merchandise on a sales floor, inventory management, etc. I learn much in this job and have a very nice co-workers."
good,"Os valores e cultura da companhia são ótimos, porem em alguns departamentos tais valores não são seguidos pelos gestores , o que desgasta a relação associado /companhia."
good,Manager had her favorites. Also when manager slept with a employees boyfriend nothing was done within the dept to keep the peace. Us co workers had to suffer each day working with the two in close quarters in the hole in the wall until things were worked out between the two which took many months. I ended up moving on and think they should get better management people and not the drama queens.
good,Busy this time of year and crazy work hours. Have not worked here for too long but so far besides the crazy hours I enjoy it.
good,"Well, walmart is an okay place to work but not the best experience i ever had. i got stuck in a position i didnt like and asked to be moved and was rudely told no. i was not able to do my best in the postition that i was in so i ended up quiting."
good,I learned management and constomer relation skills at Subway. It was an average food service job but management made sure that your schedule benefited them as well as your home life to the best of its ability. I actually enjoyed the work.
good,Will never work there ever in my life... work as a manager for 12 to 16 hours a day.
good,"I liked my job. I would come in and start taking products off the palets and shelving them, also rotating products on shelf. I got along good with coworkers."
good,"Gerentes ,supervisores,colegas de trabalho agradáveis de trabalhar."
good,"I loved the crew that I worked with. Being third shift, it was interesting bunch of people. Management was good to people until it came to company policies and then they did not back workers when they should have. One policy that is not right is attendance within the first 90 days. With a doctor's note stating that you cannot work, they still will let you go. They will not work with you at all."
good,"A typical day would consist of me sweeping entire store. /waxing i would do that all night/ Scrubbing i would rotate in and out of doing that and loading carts sweeping cleaning backrooms, bathrooms. Near the end of the day gathering pallets and then using a rideon forklift to stack up outside 15 high to be pulled out when the truck comes for pickup."
good,take the employees
good,"Stayed very busy with checking people out, and doing returns or exchanges. hardest part of the job was on my feet for eight straight hours, and working late."
good,"Clock in-, two fifteen minute breaks and an hour lunch. Great work environment."
good,"Typical day as Deli Associate was working the salesfloor, cooking, cutting meats and cheese and customer courtesy. Management was okay. My co-workers were enjoyable and fun. If I was down they lifted my spirits. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it kept me busy and my co-workers were awesome."
good,"A tipical day at work was stocking lots of merchindise , i learned how to inertact with customers and help them find what they needed."
good,A typical day at Wal-mart after clocking in I go to the CSM podium to find out what register I will be working on. After getting the register set up I then start ringing up customers items that they wish to purchase that day.
good,It was very repetitive...Samething all day everyday
good,As a cashier I loved meeting new people and getting a change to listen to someone as well as try to be a up beat positive insiration to them. I love to make people laugh and I like to think that I made someones life a little easier.
good,learned how not to treat people and the people there are completly nice just the managers and supervisors are not anything like that at all and my most enjoyable part would have to be getting off work so i didnt have to see the management for 12 hours
good,The job helps me manage my time so that I may finish my Bachelor Degree as well as work.
good,"I would cash out customers items, handled their money for change and assisted to items stocking and handling along with customer service. Management was nice to me and worked with me on emergency situations but are not compliant to call outs. I never had coworkers I worked for myself and no one else which was sad. I will admit that the hardest part of wal-mart is you have no personal or family life because as soon as you work there you do not have time to have a life outside of wal-mart. I enjoyed doing my job and working to be a better person in my life and for my boss."
good,Walmart was a part time job and they did exactley what they promised.
good,I have worked in many Wal-mart locations as I have moved across the country. One thing I can say is consistent is you never want to disagree with upper management on anything or they can find a way to make you miserable and make it look as if they are following the rules of the company. Don't get me wrong I have learned a lot and there are many good and hard working people in many of there locations. There a good place to start and advancement is only as far as you want to take it so the sky can be the limit.
good,"Trick to this company is knowing a friend and get a feel for how the store is politically. Too many female upper management such as co-manager and store manager equals undiversified workplace and commonplace favortism, to girls or women."
good,"i learned how to please the customers, make them feel comfortable at the store."
good,CVS was fun once i got put on 1st shift. i worked as a cashier and photo tech. we always had fun and i stayed busy. we got regular breaks and could miss a day if needed. i left because there were too many robberies and the change of management was a bad one.
good,I have learned many skills and have made many friends that will last a life time at Walmart. I work with a great team of leaders. The hardest part of my job is the long work days. My days starts at 2:30 a.m and ends around 5 p.m.Tuesdays to Friday. I do enjoy my three day weekend. The best part of my job is the satisfaction knowing I make a difference every day with the associates and their families.
good,"co-workers were easy to get along with, they were very helpful. i furthered my experience in stocking shelves, organizing, trash compactor"
good,I was stocking shelves with groceries and unloading trucks. My co-workers were nice.
good,"Fast pace enviroment. Helping customers with personal and non personal paperwork. Management was reliable about making adjustments to schedules, the coworkers were good to talk to. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help the customers with some of their problems, the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,A typical day at work is always a new challenge.
good,"Final de semana ,bastante puxado + gostoso, pois o mantem o tempo todo ocupado.Aprendi a lidar melhor com o proximo e a etca e valores pessoais e profossionais.Direcão bastante responsavel, gerente com uma grande compentecia.Cultivei muitos colegas de trabalho,relacionamento proficional fez diferença na minha vida pessoal.Dificil se dar com clientes de generos e temperamentos diferentes,a opinião pulblica e critica.O coleguismo e a união com a qual trabalhavamos, era gratificante quando recebiamos elogios da gerente."
good,I learned how to manage inventory flow in several consumable departments.
good,"3rd shift stocking shelves, unloading trucks, assisting customers, making sure items are were they should be and easy to read."
good,Morning meeting with management team to observe store readiness for business day. Evaluate store inventory levels to properly maintain merchandise for customer shopping experience. Evaluate workforce to ensure store properly staffed. Ensure store is properly merchandised for the proper season. Evaluate profit and loss statement to ensure increases in profit and controlled expenditures.
good,"Typical work day was a 12 hour shift, very busy. THe management team was not a solid team and had alot of interpersonality issues. I enjoyed most of the people I worked with and had overall good realationships with them. The hardest part of the job was working and having to supervise sometimes up to 100 people alone."
good,Very friendly and good people to get along with. Work was very strenuous. Works alone most of the time but help will be sent when need.
good,"Working a walmart was a fun work experience. I learned a lot work there with being a team leader, working multiple departments at one time."
good,"The meat department is one of the busy departments in Walmart. I enjoyed the fast paced always on the move work this department required. Stocking, rotating, inventory, all parts of the job that require your attention daily, you are never without something to do. I enjoyed working for my original department manager, she trained me for department head position. The hardest part of the job would be stocking the heavy meat boxes which require u to lift several feet off the floor, but after a few weeks, even that seems easy. A typical day included stocking, markdowns, rotating dated meats, pulling out of dates."
good,Friendly co-works. plenty of opportunity for advancement.
good,it was a ok job. i was only 15 at the time so i didnt get to work alot of hours.
good,they dont pay the greatest for the way the economy is. it is a pretty good place to work at but not enough hours and not enough pay.
good,"wal-mart was a good place to work, it was a constant stream of knowing what to do and when to do it. I enjoyed working there and would still be if I hadn't been deployed"
good,"Personally, I believe Walmart could improve so much in every aspect. Management was a joke to me. Managers stuck together, but would pretend to care and be on your side when they were alone. They really didn't act like they cared about a lot of issues employees were having. Yes, I had fun at what I did, but it was highly stressful for me."
good,I enjoy working with the various people during my employment. I enjoyed meeting new people on a daily basis.
good,I loved my job and working with the public. They were very understanding when I had a death and had to be gone but the old management was absolutely horrible and very rude towards employees.
good,Nice place to start work and gain working experience. Need more advancement to grow. Work in infant section that I love and various departments as needed
good,"Empresa paga em dia , adiantamento dia 15 de todo mês , salário depositado pelo banco é claro , grandes chances e oportunidade de crescimento várias oportunidades."
good,"empresa séria, atendimentos muitas vezes estressantes, mais super confortavel."
good,"Be careful with there point system. I was let go even being a great employer because I went into the hospital for 2 days and I brought in a regular doctors excuse and they stated that wasn't enough. I needed to fill out FMLA forms, which the ED or my doctor stated they would not do it because it was a short term illness that happened. They let me go because of this. Yes I would re-apply here because it's a great place to work."
good,"As above, I think this is a good beginning Job. As for someone with experience unless you are willing to change your position its difficult to get more hours or shifts"
good,Walmart is a fun friendly place to work the environment is really welcoming everyone that works there has a smile on their face every associate there are outgoing hardworking individuals Walmart is a great place to work
good,"Walmart is a busy, fast pace work environment and requires a lot of heavy work. It can be enjoyable, but that depends on the day of the week and month."
good,"Walmart has a lot of areas to choose from when deciding on your career from the Vision Center, Pharmacy Bakery, Deli to the food center and cashiering plus more"
good,"Walmart is great in all but isn't  something that you should stick to, to make a living off of. From my experience everyone to even full time employees are getting hours cut and more days off."
good,"I  would have to say that it was a great job experience and I had learned quite a bit. I started to feel like I am out growing the job, or yearning for learning."
good,"I learned great customer service, learned how to deep fry chicken, motzerella sticks ext. Workplace was e fun, fast pace environment. Co-workers were outgoing and great to work with."
good,"A typical day will depend on what department you work in, but in general you will be expected put out and organize merchandise, and help customers. While I worked as a sales associate at Walmart, I learned two things: first, I learned that 90% of humanity are better people than I knew, and second, that our maintenance personnel have nerves of steel and stronger stomachs than I thought and deserve more respect. Different managers have different personalities, and how your experience with them depends on what manager you’re talking to. Some of them are level-headed and understanding, while others are more difficult to deal with. In the end, the hardest part of the job depends on what department you work in. The most enjoyable part of the job, in my opinion, is on Fridays, when they have free baked goods in the break room."
good,I like working at walmart but am frustrated as it is hard to advance and I feel i am worthy of promotion. It is hard to get management to teach you anything. Some persons are great othwrs not so much
good,It makes for a really long day it kept me very busy at all times management is awesome I learned  quite a bit how to be responsible and take your job  seriously
good,"Poor management.  "
good,"Not all of the coworkers can be understanding and friendly, but a lot of them were at the Walmart I had worked at. Manage is not the best. You would inform them of something and all they did was brush it off like it didn't exist. Walmart didn't always take care of their employees like they were supposed to compared to the benefits they had."
good,"Walmart is a great first job experience but this is not my first job. I like working with the clientele that come in on a daily basis and offering guidance and recommendations on certain products. I don't like that there's limited growth and few advancement opportunities. "
good,"The management there is very unbalanced. You have a lot of problems with the manager’s considering most of them do not a lick of work. Then the ones who do stuff don’t get the recognition they deserve, same goes for workers."
good,"I worked as a seasonal employee. Another employee lied to our boss.abd tried to blame me. It seemed that my department had a group that were catty. Anyone they tried to put with them they ganged up.on. since it was just a seasonal job , when it was over. I never pursued staying."
good,I start as a regular sales associate and in 5 month was promoted to be a department manager where I learn a lot of things of retail and produce product that i never imagine.A day on my shift was getting there early and go to my department to see what the night shift left me so I can start a priorities and delegate some and worked the others my self.  The hardest part for me was to coaching associate for not doing their jobs as supposed to. But overall I enjoyed to works those years.
good,The store I was at I had heard that if you weren't personal friends with the managers/higher ups then you would never be advanced. I have recently heard that some of those people that made it that way were gone.
good,"WalMart is a decent play to work, overall. I would recommend it to someone in a two-person income household. It's hard to pay all your bills on only a WM salary."
good,"typical day is working with chemical section of store, which made me physically sick and the managers refused to move me, the head of store tried to help if u had a problem."
good,"Walmart has a lot of innovative ideas, and support for college. They have a few benefits, like discount card for products. The discount card can also be used for Walmart's vision centers as well as a few others. They also offer free medical check ups such as high blood pressure or free cholesterol check ups sometimes. The management varies on the store. Walmart pays more than most companies but they do make you do more than what's in your job title. They will have you working in any department if they need you enough. Personally, like in electronics they may have you doing wireless, or photo or freight and returns all in the same day. On top of customer service, sales, and cash handling. Walmart pays well, but they do have you multi-tasking a lot. Walmart offers a lot of great opportunities but the hardest part is having to multi-task six things at once. The most enjoyable part is the interaction with customers, and the benefits of helping customers."
good,"Depending on your management and your coworkers this is ranges from a decent gig to literal nightmare. "
good,"Very educational environment for those who have the drive to excel, learn and grow in Retail. Some days were very routine while other days where totally not what you expect. Best place for those who like to over achieve."
good,This place is unacceptable they over work you and don’t wanna pay you what your work is for they just uses you until they can’t use you anymore then terminate you but before they do that they let you get done with your work send you to help someone else they call you to the back in the office then terminate you
good,"Love that I can relocate with a job. The adventure of traveling to a new city and meeting new people and new cultures. Learning new jobs, and how other people live."
good,The pharmacy is great! There is allot to learn and you are always learning new stuff. I'm also one of the techs at my site who teach others. I live teaching!
good,"Met a lot of friends there and enjoyed working there as long as management wasn't too much into my business. It's when they start investigations about something that they don't know enough about, and ask people questions the wrong way, they stick themselves in a corner and get fired because of it."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work, but like every job there’s a part of it where you wish you didn’t work there. Management is a big problem. Unfairness and not a lot of equal opportunities."
good,"The managers are very well trained. They are super helpful but a little unreliable sometimes. Other employees would be happy to help though. They are wonderful with caring about their employees and their needs, whether it’s about their person lives or about your job."
good,"The pay was great, the work simple and fairly easy. However, none of those great benefits they mention kick in until after 90 days of hire. They don't really care how hard you work or if you're good at your job. They just want you to show up and work your full shift. Some days more, depending on department."
good,"Working at Walmart wasn’t horrible. They paid okay and were somewhat lenient. When I had first started I was scheduled 36 hours per week which was great; however after about a month my hours had been cut to 15 per week. I was hopeful that it would get better, but I had been hospitalized due to an infection and they fired me even though I had a note from my doctor."
good,"generally working at walmart is a decent job. Listen to management, always be on time. They do not like when people slack, and kill time on the clock, they look for hard workers."
good,"I'm always eager to start a new job, I always try to do my best with with any job and I'm always ready to learn something new and become a better employee she team player."
good,"Walmart is a fast growing company in technology. They have grown to incorporate many devices to make an associate job more productive, in doing so they have lost the family friendly work atmosphere which originally attracted me to the company."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and helping them. The hardest part is the constant cut in hours for staffing while trying to balance a growing workload.
good,Was a good job to start as a foundation. Learned a lot of job skills. Liked working with a great group of fellow employees which were very dedicated and hard workers. Liked having a stock program and 401k to contribute to.
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of working freight in my department and helping put out new items or move items around. I have learned many things working for the company, including talking skills, some computer skills, how to manage a phone and transfer lines, and how to read barcodes to put stuff out. The management is alright. My favorite part is the people."
good,"It was a very diverse place to work , with friendly co-workers. Fairly easy job and days there although they never really seemed to notice when an employee was going above and beyond their job description for the customers as well as the store."
good,"Culture is the foundation of everything we do at Walmart. We define culture as our values in action. It's how we deliver superior customer service, create a great front-line work environment and improve performance in order to achieve our common purpose of saving people money so they can live better."
good,"My walmart is ok, I learned alot as a associate and a department  manager. There is alot of room from growth and promotions.  The company has bonus every three month's. The company has pros and cons."
good,If your a hard worker and like to do a lot of things don’t work as a cashier being a cashiers could sometimes get boring but the other departments are way better
good,"I liked working there. The supervisors was very hard to talk with. I was given the wrong information on things to do, then it was my fault is happened a lot.."
good,"Very fast pace, learning something new everyday. Management is always there to help. The workplace is very accepting and very good about working together."
good,I honestly don't think they pay enough for any of their employees. The cultural of the company is poor. Unless you have no other option you should not work at Walmart.
good,Walmart can improve job security by ensuring that all employees have equal opportunities to advance and grow in the work place. Also an increase in wages would be wonderful
good,"I did a little bit of everything at Walmart and enjoyed working there, however the management was very unprofessional and did not treat their employees well at all."
good,"The position should be considered full time. Considering it is the first line of defense against a potential shooter, it should pay more. There should also be a map readily available to assist customers about items needed."
good,"The job was fine but the amount of sick days you earn per year starting is terrible people are going to be sick more than 5 days a year."
good,"Been working at walmart for a little over a month. Keep in mind that this is my first job. The interview process was easy, little to no on sight training - only online training. I shadowed a cashier for 2 mins and then the cashier made me get in and do it myself for 8 mins and they had to leave. I was then sent to self checkout to train for two hours and it was mainly just standing around.  The lack of training and guidance left me feeling insecure and stressed out for a couple weeks and I’m still trying to get the hang of it. Management is fine, no problems with them so far."
good,I followed directions and learned the tasks I was asked to perform quickly.  I showed team player and helped my fellow co-workers on tasks that they needed help with.
good,A day at Wal-Mart can be stressful it is a really cool jib to work at but management expected so much from you for not much pay. You can no more than management but they will still over look you for a higher position no
good,"Some managers aren’t very good , but is a good & easy environment to work in. Must be good at dealing with customers & have good customer service to work here"
good,Walmart is a fast paced work environment with very many friendly people to greet you and help with our needs. They offer good benefits along with good PTO and have slightly flexible hours.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was very exciting at times. I like working at Wal-Mart because everyday I worked in there the managers and the other associates make sure you having a very good day. I learned a very lot from Wal-Mart, I leaned how to use certain tools to clean and fix the store, I learned how to interact more with the customers everyday. A hard working day at Walmart Is when the store is over crowded with people and they put a lot of work on you."
good,I thought management was what I wanted to do at walmart but after becoming a manager the work life balance that I initially had vanished. I went from 8hr shifts to 10 hrs shifts but always left 5 hrs after my schedule departure time because the job is demanding.   And no one helps each other
good,Walmart is a good place to work at but supervisors there tend to take advantage of the employees if you are in a lower class department. I would not work there again.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work, but towards the end of my time there the management started to fall, hours kept getting cut, overtime wasn’t an option, I wasn’t making the money I needed to pay bills"
good,"Enjoyed the position I had very much because of the limited supervision and the trust that was given. Unfortunately, due to slackers and buddy situations, I witnessed other people having to work harder since the boss played favorites and let her amigos come to work and do nothing but socialize and sleep. I'd work there again if I had to in spite of those points since they didn't really affect me. It is a shame that higher-ups haven't learned yet how to be good leaders and play fair. It sets a very bad example for new and upcoming leaders, to have to be under managers and supervisors that take advantage of hardworking people and teaching others that it is alright to do so, just don't get caught. In a way, it is stealing from Walmart, getting a paycheck and not working for it all with your supervisors' blessings."
good,typical day at work was usually just putting away stock and helping out customers when they needed it .the management wasn't that great they dot even accept doctors notes at all they will fire you after 2 trips to the hospital
good,"If you need a job, theres a lot of different skills to learn at this job and there are usually several different positions open. Hours aren't very flexible."
good,"Keep your head down and stay out of the politics of the store, and you’ll probably be fine. Don’t let them convince you that they care about you though, it’s bs."
good,"A big store like walmart demands a specific attention on all the details with the workers. In a place like this everyone should have a voice, although always being respectful. I think they should give long time workers the chance to work with a full time. I'm distant to the knowledge of the reason why they won't give us full time."
good,Freight handler seems to be the hardest position to keep so to how  strenuous it is on top of how easy it is to get written up at work. Between the building constantly trying to change the task of the job to moving everything around on everyone keeping rate can be a task.
good,Buena lástima que no efectivisan a nadie y el trabajo duro 12 dias
good,"Walmart good company"
good,Walmart in Wetumpka Alabama is fairly nice to work at. I cant say I enjoyed it everyday but who can say that about work ? What I liked the least about Walmart is they didnt take enough time teaching you what to do there was alot of confusion from time to time and it seemed my associates didnt want to do anything as a team or even be at wprk at all.or e
good,"They like to say family and team but everyone looks out for themselves and their position. If you don't have a good supervisor you're not going to like it. If you do, you're going to be fine. The bad thing is that they rotate supervisor assignment every 6 months."
good,"It isn’t a terrible job, some of the management aren’t the nicest people ever. They pay $11 an hour now I believe and there’s lots of good benefitsss."
good,"The location i was at had terrible management and poor communication skills.  The company as a whole, i understand is good however the location I was hired at was terrible. High turn over rate."
good,"My experience with Walmart was a good work experience "
good,"love the people but the management team wasn't good and the communications was poorly  they couldn't hold staff and "
good,"Walmart is an okay job for the most part, the pay is pretty good the people are alright. If you’re looking for a busy job then it’s the place for you."
good,"It is a good job for anyone trying to live a simple lifestyle. At times the managers can go overboard with how serious they take their jobs, but as long as you're working at a decent and steady pace, you can dodge a lot of the mess that comes with the managers."
good,Not enough salary for the hours you work & the job was not organized order but you always had to be on time for work & they wanted you to do more work then expected
good,I liked working for WalMart when I first started in 1994. As time changed everyone wanted to be the boss and no one was working as a time. WalMart could be a good place to work for if everyone pulls their own workload.
good,"Most day managers don’t have time to help you out with problems. You have to work them out yourself. Enjoyed my job as a department, helping customer. Learning about retail and how it’s works"
good,A typical day at work what you learned management workplace culture the hardest part of the job the most enjoyable part of the job the opinion about the culture
good,It’s a good place to work if you have right management . Have to deal with a lot of different people and ideas. Can be overwhelming at times. But with right team it’s great.
good,"People that work there are great. I did a little of everything. Schedules, interviews, training, managing money and disciplined people."
good,stressful at times not enough coverage so they run you crazy they are ALWAYS cutting hours you will never have a consistent check co workers are cool.
good,El trabajo es bastante bueno siempre tengo buenas horas de trabajo aunque aveces no tengo los asociados suficientes para cumplir con las metas del trabajo pero siempre encuentro el método para lograrlo
good,Although I did like my job at Walmart they made it hard for me while I was pregnant to get days or some hrs off to make it to my pregnancy appointment. Even when I let them know in advance they would make it hard for me or give me points if I ever had to miss a day to be able to make it to my appointment. I quite because of that only reason.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work if t"
good,"If you want to work in a fast-paced, never boring atmosphere, with a variety of tasks to perform your shift Walmart is the place to work. Working at Walmart gave me merchandising experience. It can be very stressful trying to multi-task several duties as assigned."
good,I don’t play on the job. I come to work on time. I take my job seriously. My manager show me the right way to do my job. Safety is first. The job wasn’t hard.
good,"Walmart would be a nice place to work if they paid their employees their worth, promoted the ones who deserved it, and didn't favor employees.    My job is not a bad job, but my pay is definitely not what it should be with everything I do.  I am a hard worker, I want to earn my check and I do daily.  Store Management has denied my advancement several times with no justification for the denial.  Speak to any manager that works with me and they will all say what a great worker I am."
good,"Walmart is an ever changing company, new policies, new management coming and going. Some days are rough some days fly by. If you have a positive attitude, do your job you can move around. I’ve been at Walmart for 1 year. I have seen 3 fellow associates move to salary management and I myself was promoted from part time frozen dairy to GM support manager, now voluntarily step down to csm.  I think if you play your cards right and have a good attitude you will make it."
good,"Checking fast pace"
good,Working at Walmart has given me the opportunity to learn how to deal with different kinds of customers. I learned also to work with different people from different cultures. I really enjoyed working with Walmart though at times it is tiring from consistent standing being a cashier. I loved working with my teammates.
good,"Fast paced stocking, positive relationships with other associates and my department supervisor, Various problems with equipment availability, some manager issues,"
good,"Great place to work as a student, but not somewhere to build a career if one plans to start from the ground up. There is a lot of valuable experience to be gained from a job like that at a starting stage of one's career."
good,"Management needs to be more helpful and less rude to their employees. Management doesn't fix any problems with employees, they brush everything under the rug. Some managers discriminate against employees"
good,"count you register and wait on customer, stock, bag items that customer purchase and check id for tabocco products , and make sure your register area clean and ready for customers at all times"
good,"I was a freezer order filler at Walmart DC. The freezer was the only position open but, I would’ve preferred to work in the dairy. I couldn’t work in the dairy or anywhere else due to seniority. We also had an misunderstanding that led to me never wanting to come back to their place of business."
good,Ok place to work. No schedule flexibility. Not family oriented. Management would often not listen to employee concerns. It was when we would make our bonuses.
good,"Hard work is expected always"
good,"It is very fast paced, me and some of the people I worked with did not think we could do anything right in the eyes of management. We did everything they wanted and they still found a way to complain wile others in that department did nothing the rest of us had to hurry up and pick up their slack so everyone else didn't get yelled at. Other than that some of the people are really good to work with."
good,"The pay is pretty good and benefits are only good if you are a full time associate. If not, than you are just getting paid well to do a stressful job."
good,"This was a very interesting place to work because you get to meet all different types of people.  The workload(lifting) can be strenuous but all things considered, it was a great place to work."
good,"The working environment in Walmart is fast-paced, collaborative, challenging, and even stressful at times. Everyday at work is different, no two days are the same."
good,My experience with Walmart was a good one with lots of opportunities to learn and grow as a professional and customer service skills they took care of me as needed.
good,I would work at Walmart Super-center again but right now it’s now the best thing for me because they are not considerate of people being in college or having children or even being sick and having a doctors note.
good,Typical day started 5am checking in all vendors as they showed up. Learned about everybody products.  Got to meet lots of different people and learned how to get along with everyone in a business setting.
good,"Mis primeros años en WalMart eran excelentes, era otro sistema de trabajo, y gente buena a mi alrededor, mis 3 últimos, y el ultimo, vinieron dos asist.mananger, que me hicieron la vida cuadritos, no se valora los años de tbjo, no tienes fin de semana libre, , tampoco ningún Holidays....es extresante, mucho abuzó de poder, descriminacion, y trabajas más de lo que te pagan..."
good,Very busy place alot of people take but overall good place to work very stable schedule and hours really good hours around the holidays about 12 shifts all week
good,i think wal-mart is a very good company too work i learned how too cash checks send/recieve money pay bills i also learned how to help customers find/locate items
good,"It was good but not able to accommodate my high school schedule.  Manager was not always assesible to talk to.  Nice co workers, great customers to for with!"
good,"Atmosphere in the Contact Center is terrible.  Low morale, high turnover.  Extremely micromanaged.  I have been in the workforce for nearly 30 years and this is by far the worst environment I have ever worked in."
good,I miss the employees that I worked with  I wish that Walmart would think more fore there employees  salary and benefits because they have lots of part time with no benefits .
good,The managers are rude and too in their own heads to even care. Associates don’t get paid enough to deal with rude managers and snotty department managers.
good,When working at Walmart don’t think your going to be doing that one job cause your not before you know it your going to be stocking yogurt and don’t know how to because your an apparel associate
good,WalMart is a family oriented company. WalMart serves the local community and donates to numerous charities. There is flexibility among schedules and shifts.
good,Working for Wal-Mart as a stocker (CAP 2) was a good beginner job into the customer service area. The best thing about the job was the coworkers that I worked with. The job was easy enough you just had to follow orders and do what you are told. No strenuous work.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. The atmosphere was fast, friendly and professional. The only thing that coukd be better is management. Some were in a power struggle and others were very professional."
good,Wal-Mart us a good starter job for people with little to no job experience. They offer many benefits and flexible hours for college students or working parents.
good,"I have always enjoyed my job at Walmart. I started as a cashier,worked on salesfloor. I have worked in Automotives,Garden Center, Layaway and Claims before going to DSD Recieving."
good,"I work in the deli.  It can get quit busy with snotty, irrational, arrogant, self serving, argumentative people that think the world owes them something.  These same people believe that the store is open 24/7 that the deli is open 24/7.  Occasionally we get in some regular customers that are kind and patient.  It is a lot of cleaning ALL the time.  And when you work with people that prefer to stand around instead of cleaning up their mess it can get very frustrating.  Management, well, that is all that is need to be said.  Corporate management sometimes make decisions that have the worst outcome, like we didn't see that coming.  I still work there part time.  I do like my job but there are things that have changed over the last year that are not for the best.  Lost a lot of my co-workers to stupid corporate policy changes either by being fired or they just had enough and left.  It is like working for someone that has a mental disability and can't settle down long enough to see if it works.  Customers get real angry every time corporate changes something, and I mean it changes at least once a month."
good,I’ve learned how to do price changes something I didn’t know how to I managed over 20 associates I loved doing freight enjoyed working with the public
good,"All around this was the best job! Great experiences, easy work, great customers, and I loved my coworkers' energy. Management is okay and the hours and pay was even better."
good,Salario bom mas tem que trabalhar domingo e feriado uma folga na semana pouca equipe de trabalho tem bastante desvio de função
good,Walmart gave me the opportunity to get into the automotive field to which i am very grateful for. I do feel that the managers lack the want to learn the processes of doing certain task in the T.L.E. This would help with better relationship with the employees at the Walmart auto care center.
good,They are unrealistic with the tasks that they assignments and the work atmosphere is tense and stressful. I don’t know how they still have willing associates for the amount of pay and benefits.
good,"Wal Mart was a good over night job, i really liked it you have a lot of time to get your work done at your own paste . its not a stressful job , the overall company environment is great."
good,"Great company to work for itself. Great benefits, PTO and pay but the management team is horrible along with the high management in HR. Overall, I met so many great people working there and complete strangers. I bonded so well with my customers. I truly will miss some not all."
good,The work itself was fine. Management was too aggressive and didn't focus on solving employee issues. At the time I worked there the pay was only $9 per hour and that wouldn't even pay the bills
good,"It is a really fun enviorment to work in, their is also always good energy within the work vicinity and employees, productivity and the customers are always the main priorities"
good,"Should of done my research before taking on such a challenge, don’t get me wrong I’m grateful for the opportunity but in all fairness I thought they were an equal opportunity company"
good,in walmart it is all about working and working and working. it is fast paced that you are timed to get a job done. so your ability to get the job done determines if you remain there.once you can adjust to their culture you good to go
good,Overall Walmart is okay company for young people starting out. Every company has it flaws. The guess sometimes make it worth. I have enjoyed it so far.
good,"At first it was a place I was glad to work at, but as the months went by, they got strict with nearly everything and it made difficult to stay there. Of course no job is ever easy, but to handle school and with how they wanted everything to be, it was difficult."
good,"My store location is decently managed. There’s sometimes a few issues with the scheduling system they use. I work part time, with full time hours however do not receive full time benefits."
good,"Cap 1 is great, you work 4 a.m. to 1 pm only.  So it's a nice set schedule.  The job itself is nice, but the management, not so much.  Lack of communication, management is the only reason why I want to leave my job.  They don't even say hi, if you can't hi to your employees then that just shows you what you mean to them.  That's probably why they have such a high turnover rate.  Management team was great, now they switched them all out for a new team, not so good. You don't get your vacation days off you ask for."
good,They need to Lear to only have one schedule because the have two and only one is correct. And they do not tell witch one it is witch makes it hard to know when you are scheduled
good,Working at walmart has the it days but overall its not a bad place to work. Some of the managers a very helpful others will leave out to hang and not care.
good,Poor management but great atmosphere for first time workers. Fast-paced  which is great for someone who is always on their feet. Great experience and learn a lot about customer service industry.
good,"Working for a retail establishment has its challenges, for sure. You never have a dull moment. I've learned a lot about the differences in people on a daily basis, and how to cope with the ever changing attitudes. I've also learned that sometimes people just want someone to listen. The hardest part of the job is not getting frustrated with indignant customers who may just be having a bad day and no one else to vent to, and the most enjoyable part of the job is hearing the customers complement my stores practices and ethics."
good,The pay is kind of cheap but was very thankful for the opportunity and met alot of new people and If I were to be presented with that opportunity again I would probably take it because it is an overall good place to work at.
good,"I broke myself time and time again to bring a quality experience to the average walmart customer.  Although I had been praised for my work and quality of my store, my management never seemed to appreciate the amount of work was required to maintain the department.  Quick to blame, slow to accept blame, they passed the buck down to the lowest rung to save their own hides.  If you find yourself with managers who will listen and communicate, you can easily make Walmart a career for life.  If you have self-serving managers(like I did) then you'll be hard pressed to choose between a decent wage and literally anything else."
good,Upper management at Walmart treat normal associates like they are lesser than them. They see you as a number not a person. I loved the other associates buy dreaded dealing with management for any reason. I left Walmart because of a manager threating me.
good,"The job was very fast paced and people communications are a majpr part of the job. The job consisted of standing in one spot for 8 hours a day, working with cash and credit cards and greeting people as they checked out."
good,Walmart has a big problem with favoritisms certain associate get more hours then others. Management team is horrible some mangers are rude and disrespectful along with the supervisors
good,they were okay to work for. the experience i gained will help me with my next job. management wasn't consistent and didn't have realistic expectations. the work place was always lively and fun. the hardest part about was unloading trucks.
good,I didn't intend on leaving.i went over their point system.i don't think that's  way to do to an employee with drs notes with real problems.i was getting it taken care of but my time ran out
good,"buena empresa, buen trato al empleado, buen ambiente de trabajo, cansado pero sencillo, salario muy bajo."
good,"The pay isn’t high enough and there aren’t many opportunities for advancement. Some of the CSMs are RUDE! They never would let us go to the back and finish our assessments. (You can take these assessment type tests and get raises based on your progress but they HATED letting us go take them.) And I think the assessments are just a conspiracy to keep the terribly paid cashiers motivated and happy. As soon as you thought you were finished with the assessment, a whole other “level” would pop up."
good,"empresa boa de trabalhar, apesar de não ser possivel demostrar seu potencial"
good,Great work atmosphere always busy great place to work if you like fast paste work. Walmart has great discounts for employees and customer's and they also promote with in the store
good,"In genaral, working for Walmart is a good place to work. I make enough just to get by. People in general are plesent. It is possible to move up in the company."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart. It was a very relaxed store with a few managers here and there. Most of the manager don't even work, all they do is stand around."
good,The company was okay to work at but the coworkers and supervisors weren’t okay to work with. The workers didn’t communicate very well. The manager himself didn’t want to do his job.
good,"Medio tiempo, salario bajo, exigentes, buen ambiente"
good,Walmart is a very fast paced and high energy workplace. There's always something to be done.  Wal-Mart pays well for entry level positions and mid level managers but moving beyond hourly supervisor positions into store management almost always takes years.
good,"I was working part time capacity but full time hours and not getting benefits, which are needed in today's society.  Since this was part time I was told I was never going to become full time."
good,"Walmart is a very friendly job. Walmart gives very good hours, and is very a good experience for someone in the marketing field. I myself would recommend Walmart!"
good,Walmart is a good company to work for.  You work long hours (typically 45-50 hours/wk) and sometimes more during peak sales times.  We are able to go to some personal appointments without using PTO and they are have flexible work schedules that should work for most people.
good,"This job taught me about things I didn’t want to do for the rest of my life. It was a good learning experience that paid decent, but not a lifelong career."
good,I original loved my first store I was at felt like a family(store 995) moved away to work at a different store (3529) upset managers are very inconcitant and do not like to work with there team and communicate effiently most the people on my team where great besides a few
good,"Working at Walmart has giving me the opportunity to work in a social environment, Where i deal with many different scenarios on a day to day basis."
good,"You can get plenty of hours but have heard rumors and experienced people getting fired for unreasonable situations. Brother got fired for “stealing” but no prove of doing so, he is a good guy and knows not to do such a thing. They fired him from secret shopper, it may be because of his color but they never gave a true reason why they fired, but with SC Laws they can practically fire someone at their will."
good,"Walmart is a fun and energetic place to work. The managers are super nice and helpful. The customers are amazing as well, I try to help whenever I can."
good,I like to work here I did cashier go backs end cap checks working with the public the manger was ok I learned really  quick on the cashier the empolyers was nice  and good to work with
good,"My main experience with Walmart was only during winter and summer breaks. The workers are nice, and its an okay job if you just want something to do or you just need to find work."
good,"not much to say, Most days work as fast as you can, as safely as you can. make sure not to get in the costumer's way,"
good,This is a great job for young fit people. If I started at 20 it would have been great. After working corrections 10+ years it was to hard. Busy and physically demanding job.
good,What you about the biggest scheme since the day this place opened with beated prices and management micro management service. Well it pays the bills bonus each pay time off and ap lp (lost prevention and assets protection) steals. The best part is never sleeping and working 27hr days.
good,salaried management wasnt good. work to life balance was horrible. being an overnight manager is not for all. they need to hire for that position just like they due for all other areas of the store management team.
good,Working at Walmart was a good decision as I was needing a job at the time. Going into the position I knew I would have to be working hard but not at the pace that we are forced to work at everyday. My department is very busy filling orders for other customers but we also have to ensure customer satisfaction on the sales floor as well as to the customers that we fill orders for. I have learned to develop more of customer service attitude as I've been working in customer service for quite some time now. It surely has been a fun ride working at Walmart in Marion; but I think it is time to move on to bigger and better things.
good,"Always busy with customers, mostly friendly coworkers and alright benefits. The people are very diverse and fun to get along with. I enjoy helping the customers and I feel rewarded when the customer leaves satisfied"
good,Fast paced job with no extra pay for work outside of job description. Must keep fast pace at all times. I am constantly exhausted and have absolutely no time for a personal life out of work.
good,"This was one of my first jobs the store I worked at rerally turned me off to working in reatil staore again my managers and coworkers were aweso,e it was the area and customers that turned me off honestly."
good,"Wal-Mart is very kind and considerate to me, but I also don't ask for a lot. Im an adaptable worker, and I think you gotta be one to work there. I like my coworkers, and I've always had good managers (except for one but he went to another store)."
good,"get to meet various peope. good company, love the benefits and discounts. opportunity for growth and travel.  some stores are awesome and depends on the neighborhood"
good,"In my opinion managers are chosen based on who can talk well not work well. The hard workers are held in their positions because its hard to find motivated people who actually work with a since of urgency and competency. So this leads to a deserving employee moving on to other companies with hopes of being recognize and promoted. The health and 401k benefits are great, if you can afford them. If you have a family hopefully your spouse has a job because the starting pay rate is good for single life not family life. Overall it's a great place to maintain a paycheck but I guess it's up to your individual perception and career goals,"
good,"You would have to work there to see what you get out of it. Every job is not for everybody.   "
good,Company works with associates to help them find the best fit for their career. With stores offering so much development in areas from food service to retail management.
good,"What can I say it was Walmart, Amazing people however! Walmart was a typical customer based job. If you are not good with people then this is not the job for you."
good,"Take responsibility for handling returns and answering questions about mercha,store politices,and ongoing promotion. Keeping up with fast pace.Dealing with rude customer."
good,Low Moral poor management hardest part of the job is standing all day doing same thing day after day no variety. Good thing about the job is meeting new people.
good,"everyone works really well together, all around great place to work. but the hours I worked weren't good and couldn't be moved somewhere else to have better hours."
good,Disheartening not to be able to return to work after a medical procedure when you've done nothing wrong and was not told why I would not be hired back.
good,This company is a great place to start out if you need a part time job.  APCH has no advancement options so you would need to apply again for another department if you would like to be off the door. You have an assistant manager assigned to you although you never hear from them. You are cut off from the rest of the store and relegated to the entrance and exit of the store.
good,Its a great place to shop. They would do better if they would help work with parents with schedules when stuff happens. They denied my FMLA leave and I heard that were not supposed to do that.
good,Hours of work were good. Work was interesting and easy. The job was challenging. Some of the people were good to work with. Would go back at a different Walmart.
good,The front end supervisors were always very awesome & fixable with where the put you. Everyone there is like one big family. They could be better about approving days off.
good,"Only worked there a short time. Although I did work for Wal-Mart more than once. I don't think I'll ever go back. I'd have to be desperate for a job. It's not the greatest. Like most companies now, they only keep part time employees. Companies do not like hiring full time because they'd have to pay out more insurance."
good,"Most work days, you were short staffed and working outside of your assigned area. Great management training programs and resources. The hardest part of my job was keeping the store fully staffed, lots of turnover and hiring. I enjoyed meeting a lot of people from all over, and training to be a great manager."
good,"Just want to make a career, I really was happy to work for Walmart but my DM sucks. She acted like the fbi asking questions that wasn't her business other then that like Walmart."
good,Walmart is Walmart. Some days are days are good the other are interesting. Management does not really care to see you move up. Not really flexible hours
good,"I really enjoyed working for Walmart and the new online grocery program,managers were compassionate and caring with their crew in the online grocery department"
good,"Made alot of new friends, learned alot of new things. Drama was a big issue in the workplace but thats with every where. I went to do my job and left."
good,its okay if you live in an area where the living cost is less. Management needs to work as a team and then discuss with their associates so everyone is on the same page
good,"day to day work was simple and straight forward and you could expect to have many routine shifts with the once and awhile rough days.The job itself only gets better with the people around you that manage you and work with.my time there showed over time people coming and going that this job requires good employees and managers. During my employment ive had both good and bad employees and managers, so the job isnt always at fault in my experiance.."
good,"Walmart was probably the most challenging job I’ve had, because I had to learn how to set modulars and was working the night shift (10pm-7am). This was not a bad thing though, as I learned many skills there that will help me in any future jobs I might be hired for."
good,an okay source of stable income. the workers didn't take their job seriously and you will often be punished for doing what you are asked of. the managers were arrogant when it came to product security and people stole products often affecting my salary
good,I am on the remodel team which is helping remodel the store and is a temporary position.  It is mostly a fun place to work tho it can get stressful and there is always something to be doing.  Managers do not like seeing anyone stand for any period of time.  Most Associates are very friendly and helpful.
good,"I worked at the one in Somerdale, NJ. It was fast paced especially in my department which was OGP (online grocery pick up). I loved all of my hoe- I mean Walmart family, especially the ASM of produce, but anyways the pay was pretty good but my hours were like full time one week and part time the next, also I moved back to Philly so the commute back and forth was hurting my pockets and wasnt worth it."
good,"If you're looking for a labor intensive job with somewhat good pay and benefits, this is for you. Starter job for those who don't have much experience"
good,"A small town Walmart functions much differently than a big city Walmart. You are trained by programs focused on the big city policies and processes for your job title; although you must still strictly adhere to those policies, you basically are performing multiple roles daily."
good,Like the title says its Walmart and it pays well enough. starting off i got 11.00$ an hour. so i was able to pay bills and have some left over witch is always nice
good,Nice pay. Pretty easy work. I love working with people. The only know was price matching. It was a pain because people would lie and management told me to quit calling them so much to check prices just do it unless it's super under priced.
good,I can see where Walmart has the potential to be the best place in the world to work. it does all however have to do with the management team inside the store In which you work.
good,Loved the interaction  with people  solving there problems  like the small town vibes. Got to know a lot of people  and seem to.make a good impression.  Never a dull moment
good,I like my job as far as the people I work with and for. It is not a bad job at all. The only thing I don't like is the pointing system. The people are very friendly and will help you when you need help.
good,"I enjoyed interacting with the customers, and the privilege to help people. My day consisted of me checking out customers, restocking jewelry and shoes. I also would answer the phone for the store, and transfer customers to the appropriate department. The hardest part of the job was sometimes not having something the customer needed, and the disappointment in not being to help that person out.  Also, when we had some managers that rather rule, and dictate, than be team players, and help their workers out. I love the customer service aspect of the job, I really enjoyed interacting with new people, and being a service to them."
good,despite lack of training and poor management I enjoyed my co workers which made the over all job enjoyable. management just needs to be fair to all employees with the same respect
good,"es buena empresa en sentido de ventas, pero desafortunadamente hay muy poco crecimiento laboral"
good,we did have some truoblesome patrons. but for the most part alot of them becoma friends. thru out the the day most of the customer would come with great attitusesm cracking jokes and giving out little treats. on not so good days just seeing a regular would plut a snile on an employees face
good,I have been a dedicated associate in the company for 22 years. I love the job and love to teach and train others to lead a business. I love the high pace of the company.  Constantly changing and evolving into a very well organized company as far as processes and routines.  I have learned to be diverse in thinking and treat everyone individually to how they learn or think.  Also adapt to personalities in the company.  The hardest part of the job is the added responsibility on short staffed areas.  Balancing my primary job and then covering for others that have not finished their job is challenging.  It has taught me to delegate and follow up consistently. It has also taught me to prioritize due to the amount of work given.
good,the hardest part of the day working for Walmart is unloading the trucks. but the most enjoyable part of the day is when you are on the floor and you get to interact with the costumers.
good,I love my job don’t get me wrong but I feel like I could be treated better in so many ways . I need more pay and hours. I wish management understood how we felt as well . I come how stressed out because Idk if I’m gonna get the days off I need it even the hours I need that week.
good,It was a calm environment you met people pretty similar to yourself which was interesting but there were some managers if they didnt like you they did everything theycould to get you fired
good,"I can remember  the day I was hired at Walmart. It  was a long process,but once I got started I loved ringing up the customers,helping the customers and working in the different departments! I made life long friends there through work family and customers."
good,It can be an okay place to work unless you have managers that hire hire hire and you only work 8 hours a shift 3 days a week. pay an hour is good but there are never enough hours. I work part time in a full time 3 day week position. I have also hit a wall in terms of advancement. I am certified on every piece of equipment i am also what they call an eagle elite trainer . Theres no more advancement.
good,Fun workplace friendly enviroment.Undestanding management and supervisors. Daily plans were the same and the directions was easy to follow. No heavy lifting
good,"Really fast paced espescially on weekends long lines, a lot of items. But its really good if people are friendly and always have conversations with the customers it will make time go by faster and you’ll enjoy it more."
good,"Great job, decent pay, but management sucked, terrible hours."
good,Poor management Store manager is cocky rude and dishonest He is a bully and very manipulative He doesn't appreciate his workers He walks around like everyone is beneath him
good,The work/ home balance is nonexistent. It very stressful. As soon as you think you have a new process mastered they change it . Things are different from day to day.
good,"As a cashier, you just greet customers, scan their items, bag them, and load them into their carts if they haven't already done so. I learned many new skills here including learning how to speak a lot of Spanish, as a large customer base at out store is Latino, as well as fellow employee's who can only speak Spanish. I took it upon myself to learn how to count change back in Spanish, with the help of fellow employee's, who wanted to learn English, we helped one another. It really is a network of some really good people."
good,"This job is okay for students. The schedule is somewhat rigid so depending on what you need this could be a benefit. Walmart has a strict attendance policy you can only miss 4 days in a 6 month cycle so, if you get sick easily, or your school changes their scheduling it kinda sucks.The workplace environment is good though. Co-workers are nice and they pay pretty well."
good,"Corporate is good and well maintained and respects the employees and associates. The assistant managers, support, managers, and co managers of the stores don't respect the employees and associates, even in front of customers."
good,"The majority of management was really good, but there's always those few who just dislike you for no reason. The people I worked with were always the best part, and sometimes the customers were really sweet who made that shift all the better."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was great crew members and the benefits and pay  and real nice customers sometimes and to get to meet and greet new people
good,Employee job roles are changing and leaves an unstable feeling for supervisors.   Many department managers and supervisor jobs are being eliminated and those affected are going to be stock personnel.
good,"Cashier Customer service, greet customers, assiting if needed. Scan items, bag them wish them a great day. I also worked in customer service dealing with complaints / redunds etc."
good,"While the work at Walmart is meaningful it still comes back to the core value of,"" People don't quit jobs, people quit people."" This is the sole reason for my scoring, I believe I would've been at Walmart longer if it hadn't of been for personal family issues tied in with the fact that the managers treat you as a work asset and not a person."
good,It was a job. They often didn't care about your situation if things were to come up. They also showed alot of favoritism towards employees. Sometimes it was very unprofessional.
good,"Basic level retail place that seeks profits at the expensive of their workers. Don't let it bother you. Managers can be manipulative and play politics more than working, but it is an easy job that has some opportunities for those that are willing to seek them."
good,"For all the horror stories you hear about Wal-Mart, I can honestly say in my experience it wasn't all that bad. They have some poor management skills, as the Managers don't know how to manage themselves let alone the employees. Often times I felt the employees did a better job at following company policy than the Managers."
good,"The store that I worked at was often stressful. Typical day was starting off struggling to find correct equipment to perform your job duties. Doing multiple jobs alone, dealing with unpleasant co-workers or angry customers. Learning maybe one to two new things every day. Management was rarely involved in anything. Only checks up on how well you're doing every so often. The hardest part of the job is learning how to do so many things at one time, with little to no help at all. The most enjoyable part of working there, was probably meeting polite customers and working with a couple of friends."
good,"I say this job is okay because it was just to slow paced for me because they always had to many people at a time. You barely ever see management and even if you do want to talk to management you have to write a note or try hard to track them down. The people that worked here weren't that bad but it seemed like they always want the new people to get in trouble. You will be Confused because they explain everything once and then you are on your own."
good,"I liked what I did, I counted and balanced teals of the cashiers, customer service. I was in a room all day by myself, and if I spoke to anyone it was thru a drawer. I did not like the manager who always told me what I could do when I was not at work. Like telling me I could not be friends with other workers."
good,Can be a ok place to work. Some members of management are ok. the hardest part of the job is the management team.  They don't communicate with each other which leads to a lot of problems.
good,"IT was nice to work when a manger wasnt throwing there  I am manger around u all the time.  I worked for sales for a long time, they want  u to work fast  and do more then what u get pay for"
good,Great culture and people.They promote within the company but not the best salary and work life balance..  Many opportunities and great to work for a big corporation who has partnerships and has a great degree of respect for employees
good,"Great initial work environment but management was lacking in the ability to attone for their mistakes especially within the first 6 months, due to their point system of attendance if your availability says you are blocked out for certain days whether for school or other matters if you were to call out due to it you would be penalized for them not being able to follow or fix their scheduling mishaps, especially when it came to management not confirming schedule changes with associates, so  recommend you check your schedule daily or else you could get in trouble for managements lack of leadership. All in all it is a good job environment other than management, it is a fun fast paced learning environment to learn the skills of major merchandising."
good,"Show up on time, finish jobs in timely manner, can work alone, or as part of a team, honest, fast paced worker, talented, multi tasker, no unexcused time off."
good,I learned to work with others and had fun doing it as well and getting the job done. It was my first job in a long time and it was a great opportunity.
good,"Upper management was good and bad, they offered great training. However managers, reported directly to did not allow other managers to create a good work life balance"
good,"Enjoyed working here as it was pretty fast paced and they were helpful in teaching and maintaining knowledge for the ever changing policies. I wish they had more help where I was though, as sometimes we had to wait up to 30+ minutes for change. Also, over-time was frowned upon."
good,"The hardest part of this job was when we were understaffed and needing to help other departments with returning things to shelves. It was frustrating only due to being short-staffed and wanting to help progress the straightening out of products and without enough time or help. The most enjoyable part was working with good managers and staff who are fun, funny, caring, and team workers. Also fun was assisting the public with their purchases; even when there were customers who were not nice, it was still ok since majority of customers are good, regular people."
good,It's an ok place to work if you do your job and jump when they tell you to jump. Unless your in the in crowd there is less to no chance of getting a full time position
good,"Part time job while going to school. Learned a lot about how retail works and doesn't work. Good fun place in automotive, fast paced, liked the work. I'd do it again."
good,Management has their own favorites so to speak that they look out for and advance. It is who you know or who you can get in good with and not how well you work.
good,"I had a great opportunity to gain knowledge and skills in all areas. Progressed year to year, and was offered new experiences, and chances to really prove myself. Have much more experience than your average employee. Love team processes."
good,"I enjoyed the rapport I had with my co-workers and managers.  "
good,"The work environment at Wal-Mart was fast paced. The pay was good. The overall management was getting bad. They were not about family first. I did learn how to drive different types of power lifts, I know how to order fill, a little of the receiving, and how to load the trailers. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,"A good place to work. It is especially good for new managers. They do provide training, however some stores refuse to use the training. Some stores can make you work very long hours."
good,"Working at Walmart, on a weekday(Mon.-Thurs.) the days were not as stressful as a weekend day. On weekends (Fri.-Sun.) the store was full of customers and there was barely any break time."
good,It's a job it's a place to go to work and talk it's hard work long hours for a little bit of money they barely trained them or work with you and Management's barely there
good,It was a fast pasted environment time would fly by and I dealt with many customers. When they left smiling I felt happy I did my job and that's all that mattered.
good,I'm just a people greeter now due to a injury there. Ever since the injury i've been stuck in this spot and it seems that they closed the door for me to move. I hate this position it is the worst in the entire store. I'd rather be doing floor work.
good,"I was a challenge working over night, but over all I learned some very important information for customer service....................................."
good,"They paid me $12.10 an hour, which is good enough for the cash, but not good enough for how they treat you. If you have anxiety, depression, or other similar illness, do not work here."
good,Overall it was a good experience working for Wal-Mart. I learned alot and met alot of interesting people. I would recommend working there to anyone. It's a good entry level job.
good,I really enjoyed working at walmart. The people were friendly and the customers were great. The only reason i left walnart was because i nobed to tulsa to better my family.
good,Management enforce employees working on none programming works. Many senior PA manage contractor and help many projects.  Many excellent coders left. Reason of forcing to take management classes.
good,I loved working at walmart it gave me a grat look ob things i loved it becaue i love shopping there and u get to meet alot of people i love to meet and make new friends
good,Dm was a real B.   previous DM was a good person cared about customers and employees.  Learned a lot on how to run a business through Wal-Mart.  Lots of changes taking the joy out of work and decision making.
good,"While I was working here the managers, are lazy and my coworkers were lazy as well.  There wasn’t a lot of rush to get things done, pretty much just waiting until the clock ran out."
good,"Working as a Cashier at Walmart, my days consisted of running the cash register and cleaning/picking up items left on the line.  While the customer base can be difficult to work with, it was enjoyable, Management was the only problem, of there lack of management.  Problems would not get solved until the problem became super serious or management not taking your problem seriously when you bring something up.  But otherwise i loved working there"
good,it really depends on what department you're in. All of the managers are technially your manager you will have one specifically over you but the all mange over you.
good,"walmart was ok not what all people make it to be. but it dose get fun but it wont pay the bill like it will pay some but not all you would need a two jobs if you have a family. but over all it is a real fun place if you stay out of people things then youll have no problem, what i didnt like about the place is that they make it hard for you to move up. the other people will do what ever they can to make you feel down or they will make you look bad. but i am not going to lie i do like it."
good,didn't make enough for a person to live off of and the hours  sucked for a pay period for the amount you work you didn't have enough to live off of wasn't worth the time ok for a high school student but never a forever job  as the wage is no ideal
good,"It was a part time job, most of their cashiers were part time. "
good,Walmart was an amazing place to work. After I got into management it was very challenging because we were always short staffed. The work place culture was an important part of the day.  As long as you show up and do your job it was easy.
good,"Days range from hectic to relaxed, depending on events. Managers for the most part were level headed, although a few were very rude to both customers and staff, that was an exception and not the rule. The employees are down to earth, and are there to earn a paycheck. The majority of employees do proper work, with solid ethic."
good,"It’s a good starter job. Teaches you customer service skills, how to work with a heavy workload. You learn skills from each department you will work in. Can be quick paced or slow. Depends on department."
good,Management has something always complaining and  play favorites. They don't ever want to help any body but boss every body around and get mad when you are trying to figure it out.
good,Walmart was a good job as the managers not so much. You could only have a certain amount of poi tshirts for being late or sick within a 8 month time span and if you went over your points you got firef.
good,"Quick pace, hardworking, easy to learn, opportunity after a certain amount of months, pay raise every six months, inconsistent hours scheduling, availability hours"
good,Work was fun and rewarding make sure your register area was clean and neat greet all customers with a smile. Management was good to work for. Job isn't hard at all just have to know money. On really slow days you may be asked to put merchandise away that was at the customer service desk. If you would like a high past job at times this is the place to be. The culture is very wide spread. Its a great place to work
good,"The assistant managers are very good if they like you. If they don’t, good luck. The store manager refuses to take doctor notes, and I was scheduled for days I had important doctor’s appointments, even with a month advance notice each time."
good,"good environment, good hours, nice facility. the hours were consistent. The pay wasn't good, but its a good consistent job. The cost of living for my area wasn't supported by this job."
good,"normal, divertido, con algunos altibajos y algo inestable en lomgerencial y direccion."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno, así como el compromiso de todos para lograr los objetivos de la empresa."
good,I love my position but management was not right. cashier is a very exciting postion. hours was not to good. needed more hours and more professionalism. overall it was a good job.
good,The job itself was not bad.  I kept busy most of the time.  The part of the job that I could not stand was the fact when we got busy there were never enough cashiers on duty to help with the customer work load.
good,the schedules were in-consistence. Management didn't know what they were doing... there was not enough knowledge to make sure everyone had hours to use or get paid.
good,I liked my co-workers very much but with the new managers in my area not working with my school schedule things very quickly became hard to deal with.
good,Throughout my time here I have learned that no matter where you go. There are always obstacles that you have to overcome. The easiest part for me is to just get my duties done for the day. The hardest part would be having to get along with so many different personalities. Although times aren't always the best nor my day isn't always perfect I always try to keep a smile on face.
good,"Pouca qualidade de vida, trabalho excessivo dentro e fora do horário de trabalho"
good,good place to work if you dont have young children. attendance policy is a bit strict. even if you have  doctors statement you still get an occurance.
good,Typical day for what I do is very stressful. Morning I help down stack freezer 6-7 pallets taller than myself along with 4-5 others all within 4 hours if possible. After trying to get all of that finished we go onto our next task which involves putting out general merchandise throughout the store areas. IF we get done with all of that we help unload a 2000+ piece truck until we get to go home. Every day is this.
good,"Arrive and look for the MC40 and the printer verify the work area to know what was needed to start, go Gm receiving the merchandise and collect all the work to start working with the new merchandise."
good,I enjoy my coworkers and the atmosphere of the work environment.  My duties were not hard or demanding and the pay was decent for no college education.
good,"great for older people who are retired and students. Clock in do your job, and you will be fine. Sometimes the management sucks.Sometimes help is limited."
good,It was a nice break from nursing at the holidays.  I enjoy being around the happy feeling in the atmosphere.  The cheerful atmosphere. The jolly people.
good,"I love my job but i dislike alot of mangers attitude and the way the treat people. The job is Awesom, but they dont treat their employees right until corprate is in thr building."
good,"not a bad place to work."
good,This job is a great place to start if you have little experience. They pay is nice compared to other jobs in the unskilled area. Schedule is flexible. You tell them when you are available and the system slots you times based on your availability.
good,"One of the most enjoyable times I've had when working, it was very physically demanding, but what was asked was simple, nearly anyone could do this job, maybe not well, but that's how simple it is. there was never a day i didn't go home sore and in pain, but that's the down side."
good,"Its my first job in canada i learn do manh things here its a good job foe beginners and ee can kearn alot here . Peple are loving and manegment is cooperative ,"
good,its a good job and you can get far in this company. some things were unfair there but its a all around good job. I would go back if they let mr. I loved my job at Walmart.
good,I never regret my experience with the companies I have been with but Walmart did not have the growth or development I was looking to achieve. They did not have a good work life balance and I spent far too much time away from my family. I did not feel I could connect with the customer as much as I would have liked.
good,"This job was a fun job but being a single mother of 2, the benefits just weren't there. It is not a bad job to work for, there is plenty of room for advancement and the management is very understanding of any issues you have."
good,"If you are sick and you are part time, You aren't allowed to take a day off and if you do you have to have a doc note. They don't give insurance to part time people. And it doesn't let you keep your job. If they hire someone during the time that you are getting better. Than your job is gone. Without notice."
good,"Greet Customers Scan Goods"
good,A typical day at work is giving it 100% every single day. Have to keep up and listen to your supervisor or managers. Being a team worker and helping others is the most enjoyable part of the day.
good,I worked at walmart for a little over a year and I really enjoyed the benefits of pay raises and discounts but I didn’t like the poor management and the lack of ability to move up unless you’ve been in your department for 6 or more months. Also you can only change your avaliablity once every six months as well. So if something important comes up you’re kinda in a hard place.
good,"Wal-Mart is a decent company to work for if you're full time."
good,Empresa entrega o que se espera uma empresa seria organizada onde seus objetivos são claros e que sempre cumpre o que fala
good,"Walmart is going downhill, poor customer service, never enough product on shelves, stores are dirty and never stocked, lacking training and never see management out on the floor"
good,I loved my job but the managment was very unprofessional. They always tried to blame everyone else never taken responsibility for tgier own actions. I hate it came to this after 10 years but i couldnt deal anymore.
good,Walmart was productive yet competitive. The pay is great and well above state minimum.  Only bad thing I can say about Walmart is that management is not so great. The company as a whole is a great company to work for.
good,When it’s busy management starts to get aggravating and takes it out on you They Listen and go by wat one person say they never take both side to the situation
good,"Aprendí cosas nuevas a como desenvolverme por mi sola, no me quedaba muy lejos el trabajo, hacia cosas diferentes en mi puesto trabajo"
good,I worked as a cashier and as a floor stock person. I had a lot of different managers coming through my area giving different views/opinions on how to do things or what to do. There was quite a few times I was pulled off of one job to do another by different managers in one day.
good,"Coworkers are great. Management is out for themselves. Over worked, hours cut, short staff. No one is held accountable. Untrustworthy managers. Managers have favorites. Store manager is two faced, she will be nice to your face but then get one of the assistant managers to do her dirty work so she doesn’t look like the bad guy. All the hard working employees are leaving there to find other work because of the stuff that  goes on, on a daily basis."
good,"I would go to work, start stocking the sales floor as much as I could until a certain time so I could fully run my processes. The hardest part was when you were alone and could not run any processes."
good,"Unprofessional and inconsistent work environment.  Minimal to no structure .  Lack of management skills . "
good,Typicalday at work is stressful in regards to the help we have at work. The number of people available in pharmacy does not match up to the workflow constantly presented. I have learned to be tough outside and inside. you learn to work in group settings to reach a common goal. The job teaches you self sufficient and teaches you to be efficient. In regards to workplace culture is very accepting and tolerate of people from all backgrounds. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing the difference we as healthcare members make in our clients life. So I have learned to be appreciative of what I do and my clients.
good,"Once you got into the swing of things, stocking was a really great job. The first week will be hard unless you have a great manager willing to work with you- I did not, and had to figure things out on my own. How smoothly your shift goes will depend on how well the 2nd shift did their job (unloading trucks and moving the freight to the floor, some times working some of it out as well) and if your team members are hard workers. Pay is above average for this area, we got to listen to headphones/music while we worked and got off at the same time every night. Hour lunch was nice. Overall a rewarding job and a great work out."
good,Working at Wal-mart was not Horrendous however upward mobility seems to be an issue and pay raises are too far apart for my liking. also the style of management greatly differs from manager to manager
good,Loved the people I worked around. Love working customer service and having new things happening all the time. This was a great place to work and would definitely be a good first job.
good,Hours are being cut. Unable to pay all bills on 28 - 30 hours per week.  The insurance coverage has become a joke. We as employees pay more out of pocket cost while paying high insurance premiums. Financially employees are suffering.
good,In the evening time was the worst time ever the mangers would close all the cashiers and only leave  minimum  2 registrará open and the customers will be complaining because the lines get pass the hygiene stuff and nobody wants to wait so long in line
good,"Unless you were a favorite, forget any type of advancement. Raises were small and could be taken away during evaluation if the manager did not like you. Hours were constantly changing, never guaranteed. The people were petty and acted like high schoolers."
good,Management needs to listen to their associates. I mean if u show the associates that you care. Police that they have in place hurts more than help. I think everything is wrong not excepting Dr notes or excuses is a real slap in the face
good,It’s a good place to work for a short time unless you plan on moving up to management in which case you will make a decent living. Holidays are fun to work cause you get to see all the new stuff but the people aren’t always fun!
good,"Atypical day at work is very busy. Especially on Fridays, Sundays, first of the month, and during holidays. I learned a lot about fabrics and electronics.The management there was not so great. I could never get my main issues resolved through them. The personalities in that place is something to recon with. Some of the teammates have outgoing personalities and on the other hand, some were biased and had terrible attitudes. Being the person that I am, I knew how to deal with the personalities and attitude in a good way. I also learned that, if I'd go in, do my job, speak and greet customers, be nice and kind, and stay to myself, Id have a great day on the job. Eventually, that was my role and I stuck with it."
good,Management  lacks knowledge of all aspects of store operations .they preach team work but at certain times completely ignore it . Hardes part of job was getting  management to back me in trying to make sure  store was  completely  clean and  ready for  customers
good,The job and work life balance is not good all that good. There is no balance and you work more than you are home and the pay does not make up for it to be honest.
good,"walmart as a company does supply a steady work environment but lacks organization on many levels. Lack of comunication between departments and managers creates tension or miscomunictions between staff.Often understaffed my position is set out of the fray of most of the store. My main job description is processing money transactions. including money transfers, bill payments, and cashing checks."
good,The company  Is wonderful  it's just that the management team is no good. They walk right by dont speak. And you dont get rewarded for your hard work. Your over worked under payed. The customer service sucks The lines are always out the door not enough cashiers. The whole store is under staffed. The use you until they cant use you anymore. So no I wouldn't recommend anybody there for a job
good,"I enjoyed my short time at Walmart, i like meeting the variety of customers. Unfortunately walmart was not providing me 40hrs per week and scheduled you on various shifts. Making it hard for you to get a second job."
good,It is an okay place to work. The pay is decent but it is very busy and it is hard to get raises and it is hard to advance within the store part of Walmart.
good,"Walmart is a good starter job, but not enough to compensate cost of living. As a part-time employee, I was not provided healthcare benefits which I needed for my family."
good,"Keep a better eye on management. Some are quite rude. Hours are reasonable, job is simple. Pay is pretty good. More positive actions from managers would help immensely."
good,"I usually worked the early shift. 6:30am to 2:30  I really enjoyed this shift as I am a morning person.  The general management was a real hands on type.  He kept the store really clean and nice for his customers.  Some of the CSM's could be rude if they got too stressed out.  Not sure why but I really enjoy being a cashier.  Each customer comes with fun stories to share, personal tidbits in their life, they joke and laugh.  I enjoy the time with each one.  I had several customers that would only come to my line.  They said I was the best ""bagger"" they ever had.  I bagged each item like it was my own...with care."
good,"It was an easy job, some people were cool others were pains.  The main problem I had was with the management trying to force me to force credit cards on people."
good,"Hard work, constantly busy.  Helping customers, going on cash, merchandising, refilling shelves, doing modular(merchandise assigned location), pricing changes and more"
good,"I loved my job. I loved what I done, I liked my co workers and working with them but management in the store I worked in was terrible. They didn't advance the ones who deserved it, they talk to you like your a slave."
good,Its fast paced and not for someone who can not handle stress and pressure. I have been there several years but I needed something new. It's a good starting job and can move up if you bow down
good,"Depending on the day, work could be hard. However, the employees entertain each other in order to keep a happy environment. Being on the floor stocking merchandise was the easiest and more enjoyable part of the job. Being in the backroom unloading trucks was the hardest, due to the heat and manual labor."
good,Management could better but an overall fun place to work. The people you work with sometimes become family. Customers brighten your day. You never forget about your Walmart family!
good,"Vendedora de todos produtos que faziam parte do setor de eletrodomésticos, serviços como garantia estendida e seguros, ambiente de trabalho bom,"
good,It was easy to start my day as a cashier. All I had to do was clock in and the computer would assign me to a register that I would be working for beginning of my shift. I would start work right away. Then the head cashier would tell me when it was time for break or lunch.
good,"You can be a rock star or a looser and still get the same pay/treatment. Walmart sees you as a walking talking machine, and will work you like it if you let them. Don't let them."
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for long as your dedicated and hard working and care about your people."
good,It’s not the greatest place to work Because of the pay you could probably live off it depending on where you live and what bills you have. Other than that I would like to make more but they give everyone in the store the same amount of raise a year as far as I know
good,Change in Mgr. in my department was not a wise choice. No matter how hard you worked was not good enough. Not enough help nor teamwork. So much stress
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo, con una cultura muy bien definida."
good,The work was a challenge lifting heavy merchandise all night but during closing hours it was peaceful with no customers in the way. Co workers were very friendly and helpful.
good,most days it was all about getting the work done by a certain time and being pressured to do so. I feel as though associates are overworked in most cases
good,"Servicing vehicles at the shop."
good,"Working with customers helping, suggesting, stocking wile serving customers, culture  it is no culture and respect for working responsible, looking for carrier associates only favoritism an connections"
good,"La cultura laboral es buena, solo que dependiendo de quien este en los puestos claves se lleva al pie de la letra y se le da mucho enfasis, cuando esto no sucede los asociados caminan sin rumbo y objetivos."
good,Being a cashier is very slow at times. and they don't require much when it is slow they ask you to front the area around the register then just stand there waiting for customers to approach your area
good,"This job is very difficult if you’re not used to a lot of confrontation with customers. At times it can be difficult, but at the end of the day it’s all about the pay and the people you spend time with. Starting up this type of career for a short while gets you thinking about the great experiences I shared with all my co workers and customers I have met over the years."
good,"WalMart has the most craziest schedules! I worked there for 3 years. We get a ""bonus"" every 4 months, but if you don't work full time you will only get a ""piece"" of a bonus ($500 bonus, part time $150) the managers dont do their job, they talk about eachother and other employees as well. Work full time hours for 11 weeks and work 20 on the 12th week (so you won't get full time benefits) "
good,I learned ALOT met ALOT of ppl work place was good but pay was crazy working hard but not enough acknowledgement no raise but good bonuses great team very fast pace
good,"While working for Walmart I found it difficult to find child care for my children, as the hours available for shifts were very inconstant.  When you changed you availability the chances of not even being scheduled were increased greatly."
good,I liked my job at the Harker Heights store until I was fired for one customer complaint and with them not giving me a write up or anything. I am also made non-rehireable for this.
good,The most enjoyable part of this work place are the customers . Some customers are rude but then you get the customers that make your work experience great . If you want a different position you have to work hard for it .
good,"someone would say one thing one day and another the next day "
good,"Over all, it was an okay job. People worked full time for over a year with no promotion. One manager was terrible. The morning crew was disrespectful."
good,Walmart is the world's largest retail company. It has been undergoing  changes to better compete in a digital world adding new business and becoming more flexible with shopping options.
good,"Walmart was a good place to work. I enjoyed the staff and the managers as well. I did not like working on holidays but they did supply a meal of some sort if you did have to work which was better than nothing. Although I did wish I had more hours and the specific location I worked at was unstable and shaky, I would work there again."
good,Its ok but want to get a. Better job sonetimes is stressful need a good job the hrs are kind of bad because they close late schedule sometime are weird
good,"Certain times of the day that were slow and once the rush hour came through, more lines should be open. More happier faces and fast pace cashiers. Other than that, should have got to work 40 hours instead of under 40 so we don't get benefits."
good,"My typical day at Walmart starts with customer service and ends with customer service, and learning how to ajust and adhere to customer of different cultural back ground.  When it comes to the management team in my opinion, the communication is lacking and more training is needed. As for the culture I am yet to understand fully, Hardest part of my job is being able to assist a customer who speak a different language other than English. Most enjoyable part of my job is a satisfied customer."
good,"Shifts are often unpredictably scheduled week to week, and you usually work harder than what you were paid. You will most likely get more hours than your part-time status implies. Most other associates were friendly to work with, management lacked communication and weren't understanding of family emergencies."
good,Pay is good. You will work for the pay. Have to meet production numbers everyday. Hot in summer cold in winter. No AC just industrial fans. Don't have to deal with customers. Just get your work done and go home.
good,"With working with customers who are very demanding and think Walmart is not the ""best"" place to work, you have to overcome a lot of negatives.  While we have some great customers, and I thank each of them daily, we have to deal with some scary things.  Then to be downgraded by management when you are working as hard as you can, is very sad.  I use to enjoy going to work and meeting and greeting associates and customers but now there is just to much on our plates to ""enjoy"" going to work.  Some management won't give you the time of day and if they do it isn't very kind.  A lot of favoritism in the mix hurts the team.  We are asked to treat all with respect and integrity but upper management doesn't seem to have to follow this rule."
good,"Observe individuals shopping in the store. "
good,"What can I say, I enjoyed my time here, the customers made the day go by so quickly. Management was hard to deal with, lots of people to listen to no one to lead."
good,I felt like Walmart the thing I did not like is not being heard. sometimes it seemed like no one listened until some from higher up was coming to check the store.
good,"Trabalhei por muitos anos na mesma loja por conhecia a loja toda era minha segunda casa literalmente era um bom ambiente"
good,"Big expectations and pressure to achieve sales and goals. Difficult culture with associates. Good pay and benefits are a plus for management, and a good bonus structure based on store performance."
good,Poucas oportunidades e trabalho muito repetitivo sem muito desafios
good,"All employees are just warm bodies. They could care less about anyone. They hire constantly, why not hire people that really wants a job. Not just  there for the money. The employees are 99% could care less. Most employees need the jobs. But WALMART isn’t about working with the employees. It’s all about making the management look good."
good,"I only shop there now for things I need I try not to go there very often, but again I go there when I need to. I was treated poorly when I worked there."
good,They could have paid better. It's hard working for a company that based your bonuses off thefts but didn't want to hire security to protect their items. I enjoyed it while I was young but definitely needed a more stable job as I got older.
good,The goal for Walmart has changed over the years as they are gearing up for more of an online roll as opposed to brick and mortar stores. Shifting of the workload to skeleton crews.
good,Walmart has been good but for being dedicated for 25 years i feel their should be more compensation . I do like the job of quality assurance and the different things we deal with on a daily bases.
good,"It’s  fast paced job. I am constantly on the go, from running the cash register to going and checking prices for items. I run returns and put things back where they need to be and help people at customer service desk."
good,Walmart is a decent place to work most of the time but they hardly offer full time and the hours are so inconsistent but the work environment is usually very good
good,"It was a great place to work. I enjoyed my co workers, and the customers were great too. "
good,"A good day included all employees and management getting along, with no one getting in trouble. The hardest part is the miss communication. Enjoyed the associates and customers."
good,I like working there  but at that time the pay rate wasn't  enough for  all the things I did. I really don't have nothing else to say but its a great place to work if you are young and have no responsibilities. I recommended working here to my own son.
good,"Management plays a lot of favoritism towards associates who kiss up to them and then the management gives them what they want(cutting off points, giving them department transfers/management positions)."
good,"A typical day on the job included a meeting in the back room with the shift manager and all of us.  Usually the meetings were productive and helpful, on occasion they were used to berate or yell at the entire team for some failing or other.  After the meeting, we were dismissed to our assigned areas.  For me, that included helping to unload the truck, and then go out onto the floor to my assigned stock area to work freight that came in that day.  Customer Service was also a large part of the job, as you answered questions all the time from customers looking for different products.  Most of the time, you would lead the customers to where those products were located.  Pulling liquor out of the cage was the most stressful part of the job, as the customers in that area of the store tended to get fussy and impatient.  I remember one particular day when there were seven people waiting for assistance at the liquor cage.  I wasn't allowed to use a shopping cart to get everybody's requested drinks, so I had to carry a few at a time to the register where they would be waiting for the customers at the end of their visit.  Because I could only carry  few at a time, some customers would get angry if you didn't take their selection on your first trip.  This resulted in a few instances of customer abuse when they followed me to the registers and yelled at me the entire time.  I once threatened to return said customer's selection to the cage and refuse to sell it to them.  Overall, Walmart is a decent place to work."
good,Walmart is a fun place to work at. It allow you to enjoy your day by doing your job and being involved wit the customers. They provide good pay along with benefits
good,Too much work load and you have to work according to there schedule and then the behaviour of management they want you to do everything. Per hour wage starts from $11 and there are three bonus in the year which depends on store sales in the fiscal year. They have good paid time off.
good,"My last manager did not let anyone take any time off. or vacation , sick time.she was a terrible manager only thinking of her self, she had all her management team working 18 hours a day 6 days a week for 4 months. your body gets tired and she didnt under stand, I was let go after 23 years with the company"
good,"at walmart you must be cross trained because you never know what you will be assigned."
good,"Good people to work with. Stressful environment.  No consistency with management and too much favortism. Benefits are good not the best, but good. Full time but not always given full time hours and no overtime!"
good,Busy. I have learned more then I knew when I first started. Some of the management could use more people skills. The hardest part is trying to get help when you need it.The most enjoyable part is helping people.
good,A typical day at work was coming in and getting straight to work I learned a lot of management sucked the work environment was chill because I had my homies hardest part was the other staff judging me most enjoyable was the pay.
good,"Associates are willing to help others with job tasks."
good,"This job was only bearable because of the people you worked with, the insurance was good and so was a discount. If none of that was offered they'd be a awful company to work for"
good,"I worked in the pet department.  A typical day for me meant cleaning out the fish tanks, counting the dead fish and documenting the count, and removing the dead fish with a net.  I also organized (zoned) the pet department, stocked the shelves, and occasionally was called back to grocery receiving to downstack trucks and pull pallets to the sales floor for the graveyard shift later.  The downstacking and pallet pulling proved damaging to my back.  I should have reported this injury, because it actually impaired my walking.  I was later diagnosed with sciatica caused by muscle spasms.  If you do any work with the freight, be careful not to hurt yourself, and don't get cocky.  Also, make sure you use one of the ""good"" pallets, as some do not have effective hydraulics and will drop as soon as you raise them."
good,politica de trabalho difícil porem um local agradável de trabalho
good,"great company to work for, but some of the people within the corporate make a bad name for the company. The company has changed tremendously and for the better. Company has provided training for hourly supervisors which is amazing!"
good,The manager never helped. The always put more on you and they were slow when you needed some money. Dress code was fitting. It was steessful sometimes during rush hours
good,"I had a work family there, they taught me and helped me learn new things at work and about life! They were there for me at work and outside of work and I loved that I was so close to them because it made work so great! I worked so hard to be as smart as the older workers and they helped me try to get there too! I got complemented at least once a day by a worker on either my looks or my work performance the day before. They always somehow made me feel proud and good about myself."
good,"This company has changed alot over the past 10 years going from Family first mindset to Every Dollar counts the hours are demanding there arent many positions that allow you to have a consistant family life and the wage is the same as anywhere else Minimum Wage."
good,"gerência nota 0 ,encarregados péssimo,desrespeito total com o a funcionário,não respeitam a função qual o funcionário foi contratado."
good,I was a sales associate. i worked in the meat department most days specific duties would'nt last long. I worked very few hours and I was'nt enough to stay working there.
good,You have to be strong working in Walmart . Some locations have better management than others but for the most part it was okay . Its most likely always busy . You will always have something to do and getting to know new people everyday .
good,It was a very busy place to work. especially working in the Toy Department during Christmas. The company has more managers than they do employees. And they do not have enough people to run a department during the busy times. The Photo Lab was fun processing pictures.
good,There isn't anything really spectacular to say about Walmart. You get a discount if you work there and don't have to make an extra stop on the way home if you need something.
good,ok to work for but no benefits unless you are full time and have worked there a year or more. also customers are sometimes rude and cant understand why you cannot match another stores prices.
good,great job for those looking to build experience and learn new things. you will learn great problem solving skills and how to deal with multiple situations that will need you to think fast. everyone really becomes a family and that makes it the hardest part to leave.
good,I wouldn't say that Walmart is a bad place to work it is just that you have to have a strong mind and will to deal with everyone in and around you through all the motions
good,For the most part i liked working for Walmart but the things i didn't like was they would give me any hours to work and it wouldn't fit with my agenda. but the pay was good.
good,"Management are awesome, people you work with are great, but they work you to hard for what you get paid, the new way of working cut peoples hours back"
good,Long hours but good pay . The time went by very fast and the work was easy and repetitive. The hours were long and the managers were helpful and caring
good,"Working there is good, it is super busy though and you are always short handed. "
good,working at Walmart i would use the register cash to customers be friendly and courteous to customers and fellow employees i would also stock in different departments in the store it was an okay job
good,"This was a great place to make good money"
good,Walmart's a great company to work for there was a lot of good times that you can learn an advance yourself as a individual and as a member of the community Not only was their ways inside of Walmart but those ways that Walmart did charity events and stuff like that but also you could Advance yourself up the corporate ladder if you wanted to devote yourself
good,"Good working environment, good management and coworkers, busy, steady work so it's never boring and there's no time to stand around. Fast paced, good number of breaks during the shfit."
good,"A full week of video instruction before actually starting the job, and the videos were not accurate enough to the workplace. They also attempted to pump you full of walmart propaganda. The actual job was pretty good, stocking was my favorite activity but zoning was ok too."
good,"The work at Walmart is very fast paced, standing on your feet all day. You need to be able to adapt to different situations. There will be good days and bad days."
good,"I enjoyed that the people above the store manager were so hands on with the associates, but I felt like the management team was always at odds with one another and that made my experience poor."
good,"Was not my dream job anyway, and really require long standing and carry heavy merchandise. because i work at the LTE and sorting good and hardware and land and garden departments."
good,It wasn't that is was all that bad just had a new manager all the time and rules changed a lot. And overnight was hard to have a life to move around and get out to do things.
good,Sometimes a good place to work.  Other times the management couldn't agree on work priorities. The pay was lower than I thought it should be after working there over a year and a half.
good,"I was a customer service manager , the job allowed me to work with several people of all nationalities and it was fun the customers were nice and the staff I managed were respectful."
good,This job was a reasonable job for a part time job.  Working retail you have to provide customer service with a smile.  As long as you did your job and kept your area clean and organized you would be okay.
good,It was a ok job for me. I liked the job its self but the mangers we had didn't do there job. and I was let go after 6 months because i had gallbladder surgery.
good,"WalMart is ok to work for, however in a management roll expectations of what to accomplish were unreasonable most of the time. Constant change in process made it hard to get work done."
good,Walmart is your typical retail position.  The hours were rotating and flexible.  The pay was not much more then minimum wage.  Overall if you like working retail its not a bad place to work.
good,This is a job that requires a commitment that most cannot give long term.  This company has changed dramatically over the years and no longer embodies the culture once seen as the driving force behind it. Realistically they have had to change to keep up with market demands. As a member of management you will be on call 24/7 regardless of your schedule or family commitments. They will expect to be your top priority and will accept nothing less.
good,"Basic retail of restocking shelves, ordering items, and providing customer service. Job itself was relatively easy but cons do include differing instructions from upper management."
good,only reason I could only not like about walmart is because the manager an I didnt get along. i couldn't let her treat me the way she did and no one else did anything to fix it.
good,Ran backroom loading and unloading dock during my shift. Unload trucks and sort merchandise and grocery. Stock grocery to shelves for customers. Work with computer to monitor the cap 2 staff and how long it takes to unload and stock selves
good,"O gerente não tem respeito, é  tarado,administração praticamente que manda, proterem quem precisa e condenam quem não favorecem!"
good,"Sometimes this job was very stressful, but at the end of the day I was happy with myself. I got the chance to help people by answering questions. That is one thing I really enjoy."
good,"I like that we get raises and bonuses. The pay is good. I don’t lik that I don’t have a set schedule and the managers I’m under never want to help. They break rules set by corporate or district managers all the time and then do the right thing when they come in. You can never get a manager to come to you within a reasonable amount of time. Love that we get two breaks and an hour lunch, but without a set schedule you almost never know when they’re going to be or if they will be on time. Hard to have a social life outside of work at all because you always work crazy hours and sometimes I have to work until 11pm and come back in the next day at 7am so I get no sleep."
good,"Honestly, Walmart is a great company to work for but if you don't enjoy retail it will destroy you. A lot is expected of you if you work hard and nothing is expected if you don't causing a very difficult burden to carry on all but the least effective associates. Your experience with Walmart will be entirely determined by 2 things. Your feelings about the industry itself and the quality of your store management. If you work for a store with quality management and/or enjoy retail this is great. If either of those aren't true it's only acceptable. If neither are there it is a pretty tough haul."
good,working at walmart as an overnight stocker was very slow and long i loved it though because it didn't require any supervision every hour  of the night.
good,"Walmart was a good company to work for except for the work life balance."
good,"I did love doing my job at Wal-Mart. I loved staying busy and helping customer. The hard work didn't bother me,mit was part of the job. For some reason, because I was happy and customers enjoyed my help, it didn't seem ""good enough"". It was a complete shock to be let go,as it was to everyone I worked with and all the customers that came in the store. I still do not understand it, but I cannot let this affect my positive look on life. This is just another challenge I am faced woth, one that will make me stronger and a better person for a better company that I will work for."
good,Walmart gives discounts to all employees including a discount on Sam's club membership. The associates are great but the management isn't good. Advancement is there just don't be late and don't miss work.
good,"I worked as an over night shelf stocker, I liked my manager, and my coworkers. Walmart Neighborhood Market was a good place for me to work at and get my hours in."
good,"Management seem to only promote those they are friends with and will purposefully keep a good employee in the same position for years without promoting, even after promises of promotions. They will keep you waiting."
good,"I loved working at Walmart.  I helped with setting up the store, that was fun and a great learning experience.  once the store was open I believe things would have been better if we got more training."
good,"sales and customer service is the main goal."
good,"A day at Walmart will either be busy or quite slow. I worked in jewelry so i often have to react with people, pierce ears, recommend products, and display great customer service. Management could be better on how they deal with certain situations as far as with customers"
good,"I have been with walmart for about four years now.  It is a great place to work while getting out of high school, waiting for your full time career to take off."
good,"When I applied at Walmart I knew that it would be a temporary job. I never intended to stay there longer than a year. But I did leave earlier than I had originally expected, due to the fact that the HR ladies treated me very poorly when I went in to apply for a leave of absence. I would say that a typical day at Walmart was moderate. Tasks were challenging but manageable."
good,the best part of the job was helping customers find everything they needed and to be able to make sure that you always have a smile on your face and to be able to make someones day a lot better with a single smile
good,"The job could get stressful at times, but would balance back out with a relaxed shift later in the week. Management sometimes could make you feel undesirable if they were having it bad also, however, the associates created a family bond with one another."
good,"The job there isn't that bad, it's the people and the the coworkers and the management that are bad. they're two faced and cannot be trusted. Once in a while you can get some people that are worth the breath but most, just aren't."
good,The pay there was good and the treated us well with bonuses and discounts but the management was not good a lot of the managers were very rude and did not care about what you thought and would throw you under the buss as soon as they got the chance
good,Working at Walmart was a good experience for me because I was able to learn about good customer service. I also stocked the shelves and assisted on the register when needed. I think that Walmart is a great starter job for anyone looking for their first job. It is sort of fast-paced so it has the potential to be overwhelming at first but once you are able to get into the swing of things it's not so bad and can even be enjoyable.
good,"Okay work, depends on your department. the job its self is not hard, but the managers over work you and send you to departments that arent yours as well as show favoritism with i strongly dislike in a company. if you are there for a paycheck then its a good job."
good,My coworkers made the job fun and made the day go faster. Management was good at times. Customers were good most of the time but in retail you can never always have great people.
good,Long hours with managers that care more about what is on paper then making sure that there employees have the tools that they need to accomplish the job that they have been given even when this mean telling them to circumvent safety protocols.
good,"A typical day was stocking and cleaning.. Making sure shelfs and cases were neat, Dealing with customers on a daily basis. the management was ok . it was hard to get them to switch shifts in system or change in system when they approved it. most enjoyable part of my job was getting to interact with all the customers"
good,The actual job itself is not bad. They do NOT promote within the actual company but hire outsiders that do not know what they’re doing. The managers do not care about you. They will not hesitate to tell you you are just a number.
good,"The assistant manager role is one of the most high stress jobs within the company. The hours are very long and the expectations are very high. This is balanced out by the pay, which is fairly high."
good,A typical workday was very fast paced depending on the area that you worked in. The hardest part of the job was when you had a 2 truck night and the only person working in your area. But I would surely go back there and work again.
good,"Working as a cashier for Walmart isn't always bad, but I've yet to see a good side to it. Breaks were inconsistent-- sometimes I was an hour late for my break. The hours were also hella inconsistent too."
good,"Reorganized shelves, stocked shelves, returned items to customer service if belonged in different part of store. Cleaned general area, and assisted customers on finding items they were looking for."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart as a Cap 2 was a pretty descent job. My complaints were they did not offer enough compensation or benefits to their employees, it made it very difficult to survive off of a $9.50 hourly wage and no medical benefits."
good,"I went there for the job fair, and after the interview, they called me before I even got home and left a message saying that they want to set a drug test up for me, so that they could give me a date for orientation. I started off working there as a cashier, and after my 90-day probation, I got promoted to Customer Service Representative. This was my first real job that I had, and I worked there for a year and a half, up until I quit to go to school."
good,Walmart was a good job for the most part but some of the managers have a bad time communicating properly with associates and it comes off a bit disrespectful.
good,"I enjoyed the community Walmart had and it was a very relaxing atmosphere even though we did quick work. as a CAP 2 associate my duties were unloading the truck almost all days and stock shelves and other miscellaneous tasks, didn't have a supervisor for the first few weeks so things were done worst but became better when we received one. they only allow 3 sick days in the first 6 months which is a little much but it is a fine job through and through."
good,"Boa para trabalhar porem falta oportunidades, gerência boa trabalho em equipe."
good,For the most part management was awful and did not listen to any concerns of their employees. Associates rely on each other to complete tasks in an otherwise fun work environment.
good,There was never time to spare and you always had something to do. I like how they give you a main task to do but when you finish you still have more things to do.
good,"Walmart was definitely a great experience I learned a lot of things from my conworkers,trainers and managers . My time at Walmart was very enjoyable,educational and pushed me more to love customer service  ."
good,It was a good employer. I enjoyed my time there as I worked there. I was able to gain knowledge on various task and how to organize according to business needs.
good,They start you off with part time at this location some days are busier then the next. 1$ raise after three months. The pay is ok if you don't really have any bills. A lot of the customers who do shop here feel entitled and can be rude and nasty because they feel like we're beneath them. Some of the supervisors are just messy but as long as you do what you're supposed to do their should be no problems.
good,"fácil localização, colegas dedicados, empresa boa."
good,"Good place to work, but management doesnt fully do there jobs they do the minimum and blame the lower associates, the group of people that i worked with disagreed alot and was really lazy about customer service, took longer breaks then scheduled, no communitcation between techs about what has been done on what and what is left to be done, not to many people would clean or finish jobs they would walk off and nothing would ever get done to people that break the rules and you see special treatment to certain people and its very obvious."
good,"staying busy, always something to do. good chances to advance in management. not much on raises. Meetings daily to tell how the company is doing and what to do to make things better"
good,"Fast pace, high demand customer service based job. Follow up is key to success in Wal-mart. You are given task to complete on a daily bases through Walmart BYOD system and associate engagement on a daily basis"
good,Jumped around departments a lot could not find my place within this company. found lots of task very easy and also unnecesary. Enjoyed being able to swtich departments
good,This could be a great company to work for if corporate Walmart would understand what is actually like to worfk in a store. Not enough staff to accomplish anything. As of late it seems as though no one's job is safe.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, as far as the people I worked with,but it was a difficult place to work for. I still have friends that I met while working there. The schedule is hectic and erratic. One day you may work 10am-7pm and the next work 5am-2pm. Some days I worked 2pm-11pm and had to be back at 6am. There is little time to rest or keep up with a personal life. Your days off are never back to back. It is a young persons job or at least should be."
good,"work place is good and friendly, but scheduling can very erratic and hours are not always fulltime. I did enjoy meeting and talking with most of the customers."
good,"Typical day at work was coming in opening up my department get things ready and start helping out customers."
good,I absolutely hated my particular Walmart. We dealt with not the best customers so that played a part in my opinion of it. They often gave you more hours than you were available and worked you every single day that could. It was good because paychecks were great but being a college student it was hard and took a toll on my education. Management was ok for the most part. They had favorites and often felt stand-offish at times. The co-workers in my department were great.
good,a normal day at work consists of me having to restock shelves or helping customers find items or answering their questions. Management doesn't set enough employees around the areas so customers come to my department and want me to know where things are in other departments which i don't work at or have no knowledge such as makeup.
good,"As long as you complete your daily task, there is no pressure, tension, or negative atmosphere. Support from co-workers, mutual help to accomplish daily labor protocol."
good,management is horrible they do not care for their employers as they should .There are some unfair things that occur there. Nobody is consisitant and they expect you to do for tor them but they will not do for you.
good,"Typical day was mellow to start. Stocking merchandise, cleaning the department and answering the phone. I did get to learn electronics, photo and  the cell phone departments. The photo and cell departments were to most interesting and rewarding. You also got to work with the different vendors/ sale reps. Working with so many different associates was great. The management when I worked there was very poor. Most managers were very hands off and unrealistic about certain tasks. Management looked out for management and no one else. The hardest part was working 3 department solo and being asked to cashier up front while being paged  back to your department because no one else knew how to work them, including management."
good,nothing to tell. a job is a job. you work and go home then do it all over again. that is it. nothing to tell. walmart is a good place to work for your first time
good,"They over work they employees , but don't pay them fairly. if you need a starter job to gain experience its a good place. The discount card comes in handy. The breaks are good"
good,"This place was overall a good place to work. I enjoyed the environment, although a little chaotic. It can be fun, if you can handle it. The people you work with and work for can make the difference."
good,We were never on a set schedule or set location of where we would be working. Everything would change from one shift to the  next. I was constantly  moved around while others were not.
good,"I enjoyed the store but the Distribution Center was a little much. I worked on average about 18 to 20 hour days and extra days outside my schedule. I learned a lot the work experience was great but the expectations were unrealistic. The culture was not manager friendly in my opinion, managers were expected to take abuse and like it because of the pay. Respect is one of the Basic beliefs but was not practiced. The hardest part of the job was the work and family time.(too many long hours) I enjoyed the customers and employees."
good,I felt as though I was constantly drowning in work.  at least that meant my days went quickly because I never stopped working.  despite having my own set of daily jobs needing my attention I was constantly being called up to help cashier due to high customer volume.  which means my individual tasks were rarely completed.
good,Walmart overall is a very nice company to work for. Tasks vary from time to time depending on your position. However advancement in the company is not very likely.
good,"Management is strict at times but also understanding when emergencies come up, also the pay is good for a part time job. Typically between 32-40 for full time employees."
good,"A typical work day at Walmart would include clocking in, waiting on a manager to tell me exactly what i would be doing for the day, checking out customers and helping them with anything they needed help with."
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for but there are no sick days and people do get sick..  They should take notice peoples work and how they conduct themselfwith people. They should give associates praise when jobs well done, A kind word would go a long way."
good,"lots of different jobs you can do, opportunities to move up, 2 15 min breaks and 1 one hour lunch depending on the shift, nice coworkers, depending on the walmart good communication"
good,New manager brought lots of employees from his previous store.  Felt the need to be back in corporate world making more money.  Children grew up so i didnt need to be close to home.
good,"good if you are flexible with hours. I lived an hour away and was attending school. the hours consistently were in the way of furthering my education, or when the schedule was changed, I was not informed to make it to work on time. Walmart itself is a great company to work for. but management was difficult to deal with while attending school."
good,"Don't expect a lot of hours, mangers are not to friendly. They do give you chances to move up in the company but part time employees really get treated poorly."
good,"Its a good place to work.  The people are awesome but there isnt a lot of opportunities to move up, or become full time.  Difficult to make a living on part time hours."
good,muy bien ambiente laboral ademas de que fue mi primer empleo formal
good,"Multi-tasking, assisting (10)cashiers with schedules breaks and lunches. Fulfilling cash request, resolving customers issues, price adjustments for multiple individuals. The most difficult is not having the correct number of staff. But I enjoy people and the social aspect of the environment."
good,"Tiene buen ambiente laboral, estabilidad laboral y buenas prestaciones."
good,"I work at a Walmart DC in Ga "
good,Facilidad para trtar con todo tipo de personas asi como la abilidad de trabajo en equipo y hacer ls cosas bien la primera vez y cada vez
good,A simple job made hard by the amount of work asked to do outside of your job description. On a daily basis asked to do the managers job while they do nothing and take all credit for the work done.
good,me parece un buen trabajo con un ambiente de trabajo agradable
good,Management was horrible when it came to scheduling and showing favoritism to certain employees. Not exactly a “fair” work environment. You could work 100% all in but the favored people will still be the only ones who are looked at in any positive way.
good,Fun  place they gave me a job when I needed it . Walmart paycheck paid some of my little bills . It's a great start if you never had a job . You will learn the ropes of the department you work in
good,It can be a hard store to work for. Some days the managers give you tasks and sometimes they can be hard to complete. Management watch and make sure you know what your doing.
good,"Monitored cash, debit, credit card transactions. Helped customers if they had any questions. Fixed and maintained putting merchandise onto the shelves and end caps."
good,"Good company to work for the management just sucks. They dont know how to talk to employees and sometimes just comes off like their ""better"". God growth opportunity tho just dont be like the rest if u do get promoted"
good,"I took a job at Walmart due to proximity to my home.  Started there as alternative to staying at home after loosing my wife to breast cancer.  A way to get out and meet new people."
good,"When I made the mistake I made 8 years ago, they harassed me for 2 hours over it accusing me of other things that never happened, and could not proove."
good,had a problem with inaccurate scheduling and unable to obtain .fairness from managers. I did like the fact that it was fast paced and I enjoyed the customer contact
good,"I showed up got my assigned cash register or self check out position, and got to work. management for the most part was good. the work place culture was friendly but a high stress level environment and was very busy. the best part of my job was the employees I made friends with."
good,"Not  a bad place to work if you're liked by every single manager in that place. If not, prepare to be ridiculed daily for doing your job perfectly fine and prepare to try to be fired for no reason at all."
good,"Overnight stocking is probably the easiest job Walmart has to offer. Can be stressful sometimes due to amount of freight but there is always plenty of other employees to help out. Some of the managers are great, others not so much. Most co-workers were very easy to get along with and make the job slightly more enjoyable."
good,"It was always hurry, hurry. A job to hold you over until you find better employment. Seniority has no bearing, and everyone is expendable if you do not work fast enough to meet managements designated work times."
good,Job that is never the same every day. People pulled to work in areas that are not theirs. Job ambiguity for some workers. Lack of equip and personnel.
good,I actually enjoy my job as a cashier at Walmart. I enjoy the interaction with my co-workers and my customers. I love staying busy and enjoy the chaos that comes with working there. Even tho I am looking for another job I still plan to keep this one a night or two a week. The hardest part of my job is just the insecurity of not knowing if I am going to get enough hours each week. I may work 9 hours one week and 34 of more the next. I cant live on a job like that.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was okay. There were good days, and then there was bad days. It was a typical workplace when it comes to retail jobs. You just have to hope you do not get the most difficult customers. The management was not the greatest, but I am sure they are trying to improve."
good,"I enjoyed the job, but overall I found my time there to be unproductive. I did not see much as far as creativity or individuality within the workplace."
good,Typical day of work includes harassment from customers and management that have no clue on how things work. Most enjoyable part is decent pay and benefits and mostly good coworkers.
good,Fun place to work and meet new friends. Management wasn't the best but they tried. I never got my benefits because i never applied for them. Would've applied if they actually would've let me know when applications were being filled.
good,"Pushed carts, and helped load heavy items into customer vehicles, this was the job. Relaxed and laid back place to work.Being outside was the only slightly inconvenient aspect of the job."
good,It was alright for the most part. The managers really become your friends and you can joke around with them. Getting along with people and making friends were a breeze.
good,Good pharm manager. Good amount of help when fully staffed. Much better comp than CVS or Walgreens. Good shifts are hard to come by. Up to date less primitive software than cvs.
good,I feel they tell you what you want to hear i did learn how to manage people and have integrity and great work ethics.and average day is fast paced and challenging
good,A typical day was checking out customers. It was not a very relaced place to work. I did learn how to be patient. Depends on who you are as to how far you will advance.
good,"I show up for work, asigned an area,cigarette dept., cashier, or fast check out.  Never know where I will be working.  I had computer courses on customer service & safety.  All employees are required to complete the computer generated courses for the company.  These courses cover just about any thing that could come up as far as safety issues, work problems such as transactions that could come up.  I found the variety of work was fun.   The hardest part of the job was the change of work hours.  Changing from early morning shift to a later shift getting off at 8 or 9 p.m.  Over all working for Wal-Mart is fun.  Working with co-workers and the great variety of customers we get."
good,Good place to work associates are generally friendly my only issue was it seemed unless you were close with certain managers you never moved up in the company.
good,"I personally loved working for walmart and being so interactive with the public. As a deli associate, i was always meeting new people and providing excellent service. Although this job was nit perminant for me,  if i were offered management i may have considered long tern with the company."
good,When I first started at Walmart I really liked it. I worked as a cart associate and in the winter it was cold out. If you put the days you need off ahead of time you are good. But if you are sick and have a doctors note they are not always considerate.
good,"Wal-Mart in Troy Alabama would be a great place to work if they had management that cared for their employees, and a manager that would stand up to his management team."
good,It was great at first then super management changed and values did as well. There is no work life balance and daily respect for the individual is lost.
good,"fast paced, structured environment. work with a variety of different situations thru out the day. It is hard to work with others that are not team players. Management is assertive and direct, sometimes take awhile to get things done, but overall good to work with."
good,Walmart really isn't that bad of a place to work depending on which one you work at. The Reynoldsburg location is one such place. Management was not the best as some managers were incompetent and the others were. Always seemed to over order practically everything making the workdays rather stressful if you were the only one in that section with 12 pallets of work to do but besides all that they tried to care for you.
good,if you love retail i recommend this job to you. All day with customers and assisting the ones that demand for help will cause your day to be stressful. overall a decent place to work.
good,"Very fast paced work environment, co-workers were friendly, management was easy to get along with, somewhat competitive and goal oriented. "
good,Working here was pretty easy and they paid well. Depending on your position depends on your hours. It can get stressful at times but if you're a student its and easy job.
good,Fun place to work.  There are a lot of departments to choose from to work in.  There are various shifts to choose from.  Can get training in the various departments to do the work.
good,If you like a easy job that is really boring this is the job for you. The only thing that is bad about this job is the hours. Management sucks. They're just around for a paycheck. They really don't care about you or the company.
good,Good job love working get to meet new peoplw custoners an employee.. Get good hours .fun job .......... Awesome store management friendly work place all around cool place
good,While when I started in 2002 it was a very favorable job lately it has become much more stressful and a lot of change in operational matters.It's still a very good job but I'm also looking for something a little more local.
good,"Not a bad place to work, definitely not for everyone. The environment can be fun and laid back at times but when its the holiday season do not get too comfortable it becomes very demanding."
good,it's a slow and relaxing environment as long as you do your best. most of the staff is relaxing and understanding with the schedules. just an okay environment to work in
good,i enjoy working with new cashiers but the turnover rate for walmart is ridiculously high and they don't seem to keep cashiers for long periods of time.
good,"I have no words.. word are hard."
good,"Work was good when enough help was provided."
good,The job is good an easy but selling phones at a Walmart can be boring. The clinettell that you serve her is not very good. And the commission structure could be a lot better
good,In the New York metropolitan area Wal-Mart was opening up a store specializing in groceries. In order for it to be a success there weren't any real fixed rules  but more of an experimental stage to get it off the ground after four years the store is operational and hopefully will continue to serve the community
good,I really don't have much to say but working at Walmart it's a job and they will work you. I hated they point system to me it sucks but in all it ok job.
good,Walmart is a great place to work.You work hard for your your money and feel good about your shift put in. An excellent place to work. Negatives hard to get a shift with less than 5 days a week. Asking for time off will not be tolerated .Excellent training
good,"Bom. Trabalhei a quase 5 anos na empresa Walmart. Me tornei um HOMEM trabalhando nesta empresa maravilhosa. Mais a gestão da empresa não deixou me crescer por motivos fúteis. A gerência só observa aqueles que querem ver. Integridade, cultura e Etc não entram no Walmart. Isso foi um dos motivos em que sair"
good,"They were more known for write ups, suspensions, terminations and false promises, then promotions and pay raises. At the store I worked at, the managers were known for putting off promotions then giving them."
good,IT was a nice environment to work at just faced pace and got to be able to do the job i would do the job again it a real good experience to learn and to be able to put your skills to use
good,It's okay for a first job i dont see it in my future. the co workers are great the people i love its the stress of the job of doing other people work when i dont get paid for it is whats killing me and need a little bit more of a pay
good,Its an okay place to work. I worked at the self-checkout as a host. Hours are not very flexible if you don't specify the hours in your application. Very hard to have a life outside of work.
good,"always busy, always on our feet. takes an incredibly patient person to deal with customers. their satisfaction makes me satisfied. each day is a learning experience"
good,"Right now they are going through an upgrade, but cutting hours way too much. Not enough pay for the line of work I do. No benefits until 1 yr of work."
good,"Alot of favoritism,  have to be on managers good side to be able to get a day off. Alot of hours cut,  bit still hired more associates knowing not enough hours for current associates."
good,Prepared to sell and clean and talk to many people everyday. Fun environment when you work with friends at work and talk when its not as busy. Always on your feet can be hard for the first couple of days but i got used to it and felt like I can run marathons.
good,I loved working for Wal-Mart. But it was frustraiting at times because management does not communicate to one another the progress of given tasks efficiently. Also you always have your days off split. So no time for family.
good,"It was an ok experience.  I made good friends. Learned a few things, like responsibility. How too handle money. I did not like the way they they fired me, could have been more professional."
good,Es poco la paga en comparacion con la carga de trabajo
good,"Walmart is a great company I'm proud to work for - they practice what they preach (saving people money so they can live better) and they do a lot of work for charity."
good,"Walmart isn't a bad place overall but they do not accept doctors notes if you or your kids are sick so you will get pointed for that "
good,"Clocking in, I would immediately begin working. I would often help down-stack the truck, work carts, and cull."
good,"No geral uma boa empresa para se trabalhar um tempo. O pessoal é bem amigo e a gerencia, parceira. Deixa a desejar o almoço servido pelo restaurante da empresa e o RH só tem (salvo exceções) gente incompetente."
good,Unloading freight and stocking shelves. Work is steady and fairly easy. Hours are rough as I am overnight. Hardest part is not having a freight truck on some nights.
good,"The store level crew can make it or break it, overall the company is so-so. They are strongly anti-union, and often try to push you as close to full time as they can,all the while keeping you just under, so they can avoid giving you benefits. So if you are looking for a job with benefits, I recommend looking elsewhere. Unless you are looking for a management position. Of the two locations I worked at, the first one was one of the older, smaller stores, and had a much nicer ... family feel, everyone tended to look out for each other. The second was a supercenter and it was understaffed, at time leading to a single overnight stocker working an entire department by herself."
good,The traditional family culture of Walmart is being replaced by a more cut throat culture. Still a wonderful company. HR is not very supportive. Company is innovative and executes very well.
good,It's an okay place to work. They pay better than most businesses in our area and you have a chance to move around in the company. It is as good as any job.
good,"A typical day at Walmart was usually different everyday, I never knew if I was going to be at the fitting room, re-stocking shelves, or unloading the trucks and bringing the pallets to the floor, but what I did learn while I was there was to be a good, hard worker and do your best for the satisfaction of the customer."
good,"The work at Wal-Mart is fast paced and for me pretty worth while, however you are usually left hanging in the wind by managers and so many of your co-workers are tired and dislike working there so they are there to help you out when you first start so you are usually left to fend for yourself. The customers are usually alright however you can get the awful ones quite often easily getting you in trouble if you don't give them exactly what they want. As I often like to say to new people this job is not easy but it is pretty simple, but if you like working hard and enjoy seeing a good job accomplished then Wal-Mart is the job for you."
good,Muy buen ambiente laboral ..solo el cambio de administracion no me gusto ya que no todos trabajan a la par y de la misma manera...
good,"Management kept scheduling me on a day I explained I wasnt available to work. Which i feel is very unfair to me. I liked the job I just couldn't work Sunday's after 7pm, but yet they continued to schedule me on Sundays til 10pm."
good,"Nothing much to say all of what I can about Walmart is throughout this whole review, it's simple pay, tough hour's, they were not flexible even though I lived far from work"
good,"I love the task that I was giving, meaning I didn't know if I was going to have a laid back day or intense day and that's what I loved. The manager was very good and understanding."
good,Management needs Improvement Their are a few good ones but a few terrible ones but such is life I wish that the hours of when day shift worked was more steady so i could get a second job but its so up and down its hard to work any job but there but over all its a good company to work for and good money if you stay with it long enough
good,They need better managers it is really hectick on weekends and everything would be out of control they didn't believe I was in school when I told them because there was certain days I couldn't go cause of school the managers thought I was lying
good,"El ambiente es malo, hay mucho favoritismo no hay igualdad para los empleados, el servicio y comedor es pésimo ya que de los 40 minutos que tienes de comida en el sistema de comedor tardas más de 25 en solo pagar y aún falta adquirir y comer."
good,They only give you about 25 hours a week if youre lucky to get that... Some managers are a** and like sit around and do nothing while other people do their job and then complain when you you go over on your time..
good,"not bad for a first job, the management is very poor when I went for my first day I wasn't exactly told all that to do and wasn't happy with that. the most enjoyable part of the job is helping people with stuff"
good,Walmart would be a better place if they treat their employees right they made respect employees listen to their concerns not reject them and listen to the employees when they tell them going around the store
good,"A typical day at Walmart is full of a nice staff, people that are ready to do their job and enjoy interacting with others. I did not like the fact we were constantly understaffed."
good,I have learned a lot at Walmart they do a lot of donations which is nice..I guess ive learned how to handle stressful situations since working at customer Service.
good,There is no such thing as balance. I usually work six days a week and always more than 12-14 hours a day. Never time off. Always working to meet the unrealistic expectations of higher management.
good,"The coworkers are kind, helpful and we try to help each other as much as possible. We love working with people. I learned that I liked teaching the new  coworkers."
good,There was always something to do. I love the people that came to shop at the store really don't have to much to say beside the management team was not on the same page did not communicate well with the employees
good,If it wasn't for the employees and my assistant manager and the not great but decent pay I would leave. I wish I was allowed to be more creative and we had displays to display the talent of the decorators and wedding cake skills.
good,I worked with Wal-Mart through a temp agency so I didn't get the Wal-Mart benefits and I didn't get the Wal-Mart salary but I enjoyed my job and I enjoyed the staff I was working with.
good,Es una muy buena empresa el problema es el tipo de personas que ponen en los puestos gerenciales que no les enseñan el trato jefe subordinado y el respeto ya que son muy prepotentes con los empleados yy aveses humillantes
good,"Your jobs functions are the same everyday, they only thing that changes is customers. Different customers different needs."
good,a typical day at work was like get on the register. the first customer will make or break your day. im serious. it goes back really fast though. good breaks and stuff.
good,Too much favoritism. They don't give everyone a chance to advance. However paid time off benefits and discounts are great. You need thick skin in order to make it.
good,Loved working in customer service and taking time to hear my customers needs. Enjoyed getting compliments on the exceptional customer service I provided.
good,"Walmart provides several different working positions. Each position has it's own tasks, but every employee has a priority they must satisfy the customers."
good,"It is a constantly  changing a developing environment. Which can be nice to keep up with the ever evolving retail industry. However every manager i have worked with picks and chooses which policies they wish to follow, with a lack for holding the appropriate people accountable."
good,"I did not work directly for Walmart, I was hired as the manager by the physician in the eye center. Being the manager for the Dr. meant I had to work closely with the vision center(Walmart employee) Manager and she was wonderful to work with. It was a friendly environment."
good,"Walmart has been a place to work at where the job doesn't demand much, and the work is simple. The overall environment is excellent for students, such as myself, wanting a steady income without impediments from our studies and class schedules."
good,Was a seasonal job but it was great. Work during the holidays. Pay was okay and customers wasn't bad at all. Just wondering where their packages was. Back to back calls most of the day until Christmas time
good,"My experience with working for Wal-Mart was a good one , Great start up job for someone looking to get on their feet until they find something better but Wal-Mart does offer long term employment benefits once you have been there a while."
good,"Loved my coworkers, we had good and bad customers but overall cool place to work while you're young. They take everything serious good and bad problems."
good,When I worked there it was good most of the days and I enjoy doing resets when they wasn't shot handed and had us doing other jobs through out the store
good,Its good working place in terms learning but Work life balance is not possible. Workplace culture is not uniform its regional specific. It provides one an opportunity to work with independence free mind where you can utilize your experience and ideas & enjoy the results.
good,"pretty cool days, managment was lazy, it wasnt hard, it was a calm job good lunch hours plenty of friendly employers many people would leave for better jobs"
good,"Love my job...most people I work with are fun,kind people. Supportive of family situations. Company is always fundraising and donating. The provide luncheons. We have potlucks. Overall happy place"
good,"I loved stocking shelves, it was a great weight loss program for me. Breaks were good. You had to get so much done every night but needed to stop to help customers as well. Fun place to work. You had to work extra time during the week if others needed help, but cut you off at the end of the week as no overtime was allowed."
good,"Um bom lugar pra trabalhar, com bons ambientes, com gestao razoável."
good,"I loved working here, I loved cake decorating, but the management was terrible. There was so much drama between employees that it made going to work awful. My Bakery manager was racist, unprofessional, and unfair. The manager above her, didn't care about her employees, didn't listen at all, spread gossip and rumors, and should never have been a manager. The compensation for a cake decorator is fantastic, especially if you have experience, but that's it. Anyone else is paid minimum wage. My hours for the first two weeks were 45/week and then were cut to 28 a week, and were declining each week because they had given out too much over time and had to make up for it. The drama was the worst part, and the managers made everything 10x worse and played employees against each other. Picture a gladiator arena, with managers in the stands, making employees try to kill each other. That's the work environment."
good,It was a nice experience to get to work with some many different people and interact with some many different customers I enjoyed getting many different pointers and options from my peers around me
good,"You can learn a lot working in retail pharmacy, but may not advance much as a career in a retail setting. You will learn about the different drugs and what they do. And it's great interacting with all the patients."
good,"Placer la marchandise est une journée typique."
good,"Working at Walmart was pretty cool, I worked in jewelry and shoes. also apparel basically helped maintain my area and keep it sanitary, counted and shelved new items, ran register and assisted customers with needs."
good,"WalMart can be stressful but overall there is proper structure. the management is good however I am not fond of the culture. overall, it is a flexible place to work at."
good,"While working here I did enjoy my job, the little I was scheduled. However, they have a STRICT attendance policy. One no-call-no-show, you're gone. Four times after being late, you're done."
good,"Fun times socializing with co workers during breaks and lunch times, no interaction other than with customers during work times. Fast, stressful pace."
good,I worked at walmart for just under 2 years as a sales associate. Hours fluctuated frequently. It was difficult to get days off and there was definitely favoritism between associates and management.
good,"Overall, Walmart is a great place to work. You will learn a lot and it is a fast pace environment because of the evolution of Retail.  My recommendation is to learn as much as possible while there."
good,I like my job I hate to leave yet I do not feel the opportunity to grow my career currently. I love the people I work with I will miss them greatly. For the past 5 years I've had three weekends off. I have over a hundred hours vacation that's almost impossible to take. My husband and I are looking to start a family I know this will include some time off for medical reasons. I don't see this being a positive experience because of the new point system. Eight missed days and you're done.
good,"Not a hard job, very routine. an get really cold being in the freezer. Coworkers and management were helpful. Offered good hours, flexible with hours also."
good,Walmart was a wonderful place to work specially if your A person that moves around constantly. The work is fair and pay is fair for the job type. Great experience overall
good,"Working environment is fast paced. Never a dull moment when coming into work. I get asked questions as soon as I walk in the front doors.  I loved the atmosphere , and the friendly workers and co workers you are with most of the time. Their is always room to grow and everyday you learn something new which I love. I am a fast learner so I got moved around the store until I knew , pretty much the whole store, even the office work too ."
good,Muy buena empresa si empiezas en un buen puesto pero si no! Cuidado
good,"Management need to get in touch with staff a little bit more, and whichever area they are running they should know something about."
good,"They require part-time employee to work every weekend whether it's Saturday or Sunday. it would be good to get every weekend off as a part time employee. Especially, Saturdays because of religious reasons."
good,"If you are young and inexperience you will be paid more than someone older and experienced. Older gets bad hours and shifts,older gets you working every weekend and holiday"
good,as you would expect the culture and job security are poor . good for young people who are in school or a second job they hire for all shifts and part time .
good,Permis de travailler avec les clients et le travail d'équipe sont essentiels donc j'ai bien aimé cette dynamique
good,"I liked working at Walmart. The opportunity is there for advancement , but it seems you have to be there years to get paid what you want . And insurance as well. The management team is great and they do their best to work with you and fit your schedule needs"
good,"I liked how much I was getting paid wish I had more hours and management could have been better. No way to get promoted without kissing up to management. They don't notice hard work they only care if you get done, give you a lot of work on top of that and expect you to be finished by you leave. Letting others get away with long breaks and other things they're not supposed to be doing."
good,"There wasnt a general manager,They wouldnt Be honest and Keep Staff. Management Was ran by anybody who could fill the position fast enough just bad..."
good,I work overnights and the only problem I have with this company is the staffing. Otherwise I like the people I work with and the job is not that hard.
good,"14+ years with this company and have seen a great many changes, some for the better and some not. Company recent focus has been more on the bottom line and less on associate engagement and customer service. Associates are the core of the company and many are having trouble navigating these changes."
good,"Cool environment "
good,"I worked at the Walmart in Port Clinton, and it was a fairly decent store to work at. The co-workers and management were friendly and helpful. Otherwise, it's a basic retail job."
good,"If you are going to do retail work then Walmart is the best option, I have had many other retail jobs and Walmart is my favorite. I will say that they should pay much more then they do because they expect a lot from you, and they are not considerate with family emergencies unfortunately. other then that i have no complaints."
good,"The people were very fun to work with here! The work environment was always clean and my coworkers were always friendly. I was attending a school taking some college courses and the work hours was not allowing me to attend my classes. The pay wasn't enough to maintain bills, so this caused me to seek other employment"
good,good pay good people management is newer people underpaid and just don't care about there associates.  you get lots of time off in certain jobs and certain jobs you don't favoritism is huge as is most factories.
good,I was able to move up in the company fairly quickly and was comfortable with the financial opportunities as well. Management did not communicate well between each other which led to many conflict in job assignments. I experienced a few store managers in my career with Walmart and unfortunately many of them were not qualified and had very unprofessional behavior.
good,"Walmart in my opinion is an overall alright place to work. The pay is good and also they work with you when you need time off, or vacation. The management team needs a little bit more of work and better communication."
good,Ambiente muy profesional en el ámbito informático. Con implementan de estándares de desarrollo y seguimiento de proyectos
good,"I Learned A lot Of Leadership At Walmart, Well As Things I Should Watch For Working In A Fast Hiring Environment Like Walmart. Feel Like It's A Good Place To Get That Beginner Management Experience."
good,Working at Wal- Mart you are most of the time working at a quick pace. The managers at the specific store I worked at was very helpful and worked with me on some family problems I had at the time.
good,"The Walmart store that I worked for was a great store. There were some challenging moments with co-workers and managers alike, but problems that were easily navigated."
good,"Good Company to work for if you don't mind playing the politics of the workplace."
good,"When you cashier you must be fast, cheerful and have a good personality.  Now that this not true for most places but it is for me.  The hardest part about the job was having to wait for the boss to tell you when your breaks were and when you could use the bathroom."
good,"If you are young and need a job to get you through college, this is the right place for you. I do not recommend to make a career here. Working here was not the best experience in my life but it got me though college and it was not easy on the body either."
good,depending on what position you are in and who your supervisor is depends on your experience working with the company. I was blessed in working there until the new supervisor started working .after he came into the position not only did I leave the department but others also left leaving the department short staffed.
good,walmart was a great place to work looking fowrad to getting back in there they try to cater to your individual needs as long as  its brought to attention quickly
good,the culture at walmart is great its just the balance of work life and private life gets blurred and you start to feel like a zombie. But its a fun job
good,"Walmart isn't a bad place to work, but it's a very independent job. With that being said if you work there you will pretty much be on your own. They put you on a computer and straight to where you applied, with no ""on the spot"" help."
good,Wasn't impressed with how they treat their employees. Always understaffed and can't keep people because of their inconsiderate to people's needs. If they would hire people and not be understaffed it would be a lot smoother.
good,"The work was never easy, but I like a challenge. The best thing about working for Wal-mart was the benefits. Medical, dental and vision. Plus 10% employee discount. However, I can't stress enough how much I loved customer service. Any way that I can help someone out and make their day better is a success."
good,"Working in the Maintenance Department at the Walmart Distribution Center outside of Cheyenne, WY was nice because of how friendly and respectful the staff is to the people who work there.  They usually take into consideration whether someone has a condition that he/she cannot help and still gives them an opportunity with another job and/or to work with somebody else to get some things taken care of.  Although, sometimes they are a bit too flexible on allowing rules to be broken."
good,"A typical day consists of coming in organizing the shelves, filling perscriptions, answering phones. Dealing with customers, showing customers where merchandise is."
good,"Empresa com uma rotina ágil, dinâmica e sobre pressão"
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart and with the crew I worked with.The hardest part of the job was the impossible amount of time they would give you to do a certain task. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday.
good,"walmart is a great place to work if you dont mind others haveing the same seniority as you no matter how long youve been there..others can come in makeing the same pay..and only be there six months..if i am a good worker..there is no compensation for me..as far as how they treat me..we all get treated the same..which is not right..the hard workers are made to work harder and the slackers are not made to do anything..they work we the good ones to death..and give them the raises..thats not my cup of tea..If im a good worker i do so because i have great work ethic, you arent doing me a favor by letting me work there, IM doing you a favor for being a hard worker.."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced a lot of work to last. I've learned working with Walmart that there are many ways to get things done u just have to use process of elimination."
good,I learned a lot and there was always something to do. It's also not hard to move up within that store location. It was a little hard on my personal life because I had a hard time getting a transfer to a different location because I moved 3 county away. So I spent a lot of times on the train and bus getting to and from work. Other than that I  liked it.
good,8 hour shifts. you either open or close. some technicians carry their own weight others don't do anything at all. if you work hard you are considered just good enough to keep your job.
good,Its was a good after school job that worked with my schedule the people i worked with where great but he management was awful and the change in company culture was not for the better
good,Worked as a Cashier met a lot if nice customers and lots of strange ones Had to work all holidays weekends and it is a part time job The pay was not good either
good,"Wal-Mart is a decent place to work, I personally don't like how management deals with certain problems but it's a great way to get yourself started in life."
good,This is a great job to pass time because time will fly by in an instant. Its a fast paced cashier job for quick hands and a friendly smile. Hour lunch breaks are nice too!
good,Being a cashier at walmart wasn't ideal. It was ok on hours but lack of advancement options. The worst part of the job was being laid along with 6 others to make room for 12 new hires. The best part was when I met new friends and got to help out customers.
good,"walmart never paid me for multiple hours, including my first orientation and all of my training. the training took three weeks, and was a very stressful course."
good,While I had some fun the hours were terrible and not very flexible at all. They had me working just under the amount of hours that would classify me as full time and would entitle me to benefits and more. They refused to hire me as a full time associate in my position even though they were in desperate need of one.
good,I enjoyed the work environment at the TLE and also enjoyed my work but with the pros there were cons as well. It was a great experience for me to learn how to work with customers of the public to solve many situations and disolve conflict with disgruntled customers to find a resolution agreeable for all involved.
good,"Dont get me wrong walmart does pay the bills, but not as well as if hope for the sttess and commitment ive given to the company as a whole. I started put working on the remodel crew anf wprked withput missing more than 3 days for 6 months. Then when i got hired on for working for the store not corporate i found put that even thpugh there were people in my own department making $5+ more than mr an hour i began to get aggravated with the lack of communication across the entire store im still currently employed but pursuant of better openings for my skill set"
good,working for Walmart was a good experience it was fast paced and very busy. the hard part of the job was working majority of the day so wasn't able to spend time with my family.
good,Walmart is a Good company to work for you receive  Training to do your Job flexible hours great benefits Great Co-workers not a lot of Stress to do your Job
good,Can be a good place to work while going to school or furthering your education. They can work flexible with you hours as long as you give proper notice. Like any company proper communication throughout company can be hard. As a whole I would recommend it as a good alternative part time job compared to fast food. With better benefits and more chances to advance if you chose to make a career out of it.
good,"When you have a good assistant manager it is a amazing experience and your workflow is sped up and the quality of service skyrockets. "
good,If you work hard and prove yourself then you have a position that you can retire from. The hours are not set and you will work different shifts. They expect you to stay busy and do your job. The management is usually very easy to deal with. That said you do get a bad one in any company so don't let that bother you.
good,A typical day in as a Walmart manager is very fast paced. Their is a new challenge everyday with the company. The work life balance has drastically changed over the past few years for the worse. They pay management very well but you earn every penny.
good,"I feel that Walmart doesn't take the time to listen to their work associates, untill they are ready to put their two weeks in and leave. I feel management doesn't show initiative to others."
good,"Very good place to work,  works with your schedule,   very good  pay helps people in the time of need,  great managers, great insurance  policies and nice 401k"
good,Poor store manager but department manager and my assistant manager was nice along with the service tech manager. Associates were nice and would help if you needed a hand.
good,"A typical day consisted of performing detailed preventative maintenance of conveyor, systems and Crown powered equipment."
good,It was a great job. they have just taken a lot of benefits away. Also most employees will never be full time. or thats what my manager told me. It is a great starter job
good,"I found Walmart as a whole was a easy place to work, it was simple as long as you did what you're suppose to do."
good,Adorava trabalhar  no Big  apreendi  muitas coisas boas
good,"Walmart enjoyed great success in the early years, when the founders were no longer there there was a dramatic change in the company's view of and treatment of employees."
good,"As an overnight employee of Walmart, I found that I was able to fulfill the obligations of my employment with relative ease. On one level I enjoyed the quiet monotony (at the time), but on another I desired a more fast-paced and changing environment."
good,Its a good job but does not make you feel like your job is safe you will always wonder when will is it going to be your last day working there. Other than that its a pretty good job great benefits and good pay.
good,"Depending on where you work, it's a fairly stress free day. I've transferred through quite a few stores because of college, and what I've found is that most of the similarities are in the amount of rumors and gossip and cliques each store has. If you can avoid that, then Wal-Mart's gonna be a piece of cake. :)"
good,Good place to work but you must be dependable and do your job which is not hard. They do have opportunity  to climb the ladder but you do have to work and deal with customers
good,"Working for Walmart was a good experience but the management team failed in every way possible. There would be times where an assistant manager was needed and they never showed, They would blame their mistakes and failures on the staff lower then them. Some of them were very rude."
good,Empresa boa em algumas partes falta de muito profissionalismo falta de oportunidade
good,Typically you started out the day the same way by getting orders and working through your tasks. With the occasional late truck throwing a curve ball into the routine.
good,"The best thing about this job is working with the public and getting to know your customers personally. While not all experiences were the"
good,"To work for Walmart was definitely an experience, I have had the chance to work at two different locations. One of them which was in Hope, AR my hometown, and the other in Desoto, TX, a neighborhood Market. My Hometown Walmart was absolutely great, I loved it, and everyone that I worked with! As for the other, the people were nice, but I did not like management too well though."
good,Ok job for young kids with no children. Hour cuts have made it difficult on everybody at my store. The overall moral of the store is low most of the time.
good,"It's just a job. Hard to advance in. Hard to get full time hours. Low pay, and hard to get benefits. I wouldn't make it a career. Good job to have while looking for a career"
good,I liked how the management was very open to work with my Schedule the staff was very friendly over all it was a good to work for them I would recommend it for some one starting out.
good,"The work at Walmart is draining and they expect you to do alot of work in a short period of time. The breaks are not long and while working, you feel as if the time is moving slowly"
good,"I enjoyed working in customer service, and various departments in Wal Mart. I made many good friends with the friendly team I worked with. The work was fast-paced and, for the most part, enjoyable. I loved tending to, and resolving my customers needs."
good,The staff is great to work with. I do not enjoy having my schedule change without notice. You have to go through a lot of unnecessary training that is not job specific related.
good,it was a good job for a teenager not someone who is older then 23 cant speak for all Walmart but i have never been in a store environment such as the one i worked for here in Chicago they tend to leave you to look out for your self i have  been called racial slurs by higher up employees and ive been manged bully which only leave you to continue  to contact corporate office and eventually its you or them
good,"I have worked for the company for a total of 6 years, and have had ups and downs with the company. I always tell new employees that the first year working at Walmart is the best; after that time they notice that Walmart isn't the greatest company as once thought. Unfortunately the customers are almost always awful; I don't know why people think they have the right to treat Walmart employees so terrible but they do. "
good,"There is ample opportunity for growth. The downside is not enough workers. Small teams means overworked employees. Overall it is a job that has its positives and negatives, like all jobs."
good,NEVER Boring - Always active position as one does not wear only one hat at this position - Learn something new every single day - Interacting with many peoples of diverse backgrounds is very enlightening
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with, was more of a job to get me through school. Worked around my school schedule. Supervisors knew more than the manager of my department."
good,A empresa dispõe um bom salário porém os benefícios deixam a desejar.
good,A typical day at work for me consist of working in the frozen department stocking overnight pallets that the truck brings in. I come in check how many freights I have to work. I then down stack them and organize each pallets items to the desired aisle and then i go and stock for the rest of the night until I have to clock out.
good,"It is a decent place to work, and they have a great open door policy if you feel there is something wrong in the work place. I do how ever feel like they can be a little better when it comes to being a leader and showing team work."
good,The store employees are always moving. They provide customer service and plenty of arrangements around the store. The workplace culture is a bit hectic and managers are also working. The hardest part about the job is completing an assignment while having to help to the customers in a limited timed shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interactions and customer service practice everyday that helps me improve my skills.
good,working for Walmart had its ups and downs excellent benefits and great way to gain customer service experience and knowing how to work a sales floor. Working for Walmart you gain customer relations and learn new things there always open for people who love to learn and gain experience for anything new
good,"With my experience as a Customer Service associate as well as a cashier I can tell you the ""Family Feelings"" at My Walmart were that of personal gain, cutthroat associates, Favoritism pertaining to that of some cashier getting extra perks due to a CSM giving them whatever they wanted and the easier positions and workdays. This culture they say is friendly and all about the associates is a way of saying if you know someone you are gonna go far kid..."
good,The job was okay but the hours were great and pay was not the best the management was awful because i went to college and they would not let me do a leave of absence.
good,"When I was there they were going through a management transition and the new guy that was sent in was sent to clear the poor staff.  Very stressful and at times felt like you were constantly being watched.  "
good,I would suggest that they get better management to help support and train the employees properly. I also would suggest that they not give an employee 3 hours shifts.
good,"Fast pace, management changes frequently other than that no pressure except putting out a sufficient number of materials and keeping environment clean and safe. No complaints basically fun job with little to no pressure, enjoyed the experience of doing a different job"
good,"Management was rude to workers; a previous manager actually got fired for being reported twice for yelling at workers in store. Schedule was always changed, breaks weren't always given, promises made by the company were never kept."
good,"working here brings a lot of positivity and negativity but its a excellent way of building ur skills, patients and test your ability to handle any situation that may deal with employees, customers. or even mangers. You learn something new everyday."
good,"Depends on customers needs"
good,I enjoyed my time at the store and the pay was fair based on the job and it's demands. I did not feel as though the environment was the best for advancement as they seem to have already had managers whom had a relationship with other workers. I enjoyed the independence of the positions and the pace I was able to set for myself.
good,I liked it but there was no room to grow managers were childish store manager was no help he just let any and everything happen plus they hr was no help either they need to have a union someone who can speak for the people
good,Their restructuring is their down fall in Canada. Customer service is no longer their priority very sad. I truly enjoyed working with all of the associates.
good,Horrible leadership at Home office in Bentonville.  Lots of nepotism at all levels.  Need help bridging the gaps.  Inconsistent practices across the organization.
good,This walmart needs a upgrade with the registers because they are breaking down. They need a new store manager as well. Also need a better system of how the front end work when the csm dont have palm pilots because they have customers waiting forever before they get down there and if its all about the customers it should be done.
good,"•	Implementacion del sistema Oasys en la Planta de Carnes Wal-Mart Mexico y Centro America"
good,"Working as a cashier was fun but very quick paced when the day grew longer. When it was busy, I spent time cleaning the shelves and making sure products are straight and in the correct placement. When busy, the job consist of standing in one area and checking out the customers items. Getting positive reviews from the customers was the best part of my day, knowing that I was packing their groceries correctly. However, sometimes negative comments were coming from customers from past experiences they have had with other employees. Breaks are normally given every 2 hours depending on the length of a shift, including 15 minute breaks, as well as an hour for lunch breaks."
good,"Keeping your mouth shut and doing your job seems to be the right thing to do in order for people to like you. "
good,The position was a great start and a great return as well. Job met with my school schedule and constantly had wages go up. A job where you can move up in positions in no time.
good,"O Walmart é uma ótima empresa, porém possui uma maneira restrita para uma carreira lá dentro, alguém consegue se tornar um gerente apenas pelos anos de experiência dentro da empresa cumprindo apenas a rotina e os procedimentos da empresa. Espaço para novas ideias são advindas somente através dos diretores."
good,"While working at Walmart was the most financially stable job I'd had, the management was far from friendly or helpful and lent little to no help when it came to completing the tasks. "
good,I was promised everyother weekend off but did not get off for those weekends. I have kids that I get everyother weekend and I didn;t get to spend that much time with them
good,Worked as a Cap II Team Associate.  Moved store goods from the inbound truck and stocked the shelved on the floor.  Worked mostly in the Health and Beauty section and Baking section.
good,"Walmart has a 'pathways' training system in place that makes it difficult to receive the pay they claim you are entitled to when hired. These training systems are artificially elongated, that you might spend as much time working the floor as possible, without being paid adequately."
good,Work on CAP Team 2 is very physical and the demand during holiday season allows for all the hours you want.  Fellow associates are friendly for the most part.  Management has little or no leadership at the store I work in.  The turnover rate is high for associates that are not supervisors and above.  This also means that the chance of moving up in this store is little to none and they keep business as usual.
good,Some of the regulations are crazy. I was fired for taking 9 days in a 6 month when my wife was pregnant and was have complications with her pregnancy.
good,this was a job I started after leaving high school overall this job was a fast past friendly job lot of thing to learn and plenty of room for advancement
good,"A good company to work for overall. The jobs usually aren't to difficult and you're usually paid quite well, in addition to having really good benefits after a year."
good,I felt I had a lot of chances to move up mainly because a lot of people were stepping down. The expectations placed on the associates can be far to demanding.
good,"They have a great staff and knowledgeable employees, a real team. Would consinder working for them again. They were a high volume store and needed a bit more staff to accomplish daily goals."
good,I worked in the Garden Center and I loved it. I just didn't care for the store manager because she didn't care about her employees or their families. Most of my fellow employees were like family. I still stay in contact with quite a few of them.
good,disagree on why they let me go. I do know really want to say much because I left walmart with a bad impression and thought they wouldn't fire me for some reason as they did.
good,A typical day at Walmart can be various things from stressful to very satisfying. I learned that teamwork is very important and not having an understanding with other co-workers can cause problems. Management at Walmart in my experience could have been a lot better. There is a family type of culture at Walmart outside of management. The hardest part about working at Walmart is the fact that you never know how that particular day is gonna go. The most enjoyable part about working there is that you have a chance to meet new people.
good,Their managers need more training! If a cashier can not help the customer and calls a manager why don't that manager know how to assist? Why do they get to have nasty attitudes?
good,Some days were fast and some were slow which I liked. Close was slow and liked the quiet. I enjoyed working with people and talking with people. It was a good job for me.
good,"I enjoyed working with the people in different departments, the work was fun and I learned how to set products. The management was sometimes confused but all were nice and polite."
good,"Loved the job in CO, felt appreciated, regular raises, great management, no problem with having a steady schedule.  Texas store is more chaotic, a lot of management turnover and had to take a pay cut, which would be understandable because of cost of living but there seems to be just too much chaos for a steady worthwhile working experience."
good,"Walmart offers better compensation than most retail employers in the area. You are guaranteed consistent hours, though they may vary day to day and week to week."
good,Good job to work... would be great for someone with out children or family the job take all your time out the day and sometimes you don't get recognition for the good work you do
good,Walmart isn't all bad! However prepare to basically live there as your fluctuating schedule will fell like you've never left!  And then the employees of you get mixed up with them lots of drama and he said she said will ensue!
good,"Typical work includes meeting with vendors and store management, resolving issues that arise at store level. Tracking inventory both incoming and outgoing to keep costs low. There is never a time when one is not busy, from cleaning to organizing to working freight or helping customers the duties are endless."
good,This job offered me a lot of hours which resulted in a decent amount of pay. I usually had the same hours and worked the same days throughout the week.
good,"okay place to work a lot over back stabbing and management have there favorite ones. a lot of lies and stories tellers.but you can make a good place to work if you don't deal with that stuff,,"
good,"Lots of work usually, learned quite a bit about customer service,management is a 50/50 likeness, standing in line to buy food for break or lunch, associates is the best part of the job lots of fun people."
good,Was actually a very fun job. A lot of the co works were fun to be around. At times management could be a bit overbearing but as long as you worked at a steady pace there would be no issues.
good,"always working I hated to work on holidays, did retail learned a lot about customer service and counting drawers down. Long hours I also worked in electronics"
good,"Set up and recover store overnight night for next business day.  Plan , teach, train associates to full potential. Merchandise and promote sales and team work environment."
good,I worked there twice. And I noticed several things that I didn't agree with. I explained my feelings to managers and stuff. Nothing was ever done. I work as a remodeling crew. They were very rude.
good,Each manager telling you to do multiple procedures different ways. Broken/dangerous  equipment. Managers don't talk to each other or discuss what's Actually going on or what the problem and how to fix it or solve it
good,"Entry level, Good for Students. Almost 60% of the work done by our team every day within the assigned work hours. Walmart financially very sound and very latest technology available but everything is manual very less pay for their employees."
good,Not a bad place to work if it was properly staffed. Other associates are easy to work with and will work with you to solve an task. Management needs to work on this. Cannot keep any hours over 40.
good,"This job is really easy work and fun environment. Management is decent. They have their days, but they pick and choose favorites. Its hard to actually get the appreciation you deserve for your hard work. Overall they have great benefits and overall are very understanding."
good,walmart is a fun place but the location i worked at was very unorganized the work load is alot for one person they are under staffed and have no communication skills
good,Hours would be cut. I wanted full time and they would hire the younger people and give them full time. They would change your manager every couple of months.
good,"Must be available, they don't really care about your personal life. A lot of favortism goes on, but if you do your work thru might leave you alone, majority you do more than what's required."
good,"working at walmart was ok, I was a cashier and my typical day at work was sometimes crazy especially on holidays and special sales. what I enjoy about walmart was the customers talking to them to make sure their visit was good and they found everything they need. the hardest part was only under staff and not having enough cash registers open."
good,Decent place to work. Management hesitant to offer help. Often asked for help and none was received. Very little was asked about what was happening on the floor
good,"I worked for Walmart for a little under 6 months. My time there was not particularly enjoyable, per se, that may be expected when all you do is check customers out for a solid 5 hours at a time. My superiors were all very kind and understanding when I did not understand something or needed help. seeing as how this was my first job I had ever done, I learned a lot about work environments in general and how to interact with co-workers. The hardest part of the job for me was trying to balance a nearly full-time schedule and continue my education as a senior in high school, which is why I ended up leaving the job. The best part of the job was the frequent (about every two hours) breaks that we all got."
good,Management was ok just to get anywhere in the company you have to be in goody goody with management. I learned that you can work harder than most and still dont get any where.
good,"Management at Yreka, CA walmart was the worst experience at a job for me, I would work 9 days in a row then get one day off then work another 7. And whenever i would request a day off for school I would have the hardest time getting it off."
good,"This was a great job to have . Hard but money is good . I didn't like how hot it was . They let u listen to music while u work . Meet a lot of people , many conversations"
good,"Empresa ótima de trabalhar , fornece plano de saúde e vale refeição."
good,"love to work with others both custumers and associates."
good,good for college kids or people who already have another income coming in. single parents or people trying to live alone its not a very good job. health insurance is high. the worst is the point system they do not take dr notes and if your kids get sick it still counts against you. and the discount would be ok if we could get a discount on grocerys more than once a year.
good,"I love working as a pharmacy technician, I don't even mind doing retail at Walmart as a pharmacy technician. The not so great thing is if you work as P/T, don't count on ever getting F/T unless they have to give it. Since they changed things, now we don't get holiday pay, from what I gather F/T don't get vacation pay either, they just give every one PTO."
good,"Not a great job environment. Worked stocking shelves."
good,"A typical day is stressful and fast paced."
good,"although this was my first job ad an amazing experience, i learned many things working at Walmart but I feel I would love to work somewhere that I am majoring in."
good,I feel Walmart was the best job i ever had.The only negatives were that it was my first time on a points system and i know if i was ever given that opportunity again i am confident i would not b giving this review i would be working my dream come true.Also i really try to give people the benefit of doubt but i am sure my manager misunderstood my place on some important issues and wrongfully fired me.I learned something new everyday and loved it.In general managers were fair.Atmosphere at that location was amazing but near the end customers come first was blurred by a few managers.The hardest part of the job was saying goodbye.My favorite part about Walmart was helping the customers and making all smile customers and co-workers.Overall this was my best job experience ever.
good,I like the job but I hate all the micro managing I've been a department manager that was nice but at this new store I'm treated like I don't know anything
good,"The customers were fun, and always made the day go by fast. We would dress up for holidays, and promote lots of sales. The management was decent to work for."
good,"Worked with Walmart for over 6 years now and it seems like each passing year gets harder to work there. Most managers are new to the business and aren't really qualified for their positions. You're hired for a 10 or 12 hour shift and them hours aren't set in stone. You may work 7 hours one day and 12 hours the next. Slowly over the years, their benefit plans have slowly dwindled away. Insurance plans are mediocre at best and all incentive plans in working hard were taken away from the employees. Overall, just not a fun place to work..."
good,Walmart is a job thats mostly for people who stay at home with mom and dad and want some extra cash in there pocket not a job for a adult who has kids and a house lol u will be homeless and on child support...
good,Foi o local onde eu tive a oportunidade de realizar cursos que desenvolveram a minha habilidade profissional.
good,"It's a great place to work at especially overnight. However, the workload is stressful and you're gonna have to work a lot overnight. If you've never picked up weights well this job isn't for you."
good,"As a student, i needed flexible hours but the HR department people were very strict and would give me hours that would collide with my school hours and then yell at me for not giving work more importance!"
good,"Typical day at work I ring up all the products being purchased. I greet the customers and answer any questions they may have. Hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers, but with patience it is workable."
good,"When I first got the job at Walmart, the job was amazing. I looked forward to going to work every day. Throughout my two years working there, they underwent a lot of changes. The changes made things worse and worse. I was getting stressed which wasn't good for my anxiety or depression. I wound up missing a lot of work and got terminated. I really which they would go back to the way they were. I wish they'd realize that the employees are just as important as the customers. It's okay, though. It was a great experience."
good,Walmart is a really good company to work for aside from the work life balance being terrible and communication and respect being terrible too. There are always a lot of opportunities for advancement.
good,Walmart is one of the best jobs anyone can have. Being at work helped me with my customer service. I met a lot of different people at walmart. I could go to work having a bad day. But by the time I left everything was great because of the customers.
good,I started as a seasonal cashier then they decided to keep me part time in the pet department.. The pay was good for me being a high school student at the time
good,"management kept a low staff to try and keep up performance.-fail"
good,Tried to help a fellow employee by letting them use my discount card . According to Walmart in the end result a definite no-no.
good,A typical day at work was hard work and sweat and i loved it I had my own work area where i was able to focus on sorting merchandise the radio made time go by productively kept us motivated
good,"Great place to work, hard when you're a highschool student and can only work certain hours "
good,Its was different face everyday an my job was to always make their day. The people who work at Walmart are all welcoming an kind. I would say there wasn't to much difficulty to the job other then lifting an carry some things across the whole store.
good,"Busy, learned sales, great co-workers. I enjoyed the opportunities to expand my knowledge of the company. Had flexible hours, and great overtime opportunities."
good,i was able to pass most of the department managers and some of the Assistant Managers but even with the Store manager giving me full time within 74 days he lied to me about just about every promotion and just kept leading me on
good,Working For Walmart Was an Experience. Gave me and opportunity to excel in the company. I had a great team that I worked with when I moved to third Shift.
good,i liked working there. the job wasn't hard. i kept busy even on the slow day. i was temporary and was laid off. the management was good and the coworkers were nice and exercised team work
good,Empresa boa para trabalhar possui plano de carreira e investe em seus respectivos funcionários
good,"I enjoyed being a customer service manager but felt like I was missing out on raising my daughter.  The pay was low, and I wasn't receiving Full Time hours.  Other than that, I really enjoyed working there."
good,"An overall good place to work but, not a place i would recommend as a career. The hours are good but, never steady as they do tend to fluctuate. They promise you 40 but you will end up with 32 or less. They tend to over work their employees and dont seem to care for the lack of you being a human being. Management treat you more like a number and not as a person.,"
good,"The job is good. you get an empolyee discount after 3 months and there are oportunities for advancment however they are far and few inbetween. the job itself is either super fast-paced or drop dead slow, which at time can make for a difficult shift. the hours are somewhat irrgular for part time empolyees, however they do start to some a general pattern in full time positions."
good,I really enjoyed working here. The people and employees were great. I just didn't like the unset schedule and hours. other than that this was a great job.
good,"El trabajo en supermercados siempre es pesado Sueldo bajo y un dia de descanso, fuera de ello el personal hace un buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,Walmart was very unorganized. Nobody really wanted to work. People called out daily. I didn't enjoy working not enough hours not enough pay.
good,"Got to do a lot of walking, the store was big. Management's idea of training left a lot to be desired. Environment was clean and most of the co-workers were fun to work with. And I pretty well knew where to locate items customers were looking for."
good,there is always something for you to do at this job. they push you to  do the work and finish on time. learn time management. management is pushy. lunch is the most enjoyable part of the day.
good,"Production was too high"
good,"Enjoyed my job as a stocker however I did not enjoy the excess drama caused by my co-workers almost every day.  I had no problem unloading the truck or  stacking pallets although there were many times I was accused by my co-workers that I was stacking improperly when I witnessed them unevenly stacking freight onto pallets.  Also, there was a lot of rumor spreading that went on and I couldn't understand why so much drama was part of a stocker position in Wal-Mart.  I came to work, did my job, and went home.  Very disappointed that I was fired due to their faulty point system and inaccuracy to register absences in a timely fashion.  And their inability to excuse employees in emergency situations.  I miss my job, not many of my co-workers and not management."
good,"Walmart was a pretty good place to work for, besides some of the not so fast people. Plenty of room to move around, change scenery, change stores, get promoted and plenty of team spirit."
good,"Walmart  is a great place to work. But like every job, it's tough at times. Sometimes it's overwhelming but over all a good place to be."
good,"Prepare customers with car orders and services. Customer would come in Happy, Angry, Upset, or Excited, my responsibility as a Service Specialist get oil changes, batteries, tire, orders and correct information."
good,"This job is an ideal fit for someone who does not have kids, and does not mind living at work. Personally, I had a child while I was working here and my parents saw him more than I did. Don't count on having any holidays off because they don't care if it's your child's first holiday or their last, you're going to work. People of course are generally pretty awful, but you make a lot of friends working here. They are all feeling the struggle too. The pay is good, but you must watch your hours; if you go over part time YOU get in trouble even though you're not the one making the schedules. Good for kids that are on break from college."
good,It's a good job.  I enjoyed working here but I have out grown it and I'm looking for something new. The days were long sometimes
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart as I really learned how to deal with customers and I strengthened my skills. I learned that you do now have to agree with the customer all the time but you do need to be respectful at all times.
good,"a typical day was always heavy"
good,A typical day at work  is I either work  in the freezer down staking the pallets and stalking them or I stalk the freight in the rest of the store. The management expects you to do 5- 6 different departments with about 5 or 6 hours a night. i learned how to stalk freight quickly and assist customers with whatever they need
good,"I loved the work that I did. Loved most of the people that I worked with. I gained a lot of experience in the field that I had trained for. The hardest part of the job was some of the company guidelines and rules. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public and along with my fellow co-workers. As a company in a whole, I feel that walmart is so big that it has become impersonal to it's employees."
good,"I enjoyed working there , Managers were a little bit much at sometimes but overall it was pretty cool.I learned to stay to myself, Management need to loosen up some time, the co workers were nice and funny, the hardest part of my job wwas working 5+ pallets by myself with no help , the most enjoyable was meeting new people!"
good,"I found that the people I worked with were very diverse but Walmart is definitely it's own community. The main issue was that the management, particularly the upper management, the were determined to hold themselves apart and above those that worked for them. The constant treatment of any employee as disposable, in the words of one of the upper management ""Just bodies to fill spots that the computer generated systems says are needed."" That was the most difficult part of working there."
good,"Quick is a day because of the breaks. I learned to stock. Management was okay, Co-workers awesome. Staying awake, worked overnights. Getting to wear jeans."
good,"Very good  place  to  work pay and hours should be higher only con ,also they need better management  that's on the same page .but other than that I loved my job ."
good,"i worked overnights, as a freight stocker in the freezer dairy meat section of the store. it was a hard labor kind of job. i typically worked 6-8 pallets a night with one other person in my department. there was some face to face customer service, but for the most part it was all about getting as many tasks done as possible before the day crew came in so that their jobs were easier,so that they could focus on helping customers out"
good,"A day at Walmart consisted of breaking down the newly deliverd product and restocking shelves making sure they stayed stocked throughout the day while at the same time helping coustomers.Walmart had a very interactive managment team that was always willing to show how things are done or help you out if things where running behind. My co-workers at Walmart where my life line, we worked together like a well oiled machine to get through the day.The hardest part about working at Walmart was the fluctuating schedule while the best part of the job was interacting with the coustomers"
good,"I really enjoyed working for Walmart. The only thing I didnt like was my hours. They wont give you set hours and I never worked over 36 hours a week, when I applied for full time."
good,I am a hard worker and there isn't much of anything that I can't perform. I also learn fast. I don't know what else to say about Walmart. It's a good place to work.
good,"Great place if your looking for advancement. Co-workers are amazing to work with, your eligible for excellent benefits too. There are always lots of smiling faces."
good,Working at walmart was a good experience in working with a real job and it was my first job.The only reason i am not there now i moved to texas. i relocated.
good,"I loved working for Walmart, however there is little room for advancement and they aren't as flexible with things needing to be done outside of work whether it be schooling or appointments."
good,"Help customers with photo editing, help answer questions about cameras, helped stock shelves. Always expected to help in more than one department."
good,Great job in the beginning. After a while you start to realize that this company only cares about the money they make instead of the employees feelings. Hated this job so much.
good,A typical work day was good. Co-workers were nice. Didn't pay enough. Job wasn't hard at all. I got good hours at least 40 hours a week. I enjoyed meeting new people on a daily basis.
good,"Stocking, cashier. Inventory, setting mods. Lifting heavy things. Labeling and organizing. I like to stay busy and not stand at the register all day. Working in the garden center keeps you busy."
good,"I enjoyed being employed by Walmart because the idea of constantly interacting with the public makes for a very interesting day, YOU MUST BE RELATABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart and will go back anytime. The people that I worked with were great. Best Co-workers. I had a great team of direct reports working for me.
good,They are a friendly fast paced company. That treat there employee's with respect. Offer many employee appreciation days. The hardest part of the job is high business days when our workload is tripled.  The most enjoyable part of the job when a customer leaves my cash having a better day because of the service that I gave.
good,"Most Walmart jobs are very self rewarding, always finish your day knowing you did a great job and accomplished your goals."
good,"Was an overall good experience. I was able to retain certain skills such as customer service, patience, and catering to customers while completing job requirements."
good,"A typical day at Work would start out as regular. Clock yourself in, go to your Customer Service Manager and get placed at a work station. At the station you get organized before you turn your light on, that way everything is in order before you start. Then you Zone, and welcome customers into your zone, asking if they have found everything they were looking for or if they need help with anything. From there you provide the customer with the best care possible, checking them through as quickly as possible and checking the basket, and looking inside always. towards the end you then check all the bags on the carousel to make sure all products are with the checked out customer."
good,I learned a lot from working at Walmart and met a lot of great people. The reason for me trying to leave is to further my education and working overnights would get in the way of my education.
good,They only want people who suck up to the managers to be on the management team. I help everyone and stay over if I need to and I've still yet to get anywhere
good,This was a temporary job for holiday season only. Point system made no sense. Managers not very professional and never helped explain work duties completly.
good,Learn how to handle money and how to work with change. Rude customers and the manager didnt really care. It wasnt a bad place to work but ill never work there again.
good,"was a very busy atmosphere, there were kids that would mess things up, but you had to have patience, and go above and beyond to do your job correctly and the best way you can."
good,"A empresa oferecia ótimos benefícios,incluindo fretado,corpo de gerencia consciente para com o funcionário."
good,"Walmart was a job that paid my bills to live and also pay for my schooling. Though the working environment was very negative, it is not recommended to work here at this location."
good,"you have to downstack freight, load them onto carts and check to see if they will go up and  you have an amount of time you have to complete it in, co-workers are friendly and sometime management can be understanding if you have an ton of freight to work that night"
good,I learned many trades in this company. I started out as a cashier within 3 months became a CSM and later down the road became a department Mgr. The co-workers were great to have around. we helped each other most of the time. The hardest part of my job was having to be up there more then I was home. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping costumers with the things they were looking for.
good,"Overall Walmart is a good company to work for. Associates work hard, and you build a lifetime of friendships with them. Benefits are good as well and offer something for everyone."
good,I started out working in the womens dept. Stocking and orginizing the product. Ended up doing maintenance.  Cleaning the store and restrooms and offices. I didn't have any problems with any of my job responsibilites. I left because my husband was in and out of the hospital alot ( he's disabled). And because of that I was forced to quit or get fired for being out alot.
good,"It is a good place to work, always someone new to meet. You will be around people from all walks of life. Demanding schedule day and night"
good,"Wal-mart is an awesome place to shop.Working there is an whole other topic.They start you out with low pay and abuse you from the start.They make you work in any department thats short because of the lack of scheduling on their part,.They treat you like dirt and once they ready to get rid of you.They will find any reason to fire you."
good,"Decent hours and decent pay was outweighed by no benefits and being fired before receiving benefits. "
good,Walmart is a good job and you work with great people and other co-workers and you get a discount for being a employee and your working for success and you can move up in the company if you want to
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart is going in to complete my job with 100% accuracy. Using my great customer service skills at all times while having an awesome attitude!
good,"It was fun in frozen department about the first four weeks. Simple stuff, unload pallets of frozen merchandise to floor. What ever could go out was overstock."
good,"Good place of work, with plenty of work experience opportunity to move up in the work place. Walmart is a family store that pretty much has anything you would need it's a helpful convenient store."
good,I think its a great job to have. Its a easy job just the managers could be a little nicer and more supportive. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and seeing many different people everyday.
good,"typical day at work- 8 hours"
good,"Las labores rutinarias y de control se llevan a efecto al inicio de los turnos, el resto de la dinámica se lleva a efecto conforme transcurre el turno."
good,"A typical day in the life of an Associate can be summed up to 1. Stocking 2. Customer Service 3. Multitasking."
good,"Typical store setting. Favoritism ruins all chances of advancement, being passed over is easy. Decent pay. Hardest part is ungrateful customers."
good,I was a seasonal cashier only working 20 to 30 hours a week. I ran up customers orders and processed their payments.
good,"When I worked for wal-mart, I had a decent experience. I really enjoyed working with some of the people I worked with. although the work would be slow sometimes, the people I worked with made it worth it"
good,This is a good company to advance with. As well as a good start off job for many. et in a good store with the right management team and you'll go far.
good,Wal-Mart is a great place to work. Very concern employee and great mangers. They keep there employee very happy or at least try.
good,"The first part of the day wasn't bad, because you could talk and listen to music wile unloading truck. But after that it got boring real fast. Plus management just looks at us as a number on a chart. They really don't care about you."
good,A good day at the customer service desk is when you get about ten satisfied customers out of the ones who want to just complain and nothing makes them happy at all even though you went that extra mile and tried.
good,"Very friendly people to work with"
good,"I always enjoy any job i get, overnight staff is great, work is hard but can be accomplished, steady work. I have learned a lot and i am still learning."
good,Walmart was overall a good job nice benefits and always had you in your same section in the store which was really nice great co workers and very helpful when needed.
good,"-Strive for the sale of the Wal-Mart MasterCard and daily targets"
good,"At clocking in I know exactly where my position & duties are every day.  "
good,"I was a cashier but transferred to customer service, I enjoyed working there but i didn't like that the managers had their favorites and the rest of the employees had to pick up the slack of the ones that didn't want to work. The pay was too little for what we have to put up with on behalf of the customers."
good,a typical day at work will consider making the shelf look awesome by checking any missing labels making sure overstock is properly took back to the back room .I learned how to read barcodes & stock groceries . the hardest part of my job was rebuilding overstock pallets after all work was finished! the most enjoyable part of my day was having team work!
good,"ouverture du studio, faire des appelles de sollicitation, confirmer des rendez-vous, faire des photos passeport, sollicitation en magasin, faire des sessions photos s'il y a lieux, vente, transaction caisse, fermeture du studio."
good,"bad place to work. no leadership, low level works are treated like lower people. the work culture is just not right. not to work for wal mart eve again"
good,Walmart is a hard job to work but if a person can stay with them you will enjoy the pay that is offer to you. One thing that I like about Walmart is that you can only work weekends if you like to so that you can have the Monday- Thursday off.
good,management needs help on being manager and they need to learn how to write people up and when not to write people up. the co-workers are great to work with because everyone stays to them self but they get the work done together.
good,I learned how to time organize better as a sales associate and I loved my co-workers. I loved nights because it was quiet and I got more done.
good,"on a typical day at Walmart I would clean the bathrooms, I sweep the floor, I clean up black marks"
good,"Your day can have you doing almost any task. Some of the tasks I preform is unloading trucks, stocking merchandise, prepping overstock to be stored, scanning expensive items in to the computers, or assisting customers. My job has taught me to be very adaptable and be ready for anything that comes my way."
good,"demaciado trabajo"
good,"I didnt mind working here. Just didn't make enough hours to compare with the amount of gas i spent driving there. And they just took away holiday pay to so now when we work holidays, we get paid the same as any other day."
good,Walmart employs many people with disabilities and older workers. They are usually accomodating to the employee as well.
good,Working for walmart is a great first job to have and for some it makes a great career. Working for walmart really taught me a lot about reality and how to be a hard worker.
good,Fun work atmosphere with  simple work. The only downfall was I recieved very few hours a week for work a minimum of 14 hours per week.
good,They work you hard and make sure you keep at it. not too friendly when i worked there but still pretty great place to work the customers were so great which made it worth while
good,"I worked the overnight shift at Wal-Mart from 10p.m to 7a.m. I've learned a lot from that job. I have learned how to management the merchandise in the store, I learned how to use the heavy equipment such a pallet jack and a folk lift, etc. The management was alright at Wal-Mart but wasn't the best. I had very concerned and hard working co workers who were young and did what they had to do to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was staying up and continuously work through the night. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to learn something new, and learning how to use the big machines."
good,"easy tasks"
good,A typical day at work was great. I enjoyed my customers and the staff and Walmart. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help someone in need.
good,"A typical day is coming in and just working with customers and making sure they are finding everything they need. I have learned to tolerate a variety of people and to just do what you are told and don't get in trouble. Management is good with working with customers when the customers ask the managers directly but that is about it. Management never has the employees back and they never do anything productive. My co-workers are nice people, I really get along with them. Hardest part of the job is coming into work. I never want to go but you have to anyway.Enjoyable part for me is talking about video games with people for hours, that is why I love the job."
good,"the managers do not care about their workers and the hours are horrible, you get 2 breaks and a one hour lunch break. the work is time consuming and the costomers are rude"
good,fun long days. different types of people. able to learn a lot. Did not like working on thanksgiving or long evenings on Christmas eve.
good,"Lots of customer interaction!"
good,"Good place to work and receive discounts. Consistent, fair raises. Management was a bit messy and unprofessional, making the job harder than it had to be. Mainly there was a lot of nitpicking for no reason, but it simply depended on the manager. Hopefully they have changed for the better."
good,Fast pace very productive nice place to work. Energetic the day goes by quickly because of the nature of the work given to an associate.
good,"It was my pleasure to work in Walmart. Learned lot of new skills by interacting with customers, organizing ,following proper procedures for handling claims for merchandise and guidelines for clearance, mark-ups- downs, signage, flagging and pricing labels and on emergency and safety procedures."
good,"I enjoy working with different people. Getting to know how to do different things. I enjoy learning and taking on new tasks. I've learned how to work a cash register quicker than I thought I would. The hardest part of my job was not getting the hours I needed for the distance I had to drive. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new things, feeling productive and having great co workers."
good,"Would I go back: Yes I would."
good,I enjoyed working for the company. The staff are upbeat and fun. We would have about 56-80 pallets on the floor on a typical night and have 8 hours to throw up frieght as we call it.
good,Clock in  go get pallets fill them up take them to the shelves. When the trucks come I send them down the line and when I don't do that I would throw the truck which means empty the truck on to the line.
good,The atmosphere was ok. However there seemed to be no room for growth . The Co workers were great. I learned how to be great leader and how to assert myself when tasks needed to be completed.
good,I was a hard working individual. Monday thru Friday. Management did not have to point me in any direction they had my tasks in the computer.  I would do them and do them to the best of my ability.I often trained new associates for management
good,"While there are several good things about this company, I believe that there are more negative."
good,"I stocked freight in the frozen food department: it was unbearably cold: I do like stocking, but not in those conditions. I really enjoy the customers."
good,you get to learn alot and always something to do. meet some good people along the way can move up.needs to change some policys.
good,it was an ok place to work. some co workers felt like they could run over you though. typical place to work. time passes by fast
good,a typical day at work was clocking in going straight to your register and standing there for 5 hours until your register locks out. The only thing I could say that I learned was patience. The mangers however was the worst part of the job. They talk to you however they want whenever they want.
good,I enjoyed working at Wal-mart because I enjoy customer relations.  I would excell in my money management skills and computer technology. I would also handle chemicals when I worked in the Photo Lab developing 35mm film.  Wal-mart is not a horrible place to work. I didn't care for some of the other co-workers but learning to manage my team building and team working skills were accessed here.
good,"This a pretty fast paced job.  I learned a lot about people, good and bad.  I was able to get along with most people I came across.  Sometimes management is difficult to work with.  Most of the time, unless you need something, I just stay away.  Sometimes your co-workers aren't very hard working.  Hardest part of the job is the peak hours and there are not enough cashiers to help out.  The most enjoyable is working with people I like."
good,"Es una empresa muy buena desafortunadamente los gerentes son los malos los que no saben llevar al frente a los empleados, solo se preocupan por ellos mismos, y no atienden las necesidades de cada uno de los empleados."
good,"Good work environment when helping customers & accompanied by coworkers that were willing to work with you & help with the job at hand."
good,Decent work with room to advance but management is not willing to work with you on any detail in life.  They also go through employees like crazy
good,"Needs management hierarchical adjustment.  Needs room for advancement, change to job culture.  Needs more motivation"
good,Through the years I have worked for Walmart a lot has changed. Less for the Associate and more for the company. Ability to work a set schedule is pretty much eliminated. You must have open availability for all roles in the store which is very limiting for Single Mother's and anyone with family.
good,"Las mañanas solían ser tranquilas, pero la hora de almuerzo y once siempre se encontraba lleno, la gente quiere ser atendida de manera rápida y eficiente, la mayor dificultad era el hambre de esa hora y que los clientes no entendieran que había que ir cerrando algunas cajas, llegar a las metas era fácil ya que teníamos protocolos de atención en donde nuestros colaboradores seguían por ende en la tarde ya habíamos cumplido todas nuestras metas diarias."
good,"I enjoyed working here while i had the chance, my coworkers were very nice and usually helpful, however, if we did not know something and tried to get an answer from someone higher up they took a very long time getting back to us. Overall it was a good work experience and if i ever move back to Minnesota i would apply there again"
good,"TGhe cashoers are expected to do alot, stock candy clean do reshops. Always make sure you redline. Some of the CSS need to be taught manners and how to treat people."
good,Started out as a nice place to work. The working environment started to degrade. The store management essicencaly cut the store off of the company culture. The associates were discouraged from asking for help or letting management know of personal problems.
good,"Wal mart is wal mart. The lines are long but they try to make it work, The managers were a bit boogie but they all are gone now so i cant say anything about them."
good,My typical work day was fast paced and ever changing. I had the opportunity to learn a lot and share my knowledge with a lot of great people.
good,"Great overall company. High pressure environment to meet sales, profit and expense goals. Exceed customer expectations."
good,"Não tenho muito a dizer. Como um primeiro emprego, foi o ideal. Excelente treinamento, bom local de trabalho em geral."
good,"I really liked working for Wal-Mart.  The management training really prepared you for everyday tasks, like talking to a group, paper work, and loss prevention.  I really enjoyed working with the employees and the customers.  The management chain is really supportive and willing to help out when needed, however it is not often needed.  I really loved learning about all aspects of the products and services Wal-Mart has."
good,pretty much like any other job it was a good job and i liked it. Lift up many boxes and very heavy . team works always. I made sure our team was positive and made the best and make our shift the best.
good,i would open the deli.i would slice lunch meat.sometimes i would have to close . so i would have clean up the mass from the day
good,"Deli: Start dropping hot case food in fryer, time and temp to ensure product is fully cooked. Sliced meats and cheeses for display and customer. Served product to customer per specifications, weight and thickness. Cleaned and sanitized work area through the day."
good,"It was a fun place to work, and the co-workers were really nice, but usually if you needed someone they would be gone for some reason.  I was a cashier and I enjoyed it sometimes, however a couple of the CSMs were overly controlling of what the cashiers did, even when they were not hurting the business in any way.  Most customers were nice, as long as you were nice to them initially.  Of course, you have the people who just wanna take their bad day out on someone, but most people are nice.  Overall, I would do it again, but no job is perfect."
good,I learned many things from Wal-Mart and for that I am grateful. I learned how to be a better leader and how to work more efficiently under pressure. The best part of the job was the friends I met along the way and the sense of belonging. Management over the years began to shift from focusing on the betterment of the associates to focusing on how to make associates accountable for pages and pages of notes. This dynamic is something that proved very overwhelming for me due to the lack of hired help. I enjoyed everything about the job itself and I am glad to have had the opportunity to work there and learn all these essential skills.
good,"Unloading and palletizing merchandice off several trucks in recieving. Nice Co-workers, but the managers were not very nice."
good,"i enjoyed working at Walmart, I am a very friendly and out-going person so working with customers is amazing. I enjoy meeting new people. Also the employees are a great group of people to work with."
good,Customers were rude management was biased co workers were great. fairly easy job if you like meeting new people everyday
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits. Issue receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customers. Assist customers by providing information and resolving their complaints."
good,"Was able to go from store to store.  Pay was not good for a person with a family and needs.  Not much room for growth, which causes a person to look for more work."
good,"it was a good job I enjoyed the experience, however it wasn't my passion but other than that the managers were great the customers were different but overall a good job the main thing I learned was computer skills"
good,"Loved managing my ladies (cashiers). Operated the money center, cash office, jewelry counter, service desk, all cashiers and registers located inside facility. Delegated lunches & breaks. Enjoyed RGIS inventory specialist. Made alot of memories there."
good,"Very interesting ... Big company."
good,I worked as a lunchmeat stocker I would determine what needs to be filled and ordered. If I was done I would help meat department stock chicken and frozen food. I learned this job was hard on the back and legs when lifting heavy items. The management was nice. I liked my co-workers they were helpful. Hardest part of the job heavy lifting the most enjoyable part the breaks.
good,"The jobs themselves are simple and easily done, however, they always find a way to make your job that much more difficult. The pople who work there though are amazing. I've made several long term friends from my time at Walmart"
good,a typical day at Walmart. First you get there and clock in. Then you scan your badge and it tells you what register to go to. After that you go find a CSM and they will tell you where to go just in case if you need to covers someone break and most of the time you will. then you work 2 hours and then take your first 15 min break and work 2 more hours and then take your lunch and then you work to more hours and take your last 15 min break then go home after that. the hardest part about working there is management lets there favorites do what they want to do and that's not fair. The most enjoyable part about this job Is going to lunch or going home because its so hot that you get tired fast.
good,"Answering customer questions regarding products."
good,"Mi dia era llegar checar tarjeta,en seguida ir a la caja comenzar el cobro de mercancía a los clientes despues de 4 horas nos ibamos al comedor donde cada quien llevaba lonche o podía comprar ahi en la lonchería.no nos regalaban nada. aprendi a ser tolerante con mis compañeros con mis jefes,con losclientes,los supervisores eran  amables la gerente era muy apatico,no tenía trato con nosotros,mis compañeros si eran amables,lo mas dificil del trabajo era el horario,rolab turnos,lo que mas me gusto el trato con los clientes y compañeros de mi trabajo.Ambiente de trabajo agradable,no daban buen  trato a empleados,nos apoyabamos unos a otros."
good,"Conheci várias pessoas, trabalhávamos em grupo, aprendi a ser mais responsável com o serviço e levar as coisas mais a sério, os piores dias era quando tinha que descarregar os caminhões, cansativo demais e a parte agradável quando todos resolviam se ajudar."
good,A empresa é dinâmica e muito proativa com oportunidade de crescimento de um modo geral.
good,Productive and hard working environment. Unloading trucks and making sure all merchandise makes it appropriate locations.
good,I loved working with the public and making my customers happy. I wish the management wasn't so bad because the job was great.
good,nice place to work has good enviroment to work in and has good quality and very well organized with the products they also have supervisors that work with you and make sure everything is okay wit you while you working
good,Many people do not work as hard as they could. A lot of standing around doing nothing most days. Not much expected of many employees so slacking is easy to get away with.
good,walmart is a great place to work but not if you want to build a future with them. its not easy to climb the ladder to higher positions.
good,"Management always complain, that the customers are complaining about the store. But nothing was never done about it. I was only an associate so there was nothing I could do about it. Do not blame me because you have failed to correct the problem we also tell you about."
good,"la empresa woalmart es un buen lugar de trabajo , por sus prestaciones y su  trabajadores ,mas los beneficios que ayudan al trabajar  dentro de la empresa"
good,"It was an ok job, I wasn't to particular about it. Just something to pay the bills. The only thing that I really didn't like about it was the ever changing rules."
good,"It's a job in retail. What do you expect? Unfortunately the job itself, dependent on department, can be fun or terrible. It is all how you take it and what you accept. The raises they have given helps a little bit. But of course you still feel like you should be paid more."
good,good place to work met some great people that will last a lifetime had a great time working there if i had to would work there again
good,"Working for Walmart vision was a lot to learn in a short amount of time before they expect you to be able to open and close the office on your own and learn all the insurance, computer skills, and field test for patients and to know the doctors routines and schedules."
good,Ok company to work for. Great management and employees. Advance very quickly if you know the right people. Bland environment and always asked to do more.
good,"I loved working at Wal-Mart, the reason I loved it was because the customers. I love meeting new people and I have the ones that come every Monday or Friday, basically every week that same day. Some of the managers were okay but there were a few that seemed like they didn't care when you came to them with a problem about another worker, and you know its wrong and they know it too. I just wanted everyone to be treated the same. I liked my co-workers. A typical day is cashing checks, sending money basically handling money all day thousands of dollars everyday so you have to pay attention to what you are doing. I loved my job and being able to help the customers seeing that smile on there face and knowing I put it there makes my day even better."
good,"Foi meu primeiro emprego, a empresa me deu uma boa oportunidade de trabalho,mantive sempre um bom relacionamento com os companheiros de serviço, um ambiente muito agradável. Adquiri experiencia e conhecimento nas áreas atuadas."
good,"los dias son con atencion adecuada para cada situacion aun que luego no lo toman en cuanta."
good,"How to plan great events, handle huge number of participants, and direct associates for success of events where in stake holders are dozens in number."
good,"Working here was a good experience I had working with different people from all backgrounds, colors and creed. I have met really great customers that loved to return to get my services"
good,"Good place to work. I like working with, and meeting new people on a daily basis. Walmart is a  great place to work. i like the idea of a big corporation that has a wide variety of opportunity."
good,The managers were understanding and nice. Loved the coworkers they were very friendly and worked well together. Breaks are fifteen minutes so not too bad. Pretty much an easy job.
good,A good place to work with job security. Steady hours plus sometimes overtime. Days off are not always the same and they change them in a minute minute notice.
good,I enjoyed being a cashier especially with my previous experience I was able to help some other new employees. I wish I was able to stay but personal life caused me to move back home.
good,wal mart is a great place to start off especially if u don't have so many bills. Me having to pay bills and provide I had to find s0mething better for my family and i.
good,"company was very fair, co workers were great and always worked as a team,pay was decent,management was pretty good and would always help out"
good,"the job wasnt overall bad. I did have a problem with the favoritism though. Alot of the front end managers are friends with the employees, outside of work also. So they get treated like friends and not employees. When people like me want to work and get my job done, we get ""left out"" and picked on."
good,I unloaded trucks on the daily base and helped on the floor. my co-workers were fun and good to work with we were a good team.i like the management was good other than one manger.the hardest part about my job was when we did not have a truck to unload we were board all night... but we found things to do
good,"I worked in the produce department, I had past experience in the department. I worked for longos before working here, and this is why they gave me a chance. I was able to prove myself fairly quickly. This job revolved around stocking shelves on the sales floor and answering customer inquiries. As for co-workers, I only had 3 others working with but the way the schedules worked, the department would only have one person closing the department at night time. The hardest part of the job was having to clear out a trailer of new deliveries every night on my own and having to stock it in the cooler, while still tending to customer needs on the sales floor. The best part of the job was the fact that for the most part employees were friendly with one another, and were able to help out in different departments (although it was not a part of their job description.)"
good,fun place to work if you agree with the way disabilities are handled.management seemed not to care. more than one person complained about how disability was handeled had to go through corperate office instead of store level management being able to make decisions
good,"I love working at Walmart, the people there are friendly and cooperative. My job fit me perfectly, the only reason I have to leave is because I'm on Part-time and was needing a full-time job."
good,"Typical day is going into work with the other unloaders. I take my place on the belt to separate and move the freight onto pallets. There are break-packs that have individual items in them that are separated using a telzon to identify the location of the item. These items are put into bins to be brought out with the other freight. As a team we get the truck unloaded and after lunch break we pull the freight onto the sales floor using pallet jacks. Before the end of the day freight is also organized and binned in the backroom."
good,"My jobs titles was a door greeter, cashier, and deli cook. I greeted customers, collected money at register, and cooked food in the deli."
good,"The employees were great. the hours weren't so great because i had just started a family and was never able to be up to have time with them, between hours of sleep and work"
good,"The company offers benefits and insurance, but it doesn't pay the associates nearly enough to cover expenses and cost of living..."
good,"I managed all of the front end. "
good,"The night shifts were fun and fast paced. I learned how to stock, do inventory, use system handhelds. The management was really strict and did not have much direction. In other words, they were strict but they were not sure why. They would bother the employees for no apparent reason just to see we were all going above and beyond with our work. My coworkers were all amazing. Everyone would do their best to make sure every single thing was done every night, and that was not easy. The hardest job was abiding by the time expectations. For example, I would have 8 hours of freight in one aisle and they would expect me to be finished in 2 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was the fact I got to choose when I took my breaks and my lunch."
good,I worked as a cashier I helped with loading bags in to carts my co-workers were easy to get along with. The best part of the job was learning to better handle money that I made so I can spend it wisely.
good,Have great Customer Service Skills.  Enjoyed working with people.  My co-workers were great.  We always had each others back. I enjoyed answering the phone and stocking items in the shelves.
good,It is an ok company to work for. they do have high expectations for their shift stockers. They do not consider that people have families.
good,"has a capability to be a wonderful place to work and have career goals, management needs improvement in the aspect on how to interact with employees and the training of ethics"
good,"Wal-Mart is a good company to work for as far as advancement,"
good,During my time as an employee of Walmart I stocked items effectively and helped every customer I saw and greeted them with genuine kindness and  determination to help them. I also proved I had the ability to lift objects of at least 50lbs by moving dog food and furnature on multiple occasions. I was also able to show some flexibility by working in different sections with slightly different procedures to follow. On multiple occasions I worked both alone and with other employees without any problems.
good,"Store is very convenient when moving, but the job experience itself is quite upsetting. I have been working for 6 years and my work and effort is not appreciated."
good,"A typical day at work for me at Walmart. was to be polite and loyal to the customers. I learned at Walmart how to run a cash register and manage how to deal with different cultural of people each and every day. my co-workers and I was like a family if we thought something was wrong in anyway we would notice, and let management know immediately. the most enjoyable part of my job at Walmart was interacting with many people."
good,"Da la posibilidad de especializarse y capacita permanentemente, lo que ayuda a hacer mejor el trabajo y crecer como profesional."
good,It was a good place to work for. the work was fast paced. I liked being able to help costumers when they needed it. The managers would jump in and help when needed
good,"revisa ventas, del dia como mas en mes en ventas gastos,utilida y margen."
good,it was a good place to work some of the management people did not talk to you as a person but as a dog. I liked most of the people I worked with.
good,"Working at this walmart was a good experience, it helped me grow professionally. I Improved my communication and customer service skills, as well as my math skills and ability to manage money."
good,"I would help set up the back room to unload truck,while unloading the truck we would sort the freight by department,, then process apparels and sort break packs of individual items.. then move the freight tothe sales floor for the overnight stockers,, then either pick or stock or bin merchandise into the bin in the  cor relates to the freight needed to be binned."
good,"great staff and fast pace work place, i really enjoyed my experience working for this company. i just wish u could actually get benefits."
good,"Walmart was not a good place to work for a person like me who is friendly and follow the rules. Ive seen situations where it seems people got away with anything. I seen a lot of favoritism amongst other things. I wouldn't consider Walmart a career job, but i would recommend as a part time job for individuals who don't have a career they are interested in ."
good,"Good place to work. benefits suck. When I worked there, they didn't even accept their own RX insurance. What's that tell you?"
good,"I preferred the pharmacy over other departments of Walmart. it was almost always busy and made the day go a lot faster, it was hard at times to keep up but worth it, made decent hours which resulted in decent pay checks."
good,"Talk to and assisted approx. 250 associates a day."
good,My most enjoyable part of my job is when I got to work self-check out because I was able to feel like I was in command and that if I could just get the customers to work with me that it would all go over smoothly. I made order out of chaos in my daily schedule and I really loved to close the store. It was fun to close.
good,"Working at Walmart is many things: fun, demanding and detailed oriented. My job title was many things cashier, sales, phone operator, stocker, set up planograms and displays of new merchandise. With this job you must have customer service skill and know how to multitask. Working with management was helpful and I learned a lot of this about Walmart. Working at Walmart there were never two days alike everyday was different."
good,"Es una buena empresa,donde tenes días brillantes y otros no tanto!!! "
good,"I believe there is always room for progress, I worked here because it was the first job offered to me after college. We were constantly busy, and they need to hire more people. The job should be taken seriuosly."
good,"I feel as though this company would be better if they had management and supervisors that actually cared about their associates. Too many times have breaks been skipped because a supervisor doesn't care for that specific individual."
good,"I was an Assistant Manager responsible for the overnight team. I was responsible for ensuring the delivery trucks were processed and brought to the floor to be worked to the counters. I was accountable for merchandising decisions and had to ensure that the team had the store ready to open in the mornings. I was responsible for delegation of work, schedules and e-valuations. I ensured that the staff had all proper training and did all my own hiring."
good,"I love retail, Working at this particular Walmart was extremely busy because its in a college town and we where very understaffed and the management was never to be found when we needed them"
good,"It is always busy, so matter snow, sleet, or rain!"
good,Management lacked communication skills with other members of management and with employees. Many times were left with a long list of tasks and no explanations on how to accomplish tasks.
good,"-talk to customers for a living"
good,"*Los jefes todo les molestaba y se desquitaban con los que no tenemos la culpa"
good,the night managers on Independence were mainly nice but some managers would threaten my job tell me I wasn't working fast enough then push I to the side when I asked for advice.
good,Boa empresa de trabalhar mais com sistema muito falho entre setores e funcionários.
good,"co-workers and managers are misreble, hate their jobs. I didn't expect much for being a cashier but for my skill level I am compensated pretty well/"
good,Being a dept manager starts at 7am. I come in collect my returns and put the merchandise where it goes. I look over my produce and make its fresh for the customers to buy.  I walk my dept to make sure it was properly stocked. I scan my labels to check my out of stock items. We have a morning meeting and we are given notes that need to be done by the end of the day.  I learned that the customer is always right. I am there to serve them. My management team is great. They want the best for their workers and are there to help at all  times.  The hardest part of my job would be trying to complete all the task given to me with very minimal help due to lack of staffng. The most enjoyable part of the day is when i make the customers smile.
good,I worked on fork lifts and had production that I had to complete every hour.
good,"Avaliando do ponto de vista profissional, tive oportunidade de aprender sobre diversas funções, isso por está trabalhando com pessoas que desenvolvia cada um, uma tarefa diferenciada, hierarquicamente falando a empresa possui profissionais competentes e comprometidos com o seu crescimento, os colegas de trabalho foram pessoas que serão sempre lembrados, a parte mais agradável foi o crescimento humano e pessoal, e4 ainda temos uma oportunidade de estar nos capacitando através do curso ofertado em parceria com as empresas que operam com capacitação."
good,"Fast paced work environment where quality of the food product.I work with good employees in a team atmosphere. I provide fast and friendly service for all the customers need. I am responsible for closing the deli down at night, making sure everything is clean and orderly for the morning shift."
good,Must have very fast computer skills and remember policy and warranty. Also all ID needed to be up to date
good,"A typical day of work at this company consists of getting a pallet jack right after clocking in and starting to move and get your work done as soon as possible. We had a myguide system where we had to clock into our tasks and complete them in a timely manner. What i learned most at this job would be to move quick and still be "
good,"great experience because i am a people person.i wish i would time in the day, loved my job but it wasn't working out for me at that time. I have nothing negative to say, is a good entry level job with room for advancement."
good,"It's a typical day at work and always busy working or stocking the shelves. I work over the front end as the zone manager, so im always merchandising, dealing with customers on a daily basis. Taking every compliant and especially letters to the president."
good,"I enjoyed working the dairy department,and at first the refrigerators went down.With a little of hard work I was able to get it back on track.I did have to carry some of the workers which wasn't so bad ,but we were both there to equally work."
good,I worked the night shift which was not to bad but it was hard to adjust due to my status. I was in the Reserve and they on several occasion tried to have me report to work after every duty. I had to explain to them that I drive to Denver for my duties and they still insisted that  I return to work. Co-workers on the other hand were outstanding
good,"Working for Wal-Mart for close to 5 years now has been a worthwhile experience and enabled me to strongly work within a busy and demanding environment while dealing with the public.  It is a joy working and helping customers, however, there are some criticisms with the overall lack of structure in the store I work in, and ultimately being locked into part-time for so long isn't very ideal in this stage of my life.  It's a fine place to get a grasp on a steady work ethic, but not quite recommended for a long stretch of time."
good,"I worked nights, stocking shelves, helping customers find what they needed, being a cashier."
good,Anything worth working for is worth having but make sure you get a payoff on your investment.
good,"The typical day at work was ringing up customers, answering any questions they had about anything, and giving them my personal opinion on certain products they asked about.  I learned how to manage money, and I learned how to move fast. I also learned how to multi-task. The hardest part about the job was the management. I don't think they were doing a great job of keeping everything under control. Overall it was an okay place to work."
good,very busy productive work place never empty with customers. everyday is a day of high sales because its a consistent business.i learned how to reset cash registers and I learned how to stock shelves with merchandise that has to be presented as displayed from a manager the hardest part of my job was staying up because when I worked 3rd shift it would be a lot of standing and not as many customers during the day .the most enjoyable part of my job was the customers they would always have stories and we worked well together as far as helping them get what they  needed.
good,"I worked on the floor stocking shelves, I learned about time maeagement and how to correctly stock things on shelves. The management was very well and they delt with the employees fairly."
good,"I started out as a loss prevention agent.  Working alone, I only had one apprehension, and was afraid of being let go for what amounted to bad luck, so I asked to become an Overnight Stocker.  I did that job until leaving for ALCOA."
good,"Work flow depends upon customer needs for their car/truck, management will always take the customers side of any disagreement."
good,a typical day at Walmart for me would start by arrive to work it was  a flexible schedule so it was alright  i work in the jewelry department so i had to scanner the items than put them on the sale floor make sure the area stay clean. at mid-day we will be call to front face the whole store. so that customer and find the item they were looking for attend to customer need and work the register. at the end for my i would close the register and front face my department than go home.
good,"typical day was unloading the trucks, and stocking product. the management was poor and the co-workers were fun to b around"
good,Management was not the greatest but employees were welcoming.
good,hard work and lots of hours but you can move up if you play your cards right.
good,i enjoyed the interaction with the customers helping them search out the best options for their prints and photo gifts
good,"Salon stylists perform a broad range of cut, shampoo, condition, style, color, permanent wave, or straighten it. They use a variety of chemical solutions, such as bleaches and dyes. They use equipment such as scissors, clippers, curlers, straightening irons, and dryers to give their customers fashionable hairstyles. Some cosmetologists care for wigs and hairpieces and in some cases sell them. Cross selling product for continued services.  As well as applying make-up for clients."
good,"typical day at work mostly consist with costumer service "
good,Good place to work .  Got along with co-workers well. hardest part of job was the lifting. enjoyable part of job was greeting the customers.
good,The management was only for them self ..they would walk all over you if you were temporary.
good,"provide fun and friendly customer service. "
good,"Fast moving working environment.  Enjoyed the customers.  Started at the Jonesville store was very happy with management was a fabulous team, what a difference it makes with a great Pharmacy Manager. Transferred to Coldwater Wal-Mart Supercenter it was a different market to work in, not as busy as Jonesville. A lot of turn over in staffing.  I enjoyed always being busy and interacting with the customers."
good,"Changing oil, Car batteries, Car tires, Wipers, Headlight restoration, Tire rotation, Tire Balance, Fast pace of helping customers get back on the road safe."
good,"I now having worked in the retail field for 13 years have come to the conclusion that I hate it. The hours suck, and you can never get the help you need from your manager in a timely fashion."
good,Enjoy getting to know my regular customers. It was a great place to work.
good,"Bag items from through out the store"
good,i worked over 4 years.  i worked in the frozen and dairy dept.  i always work above what was asked to do.  the changing of management is reason i'm not there now.  felt if what every i did  they did like.  i ask more then one time after the change how can i do what  need me to do better and the way you want.  got to point where one would tell me to do this  and the other would tell do it different.
good,Walmart is a great place to work. The managment was great. My manager was one of the best managers i have had ever. the hardest part of this job was probably the work/home life balance. My co-workers were good most of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i met.
good,A basic work day for me is 10pm-7am. Overnights is when the action happens. I learned you have to move fast and accomplish things in a timely manner. Management is great at times when you have things going on they work with you and adjust your schedule as needed. Overnights you really connect with your coworkers. The hardest part of the job is meeting the time requirements. At the end of shift for overnights is when your day is over because by the time your out of there you are ready for bed.
good,"I have learned to work with so many different, socio-economic groups and various cultures, different personality types, and management styles."
good,working at walmart is great all your co- workers were real helpful if had questions also management were very great.
good,"Managers were friendly. Work place was very clean."
good,Walmart is a alright place to work you can make a career out of working there. I think they need to do better with the management in the stores though. If I could I would work there again if given a chance.
good,I learned a lot working in the deli at Wal-Mart. I learned how to use and properly clean machines I had never used before.
good,"Steel toe boots hard hat vest and long hard work outside  in the elements. I learned how to sheet rock, tile and roofing. Strong leadership always willing to help. Co workers were very loyal."
good,"Worked as a unloader, stocker, cashier, and a lawn and garden associate. The experience there allowed me the experience of working at a busy business during the holidays. As well as, providing essential work experience. The hardest part of the job is days where there is more work then people to do it. Having the opportunity to meet those challenges and build relationships with coworkers and customers was a great experience that i would love to enjoy elsewhere as well."
good,"On a day to day basis, the job was easy and taught you the basic skills needed to function in a work place. It provided many opportunities to practice customer interaction and you developed a sense of cleanliness as you maintained your own department."
good,A typical day was enjoyable working with my co-workers and customers sometimes I would do other tasks other then my normal assigned work title.
good,"I worked as a part time optician, I worked with customers and tried to meet our goal sells for the week. The hardest part of the day was trying to meet our goals when we had no customers, most enjoyable part of the day when customers ask for you personally to help them with their purchase or glasses. The manager there wasnt that great, he would pick favorites,"
good,"fun place to work, easy to learn and great place if you enjoy customer interaction"
good,walmart was a great place to work I now have another child and need more room to grow. I'm looking for a company with room for advancement
good,They can work on training people better. And a lot of people to gossip so couldn't really make any friends or without saying or doing anything was talked about
good,"walmart is a good start off company, lack of managment, and communication skills is why i left"
good,"Walmart was my first job and it was somewhat of a roller coaster for me. I gained customer service and people skills, made lots of good friends, it was a nice, easy job. It was hard for me because at the time I was going to school full time, so I would be on my feet for 13-16 hours a day. The most enjoyable thing about working at Walmart was that it was convenient!"
good,This was one of the best walmarts I have ever been in. Everyone was actually nice and friendly compared to the last one.
good,"Management can be iffy at times, but overall a fair place to work."
good,Enjoyed the job. It was great learning experience. If you like cars then i suggest this job to anyone.
good,"good for people who want to start work early, though the pay is not really that good, you get great food and benefits. However it is not for people who just want to play around and not take anything seriously."
good,"Working for Walmart makes for an eventful day, while also time passing quickly. The company treats employees with respect and provides excellent benefits and opportunities."
good,I only worked for this company for a short while. I worked overnight installing new registers. As far as working overnight it really wasn't as bad as I initially thought it would be.
good,Majority of the positions are very repetitive but somewhat enjoyable as you progress working for Walmart. Management is pretty good at Walmart and ability to change shifts aren't difficult. Overall its a good place to work/
good,"Walmart isn't all that bad to work for, co workers become like family, you meet some very wonderful customers and for the most part have some great happy fun days. Management can seem a little intrusive at times."
good,"I would tend to put in a lot more work then other employees and not get recognized for the effort."
good,I check the returns at customer service. I zone the sales floor make sure everything looks nice. I stock all the freight. Make sure the sales floor is clean.
good,"- very busy and a lot of standing on your feet"
good,"A typical day at work you'd clock in and you're automatically assigned to your job assignment of the day, mine being a cashier. I can honestly say everything was taught to me by the system they use on the computers for new hire and to keep other employees up to date. I learned how to adjust to every customer I encountered on a day to day basis by the energy they produce. The management wasn't so good on discipline and more so the training process, as I said before the system provided was my trainer. There was no hard part to the job everything about it was something to enjoy as far as seeing how many credit cards you could up sale to making sure every customer leaves you with a smile. The most enjoyable part of the job is going above and beyond to assure that you address every need or want by our customers."
good,coworkers nice.  Didn't work to late in the evenings.  Pretty good about giving requested days off.
good,"most enjoyable dealing with the customers, moving up into different departments in only a few months"
good,Quite laid back but do what you're told to do.  Have good customer service and keep a smile on you're face.
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart.  Due to my child's handicap I had to quit.
good,After I clock in I usually go over the assigned tasks to see what job is to be done today I do a routine stretch so my body is working to ensure optimal performance then I proceed to the designated work area during this process I effectively communicate with team manager or crew member about work or life after work.
good,It's like they want you to choose between them or family. It's everybody for themselves because everybody wants to make production
good,"I Clock into work everyday and before I can even get out to the sales floor I am given a list of things to do from my Department manager that she didn't get done before her shift was up, so I make sure this list is done before I do anything else in the department unless a customer needs help then I stop what I am doing to help and focus on the customer.  The assistant store managers I have had a little bit of a problem with because between them there is little to no communication at all so you could be assigned to do a job by one manager and five minutes later you get told to drop what you are doing to do something different for a different manager and it causes a lot of confusion for everyone.  I don't have any problems with most of my co-workers we have a group of us that are hard working and when we are scheduled to work together everything gets done fast and is done right, there are a few that bother me at times because they will disappear in the backroom for hours talking to people who work in the back or hanging around with their significant others in the back and will leave fellow electronic associates out on the floor by themselves trying to do tasks and customer service alone, making it very stressful and causes friction even when a assistant manager is notified what is going on and no actions are taken to fix the problem.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to find what the customer is looking and dealer with upset customers,  you try so hard to make their experience in the store a good one and make sure they get what they came for but sometimes you just"
good,Always had a last working 3rds. The managers were great and so were my co workers. I only left because the pay wasn't good for the 10pm to 7am shift I was working.
good,"Fun work environment, would like to see a better path for advancement. workload is heavy but the compensation can be nice with bonuses"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart as far as the job responsibilities and customers were concerned.  There were usually not enough supervisors and/or managers available to handle all the employee questions.  Was always passed up for full-time employment due to my availability exceptions caused by being a single parent.  Was expected to work weekends and holiday for very little, if any, extra money.  However, I did meet a lot of wonderful people during my employment there."
good,I enjoyed working at walmart minus the unprofessional managerment and my coworkers.
good,my experience at walmart was decent. i was a stocker overnight so nothing to brag about. but the envirnment was great because you worked alone
good,Wal-mart gave me the chance to gain work experience. Prior to Wal-mart i had no work experience. I worked with a team of 7 guys. We removed freight from 18 wheeler trucks where we would work it on the sales floor.
good,"baking, cooking donuts and glazing. "
good,"management would constantly threaten employees with their jobs, no set schedules, overall employees were under appreciated. I did enjoy helping customers, learning new things, and the benefits."
good,"good team members, management wasn't the best for me, I did work tle and a day at work would be changing tires, batteries, oil , and fuel injection services"
good,"Llegaba a la bodega y limpiabamos como barrer y trapear para limpiar nuestra area de trabajo despues teniamos que ordenar la mercancia de acuerdo a los estantes que se manejaban en los estantes, teniamos una hora de comida y una de salida pero nunca saliamos a la hora estipulada dentro del contrato y no pagaban horas extra."
good,"A typical day at work involves the public and handling questions customers inquire about. I've learned quite a bit from my 3 plus years at Wal-Mart; filing skills, accounting and bookkeeping skills, and customer service. I would say the hardest part of my job, and this doesn't happen often, is dealing with angry customers. I honestly enjoy working with my co-workers and the benefit package I have through Wal-Mart is great."
good,"I always wanted to wear the blue nametag for some reason, it was kind of a goal of mine when I was in high school. I thought that it would be the perfect place to start my career but boy was I wrong. Yes they give out bonuses discounts and so on but what they don't tell you is that you have to be there one complete year before you receive anything (6 months for discount). Their healthcare plan sucks they will pay half of the expenses but then you're on your own after that but you have to meet a certain amount of requirements for them even to consider paying. I just couldn't take it anymore the management was terrible nothing ever got done and it was just a sucky place to be. They don't work around your needs or availability my manager told me ""Either you're here when we want you to be or you can leave."" so I left on to look for bigger and better opportunities. The hardest part about that place was that the chain of command was broken, badly. When it got busy on Fridays and Saturdays every department would be confused on what to do and how to do things. Especially my department. The store barely had any carts so when it got busy there would only be a slim number of carts for the customers, they are very short staffed from people getting fed up with the treatment or someone getting fired. I'm hoping it was just the store I worked at and not the entire Walmart franchise that is managed like this."
good,"Every thing was good I learned a lot in this job;how to help custumers and be nice with them,keep my area clean,how a register works and how to use it etc. The managers were great and the co workers too. We learned how to become a good team work and we also became friends."
good,Walmart is a great place to work.  You get a lot of hours and a lot of breaks.  Thw starting pay is very low but you do get a raise after a year I believe. There is lots of customer interaction.
good,"I love the associates I work with. The management lacks communication skills and guidance on how to tell associates what tasks to do. A typical day for me is spent at the register. I love my job, I love interacting with the customer and leaving them with positive interaction as their final associate encounter of their shopping trip. The hardest part of my job is not having the supplies I need to do my job properly. Running out of bags receipt tape is just unacceptable to me. Having registers that are broken for weeks on end is also a big problem. How can we serve our customers if we cant' utilize all the cash registers? That absolute best part of my day is talking with the customers. I love taking that one customer who is in a bad mood and turning his day around as to where he walks out with a smile on his face!"
good,A typical day at work is fast paced and full of things to do. My co-workers are easy to get a long with. The hardest part of the job is getting everything done in a certain time frame because there are many things that interrupt your pace.
good,Their managers are somewhat fair. They have great bonuses.
good,Walmart store 0716 needs a new manager. Employees are over worked. Store is under staffed. Store is not stocked and properly cleaned. Manager and assistant manager shows favoritism towards certain employees. Manger is very rude.
good,"It got to a point where I didn't enjoy going to work.  I was always getting in some sort of trouble, and when I went to management to try to fix the problem, he told me to look in the mirror and figure it out."
good,"A typical day at work would be to clean counters and windows of the pharmacy, move ready scripts to appropriate day, take out and dispose of old scripts no one has come to pick up, stock supplies, check-out scripts, handle payments for scripts, and answer customer questions to best of knowledge. I learned about different medications and how to manage time better. The most enjoyable part of the job was the staff. I did not find anything hard about this job."
good,best for the hands on experience and gives the opportunity to grow
good,"fast paced environment always on your feet, i learned that you can give the most excellent customer service and customers can still not be happy. hardest part of my job is to not be able to voice my opinion when customer is being disrespectful. most enjpyable part being able to work on modulers or working in the back"
good,Great place to work and the benefits are good and the pay is pretty decent.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is busy, but great atmosphere to work in. I have learned a lot of on the job experiences, such as learning new jobs, and love being a part of the team. I have the ability to be a team player, and bring my company business.  management at Wal-Mart is great, and they take the time to listen to you, and provide you with the necessities to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customer issues, but otherwise I have overcome them. Job is great. The work times vary, but otherwise a great company."
good,"I enjoy people and customer service so I had fun there.  Just don't expect to know the name of your immediate manager besides the CSM's because the managers for each area change often.  It's company policy to shift them around.  Attitude is key.  If you keep your spirits up (and those of co-workers),  things can go alright.  Customers are ill by the time they leave and so often appreciate a friendly cashier."
good,"For the pay, the job is terrible and its everyday cutbacks. I personally lived better on Ontario Works then the income i receive from Walmart canada also there is no job security and no manager really cares about there employees more people come and go rather then make a career out of walmart."
good,Safe environment everyone is willing to work as a team and best part of my job was to give my customers everything they needed so they can leave the store with a smile on their face.
good,"Overworker and Underpaid. There was never enough staff to fulfill job responsibilities. Employees were forced to work overtime to complete duties, and then were forced to cut time and received no pay for extra work. Employees were forced to leave early. Employees were written up for keeping overtime worked."
good,"Tough Place to work, just hang in there. I worked in Frozen Food, The freezer is so cold you can only stay in there for about 8 minutes before you feel so cold you think"
good,"While I have been employed at Wal-Mart Pharmacy I have learned most of what I know about medications, how to process them, and how to read doctor handwriting. During a typical day at work I would transition between the input station, filling station, and cash register while helping customers with inquiries. Managers in the pharmacy typically left after approximately two years. I have had six pharmacy managers since I have been employed. I have a good work relationship with my co-workers. We have a good environment and work as a team to efficiently fill prescriptions. The hardest part of my job would be working at a fast pace during the fist of the month rushes when we would fill an average of 700 prescriptions in a day. The most enjoyable part of the job has been learning about the medications."
good,Busy most days alot of time the management doesnt care about you and look at moving there career ahead at any cost.
good,marks was a nice place to work. the unfortunate part is its not very busy usually. customers that do shop at marks are usually very friendly and knowledgeable.
good,"Wal-Mart is a good company, although if you looking to advance its not."
good,"Very productive and busy, Learned that it is not easy to advance in this company as it was many years ago. Management ( Assistant, area Manager) do not supply the support needed for their area or associates. Co workers were enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job is doing the work of more than one person, not enough workers in department. Most enjoyable pleasing and serving customers"
good,"gostei de ter encontrado uma coisa que eu gosto de fazer,entrei na empresa sem experiência,onde confiaram em mim,na minha capacidade,e me treinaram para uma profissâo onde eu pudesse exercer fora da empresa, os colegas de trabalho, super em harmonia  um com o outro,sempre ajudando uns aos outros. a parte dificil era quando tinha clientes que nâo sabiam respeitar o seu ambiente de trabalho xingavam você, entâo ali surgiu mais uma experiência que acho que vou levar pra vida toda,aprendi que é saber lidar com a situaçâo,é você respirar fundo e deixar acontecer,ou seja o cliente tem sempre razâo,e isso me ajudou a aprender a superar momentos de clientes furiosos."
good,the pay was nice got arise ever year and after your first year you get a bonuses if your store made its sales.i worked overnights so trying to balance the work and persanal time was hard. the management most the time don't know what is going on and when you need them the most the are no where to be found. co-workers are nice and fun ppl to be around.
good,"Boa empresa, com pensamento no meio ambiente, boa harmonia com os colegas de trabalho."
good,"Boa empresa com politica forte no que tange as cultura de respeito ao individuo, me proporcionou um conhecimento e visão clara das relações de operações com abastecimento de unidades e rapidez no  tratamento das oportunidade de imediato."
good,Early day with a nlot off stress from head office due to reports.Learned how to work with customers and senior excecutive level.Co workers are respectfull if treated with the same respect you want in return.Hardest part of the job is the unions trying to influid the workers.Most enjoyable job in making budget and profit at end of each month.
good,I think that it is a good company need better managers but over all a great place to work.
good,"Uma empresa de grande porte e muito organizada."
good,"Enjoyed working at Walmart. I learned a lot about customer service working here. I handled pricing merchandise, stocking, cashier. Room to grow with company."
good,Its a cool job family environment. A lot of childish activity at times and people are usually talking to one another or customers. I recommend to college students or high school seniors. Also good for the elderly or people who needs a second job. Schedules are flexible if you are well liked....
good,"Alot of cleaning, cooking, stocking, and waiting on customers."
good,"This was the best job i have experienced with. many activities, and busy days"
good,Wal Mart was a great environment as far as the other employees. The head of the cashiers was never there so management was no up to par.
good,"You may be hired to work in the Garden Shop, but you end up in the Hardware Department work in that department."
good,"Good place to work, some management problems, good job advancement"
good,"Management need help with people skills. ""I had to go in on my day off because my Co-Mgr said I did not complete a Xmas set. So required to give half a day (I was salaried)I went in to document what I had done and verify that was all the merchandise that I had. I got a phone call telling to come in or else. I also had an employees take my drivers license credit card from my purse and proceed charge items from our store while in route to another Wal-Mart. They attempted to charge at another Wal-Mart at 2:48am but the card had been cancelled. I was told by Wal-Mart security----They didn't steal from Wal-Mart so they were not going to do any thing even though a police report had been filed."""
good,"aprendi en este trabajo a usar una caja registradora, mis colegas con buena disposicion a darnos informacion y a ayudarnos en nuestros primeros dias. la gerencia amable pero estricta"
good,"I enjoyed getting to know most of the people there and really enjoyed the variety of departments I could shop from and additionally enjoyed the food bar for lunch,but thought some of the policies were  ridiculous.For example,as a technician-in-training I got written up for things that were accidents,but no room for forgiveness!! And even certified technicians would be written up for things that were not always under their control,like  accidentally breaking  a sensor in customers tires. You can't always prevent everything!!!!"
good,The only thing problem I had working there was the scheduling. The schedule was computer generated and getting two days off in a row was practically impossible.
good,A normal day would consist of lots of customers in and out often times never having enough staff to check the customer out in a timly fashion . the people I had under me worked very hard to do the best they could often against great odds. Many of the other employees became like family often creating some great friendships
good,"The job is a really good job for me- I enjoy fast paced work and being able to manage others. However, the benefits were not the best and pay raises were extremely small, even when being promoted from an hourly associate to an hourly manager/supervisor. "
good,I have taken a lot from this job as I learned management and time management skills.
good,"The pay is not that great, but it is a lot of fun working with your co-workers."
good,"Poor compensation for a physically demanding job at a fast pace. "
good,A em presa Wal-Mart prepara pessoas em diversas áreas para o mercado externo
good,"Help customers get their purchases paid for in a timely manner, while being considerate of their feeling..."
good,Made lots of friends while working there. Was fun fast paced and stayed busy
good,"Would consist of getting all of the rocket carts emptied and put away onto the shelves before the truck comes, then if the truck comes unload the truck, down stack the merchandise onto rocket carts, then unload the rocket carts onto the shelves where the merchandise belongs, I have learned that I am a strong woman who can do anything she puts her mind to, the hardest part of the day is actually nothing its pretty easy."
good,walmart is a family store the minute corporate stepped in it became a circus .
good,Your basically hired to do whatever management tells you to do. You have to work fast to get all of it done. Which isn't that bad but when you couple that with customers coming to you and asking where things are and you have to take them to the items you have to work faster to finish what needs to be done. You will be there as long as you can perform what needs to be done.
good,"Was a cashier at Wal-Mart and enjoyed working with the customers and staff.  I needed to stay alert to each transaction to ensure correct money exchange, to help the customer if needed, and to leave a good feeling for Wal-Mart  with customers as they left."
good,didn't like working here and moved on to a different job. i was hired to move on to a permanent position and was let go because of seasonal needs. wouldn't have wasted my time if i had known.
good,walmart is a great place to work if it is ran correct and everyone is respecting each  other and are the same page.
good,A typical day of work includes disposing of outdated meats and slicing and preparing sandwhich meats in deli.
good,A typical day would depend on which department you were working in. A cashiers day is much different than a stockers day.
good,I loved working with my Dept. Mgr. She showed me how to use the handheld device when no one else would. We worked very well together.
good,"a typical day would be 9 hours and it would be fast paced and non stop always busy, there was always something to do. learned a lot how to deal with customers and associates. the management would be good it depended on who was working that day, some helped better then others. my co workers were great would work right along with you. the hardest part of the day came when customers yelled and put you down and when that happened sometime the managers wouldn't back you they would just give In no matter the issue. the most enjoyable part was working with your co workers the made the day enjoyable"
good,"I love working for Wal-Mart. I am just searching for jobs that pretain to my career and education. Wal-Mart is pretty busy year round the coworkers that stick around are great people, the management changes quite often making it hard to adjust to attitudes. The hardest part of the job is waiting for CSMs to bring money or help with customer problems. I love people and enjoy meeting and associating with different people each day."
good,Wal-Mart is a family working environment. Friendly faces and patrons.
good,"i worked with a great team, and upper managers were pleasant. we kept the deli, in a billion dollar store, running smoothly. cooking hot ready to serve food, and slicing meat and cheese. we were inspected once a month by Kay Chemical, we always received a high pass."
good,"A lot of very good people to work with for the most part, very hectic and has a good schedule for management if that is what you work"
good,ótimo lugar pra se trabalhar mais com poucas promoções e com alguns colaboradores com pouca força de vontade que ñ exercia o trabalaho certo e sobrava pra quem os exercia
good,"My typical day at work coming in and starting my work, i have learned alot of skills while at my job, managment is ok they can do a alot better about conditions of the store, my co-workers are excellent get along very nice the hardest part is coming into the store and cleaning up 2 early shift mess.

good,Colegas maravilhosos q me ajudaram muito a aprender a minha função na loja.
good,"A typical day for me would be clock in, hang up my coat, go over to apparel. Then I would find out what area I was in f ro the day, grab a cart, and go put items in the place they belong. Once I was done with that task I would go face items, and while I did that I would eliminate empty boxes, and I would put broken or messed up items into a cart and then go fill out a form to chalk the item up as a loss."
good,"Alright if you just need a job, run into a rude customer every now and then"
good,You don't make much. I started off 7.85 because I worked in electronics which is the highest paid position besides the bakery. The job wasn't really that bad it was the managers who were horrible. Since its 24 hour be prepared to leave no earlier than 10. Overall its a decent job while in school or looking for something else.
good,"A typical day is a day when customers behaved very well to employees, and employees worked as a team with a lot of fun and laughter. I learned that when people work together the task becomes easy and worth doing. The management at Wal-Mart was very accommodating. Management allowed to determine their schedule, and stick to it. The hardest part of the job was the unnecessary attacks by some customers, whilst the most enjoyable part was the encouragement, and appreciation offered by decent customers."
good,"Decent place to work. Decent pay with benefits like paid vacation and sick time, 401k, etc. Management can be a hit or miss. Co-workers tend to be fairly unhappy with the job, management, working environment, and it lowers moral a lot of the time."
good,"worked there for 9 1/2 years.was a great place to work the first 8 years.employees and management cared for each other and we had fun then we got a new manager and he started firing people on false charges especially the worker that were approach 10 years or more service,you go in that store today and employees treat the customers badly .no one waits on you.employees are terrified to move because of management.no one is friendly.when i worked ther before the current manager got there we cared for our customers and we cared for each other.we were friendly,waited on some one when they got near you/"

good,"I leered allot working for Wal-Mart assisting customers on finding the right items to helping the pay bills, return, and exchange them. I trained over 5 employees answered phones and keep the store clean"
good,I really like the people at Wal-mart but when someone is let go they expect you to do the work of two people which is almost impossible.  I work first shift and when I come in in the mornings I have to do work they leftover and did''t do.  They hardest part of the job was stocking materials that come in on high rise shelves by yourself when they weigh over 50 llbs.  The most enjoyable was my co-workers.
good,"checking out all different kinds of people"
good,"Working as a cashier and a service writer, work can be overwhelming. but you must come and leave work with a positive attitude. must be prepared for any type of work."
good,"Learned most of retail experience, as well as many skills in different departments."
good,"Usually at work if I open I take care of doing the books to count inventory of phones. Do the shrink log, which consists of sales counts for phones the previous day. I enjoy my co workers and managers. The hardest part of my job is just dealing with difficult customers whom don't understand that I can only do so much before having to refer them to a manufacturer or carrier of a product. Most enjoyable part is when I help someone solve their problem and having the satisfaction of knowing I helped someone."
good,Wal-Mart will give anyone a chance.  They helped me when I needed it most.
good,"Typically the overnight shift was fun and very busy. I learned so much about retail while I worked there. Management was normally good however they didn't always understand certain things. Co-workers were always good and was fun out going and always a good laugh very hard working and helpful. The hardest part of my job was the ladders big heavy and sometimes awkward but I always enjoyed the people I worked with, I love customer service."
good,Wal-mart at one time was a family business now it is all changed. I enjoy my customers and meeting new  people everyday. Being at Wal-mart has taught me a lot about the retail world.
good,They have good pay and offer benefits after 6 monthes employment.The manager didn't seem to care much about the employees when it came to health issues. I felt there was favortism among the employee/management relations.
good,there's is nothing really hard about working at walmart its just another day another penny the work is just boring when we get done with everything we do picks for about 2 and ahalf hours and that sucks. my most enjoyable part is lunch cause im not in that store. th coworkers are alright we some of them most of them are just air heads. i just dont like the job cause i am gone from 4 pm to 1 am and all my money goes to gas and i never have money to do anything and i never get to see my family. i guess what i am trying to say is i hate working at walmart.
good,i barley got to see the manger and when i had a problem with schduling to work around school they was not fair at all.
good,A typical day would be when u go in knowing your agenda on what to do and get done and then its all changed as soon as you get there.I learned most of my people skills from fellow workers who work there.Managment is very poor and does not know how to talk their employees.Most co-workers are great and they know how to brighten your day.The hardest part of my job was no communication from Management when a certain task was to be done.I mostly enjoyed some staff members and the customers.
good,Walmart gave me the opportunity to travel and experience things I probably would not have.
good,I worked the graveyard shift with Walmart.  I really enjoyed the stocking part of my job.  We had a lot of fun on the job.
good,A typical day at work usually starts with a department meeting. After the meeting it's get your assigned tasks.
good,I loved working here but was not aware that when I had my surgery that I would be fired.
good,one year and a month of doing whatever the disorganized tarts needed/wanted
good,"Taking care of customers needs in a grocery store was difficult at times but overall I enjoyed this job. I learned that I was dyslexic while doing daily paperwork and deposits. Management was great, they did their job and helped out if we got busy. I loved my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when the store closed. I enjoyed most aspects of the job."
good,"Then unloader position is the back room, unloading trucks and seperating items onto pallets, after truck or trucks are done, you have to go help stock or help grab carts in the parking lot."
good,"unloading trucks all day a lot of heavy lifting. It was okay working at walmart."
good,"I worked for Walmart for approximately 5 years. The customers can be a handful at times. Holidays are frantic, but I love the fast-paced atmosphere. Different coworkers every so often but most were nice and willing to learn. Management listens but that is about all. You have to really continue to address a issue for action to be taken (ex. transfers, schedule changes) The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new and diverse people each and every day."
good,"they state family values the work the opposite, no flex on family issues on attendance"
good,"Not very much room for upward movement, low pay and long shifts."
good,"I would do tire mounting, rotations, and balances. I also would assist with oil changes and friendly customer service. "
good,"Sit in your cubicle and produce.  Each of us had to get through 15 inches of paperwork in a week which consisted of invoicing claims that were filed against the vendors invoice.  During my time there, I learned how the logistics of shipments came about in the retail world.  Our management would move around a lot so it was hard to get to know any one manager.  The hardest part was trying to advance in the work place.  The team I worked with was a great group of ladies and we cheered each other up when we were having a stressful day."
good,"i enjoyed my job there, helping customers, customer service was key to success here. It was a job that i received unexpected surprises. The crew was easy to work with and i made a lot of friends. A typical work day involved stocking a lot of shelves, it was very tiring and when i would get home i was always spent, but i enjoyed it. Management was a whole seperate issue, not the best"
good,"I was a customer service manager on the front end of a WalMart Super Center.  I was responsible for 20+ cashiers and registers.  I had direct contact with the public for answering questions and solving problems.  My job include several different forms of payment(ie. cash, check, credit card) and i was responsible for every cash register in the the store.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers but the upper management at my super center needs more training when it came to running a cash register, a return/exchange register and money center transactions.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being on the front lines and one on one contact with the customers."
good,"I like most of the people I worked with.  Management in one store to another is completely different.  Leadership styles were so different going from one store to another and the transition wasn't easy.  Pay from one store to another differed more than expected.  "
good,"A typical day consist of stocking,cleaning,pricing,labeling,zoning,and most importantly customer service."
good,"fun to work here, you see so many different things. The only bad thing is the low pay rate"
good,"A typical day at work as a Walmart Store Standards included various different tasks which allowed for obtaining more skills rather than specialized positions such as cashiers."
good,quantity over quality and the teachers pets per say get to stand around while you work you butt off which can be very frustrating. management could be better trained in my opinion.
good,"•	Attached identifying tags to containers or mark them with identifying information."
good,"Great Associates, the people who work there make you feel like a family. Management need some improvement."
good,Good be very stressful when there was a line for the deli and people get inpatient. Co-worker were nice but you knew who the slackers were.  Hard part when someone called off and you had to pick up the pace to cover.  Still had to clean everything to shut down.  Felt good at the end of the day like I accomplished something good. 
good,oversee the running of the frontend the environment and customers were wonderful
good,Lá comecei no setor administrativo e depois fui pra recepção ajudar á atender os telefonemas  
good,"I know that the customers are very important but it's kind of hard to keep your cool when they're constantly getting angry with you just so they can get a discount or free stuff and yelling vulgar things at you. Like come on, everyone has a limit, and I quit because I reached mine."
good,"Secure job security"
good,"Wonderful place to work, getting to spend everyday with kids that do nothing but make you laugh is prefect. "
good,"I loved this job while i was employed, the hours were great. the hardest part was trying to get work accomplished with a heavy load and few workers. "
good,"The one thing that I like about working at Walmart is the schedule, we work three days on three days off. "
good,"todo dia apredemos algo novo, a direcao e otima com muitas reunioes, muito dialogo com funcionarios o que acho otimo"
good,"Opening and closing procedures."
good,"I feel that my time with Wal-mart was very valuable to me growing as person. The skills I learned while working there allowed me to start a business doing the same kind of work. I showed me the meaning of being a part of a team even when all members of the team don't get along. Overall the people that I worked with were excellent co-workers, but the management were not very good at communicating their needs to support a smooth transition and work environment."
good,"A typical day at work involves a great deal of customer support. I would order merchandise to stay in stock, maintain a neat and clean environment and supervise up to three associates. I set floor merchandising plans and maintain an accurate computer inventory.  My employment with this company has taught me many things, I am excellent with customer support. I'm proficient with microsoft office, word, excel, etc. I have worked in different areas of the store so I have developed the skill of learning new tasks quickly.  Overall I think the management team is great, I only wish that communication was better. I absolutely love the coworkers, there is a strong sense of family, teamwork. The hardest part of the is adjusting to new changes. Walmarts expectations and policies change on a daily basis.  The most enjoyable part is the people you get to meet whether its customer or coworkers. I love the diverse environment and helping others give me a sense of acheivement."
good,this walmart wasnt that organized couple of good managers and supervisors the really used favoritism there  always short staffed the most enjoyable thing about the job was the people you meet 
good,"A typical day at work would be, punching in, walking to the front, see what register you were on, work for a few hours, some days were great, and some day's weren't all that good but we dealt with it."
good,"Great procedures, great culture, and great benefits.  However,  due to my experience and background, it is not a great fit for me.  I would love to work in my area where I'm passionate."
good,You have your pros and cons about the job. some easy going people to get along with and just some difficult ones that complains a lot. As   far as customers you have ones that know what they want. And the others who are rude thinking we make the material or device by hand or something.
good,"Not to bad."
good,"A typical day at work depends on what department I work in that particular day. It usually consists of sorting out cartfuls of clothes or putting out freight, making labels for clothes, making clothes look neat on racks and shelves, answering phone calls, realigning messages, assisting costumers with their requests, and keep watch over the fitting rooms. What I have learned is how to work better with different personalities. Management is good about persistence. I can’t really say too much about them. They are good on persistence and task management. My co-workers are nice and good people to work alongside with. The hardest part of the job is getting tasks done in a particular order or time frame. The most enjoyable part of the job is some of the personalities that are encountered."
good,"Typical days were never the same, always had customer with tire, battery, oil changes and ect., Lots of face to face customer interaction."
good,Good place to work besides the constant sweat its always hot in here no matter the time of year. Other than the heat i enjoyed working here.
good,would got to work and perform duties for that day but more than half the time had to work overtime because the managers would always want me personally to go help in a different department. i learned a lot of things and i am pretty confident that one day i can become a manager at a company the hardest part of my job would have to be that the pay wasnt all that great for all the work i was doing. and the most enjoyable part was that it was walmart so there was always some kind of drama happening as far as with the customers people going in and trying to steal things from the store.
good,"I would've enjoyed walmart more if i was assigned the job applied for. i was an unload-er whose job was to unload the trucks and pull the freight to the floor. as simple as that sounds we had a timeline to meet which we occasionally met. i enjoyed the work place because of the co-workers, they made the job more relaxing in the stressful environment that i was in. overall the pay was excellent hours were great but the work and management could've been way better."
good,This is a job that is totally based on sales and customer service.
good,"came to work, cleaned area, stocked what needed to be stocked, assisted customers, cleaned, went home."
good,Responsible for retrieval and inventory of store shopping carts. Assist customers with large carry-out items. Maintenance of store entryway as well as interior store aisles. Assist in other areas as directed by supervisor.
good,"Good place to work, but compensation does not meet the workload."
good,cleaning registers empty trash and hangers sweep floors zone shelves and endcaps check customers out. I've learned better ways to deal with customers how to do alot of different transactions. Most co-workers are great to work with get along good and share responsabilities. Hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers. Enjoy working hard and having things to do to make the shift go by faster.
good,"a typical day include rude customers, managers who dont care about your availability. co-workers are nice but will try to get in your business."
good,"Easy to promote, family environment, excellent management."
good,"As a current employee with Wal-mart , I have learned and experienced the didfferent aspects of how to deal with the public and the employees that I oversee as a Customer Service Manager. Being a people person I encounter so many different personalities with the customers and employees which is most enjoyable part of my job."
good,A typical day at work consists of cart pushing and keeping the window fill for customers. What I have from my experience of working at walmart is how to be patient with customers and to be the best worker I can be. The hardest part of this job was working outside in the weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of this jobs was working with my fellow associates..
good,It was pretty fun working here but there are times where you get high volume and there was little to no help.
good,"Over all Wal-Mart is an okay place to work. the employees were great, management was alright, it just seemed as if some of my bosses were lost at times. and asking me questions they should know the answer to, but overall it was an okay work environment."
good,The managment wanted more work with less people. the day and shifts got all the perks. the night shift had to work extra hard during the times of visits by corporate.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart began with putting your running shoes on as you walk through the door. I was constantly busy and always had something to do. This being the first retail job for me, I learned a lot. I gained valuable expereince from the inside rather than just be a consumer. Meeting people from all walks of life and their expereinces help me grow as a person. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and associates I met."
good,"I enjoyed working with my peers as a team. Good conversations, Good working relationships. Management was changed too much. They have a reputation of letting people ""go"" because of age rather than work ability. Of course they come up with other reasons so they cannot be accused of discrimination."
good,clean off the lot. assist customers. bring in carts. and stock shelves.
good,"I worked in the pharmacy at Walmart for just over 2 years. The job itself wasn't too hard and the work done often made the day go by fast. Helping patients always leaves a good feeling but there are those patients that could not be satisfied no matter what was done. In the actual pharmacy, each person usually had his or her daily tasks. Some days some people would slack off and nothing was said about it. The management within the pharmacy had their favorites and those favorites usually got away with more."
good,The hardest part of my job was under staff. A typical day 2 trucks with 2500 pieces needing to be unloading and entered in the system.
good,Walmart can be a difficult place to work yet fun at times. Most the staff is very friendly and enjoyable to be around. Hours and pay can be just satisfactory. Everyday is different then the one before.
good,Sometimes felt as if we were totally seperated from all other parts of the company. Only heard from management when they were changing things or doing away with hours. Pay was competitive but not really worth the hassle of working for the management.
good,"always moving things around to get the product out, i learn that not everything is put on the shelves at all times, management there is lacking when you need them for something. i can work with everyone that is on the team. the hardest part of the job is that there isn't many workers that will stay for long when they are working. i enjoy work my best to get the job done with the team that i put together to finish the job before i'm done."
good,"A typical workday started with being introduced to the script and product of the day for what we would be calling customers about (service, subscription, etc.). After being introduced we would be given a few minutes to read over the paperwork before starting to call people to inform them of what they were being offered. After lunch there would be a short meeting to see what was working and what was helping to sell more or less. The co-workers were always trying to help each other in order to obtain the sales quota needed and to achieve bonuses for individuals and for the company as a whole. The hardest part of the job was learning how to take the objective and criticism from some people about telemarketing but the best part of job was getting to talk to so many people. This job taught me how to handle high sales stress situations as well as how to manage conversations in order to obtain a better form of communication."
good,"Everyday I would clock in, go into our office, check our emails, check our desks for any notes, grab a walkie talkie, hide it in our bag or purse and start our routine walk through of the store. The routine walk through would be to point out any safety hazards or anything that needed to be locked up that wasn't"
good,"good job, but managment is not well organized. scheduling was real good, they do work with you if your going to school."
good,"My typical day at work included a lot of customer interaction, phone contracts, photo help, cleaning the department, stocking, and changing out displays. I learned a lot about customer service, I thought I knew a lot until I started working at Walmart, I loved that I was always busy. Co-workers are great for the most part and management keeps you very busy, but aren't always that dependable when it comes to helping. I loved doing phone contracts for customers and just customer interaction over all was great, I never have a day where I don't smile from something a customer says or does."
good,"This was a fun place to work. Your co-workers, management was always very helpful. I learned a lot about sales, retail and inventory here. Hardest part was trying to forecast what people would want to buy during seasonal times. Trends would always change."
good,when i started at wal-mart i liked it but not long after that it turned it to a place of hell to work anybody that lie's gets what they want but for me my work is what i wanted to show what i can do so i never got a chance to show what i could do i got turned down 11 time's in 2/yrs so i gave up and walked out there was nothing for me there anymore
good,Walmart is not the best place to work for unless the hire you full time otherwise you are working close to 40hrs but not 40 to keep from getting the benefits from the comany its great for a little extra cash but unless you are fulltime you cant get your full benefits
good,I assisted in the disassembly of a Wal-Mart store which had closed and moved to a larger location.
good,Great place to visit different areas of work and learn new things. I love always learning something new and this was an opportunity for me to get that by working in various departments with wonderful people and customer service was great. Love working with the public and assisting customers.
good,"Muy buena dispocision a la hora de realizar las tareas, manejo de facturas y control de precios, buena atención de parte de mis superiores, buenos compañeros ya q la intención es el trabajo en equipo, el trato al cliente en los tiempos q vivimos la gente se enoja por los precios y la falta de tolerancia en cuanto a las creencias de cada uno, la tranquilidad a la hora de realizar mis tareas."
good,"Walmart was my life for 4 years. i lived by the Walmart code and made sure everyone did everything the way it was supposed to be, i taught my coworkers and associates things they didn't know and new things that helped them exceed. even managers were always learning something new from me."
good,"a good place to work,but poor leadership! the paste was fast. learning new receipts was fun. the customers where nice."
good,"Todo meu conhecimento em Administração devo a eles,mas infelizmente eles não reconhecia que ao falar com as pessoas estavam falando com um ser humano e não com um cachorro,a parte mas difícil era lidar com a gerências e o ambiente era um local agradável."
good,"Go to my register. log in, Clean my area make sure its nice and clean before helping a cutomer. Ive learned how to use a register , ring customers up , bag their items properly. There isnt anything really hard about the job, some customers can be mean but I have learned what to do or say to make the customer happy. Best part is seeing every customer happy ! management : poor ! Get along very well with all my co-workers."
good,walmarts benifits package is awful but the fast pace envoirnment is fun and everyday is different
good,"It and ok place to work... You feel like trying to get your area done , they call you or your employees in your area to other areas of the store to get that area done.... and your area is getting nothing done.. it seem like managers come in the door and just keep movie employees around to put out fires in that area because they have no one to work in that area... daily issue...."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart has definitely been an interesting ride. Within two years, I've gone from cashier, to service desk, to CSM, to sales floor, and now that I've been on the sales floor I know how to do pretty much anything and everything. Hello job security."
good,I worked at Wal-Mart for 3 months. I enjoyed the work and the people that I worked with. I got along very well with my managers. I was told when I first got hired that the company would keep the employees that had good work ethics. I worked very hard then when the 3 months was up they fired all temporary employees. I was told that I could come back when they are hiring again but I do not know when that is.
good,Gostei muito de trabalhar com eles muito legal a empresa e muito boa msm.
good,Huge Corporation involvment down to the shelf spacing in-store.
good,i worked there for 10+ years and in the end had health and personal problems that caused me to quit
good,Good place to work nice for meeting new peolpe and co-works. I was Responsible for stocking the store warehouse with merchandise arrivals.
good,"My days at work were filled with different things to do. I enjoyed being busy all day. I worked with alot of different people, but the hardest part was having to anwser to like 10 different managers."
good,"Opportunities for overtime, good pay, easy job, irregular hours"
good,"fun, besides people keeping you from doing the job you were hired to do..."
good,"Busy enviroment,i enjoying interacting the customers. i appreciate the management team and my co-workers"
good,stock shelve
good,Job task are easy to handle and the employees and fun and interesting.
good,Typical day includes unloading trucks and moving items out to the sales floor to me stocked. Labor job that didn't require much mental capacity. Management was fair in their dealings with employees. Co-workers were for the most part task-oriented. Hardest part of the job was the compensation.
good,"I loved the people I worked with, they made working there so much fun. I learned to not get overwhelmed when there is a huge line up, just take one person and a time and don't stress yourself out. And no matter what, always smile even if the customer isn't very pleasant."
good,Since I have been with the company I have learned how solve problems as well as make effective decisions. I am responsible for making sure that associates have tasks daily and make sure that they are carried out in a timely manner. I am responsible for inventory and making sure that the counts are correct and audits are completed daily. I am responsible for making sure that the schedules are completed and time off request are approved or denied.
good,"I love working for Wal-Mart, I just didn't think I could get in trouble for speaking my mind in a open door company, when I feel like my department manager is trying to write me up for everything I didn't wrong, and I the person who is keeping his department running smooth"
good,"stocking shelves, working in garden center, loading and unloading trucks and customers"
good,stressfull short breaks no job security. MANAGEMENT WERE VERY STRICT . YOU COULD NOT GET THE DAYS YOU WOULD WANT SCHEDULED OFF
good,Working at Wal-Mart has been a rewarding experience and i have acquired many different skills
good,"I like my job. However, I am a single parent and do not get enough hours to support my family. Hours have been cut across the store and therefore I am not eligible for benefits."
good,"While there is room for growth and advancement, it requires political maneuvering to get ahead in this company (like most). Otherwise, if not for inconsistent scheduling, a great company to work for."
good,"There was no hard part to this job, a typical day was slow until the evening and the weekends extremely busy ,that's what I enjoyed about working at Wal-mart. I enjoyed working with the public, sometimes it did get a little crazy but I knew how to work with it and my day would be good. I leaned to handle difficult situations with customers."
good,Most days were very busy. I learned a lot about dealing with the public and revieved new job skills. Management and co-workers were enjoyable to work with. Hardest part of the job was when too many tasks were to be completed in too short of time. Most enjoyable part was dealing with new people every day and chalanges.
good,"A typical day at work was usually a breeze. Except for managers,they could'nt care less about how you felt. I enjoyed the different people that came in the store every day."
good,"The reason I rated work/ and life balance so low is because I worked grave yard shift. It totally turned my life backwards and I don't care for graveyard but I do it out of desperation. A typical day at work was bearable. The co-workers for the most part were very nice, friendly and respectful people. That was the main thing that kept me working there. The other factor was this present tough economy. Sometimes I have this fear of leaving my current job for something better and then getting laid off two months later. That would not be good."
good,This was one of my favorite jobs I've held but they needed me to be flexible and work various shifts. Management was too much into personal relations with the staff then being professional for the work place.
good,"Co workers ignorant, working there was fine if you didnt talk to nobody"
good,Great time for a person that wants to know everything about the family work place.
good,Easy work but most work hard to prove yourself fast pace must be able to handle it
good,"Stock products, assist customers, and cash out customers. The store had poor management, but the department I worked in, we were really close with one another. Had fun."
good,"The hardest part is finding time to spend with family. Its kind of hard to get appreciated for the hard work that you do, but I enjoy hepling customers find what they need. The work environment is fast paced most of the time. You are often expected to do a many tasks at once."
good,"A typical day at Walmart was good, everyone knows Walmart is one of the most busiest store around the world and there is always something to do. I learned how to run the money center and customer service my 2 years there. Certain management there was great and took thetime to actually make things right but then you have some that was not. My co-workers there were nice and kept the my day strolling. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable was getting the nice customers and your line continuing to move in a fast pace."
good,I enjoyed leaving people with a smile. the management REALLY sucked. The personal lady was so rude. i would return to walmart but just not the one i worked at.
good,always busy with something to do. great customers. can advance into other areas such as pharmacy technician.
good,"Customer Service, Retail Associate and contribute in helping with my strong Customer Service background. Customer Service in Retail Material handling, Stocking ,Merchandise, Inside sales"
good,A typical day at WalMart would start off by clocking in and heading out to the sales floor to find out what my job duty was for the day bu either scanning my badge or looking in the book. After finding out my tasks if I was closing all I would have to do is close the department down latter that night and in the meen time I would either help customers or find something to do that needed to be done. I would have to interact with the customers on a regular basis either in person or on the phone. In between putting freight away I would have to ring customers up or go to the back and pull merchandise that we didnt keep on the floor. By the end of the night I would go around to make sure that all the locks were secure and that everything was dusted.
good,I enjoyed the job as I got to learn many new skills and was able to utilize my training.
good,I have worked for this company twice. I enjoyed the people I worked with and am currently working with. Hardest thing about this place is trying to get gratitude for the job you do.
good,"Its a paycheck. The other employees are nice, management is focused on corporate standards."
good,"My overall work experience was good, I learned alot about warehouse work and doing inventory. I also learned how to drive forklifts and other heavy machinery. The hardest part of the job is the hours i worked. the most enjoyable part was interacting with new people."
good,"Being the manager of the Dairy and Frozen food department, I was very busy at all times but the help that was given me made it seem like working with family. After the holidays, my help was cut by two thirds leaving me with the same amount of work and no help to get things completed on a timely basis. The manager of the store was a 24 year old boy right out of the toy department and was unable to balance work and employees. He was later let go, but I took time off to take some college courses."
good,Pulled in a lot of directions. I did enjoy working with such a diverse variety of people. Would fill bakers department with various baked goods. Also did a lot of the baking/packaging of breads and rolls.
good,"Mangmt is always looking over ur shoulder when they say 15 min break they MEAN IT, not 15 mins and 30 secs. My co- workers were great to work with, we had each others back. Because we were all in the same boat. Unloading loading trucks, stocking, crushing the cardboard and loading it outside. Learned how to use a forklift, hardest part is trying to please mangmt. Best part is working with my coworkers"
good,"Walmart treated me well. It was very, very difficult to get with HR to process a transfer and therefore it never happened."
good,"My typical day at walmart is helping customers get the satisfication that they expected when coming into walmart. I provide feedback as well as listen to complants, I deal with the complants in a respectful manner, by suggesting ways that walmart can fix the problem. I also deal with returns/exchanges. As well as Western Union."
good,"hard to have personal time when wanted,insufficient staffing,company more concerned with numbers than staff,management always miserable"
good,"A typical day would include balancing cash office, collecting money from all registers, and inputting information into the computer, having loans ready, balancing register to $200 every night. I learned how to do cash deposits and how to verify money from the bank. Management was always easy to work with. The hardest part of my job would be when there was a mistake made making the cash office being either over or short. I loved that job!!"
good,I worked for Walmart for a little over 3 years. Management was the ultimate decision for my leaving the company.
good,"I worked in retail.cashiering, customer service, stocking, merchandise dispays, phone operator answering over 1000 calls daily, trained new hires with job responsiblities based on excellent management skills. Every job was a challenged since I was an overachiever, I would make sure that I was exceeding department standards in sales to ensure that I would receive bonuses quartely. The biggest statisfaction was providing exceptional customer service. I would make each customer experience very rewarding."
good,"A day at work for me will consist of coming into work checking my departments coverage, aslo walking the department to make sure we have little to no outs and if so its on order. My co-workers and management team are always handy when im faced with a problem or situation and I need insight. The hardest part of the job is managing the different personalities of my associates. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with all different types of people."
good,"My day as a Department Manager/Associate opening of Health/Beauty Department with reading daily reports, inventory reports, data entry, unloading pallets, stocking of products, price changing,comp pricing,customer service, employee asignments, shipping/receiving of product, sales, program loading of sales, modular changes, promoting of products, and deadlines. Working with employees at a retail store I will have some good/bad days. The hardest part of the job was trying to unloading 3-4 pallets with out taking product back to the stock room. The most enjoyable part of the job is when all your scheduled employee's come to work, when no product go back to the stock room, your department sales go up for the mouth, and I had no complains from customer's."
good,"A typical day at work included stocking and removing expired products from the wall. It also included providing customer service to customers and helping them when they needed help finding an item. I learned to be patient and realized that not everyone will have a positive attitude when approaching you. Management was understanding, although sometimes they were unfair to some employees. My co-workers were hard workers and friendly. The hardest part of the was trying to work a three man job alone. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"i started off in 2000 as a softlines (clothing) retail/sales floor associate. then i was moved to work in various depts. throughout the store. During the last year I was there, I worked as a Bakery Associate/cake decorator. the job was great and so were most of my co-,workers. however, a cost-Dept starts off at 7.50, where as I was still making 6.80. i was supposed to receive a money raise for being transferred to that dept. that didnt happen so needless to say I am just not pleased with some off their staff."
good,I enjoyed this job but it was no room to grow in positions at this location.
good,"Wal-mart provided good training and some advancements for a few employees. If you're working the front end area, it's not likely that you will be promoted to a different area."
good,"The company Wal-Mart is a great store if you are a customer. When it comes down to working for them you deal with many issues. I have worked for two different Wal-Marts and have seen how the store is ran. I have came to conclude that the environment is great, but the management team does not communicate with one another. So the rules change constantly. Once you start learning many different departments, they will take advantage of you with no recognition."
good,■greet customers
good,"It was a decent place to work, not really something i wanted to do for a long time."
good,"Extenuante ritmo de trabajo con exigencia laboral con poco personal y mismo rendimiento que año anterior el famoso mas con menos,"
good,Sometimes the job could get stressful at times if your not catching shoplifters your managers are pushing you.
good,I would go into work usually about eight oclock. I would manually moved pallets around with a pallet jack. I would downstack the pallet onto my cart. I would pull my cart to the area I was working in. Then I would organize the products on the shelves to stock the products that just came in. I would work with the vendors somedays helping to find good areas to display the products throughout the store. I would help management and other associates in displaying the products. I would build features on stackbases. I would help customers find what they were looking for. If it wasnt on the salesfloor I would look for it in the backroom. I would help keep counts on the products in the backroom by printing labels and writing counts on the labels as I put them in the bins before I scan them with a telzon.The hardest part of the job was pulling heavy pallets and stackbases of merchandise throughout the store. What I enjoyed most about my job is that i was able to learn alot and use my ideas sometimes.
good,"Started out in electronics then got department manager had record low shrink then had some angina(chest pain ) issues co-manager of store told me do to my health he was moving me to tle as the department manager it has less stress, i was there about a month my father in law died who i was close to i screwed up a price change it was caught would have cost the store about 1.24 he took tle from me and made me a regular worker this price change was done on the second day after my father in law died he was not imidiate family according to the comanager so no days off to deal with it. would i ever work for wal mart again i dont know"
good,Its a tough job. The managers did not give good training for the job. They seemed irresponsible.
good,"i was a cashier , handled money transactions/checks/credit, managers were all very nice to work with, as were my coworkers."
good,very fast pased workplace. managment is very understanding and helpful
good,A typical night consisted of stocking grocery department shelves.
good,The customer comes first. always willing to help my Co-working if no customers.
good,I love working and can get along with anyone but the mamagement at this walmart was terrible. they didnt work with their employees.
good,Walmart was a job were everyone interacted with each other and were abel to work as a team.
good,"Truly enjoyed working at wal mart, it was challenging but fun. Your interacting with people everyday who take pride in there position at work. Team work was the most important thing."
good,Had to be there over a year and full time for benefits. They wouldn't let you work enough to be full time usually.
good,it was an okay place to work. working overnights was the best part about working there. working days was really hard with all the customers around and having to work around them.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with, that is what makes the times go by faster and not so slowly. I made great friends here."
good,"Working at WalMart can be tough. Customers won't give you respect, most managers won't learn your name, and getting help is hard to find. However, the job can be fun. You get to know your coworkers and some regular customers. If you are searching for great pay and/or hours you may want to look elsewhere. Hour cuts are very common and it's difficult to regain them."
good,"Good place to work , work with you on your availibility, Good for part timers"
good,Wal-Mart was a good company to work for the job was stable. However the benefits could have been better
good,I enjoyed working for them for the most part but the pay is not the greatest. Advancement was also hard to get as the management was very slow at making decisions.
good,wal mart is an ok job an a fun place to work an a lot of hours but there is too many people down talking us in management an we are not allowed over time
good,Recently laid off . I'm trying to find an another position . I am willing to re locate if possibility came in to place. Thanks and have. Blessed day. Joey
good,"I love working at Walmart. The coworkers there are very friendly, some of the management though, not so much which is typical at any workplace. The pay and benefits was decent and fitting for a family. Breaks and lunchtime was great but you don't get paid for it though which sucks, but overall though I would recommend people to work here and it does make a great job for people work are new to the workforce."
good,"A empresa ensina muita coisa para seus coaboradores, mas nao é gratificante financeiramente."
good,job not a career. management was okay. never provided flexible schedules and they do not cherish and acknowledge worker achievement. only the workers that are in good terms with management group move up. a lot of favortism
good,The truck wouldn't always come on time but we still got the work done product was counted and organized for the most part the management was fair to u
good,Good pay friendly associate's. However as an online grocery associate you are very busy and must deliver groceries to cars in all weather conditions and there is also alot of heavy lifting.
good,"From what I have experienced it is a very tough job and is hard on the body, especially to have to work under pressure pull numbers. The distribution has recently increased their pull requirement to a 100% on all orders. That means you have to move pretty rapidly in the warehouse to stay over 100% on each order you pull. That means that your body is broken down pretty heavily due to the type of work. It is hard as an older person to do this type of work. The truck departures are scheduled at certain times throughout the day so you have to move to get all your routes pulled. Some people pull faster then others but they disregard safety while doing so. I am an older male so the work is very hard on my back and body due to all the up and down on your feet and bending over and reaching above the head to pull items off shelves."
good,"If you're dedicated, it could be for you.  Work life balance is difficult, but can be attained. You must be very flexible and ready for constant change at all levels."
good,"Apesar de ter uma rotina estressante e um local agradável de trabalhar, uma cultura empresarial de excelencia se fosse posta em pratica em sua integra. Aprendi muito quanto ao desenvolvimento profissional dentro de uma Empresa do porte e cultura americana, tive oportunidades de conhecer outras filiais e atuar nas mesmas em alguns momentos como suporte. As dificuldades se davam devido ao cumprimento das normativas efetivas da Empresa e no cargo que exercia na área de Prevenção, houve alguns desconfortos gerados pelo não cumprimento das normas. Mas, é uma excelente Empresa e voltaria a trabalhar se houvesse uma nova oportunidade."
good,"When i first started working there, I enjoyed it immensely, we were always properly staffed, got our work done, and it was a fun place to be. Our old store manager left, and we got a new one, we now have only 5 people, and they take most of them to cover other departments."
good,"Working for Walmart has been a great opportunity for developing new skill sets such as customer service, inventory management, and organization. The hardest part about being a Walmart associate is completeing all tasks within a reasonable time however this can almost always be made possible with a little self motivation and the help of other associates."
good,Great starting jobs for fresh out of high school individuals but for ones looking for a career I'd advise them to find or search for a different job due to the cut of some jobs.
good,Be mottovatted and be on time follow the rules read and research all possible advantages you can get and qualify for. Build business relationship and maintain them.
good,"like every great company, I think there is some growth to be done here, but the pay is good. I have worked for the company of Walmart for almost 6 years."
good,"The pay, and benefits were reasonable. The work day could get really busy. Other employees sometimes put their work off on other people. The job was fun and very involved face to face with customers."
good,Walmart is good for it’s pay and it’s benefits but it can get stressful at times it helps if you just come in and just do your job and not to get caught up in anything else
good,"Though they do have a fair point system and a pay rate higher than minimum wage, it's sometimes hard to maintain hours. Stocking the shelves and zoning to maintain the cleanliness and neatness of the store was the easy going part of the job. Coworkers are friendly and management is easy to work with for the most part. The long shifts and being short staffed would be the hardest part of the job along with heavy lifting."
good,Working for walmart can be a positive or negative thing. I have worked for multiple stores and can day it is a nab different experience depending on what kind of management team you have. It has its ups and downs
good,"Ideally, all positions would remain filled by competent people. Unfortunately, as Walmart as the highest turnover rate and only cares that the gears keep turning, employees come and go like it’s out of style. Usually it feels like management is your enemy, the opposite of how it should be. The pay is as close to minimum as they can manage, and you’ll be lucky to get more than 35 hours a week even if you’re “full-time”"
good,overall work experience was great.Walmart has made me grow personally and professionally with customers and employees. Overall this years that have worked in Walmart I have gotten the chance to work my up and have gotten great advice and support.
good,"Not a bad place to work all in all.  The biggest problem was the Store Directors they put in place.  They preach a loving and friendly environment but every store manager they put in place was cold and callus.  Had to work with that, especially when you feared for you job everyday and were got to sit in a public room and told that you everyone was replaceable."
good,"Working at Walmart has taught me quite a few things, first off how to better communicate with customers, it helps a lot being bilingual, being able to speak English and Spanish goes a long way. I’ve  learned that you have to work hard for the things that you want in life."
good,I really enjoyed working at Walmart.  It was a very rewarding job.  My favorite position I held was Customer Service Manager during third shift. I managed my cashiers and we had a tight knit crew and worked hard and well together.
good,"Great opportunities for advancement but also lots of politics."
good,"Working at Walmart allows you to meet all kinds of people. It also allows you to work as a team. From the customers to the employees, you can learn something new every day."
good,Una buena opcion si tegustan las ventas y sobre todo si eres bueno en como desempeñas tus funciones.
good,I experienced wonderful people in life through this job and I loved my position as department manager. The job system was set up to help make your job processing easy and understandable. The applications for managing the department was easy and allowed time for interaction with customers.
good,"I had little to no issues here when I worked here. Not sure if it's way different now, other than a very picky store manager most of the other managers and employees were very delightful."
good,"Walmart is a huge business conglomerate which is mainly focused on making money. That said, I feel like sometimes they set you up to fail by not always being fully staffed"
good,Nothing else to say I worked there thought that’s what I acted to do turns out it was toxic for me to work there and I got stabbed in the back nothing more to say
good,A localidade onde trabalhei foi no bairro da Pituba. A empresa exige excelência no atendimento mas não apoia os associados quando vem pessoas mal educadas pessoa que te humilha no seu ambiente de trabalho.
good,"My time spent with WalMart was very sweet indeed. In a position of leadership within the company I learned a lot about myself. Life lessons, and skills I'll take with me that will last a life time. I appreciate all that the company did for me in my journey to success. I've built lasting relationships with colleagues and clients that are literally priceless."
good,"I can’t really say anything negative about  working at Walmart, for as long as I had worked there I hadn’t experience any  discrimination from my co workers or higher ups. One thing I didn’t like about working at Walmart was having to work weekends."
good,customer friendly get alot of customer service experience . get to grow within company  meet diversity of people  learn to help n give customer satisfaction
good,If you are looking to get 40 hours you most definitely will at walmart. Very fast paced so you will stay busy and always have something to do. Not the best management.
good,It can be a great company to work for but it would be a lot better if they hired the right people for the right job. Some managers shouldn't had been promoted and there are some individuals who should definitely be promoted. Having the right management on the floor really makes a difference in how the day will go.
good,"Great benefits, good pay. Drama everday and Managment doesnt know what it wanted most everyday. Customers are great. But over all a great job than some out there."
good,If you want to move up and you are a hard worker you can definatly do so. I was hired on as seasonal and was kept because of my customer service skills and work ethic. If you show those things they love it.
good,"They were a great company to work for I learned a lot there, just not as flexible as I thought. People were nice and made you feel welcomed at work I enjoyed working for them."
good,"There was, above all else, room to grow in this company. There is also so much opportunity to move up and travel. That was the whole reason I took the job offer."
good,I was hired as an Assistant Store Manager and then management restructuring happened. Loss of position and salary in a blink of an eye. Never enough workers to get everything done everyday. Work life balance is non existent..
good,"The management at the walmart could use some work but overall the it is a enjoyable workplace , the work is very minor labor wise and they don’t expect too much of you."
good,they don't really care about the people that work there they just want to hire as many people as they can for whatever season they need then fire you. I got hired on but didn't feel like I was treated fairly. there was a lot of favoritism. and I just felt like another number on the charts. production would keep getting higher and was eventually hard to meet. towards the beginning of my hiring they were working on getting many more things for the break room where associates could be more relaxed but they would cut out breaks in half. there was hardly any time to do any of those activities due to the enforcement of a 10 min break and that you walking to the the break room was part of the break which I did not agree with.
good,I'm bless to have employment.  I'm thankful I can provide for my family. I can go to work without being stress. I can take time off. I can go back to school.
good,"I actually didnt mind working here, I mean there's drama, the managers don't care about what the employees need or have going on, again its Walmart, the job its self wasnt bad"
good,I really liked the job but it’s not really flexible & they don’t care if it’s an emergency or if you something is going on you’ll always get an occurrence for the day you miss & or if you’re late it’s half occurrence if you have pto it covers it
good,"It was a decent  place to work, everyone was nice and always open to helping out. Management was questionable sometimes, but they still tried to help."
good,At Walmart you got the training you needed to perform your job. There were no false promises about how much money you could make. Benefits were alright and bonuses were achievable and distributed equally.
good,"It was a great experience, despite the way it ended I learned a lot from it! Management isn't all that great as employee I feel we were really treated as animals and looked down upon. I had an issue with the way I felt I was being spoken to.So I asked to speak to higher ups which ended up backfiring on me, and leading to me being accused of being unsafe while operation of my forklift. This was their way of avoiding my feelings, and I feel like I was targeted because of my age. All I did was stand up for myself or try to and the revolving door of that warehouse had me walking out without a fair chance to explain myself or redeem myself. Other than that I made the best out of what it was."
good,Not a bad place to work for they have good employee benefits and discounts. Opportunity to grow and make a career tons of opportunities to choose from
good,Works with ur availability able to change it every 3 months but u can’t miss no more than 4 days in 6 months or u get fired on the spot! They do not except doctors notes if u don’t have pto then expect a point at 5 points ur a gone! Everyone gets talks about everyone like any job! Go to work do your job mind your business and u will be good
good,The job was pushing carts every day to the corale for customers and keeping the lot clean. Easy job but low tolerance for tardiness and no excuses. Once the computer terminates you there is nothing you can do. Until 3 months later you can try again.
good,"Not bad but could be organized"
good,"A registrar mercadorias,atendimento ao público,atua como abertura e fechamento de caixa."
good,Really great pay but they will cut hours and no job security. They don't listen to reason. Make it hard to move up in the company. If you just need the money and don't care about the rest its a good place to work.
good,Good experience historically but lately job culture is changing to less associate focused to more business model focused  This will eventually translate to less customer satisfaction and that will decrease pharmacy Rx business
good,"Good place to work, lots of room to develop and grow. They provide more feedbacks to"
good,"Walmart Distribution was a great job, nothing like its stores. The pay was great for the time and the job was very doable. I would recommend this job to any one"
good,Na visão geral precisa ter mais equilíbrio nas escalas salário precisa melhorar mas a empresa estável e dá oportunidade para as pessoas
good,A typical day at Walmart was usually 1 pm to around 11 or 12. I learned that not all employees are there for a career. That some are there to do the bare minimum. And in order to get more productivity u have to make it an enjoyable workplace without letting certain boundaries be overstepped. Management was blind and didnt really have my back when it came for me to write up employees.
good,there are good people there not enough supervision. there isnt anyone around when u need help or ask where things are so that you can do your job to the best of your ability.
good,Walmart is okay to work for.  They don't give you alot of hours though and change your schedule last minute without notice.  They put to much on their workers.
good,This is a great company to work for but I now need more of a challenge.  I am in management now with 2 promotions within a year.  Honestly I require more money than they can offer to pay my bills.
good,"All in all, the experience was enjoyable. I fostered good relationships with coworkers and got really good teachable moments while being there. I learned a lot."
good,"Enjoyed going to work every day. Very understanding and motivating coworkers. However, the management and upper levels of Walmart are a joke, like any corporation."
good,I loved my customers. But a lot of the management are lazy and don't wanna help. But the ones that do make up for the day with the lazy ones. I liked my job there but it had its moments like any other job.
good,Walmart is a very good employer and provides great benefits.  Walmart is trying to keep up with the technology.  The company is also trying to keep their current associates educated by providing affordable ways to return to school
good,"The job is incredibly easy to perform, and they'll hire anybody to do it. Pay is barely above minimum wage and benefits are sparse. There's a bit of a corporate atmosphere, but for the most part you can just do your work and nobody will bother you."
good,Walmart is an okay place to work with okay benefits.  My issue was when I tried to apply for temporary leave as a result of furthering my family.  I was called and called to the point of harrassment with it when I did take my leave.
good,Pretty good until the new attendance policy. If you need a personal day they wont work with you unless you have the required time off even if its a family emergency. Thats the only bad thing I have to say. The rest is actually pretty alright.
good,"Grande avanço,uma grande multinacional porem muito engessada a cultura americana,sem muito retrospecto a regionalidade"
good,"Great place to work not all management are fair. Good pay great environment. Great benefits , works with your schedule. 40 hrs always. Learnd alot from walmart."
good,"Great Employee's Great Management Some Days Where Odd When No One Showed But You Get Use To It , Miss Working Here but I Had to move out of state For most part good experience"
good,"When i get to work i clock in, go to the front to check the returns get them go put them away to their right homes cut fabric for customers then go to zone my department, go on my lunch or break then go back to work, look over everything pick things off the floor put them away then go home and do it all over again."
good,Es buena empresa no me quejo trabajo agusto de vez en cuando y la verdad lo único malo es su gente de RH y de la Sub gerencia pero de que aprendes en la empresa aprendes eso sin dudarlo
good,Overall it's a good place to work. The down fall is they really want the hours all over the place. When you have family that's really hard to do. And I wanted to always advance but never happened. Discount and Christmas is really good benefit to have.
good,"It is too busy for the management team that they have. If they change their management team, this would be the perfect job but not a career. Great location for MARTA use."
good,"Good place to work, the benefits are good. Alot of new things have came down like college and gym memberships. Definitely recommend for those who are unsure of what to do in life."
good,"Advancement within the company is a great opportunity as long as you show a good work ethic, but can be taken advantage of by management very easily for the same reason."
good,"The first 4-5 years I LOVED working there but things changed drastically in 2014-2015. Associates are not treated with respect, tolerance or good managerial practices."
good,Walmart as a company is an excellent place to work.  Walmart offers a variety of benefits as well as job opportunities in every department. Finding that manager that's willing to take you under there wing and show/train you the ins and outs of job functionality is the best thing.
good,I liked building the bikes an useing the scissor lift to put the bikes on the hooks.I put together the furniture too. I dealt with the customers to...
good,"Good hours, nice breaks and lunches, great when the give out overtime, favoritisms company, good benefits, nice hours depending on what part of the store you work in,"
good,"For the most part, I loved my job at Walmart,it's just when management changed the store changed for the worst.And now they telling me the store manager is firing people left and right."
good,"It was a fast paced working environment, I had to adapt rather quickly but I caught on fast. The management was fairly poor but overall it was a good working experience."
good,"I’ve worked here a long time, I enjoy my job easy going. Holidays are hard you only get Christmas off for sure "
good,"Pretty easy job, recently they have put a lot more tasks on our team and not really paying as well as they should be at this point. Good management and coworkers though!"
good,Unloading and stocking is not a problem at all. Although the management team is not the best. They could work on that and that and be more organized and act more like supervisors
good,Working at Walmart was an experience I will always value. I learned a lot about customer service and even more about the locals that visited the store. I do believe the company could do better at rewarding employees that show how dedicated and hardworking they are through their work. Most of the people I did have the pleasure of working with became really good friends in the end.
good,"Falta de organización del personal gerencial"
good,I was an assembler which isnt a terrible job. But I was expected to lift over 150 lbs and was unable to do so with my back problems so I had to look for something else
good,Walmart is a good place to work but considering amazon pays 15.00 per hr they need to at least pay starting at 13 per hr because most people are going there to make more money but Walmart schedules fit for me
good,"There are good and bad at Walmart, just don’t take things too personal and you will be ok. Make sure to mind your own business and not get caught up in the gossip."
good,I worked from 1 to 8 every day as a dairy stocker. It was a good shift because i don't go home too late and don't have to be there early. Managers were great and the co workers were nice too. Some customers were mean but all of them were helped when they needed help with anything dairy related .
good,"A work day was pretty relaxed, but always had work to do. The people i worked with were great and the managers were pretty understanding. It's a good career option being as they promote from within."
good,Walmart changed their policy every other week. Once trained in aspects of job they changed it. It was frustrating. When inventory week come around everything about Walmart and the company changed.
good,"You've been in a Walmart, you know how it is. As a deli associate, I worked behind a counter and it was the best. The lax work area was fun, and everyone was nice."
good,"Walmart is a nice place to get great experience, their management team is very good but if could use some work with communication skills. But overall it’s a great place to shop with your family wel kept etc."
good,Working at Walmart I felt like a part of the team right off the bat. The team I worked with was very friendly and always answered questions I asked helping me as much as they could.
good,"Walmart isn't a bad place to start for any first time workers since it teaches you a variety of skills. It also helps that Walmart has separate departments, so in a way you will be learning different skills that could be applied to different jobs, (ex, working in the cosmetics area will help if you were to work in a cosmetics store like Sephora and Ulta)"
good,You will hate this job as much as you'll miss it when you leave. The hours are terrible. You'll either end up working inconsistent hours or have a great schedule. Management is usually too busy in the office to really help anyone and usually only look for the bad and rarely the good.
good,It’s was reasonable job and understandable the responsibility you had todo on daily basis   . Things got difficult once it was around the holiday season
good,"You must know how to work well on a team. There will always be a bit of drama in the workplace but your job is to do your job and do it right. Management will not coddle employees. At the end of the day, if you come to work, do your job to Walmart standards, and maintain a positive attitude, you will have a rewarding experience with the comp[anyy."
good,"Its great for a first job doesnt put too much pressure on you"
good,"Over the three years I have worked for Walmart, I have gained the experience for working with customers and with a team of people. The daily tasks weren't hard and/or tiring and I always enjoyed connecting and communicating with the rest of my team. Supervisors were always there to help and always made sure that the job would get done on time."
good,"like working there they give you a chance to grow in there company,they have different shifts to accommodate your needs you get bonuses sometimes and the salary is not bad."
good,"I worked at walmart for 4 years and i did like the department I worked in and the people . When I got hired I was hired as a temporary employee,  so I worked in the deli I had received part time. Then after 6 months I received fulltime. When I do my job I give it 100%"
good,Half of the managers don't talk to people with any respect. If you can get past that the COMPANY is actually pretty good and takes care of their associates.
good,Every Walmart is different. There can be a place for everyone. With Walmart being the retail giant that it is everyone is likely to be touched one way or another.
good,I was terminated for too many mis scans I asked to be transferred but no one listen when I spoke up I felt very uncomfortable when I was questioned about the problem earlier that’s why I was let go.
good,"I like to work at Spring Branch location due to distance, closer to home !"
good,"i would get to work and we would have our meetings  then we would go to the back room  and we would grab our pallets  from where they would put us we had to bring it out to the sales floor and start working on it. i learned a lot from the time i was their from how to work a pallet jack  to how to read the price tags to working the scanner . management was poor   "
good,Walmart was a good job but they didn’t have their management together I told them I didn’t make it home from school until 5:30pm and they kept putting me on the clock form 5pm to 10pm and I I had already told them I couldn’t work that so they changed it to 6pm to 10pm for one week then it was back to 5pm it happened 3 times I got tired of telling them so I Let it be and they fired me
good,"Communication is a critical problem at Walmart."
good,"Fast paced, heavy lifting, somewhat stressful, but would work there again. Management was fair, but did have expectations that were not realistic on occasions."
good,A majority of the management at my store doesnt care about you and only for themselves. they will coach you at a moments notice and the store manager will defend them rather than see it from your side.
good,Was dencent job with whom i worked with but my management took a drastic turn towards my departure from the company. Room for advancement was good but like most companies brown nosing will persevere 1st opposed to hard work.
good,Need to appreciate their employees.  Scheduling workers ours and availability is unreasonable and unrealistic. Customer service is deteriorating drastically.
good,"I worked here happily for years, however with recent policy changes I no longer felt that working at this company could help me reach my goals and reluctantly had to leave."
good,"Learned many things at this place either being a part-time employee or working full-time. Managers here are awesome, who always try to understand you. working here is fun."
good,Working at Walmart was alright. The schedules were kinda harsh with school. Like late nights and normally long hours on the weekend with very little experience. But all the employees were very nice.
good,"No Walmart is perfect. However, your management team and your work culture will make or break your role in Walmart. Some have it together. Others not so much. A lot of things happen and sometimes you just have to wonder why any of it is happening. People get hired and fired. Don't come to Walmart thinking it's going to be cakewalk. That's where alot of people fail. If you want to go far and have a good work ethic, then life will be easy. However, it's partly up to you and the rest depends on management. If they can't run the store, then you're not going to be there long."
good,"Wal Mart in an effort to change with the times is facing challenges and is letting people go who don't react to the changing demands. Also, if upper management does not like you or think that you are not responsive to their instructions, your tenure could be short lived."
good,While working at Walmart I worked as a cashier and a year later moved to work at the service desk. Some Managers are messy as well as some of the cashiers. If you know how to ignore the gossip its not that bad a place to work. Although i don't think my review is that great i did have an overall good experience while working there.
good,"A typical work day was busy, and a constant going feeling. I enjoy being on my toes as much as I was. I learned many different ways to deal with different types of customers; angry, upset, happy. The management could use some help. They don't really take people's personal medical problems into consideration. The hardest part of the job was the ""down"" times, the times when we are slower. The most enjoyable part was gaining relationships with the customers."
good,"Its a great place to work full of friendly co works, how ever trying to hold on to a manager in my department was hard for the company. We went through 3 supervisers, and had a ast transfer just for my department in alil over a year"
good,"If your a teen, still in school, then this job is for you.. they don’t want to give hours, reducing cashiers with self checkouts. Friendly co-workers."
good,"Exciting and fun place to work.  Managers and fellow associates are great.  Working with the public can be challenging and the pay could be better, otherwise I highly recommend this employer."
good,"Working here will require you to learn many varied skills. You will gain skills in time management, setting priorities, and communication. Customer service skills a must, and a strong backbone to maintain composure in the face of abusive customers."
good,The job itself is fun. It definitely has its days but what job doesn’t? I have learned a lot while working for this company & I continue to learn new things daily.
good,"very stressful trying to complete all task."
good,"Walmart is a descent company to work for as long as you do what’s required."
good,Walmart is good place if you want a relaxed job your given an hour break an decent allowed time to finish a task . The only problems i had were with management and the things they was telling me to around the time it was time to leave. I was written up on different occasions due to not staying an finishing a task that was assigned 1 hour before it was time to get off even though they knew overtime wasn't allowed.
good,Walmart sucks they pushed us to our limits just so they could get numbers but always questioned why there are so many employees quitting the pay was good some mangers where okay and the job it self wasn’t that bad
good,I wasn't there long but i opened the walmart store i was at it was a great experience i did different things at the beginning of my employment put shelves up hung signs set mods etc. I really liked workin there
good,i worked fabrics and crafts for a couple months. Management was nice and very helpful. I would work at this location again if given the chance as long as the same people where there.
good,It was very good working for company but management wasnt so nice and treated a person unfairly. Loved my coworkers and the set schedule they offer. Great benefits
good,Very productive. Always worked with me on my schedule. The company workers were very friendly and really welcoming. I would recommend to anyone. I learned right off the bat how to run my department alone. A typical day was really easy and calm.
good,It's just like any retail ruthless and brutal but at the same time it can be rewarding.  Its a great place for young adults to have under their belt but as a permanent job not so much.
good,start with a tour and walk of the store with other managers making notes of things that need to be accomplished.  If it was a supply truck night would make a game plan to unload merchandise and get it stocked or put away.  Off nights the staffing was reduced to a minimum so if there were modules assignments that need done I would assign them first then assign special cleaning and maintenance along with managing customer service issues.
good,"My time at Walmart was okay. Some of the managers at my location sometimes made my job a little more difficult, but that's not every Walmart. If you get hired, just go there and do your job well!"
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart. We stayed busy and it was more fun than stressful every day. I can only speak from my experience working there on 2008.
good,"I was a part-time cashier for about 8 years while working for Wal-Mart.  The reason I was unable to work full time was being diagnosed with a disability.  To maintain eligibility for SSDI the federal government placed monthly and annual income restrictions on what I could earn while still receiving benefits.  I have some Visual Limitations and Bipolar Disorder.  If you have shopped with Wal-Mart, you will notice the Cashier is also responsible for sacking your Merchandise which is uncommon when you go to your neighborhood grocery store, furniture store or are buying a new car (if you have the financial resources) and often when you are getting a Prescription filled.  Cashiers are also grossly underpaid for the arrogant attitude often displayed by a few who shop there.  Usually, I just took the abuse until one day when an older White lady and her Daughter came to my line demanding that I ""hurry it up blind boy"" then I asked them what that mixed breed animal was in their cart who was throwing candy bars all over the store.  I am also White which is irrelevant except when you call me a ""blind boy"" and expect me to take it for $11.00 per hour as though I have no feelings.  If you are shopping at store # 3273 just realize this will get them fired and you can treat any associate like trash and get away with it.  I have nothing against anyone of any color or race."
good,"Working as a CAP associate was very hard and fast-paced, but very rewarding, all responsibilities and duties are team based, so it becomes a very friendly environment after a few days after starting there. Management are very helpful and understanding, and everyone in that company overall has a positive attitude towards their job, which is a perk of working there."
good,When I was employed there the pay was ridiculous but they have uped there pay scale and provide more services to the customers. I hear the management team hasn’t improved any though
good,"this was a great place to work. I really enjoyed my co workers, some even became friends outside of work. I wish the attendence policy was more clear than it is."
good,Wal-Mart is a great place to work.  You meet a lot of people and also make friends.  I also made friends with co-workers.  I learned how to work other departments other than just cashiering.
good,"It was a good company to work for. Your task are set, so you dont have to keep asking arround for something to do. And they have flexable schedules if you need a day off."
good,Walmart is what you expect from a minimum wage corporation. You do what you are told. Dont think about it too much. You have to think a bit to ensure you are covered.
good,I’ve polished my skills in this work environment learning their management expectations through training and leadership academy helping me in better problem solving and thinking out of the box to complete hard tasks as efficient and effectively as possible.
good,"Don't expect too much from this position. Managers see a high turnout rate on employee's, so until you've got some time put in at the company before they count you as a dependable employee. It has decent pay for a job that basically requires a High School/GED diploma, and you should consider it an effective way to make money."
good,"helpful workplace"
good,Not the best place to work. I enjoyed the job because I love working with people. The schedule was insane though. I worked every thursday through Sunday and could never get a weekend off.
good,Typical day at work was coming in on time and getting started with work. Management was poor. Learned that you will get rude customers no matter the situation.  Most enjoyable part of the day was helping the customers.
good,"customer service , attending clients needs and helping them  get  the best service i could get  for them. And always being polite, and joyful to get a better attitude from the client and make them smile , so the can be happy and get there best service ."
good,Walmart has given me tips and experience I need to get anyother job. They even gave me farther training to help and work with stressed shoppers in the community.
good,"Definitely something thats hard to envision long term, but it’s not too terrible for the moment. The management team can really make or break a store."
good,"Walmart is a great company to work with. Sadly tho, they begin to hire and hire people and don’t think about how much they’ll be cutting the hours of those who have already been working there for a while. Also, they state they’re big supporters of students in college, but cut hours even if the students cannot make it to work because of school."
good,"Walmart has diverse workplace culture which allows people to work as team by having different background. As a member of Walmart, i learn how to handle customers and also give priority to them."
good,"Management is always changing.  Every time you turn around there is new management they change how you do your job, to the point that you get confused about how they want things done."
good,"Very Busy, Customer Service skills highly needed . Attention to safety and cleanliness. Always be prepared for unscheduled deliveries. Dress code is exceptionally casual. Importance in time management of assignments."
good,"It was fun when I first started but it was too much drama in the OGP department. I worked there for 8 months and didn't have a manager for 5 of those months. It was chaos. I ended up getting fired because of too many missed days. When I asked how to use my PTO, I was told I couldn't. The job itself wasn't bad. Some day were more hectic then others."
good,I enjoyed learning how to cashier. I liked to talk with the customers and fellow employees. I also learned about the product and set up some displays for new product.
good,"too many policy changes; too much drama in the workplace; miscommunication between management and associates; good benefits; good pay rate with yearly raises. Open door policy if needed. Not enough specific training (bakery, deli positions)."
good,Walmart's an okay job but leave heavy doing a lot for what you really get paid for. Walmart's needs to increase their pay to reflect the type of work that they require for you to do but other than that Walmart is a good job to work at
good,"fast paced , a bit stressful at times, management was not always responsive to our needs.team members very nice and helpful. dealing with the public was usually a positive experience."
good,They are a good company with 1 bad manager they paid nice and had decent hours. I would definitely work there again given the chance it's a great starter job .
good,"Certain Management have been completely disrespectful to their associates. Also making drama with other associates. Other than the usual Drama and childlike behavior, Walmart has gotten me out of my house"
good,I enjoyed working because the money was great for me.   I wasn't crazy about getting up at 4 in the morning though.   The breaks for lunch and rest periods were fair.
good,"a great place to earn some income, you will not get rich, but you can earn enough to"
good,Pesimo ambiente laboral . es una empresa familiar .
good,"The managers are nerve wracking and the only one who really puts in work with the stockers is the actual store manager, the assistant managers just walk around monitoring n trying to tell you what to do, as if they can’t jump in to help! It’s a decent environment to work at, I guess! Some days it feels as if there’s a load a merchandise to stock but it’s not too bad! There are slow days because the trucks runs late and he only boring part is zoning at the end of the night!"
good,"So I was cashier, cashiers get anywhere from 10 hours to 40 hours and it can be completely random or at least it was when I worked there. Managers are pretty awesome for the most part though so that is an up."
good,This is a good place to work but it can be very stressful at times. Once you get used to standing for 8 straight hours it won’t be as bad. I just wish there were more benefits for part time employees
good,Typical day at work is fast paced and keeps you busy. I learned how to tell if produce is bad and how to further accommodate customers. Most of the management are decent people and treat their employees fairly. The culture of the workplace is easy going and teamwork oriented. The hardest part of the job is meeting their ridiculous times. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with fellow employees and customers.
good,It was pretty good depending who your mangers were at the time. I do not t agree with there seasonal ways or the way that the computers decide if you have a job or not if you call in or if you miss to many days.
good,"Ok I worked here over 10 years it was tough but the pay was good, they rotate managers so you could have a solid manager you get a long with then that changes to a manager that's ready to get you fired, if you start getting wrote up and have the chance to work in a different department or shift I suggest you should that's how I lasted so long plus I went to HR back when they cared"
good,It has it's good days and bad days! Management can definitely be a pain and need more classes on how to manage correctly! All employees don't do what is expected of them.
good,"nice place to work as students, with very little advancement. Managers can be good from time to time but the pressure is on it is a physically demanding job required you to be active and responsive to customers over all great place to work how ever hourly pay should be increased"
good,"You opened box up and put things away on the shelves. Its called stocker, you would be on your feet for a long time. You get two 15 min breaks and 1 hour lunch break those were nice."
good,80% me gusto trabajar en esa empresa hasta que la Gerenta no nos pagaba las horas extra.
good,great place to work if your salary was enough to support you. most peo[ple were civilized. I think everyone had a high school degree. manager was terrible. he would not even let me talk to another employee in his presence. he got fired right after I left. for doing something illegal.
good,"It's refreshing to have a job that's a job, not a life style. Most if the other employees in the store are warm and helpful. OGP is has too many young people who like to test the boundaries and pass work on to others. It makes it stressful when there are deadlines. Hoping management will restructure and shuffle things so the workload is evenly dispersed."
good,"Meet new ppl everyday,hr lunch and 2 -15 min breaks,great coworkers,and always alot of work to keep the time moving "
good,"It's a given that Walmart can be soul sucking, but overall if you know what your getting into you'll be fine. The pay is better than a good chunk of places and if you know how to handle people it's simple work. Just beware when management thinks you know something you don't or when their extremely forgetful. Them thinking I had been to the weekly meeting despite never going to them as I had the day off for school was an issue, as well as my manager forgetting to change my availability to match my new school times (college classes) caused me to gain absences and get fired. Otherwise it's a simple job that pays well for what it is."
good,Provided what I had asked of them however the management team was subpar. Whilst working there I felt disregarded. Besides my voice not being heard it was a good learning experience.
good,It was an okay experience working for Walmart. Evan though the Management Was Kinda Off And Most of the workers had a lack of Minimum Work Ethic. But overall the employment experience was fair
good,"working 2-11 can be difficult, especially if you’re one to want to go out with friends and unexpected plans occur. you have a total of 5 occurrences before you get terminated which is okay. You have a fixed schedule and the days you’re off do not change, unless you request specific days or you’re in school, then they can be more flexible with your schedule."
good,"The job at some points is very stressful with a lot of responsibilities. Co-workers are great though. Most of them are fun, creative and make the time that you are there go very fast. I do wish that upper management did a better job of communicating with associates and with each other."
good,was good place to work i caught on fast even for the short time i was there. if i was offer a job to go back where i live now in florida . i would most likely be interested.
good,"It was my first job so was a pretty big head rush, hours flow by fast do to many tasks that had to be done. sometimes there would be very little in my line then in the blink of an eye 15 people deep in my line. But in the end it teaches you to work at a fast pace and to be efficient."
good,Walmart is not a bad place to work. The pay is decent and they usually work well with your schedules. There is not much job security in my opinion. You never really know where you stand with management.
good,Fun place to work great team. I've learned a lot due working in different departments and with different people. I've thankful for the experience and knowledge I have collected.
good,"It was a very nice environment to work in. I enjoyed my job while there! The pay was good, enough to make sure I was okay, and my coworkers were like family to me"
good,worst mistake I ever made. If you decide to go to the ASM program make sure you are single with no family or get into a 50M or less store because you will have no work /home life balance. Be prepared to work 60+ hours a week for the set salary.
good,"During my 8 years with Walmart I had a decent experience. The customers are the hardest part of the job. The majority of my co-workers were friendly and helpful. The management team was very slack and their open door policy is just plain horrible. Luckily the store manager that I worked under is no longer employed there, I hope that the current and future associates have a better time dealing with the management team than I and a few others did."
good,"Although I didn't get along with my manager all the time, she was at least trying her best to make sure I received a full 40 hr. week. I was moved between each department within Apparel and Housewares almost all the time. Some days I wasn't sure what department I would be in, which also made work fun and interesting. I loved the group of people I worked with, they always made work enjoyable and easy going."
good,"Doesn’t  pay very fairly,  very hard to advance at the store I was at. I really liked my job. Loved working with customers and the management I worked with."
good,Its been two years working with the Walmart they help me get experience with the customer service and how the retail market works. They helped me grew in the two years.
good,"There are many opportunities for advancement. "
good,"Walmart has a very laid back atmosphere centered around creating a straight forward, simple, and productive work environment. working there has taught me more about customer relations and handling warehouse machinery."
good,Most of my managers we're fair and provided clear instructions on what to do. Working with so many coworkers could be stressful at times but was overall enjoyable.
good,Good place to work. It was a fast paced environment. A lot of people and there were new obstacles each day. My co workers were friendly. We worked hard together each day. I cut keys. I mixed paint. I helped customers in and around my department. I also was on the cash register when needed. I drove the forklift and the scissor lift.
good,"It was a great first job, learned a lot of life lessons and I would recommend this job to any one who is looking for hands-on work and customer service experience."
good,was not a bad place to work. just did not pay what i needed. Was very fast paced and was fun helping costumers find the items they were looking for. I would work there again if the pay was more.
good,"Walmart is a good starter job, they always need workers so it's easy to get in and they're flexible with hours. Although there is benefits there are cons as well. Stocking shelves for hours gets boring and drags your shift out within your head. Unless you like being by yourself doing a tedious task the job get stale quickly."
good,C’est un lieu de travail amusant et qui a plusieurs bénéfices.
good,"On a day to day basis Walmart is usually a busy establishment. It keeps you on your toes and ready for just about anything. Although the days could be stressful, it did further equip me on my organizational skills and punctuality."
good,"The problem with Walmart is they offer no incentive to stay. The pay isn't worth it, they aren't very flexible with scheduling, the management micromanages (Which communicates a lack of trust in employees), and so often you're at the mercy of Walmart corporate. It's not even worth trying to work up."
good,"Walmart asks a lot of its employees, thorough physical labor and also time, you are required to have open hours so that they may schedule you however much or less that may be. Personally I have never been properly trained in any position I've held, but the positions have been fairly simple. to figure out. The absence system is ridiculous, you are only allowed 4 sick days if you haven't earned the ""protected PTO"" and then you get fired. They also put on a half an occurrence if you clock in early. Other then that it hasn't been that bad to work there."
good,"Work was only part time and contracted for the holiday season, would have been great if job could have continued. It was a laid back environment with fast paced work."
good,my review would not be a fair one I wasn't on the right side of mgmt. apparently i was too happy too friendly i think they thought I was up to no good because I was friendly to everyone
good,Its a good place to work.  There is always work to be done and is always changing.  high turnover so there will always be new people coming in but still a good place.
good,"It takes a lot of patience to do this job, the customers can be rude, and it gets hot in the summer, it can sometimes be physically demanding, but overall is a fairly easy job"
good,"It got me out of the house and on my feet and allowed me to use my organisational skills and get paid for it. My only complaint is one manager showing up to basically stalk his employees and not do any physical work. He was a ""boss"", not a ""leader""."
good,It is a very fast paced work environment.  If you don't like to be multi tasking or taking on more responsibilities then this is not the job for you. You will constantly be busy and probably be doing more then what is in your job description.
good,"in my own eyes i really enjoyed walmart for the most part, just felt like advancement wasn't really something in their eyes. Everyone got stuck in their one position for a long time."
good,Overall it was an experience and the staff was great at this location the benifits you can appreciate. You can also grow with the company the leave all doors open it’s up to us to continue.
good,"I worked both lawn and garden at first as a temp for the summer and then offered a job as backroom associate by fall; end of season. Great atmosphere, kind co-workers, relaxed but sometime stressful. hardest part of job was pulling pallet jacks while customers stand in your way....holidays are the worst days. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping those in need and the past time conversation."
good,"salary to low, no extra pay for working on weekends. management some how good. 1 hour break is just waste of time. should have more  opportunities to move ahead."
good,"Walmart has been a good place to work, the people around you can make it a pleasure to work by providing a collaborative effort to achieve any task set upon"
good,I enjoyed the older customers and the young and all in between but I found it a little repetitive after a while saying the same things over and over ..
good,Walmart puts a lot on their employees and make it hard and stressful for people to make it. They do not give their employees raises well enough. Makes it very hard for people to make a living off what they give
good,"Walmart was fun because of the customers, I love people so I kept it positive, but there's a atmosphere of fear there because of management. That's not fun to work under"
good,Very good place to work  good environment pretty fair pay can be stressful at times but a very good place to work overtime is sometimes available as well
good,"Good work environment, face paced, friendly staff, hard to get certain days off, hard to switch shifts. will work with other job schedules. learn different aspects of the job."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, constante aprendizaje y promociones."
good,"could have better communication among management  for a more effective team effort, hours vary depending on department, overtime is given if necessary."
good,"Restock returned and let behind stock."
good,"The environment was unprofessional. I like a professional more organized environment. There was no leadership, and they didn’t keep important things confidential"
good,"Walmart has gotten rid of most of the old and/or disabled associates, one of the good things Walmart once stood for.  Many jobs have been cut deeply, leaving fewer people to give customer service. Most of the management seem good, but everyone worries about their jobs and the future changes.  Standing on your feet all day, every day, is tiring and painful for many, who are afraid to say anything for fear of losing their job.  We are expected to work when we are ill, or receive ""occurences"" if we stay home.  If you receive too many occurences in a 6-month period, you are fired. The computer training is great, but in real life, they expect cashiers to work very fast, leaving no time to look up and smile at people or do a good job packing the groceries.  This is probably a good company to work for as a first job, because you have no experience to compare to."
good,Fast paced. Friendly people. Open door policy. Great place to work with room for advancement. Would recommend job for family and friends. Love the way they notice your hard work and compliment you on work skills.
good,I am looking for advancement in this place of employment but it is always offered to others not within the company..I think with all the responsibilities I have I should have a better pay rate then a quarter raise.
good,No work life balance. Its a good company to advance in and pursue career goals with. They have good benefits and good leadership on the corporate level.
good,"I enjoyed working here, I worked her for about 3 years."
good,I wish they thought of the employees as a part of the company and not as just a worker. The company needs to have the same ownership they expect their associates to have.
good,I got pregnant and had to quit due to the heat. But it was a great place to work overall. Probably had the best coworkers and most flexible boss. I was in college so it was really flexible when it came to that too.
good,"A big corporation, easy on with lazy people but hard for good workers to get the value they deserve. If you are a student, it's a good place to work. Or you want to work only part time"
good,"... But then go get a real job. I see a lot of people trapped here. Nothing is merit based. 2% a year raise no matter how hard you work. Poor communication and no one ready to be accountable for any decision. All complaints are met with, ""blame Bentonville"" (corporate). That said it's a great first job and a good way to find out if you can work with the public."
good,"At Wal-Mart cap 2 we did the unloading of trucks we stocked food , waters, paper products, chemicals (like soap, bleach, amd cleaners) and animal products the people are fun to work with"
good,Walmart was my first job I started at 16 & i was nervous about working because I’m a introvert but it helped me with my customer service skills & helped me get out my my shell in my work environment with the customers .
good,"During the 3 years I worked at Walmart Logistics i was always considered for on the job training, and cross training to other departments to support the warehouses needs. However, when faced with personal problems off the job Walmart turns a blind eye to employees that are going through rough patches. Management is strictly goal orientated and rarely show interest in the associates well being or quality of work that they are producing, but rather the quantity and how much they are producing."
good,"I worked in the deli bakery section and restocked products under our department every morning. My day started at 5am. I often had to take over responsibilities in the kitchen with preparing food without much training. Hours every week were inconsistent, and I would often have to organize the freezer alone meaning I would be in below freezing temperatures for extended periods of time just trying to get stuff done so a manager wouldn't get upset at my supervisor who was doing her best with an understaffed department."
good,Debe mejorar sus políticas ya que están aplicadas para la población anglosajonica
good,Other than the lack of coverage and sometimes the lack of care from managers working at Walmart was good. The pay was decent for what work I was doing.
good,The work at Walmart is almost always fast paced and productive. It’s always busy and there is always something to do. I enjoy working there and the tasks that are given to me.
good,"Fun place to work. I was given opportunities to work in various departments and develop diverse skills.  I enjoyed working at Walmart, but changes in management led to changes in working conditions."
good,Great place to work people are very friendly however management needs to be improved. Flexible work schedule as far as days and hours needed. Would go back 1 day
good,I've worked at walmart for 2 years. It has helped me to learn customer service skills and gain confidence dealing with the public. I've learned to use a point-of-sale system as well as inventory management.
good,"The managerial pay was poor and barely above minimum wage with very little advancement opportunity. You were a number and not a person, district level and higher did not seem to care what went on in the store."
good,Walmart is a very equal opportunity workplace. If you show great leadership you can advance and move up quickly in the company. Also great work place to gain great customer service because you will interact with so many people.
good,"Walmart is a great experience to have. they provide a great working atmosphere. people, over there are friendly and kind. you get to do a variety of jobs every day."
good,"working at Walmart is good. Of course there cons and pros in each work environment. The pros of working at Walmart, first, is a safe place to work. secondly, employees can get good discounts coupons. the cons are too many to mention. first, bad management, bad work schedules. The workplace culture was so stressful. the hardest part of my job was how to interact with an angry customer."
good,I was working here full time and the benefits were good. I received a raise twice in the year I worked. The main management staff were terrible but some of the lower management were nice and easy to work with.
good,I meet more than 100+ customers a day and it is a nice feeling talking every customer and understand their needs and serve them in a fast paced environment. Sometimes i do face hard time but the biggest gift which i got is smile.  In any situation i'll have smile on my face and i believe which is the best solution for any issue to resolve and make the customer calm down.
good,Walmart was a great employer besides pay and human resources . I resigned from medical problems and wasn't able to return because human resources misplaced paperwork.
good,"It is best place to work for part time worker or who just want to engage on work and get paid a bit. Rules are changing frequently, and working schedule is not pretty good for hard worker. Hardly get overtime or company doesn't like to work overtime."
good,"some positions are better than others as with any job, but some are very stressful at times as well. good work place with good pay and good hours as well."
good,"So far working for walmart has been a good experience. Made new friends. "
good,"My experience at Walmart was just the fact that the garage area was not set up correctly.  The cheap equipment was not serviced nor maintained by anyone.  We were overworked in my opinion, for the pay we received. When you have a door greeter making a dollar less than service techs, there is a problem I had with that."
good,They have a some food benefits like paid time off and stiff but it can be a hard place to work. They do offer paternity leave which is paid and is nice also
good,"Certain good managers & decent pay rate in certain positions. But also certain managers that do not have respectable or fair attitude's. Assistant store manager was very good, fair option for a short distance work option."
good,It a decent place to start off rather fast food. But not a lifetime job. Their lack of acknowledgment when they don’t thank you for all the hard work you do and to feel like you won’t ever move up
good,"Its the best corporate to work long in your career, best place to learn while you work, professionalism at its best,  best place to grow as a manager."
good,Very good management team and company with alot to offer but the pay isnt enough to live off of unless you want to live with your parents forever. But it is a good job to get you by
good,"Working 2nd shift at Walmart was relatively easy, but it could become monotonous very quickly. It is not a job I could keep for a long period of time. You can earn paid time off after an initial testing period. Management was not always reasonable in their demands and consistently added steps that slowed down our workflow. I enjoyed that the work was physical and mobile. I also enjoyed most of my coworkers while I was there."
good,some days you could wake up and your shift would be changed without being called about it in the first place. i also had a little one going in to day care but they wouldnt work with my hours.
good,Depending on the area you work and the store managment will be the determination of how well you enjoy your job. Department managers are giving entirely to many expectations with no real understanding of how certain things work at store level
good,Very stressful environment from the customers to management. But if you intend to show up and work you won't have a hard time. Management could use an overhaul. 80% of the stress is due to management. Not customers.
good,I love my job and my coworkers. I do wish Walmart cared more about their workers! The pay does pay off for the work! Customers are friendly but everyone has their bad days!
good,Easy job with decent pay. Depending on the shift management was either great or not so much. Most employees were very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed working here.
good,Trabalhar com varejo x logística é uma experiência ímpar.
good,"When you walk in you are often greeted by your co-workers after week 1 or so of adjusting to the enviorment. while my Co-workers made me feel welcomed and I felt like I could be myself, there was contempt for our management like you would expect at most work places. Not a lot of people liked our assistant manager, our department manager was a swell guy. the lower management, the supervisors, where the best part of the job because they made you feel like you were apart of a team and family. The Wal-mart way was to make sure the customers left satisfied and smiling which in most cases we did. Wal-mart over achieved by making me leave the same way. Wal-Mart may be know as a main brand general store and for its low prices, but the customer service is what they pride themselves on. The hardest part of the job was more or less staying awake through the CBL's, but the most enjoyable part was just being there."
good,"Depending on which location you work at and what department you worked at the job can be stressful. Usually the stress comes and goes with the seasons. Great place to work if you need the hours and are a determined employee. They schedule you basically the hours you say you're available, only exception is when you get to the slow parts of the year."
good,I enjoyed what I did and was considered the one to go to if someone had any questions. I knew how everything was supposed to be and did everything I could to keep it in shape. There was one manager that was over my department that didn't like the fact when she had a question for any of the other members of the team they either asked me or told her to ask me.
good,"The coworkers make work fun, but that's about it. The breaks are over too quickly to even count and management is really strict about them. They work you hard and don't care how exhausted you are as long as they get their orders out."
good,"Highly competitive, metric driven atmosphere that creates an Extremely high performing culture that keeps the company moving forward. Focuses on total company improvement"
good,Was a great place to gain experience and knowledge. There was always something new to learn and the fast paced work environment was always challenging.
good,"Walmart was a learning experience. Meeting and greeting with the public and managing personalities was a challenging and worthwhile task. I made a lot of friends in co-workers and customers alike that I would akin to family. The hardest part of the job was that we were required to work most holidays and always on the weekends. Retail demands a person be available to work, usually when family schedule important events like holidays and weekends. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of serving a person directly and having what they need, when they needed it."
good,"Worked with great people. They provide great training and you have the ability to move between departments. The benefits packages they have are very good , and they also have other benefits."
good,I enjoy working at Walmart but management always seems to have it in for you and each other so theirs littke to no communication and then they don't seem to really care about your wellbeing so long as you show up and work they don't care if you're sick depressed or going through hard times
good,"A typical day at work includes getting returns, zoning, stocking shelves, assisting customers frequently, running as a cashier sometimes, taking online training often, making sure your work area is neat and safe for your customers and yourself."
good,"Greet people, ring them up. Help make sure they find what they are looking for. make sure there is always a clean an safe environment. help with inventory. management was always making sure each shift was on task with there work. the hardest part of this job was not having what a customer needed. I enjoyed this job because I was always making my customers day, as they would tell me."
good,They were a very serious company to work for but also made working there fun. They knew just when to be professional. Took great care of their workers. And are a very reasonable company.
good,Lovely people that work here and most are very helpful either solving customer dilemmas or helping others find more shifts to round out a slow week.  Management communication to general staff needs some work but then again that is the same as with other retail venues
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart for two years but it wasn’t in my career choice so the best option for me was leaving and finding something in my career field.
good,"taking care of the customers needs always comes first ….. A typical day as an aparrell  associate zoning and straightening up the tables and the racks trying to keep your area as nice and  neat  for the customers ,so that it may be a pleasant experience for the customers"
good,"They denied me an incident report twice. I got money stolen from my wallet and they never did anything about it. I was laid off because of my incidents that were clearly not my fault. The management was extremely rude. If the pay was better I would have stayed. The workers there are really friendly. Overall, it's a good job. I'm just not one to sit there and take it"
good,"Overall it is a good place to work. For the most part, management will work with you in whatever situation possible. Dayshift can be a little more strict on the rules because of more management present."
good,"the only problem I've ever had while working here was the security staff is not always on their toes. my purse and wallet was stolen two days before New Years and I lost $300 that day. an employee was able to break into my locker and steal in front of cameras which showed me the company isn't serious about their employees assets "
good,"Management at this store is definitely sub par, however, if you are a hard worker, your job will stay very secure. A lot is expected, however, sometimes unrealistically. My coworker are not very hardworking and often leave me a large work load."
good,"I wouldn’t recommend staying in a certain position for too long. Hours can be long as a cashier, but if you do move around the store in different positions it might be good. "
good,"Ok company to work for, depends on the local management team. Corporate level doesn't provide much support to local level team members or management. M"
good,"Walmart like all other retail facilities has it's own atmosphere for every shift. I worked Janitorial maintenance on night shift and I have to say as my first janitorial job and my first night shift job, I loved it. It is a faced paced job simply because we were for the most part limited to 2 and or 3 people a night to clean the entire store. Okay but, it's honestly not a hard job,  not the worst job. Managers can be a pain but, other than that it's seriously not a bad start into the world that is Walmart."
good,If you never worked for a company as big as Walmart I do not recommend. Very fast-paced and time waist on no one. Management was okay but link card days and holidays are the worst.
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for. However, the hours are not flexible. The leadership needs work, the communication between managers need to be improved."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart although it is stressful and fast paced. If they would work with the hours I need I would gladly go back, unfortunately they require open availability which I don’t have."
good,I feel so the management could be better at Walmart. Son of a manager is one hours there including the store manager or rude and  Unhelpful. The we're all about making sure that they stayed in their positions no matter how Or why another lost there jobs.
good,It was a ok place to work. Moved a round a lot to different departments when needed and everyone has to learn to run a cash register even if you say you don’t want to do it
good,I liked working at Walmart for the most part.  I really loved the department I worked and was placed into. My only discrepancy was that I was constantly forced to work in other departments when my department still had work to be done.  I didn't like the inconsistency  of not knowing when I went into work I didn't know where I was gonna be working.
good,Uma empresa nota 10..Boa experiência profissional.
good,Review of Walmart i start out down staking a truck. I learn how to truly multiply task. The most enjoyed part of the job is break down the truck the hardest part is try to keep up with time
good,High expectations.  Must be willing to work hard and fast to keep up with the demand put on by the sheer volume of product sold on a daily basis.  Hardest but best position from my standpoint was department manager.
good,"Enjoyed working with walmart, co-workers were great, some managers are not very helpful but all in all always had something to do for the pay I was getting."
good,"A typical day at work was to unload a 1,300 piece truck or 2,200 piece truck as quickly and as efficiently as possible. Once that was completed, the supervisors would delegate which employee had which isles to stock. We had to make sure to complete that task as quickly as possible. Some days were better than others but most days, our team would complete all the tasks that were given to us. "
good,Good place to work for someone in school that just needs a little extra spending money. Very laid back place to work pay is not that good you don’t get a lot of hours
good,I learned how to deal with a diversity of rude men and women. I learned how to be nice and polite to people who were super nasty to me and didn't deserve my kindness.
good,Walmart has showed me that being a team sport is very important. Focusing on my job is what i need to do everyday that i am working to get completion.
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place to start your journey into the workforce but I don’t want it to be my career choice, or life long commitment. They have great benefits for maternity leave but bonuses and raises are difficult to attain"
good,"The job itself was easy to do, however, the returning grocery carts to its proper perspective. When I wasn't pushing carts I had to stock merchandise."
good,Empresa boa para se trabalhar. Com bastante diversidade.
good,"The benefits are amazing.  Walmart partners with alot of different companies throughout the world to offer employees perks.  I've learned leadership skills, I never knew I had.  The hardest part of the job is time management.  There is not enough time in a day to maintain and manage your duties expected of."
good,While working at Walmart I learned a lot of things that I didn't know how to do but by God grace I succeed and got the job done.i am willing to learn new and wonderful things with this company
good,I enjoy my time at Walmart.  I love the casual dress and how clean the store is. The store Is very relaxed and fun.  I love the customers.   I just need more hours then what they are willing to give.
good,"Changes are occurring that make it difficult to work here because you never know what changes will be made or when and if your job will be eliminated. The company expects too much from one person. Attendance policy doesn't take into account treacherous driving conditions during the winter. Expected to come to work, no exceptions even if the roads are icy."
good,"Management is a downfall. Nice place to get recognized by customers . They dont accept doctors notes or weath conditions, youll still recieve a point."
good,"there is never a regular day at walmart, you always meet new people an you learn something new everyday. you grow patience, The busiest days be the beginning of the months."
good,I have worked for Walmart for 12 years in my time here I have worked in various positions starting as a cashier moving up to a customer service manager then I became a dept manager of the stationary dept. After that I went back to the front as a customer service manager due to a move for my husband's career. I also was the front end zone supervisor prior to becoming the jewelry department manager.
good,I would order merchandise that the department needed. I would help customers. I worked the cash register. I would fill out the work schedule which sometimes was not easy. I enjoyed meeting and talking to different people.
good,unfair no one to express what going on open door does not work buddy buddy system don't follow policey off day unfair no weekend or rotation job advancement buddy buddy sleep with employes
good,Every employee were Timed on each cart . everyone worked together as a team . the backroom was always cleaned store number 1746 . every worker there is kind
good,Walmart was a good company to work for. Was hired on a 1 year contract to install internet lines and fiber optic cables. They made sure I was happy with my work environment.
good,I like working at walmart. My co workers are decent people. They are fair with breaks  and lunch. Benifits are a bit below average. Scheduling is erratic and inconsistent.
good,"New absence policy sucks"
good,"WalMart is  decent  Place to work for.  WalMart is a high volume ,high paced place to work for. WalMart Pride  itself in customer service. They also pride themself in  having the everyday low price."
good,I enjoy working for Walmart. I don't feel the pay is in line with what the cost of living is for my area though. Very hard to get raises and no room for advancement.
good,Les Collegues et les Gerants se montrais tres amicales et aidant dans la plupart des situation. Travail plutot simple mais repetitif. Apprecier grandement aider les clients.
good,a typical day at work involved assisting the customer with check out.  I've learned to be more tolerable of others. The hardest part of the job was keeping customers calm whenever management needed to be called and management needed to be called consistently.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling that I have indeed helped the customers.
good,"Working there was great for the most part. I did my job, and I thought I did it pretty well. The last three weeks of my employment, my hours went from 25-30 to 11-18 a week. I had no choice but to look for another job, as I could not live on such low income."
good,a great place to work always busy during the holidays a typical day at Wal- mart is stock the items for customer to buy and help customer find products
good,"I enjoyed my time with Wal Mart, with a few exceptions but my overall experience with them leaves something to be desired. The associates and customers are great but the Management needs to get their house together."
good,"It's a great place for a first job. Great Leadership, management. Fun customers more times than not. Not many advancement or promotion opportunities available"
good,"Walmart has a decent work environment."
good,"It’s a good job if u have tough skin, lack of management, coworkers become more like family, I try to learn as much as I can so I can become a manager that doesn’t lack."
good,"I worked in NY in a new store that was very busy all the time. I enjoyed my job as cashier.  I enjoyed meeting new people every day. Also, I enjoyed helping every person that I could. It was a great place to work. Due to family needs, I transferred to Wichita, KS to a"
good,the part I loved the most was the regular customers and the relationships I had with them they loved the fact that I cloud remember what they smoked or wanted from behind the counter
good,Walmart offers great opportunities in different departments. Great for anyone with great communication skills and those who just like to help others. Great starter job.
good,"I was recognized for my exceptional customer service skills. Management was easy to work with.  Walmart was a fun place to work.  I wanted to advance in my career with Walmart/Sam's Club, but it was not easy for me to advance. I need to have a job where I worked more than 30 hours per week"
good,"No regrets. Walmart provided me the best exposure to so many elements of retail, marketing, operations and merchandising in the Cdn marketplace. I learned so much. Overall a good place to work with some big downsides. Leans teams are one of them, so expect to do lots of heavy lifting yourself. There is limited room for advancement for the same reasons. Merchandising and Operators run the show so if youre a support team, expect to work extra hard to be heard. Its the pay that will help keep you there in tough times."
good,"can be a fun environment, technology is changing the way the workplace is structured, advancement is very political, need to have excellent people skills"
good,"I worked in the fresh area and it was very productive and fast paced I liked it, the only thing bad was the management.. I would recommend it to a friend"
good,"If you need a job while you are studying or getting prepare for a better job these is the right one."
good,"As a teenager, I had a lot going on with school starting up and my family told me that cheer and school cane first. This was the first year that I have done an extra activity, so my parents thought it would be best for me. I tried to change my schedule as soon as possible before school started up again, but it got too complicated as my life became more busy. I had a huge problem with the way they scheduled things."
good,"Se trata de ambientes que brindan flexibilidad a los individuos para personalizar su estilo de trabajo. Determinadas tareas, impulsando la conciliación y permitiendo realizar labores personales."
good,"When I started it was a great place to work. It was a very inconsistent at time, but at the end of the day you knew where you stood with the company. Looking to go back to work for this company."
good,"The company itself has a lot of great people that work within the store, but I find that the stores themselves are run by people that don’t know what they are doing most of the time. Whether it is from a lack of knowing their people or not understanding their own policies they need improvement."
good,"-Must be able to work in a fast paced environment "
good,"Culture was laid back, fun, and lots of customer interactions. Management was bad and focused on other things than its employees. Opportunity to lean various duties but not worth the stress and pay."
good,Walmart is a cool job especially if you are in  college student trying to make some good money to keep food in our belly and gas in your car. It also pays well for a college student.
good,"Did not care if employee was disabled with seizures and when had them was unable to work for several days, the doctor even provided documentation about the seizures, but to Walmart seizures is not a disablity and if you missed 5 days your job was terminated. Walmart says families come first but they did not seem to care about the health of an employee."
good,"I started off as basically a glorified greeter, until the position changed and we started checking for un-bagged items. Then it became checking receipts as well as bagged items. that along with learning how to apply the security devices to our products and to which devices go to which products started to get a bit much, but ensured everyone that was AP had something to work on."
good,buena empresa aun qno hay comunicación entre mismos compañeros y desigualdad de genero
good,"What I learned at walmart is your basic abilities, stocking, team work and merchandising. As I continued to work there I did learn new things. Change is always a big one, you must be able to adhere the changes. I learned many tools about doing price changes, tpa's, cvp's and so on as well. But ultimately what I took away was team work. Everyone has a job to do and if you get behind someone is always willing to come and help."
good,I enjoyed working for the company. They took me in like family when I didn’t know anybody. Great way to promote and move up in the company. Helps build confidence.
good,"I was hired as a cashier. Which I loved doing, the was quickly as to become a CSM, I accepted the advancement. Learned the money center and customer service."
good,Overall I enjoyed my experiences working at Walmart on Cap Team 2. I would do it again. Everyone was very friendly and helpful and had no problem helping you when you needed it.
good,"The work place is really friendly, fast work paced( which is the time of work pace I like), moderaly compensated. I would definitely recommend Walmart to a friend."
good,"A good company its just the managers, they give management positions to people who does not work hard nor deserve it ie: father is the ceo so the store manager is new with no experience and no drive.."
good,"No job security....poor management....low wages....stressful working environment when busy and understaffed, which is often. No overtime, Holiday pay or incentives."
good,"a typical day at Walmart was very intense, a lot of the time the department managers left their work for us midshift workers so that was stressful having to pick up their work as well as ours. I learned how to multitask very quickly and deal with unhappy customers daily. The hardest part of the job was not having keys to unlock every lockup, which resulted in very unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was observing the type of people who would shop here."
good,"The only thing I didn't  like about  Walmart,when company come to visit the store , it's time to make things look good. It's  a job,so I would not tell anyone to not apply."
good,the atmosphere is great. certain management show favoritism. the pay was ok and it was fun to work there. co workers made the experience fun and I would work there again
good,I was able to get this job because of my military service. It was a temporary job and it provided me some income while I attended school. I would recommend the job to someone who needs temporary work.
good,Good job easy to work up good people good hours can get more hours fexablle good pay easy going but good balance of working and home life over all good palace to work
good,"When I was working there in 2011-2013, it was horrible, management was not nice, they treat employees like robots, no life after work, don't even appreciate if you go behind your work."
good,"During my almost three year stay at Walmart I have seen quite a few managers come and go. Some of which have been wonderful while others have been nightmares. They exploit their power and make the lowly associates suffer for it. We are expected to break our backs working for them while they show us no gratitude or thanks very often. I will pass by a group of two or three managers just standing and talking, and they're doing nothing else and making them look very unprofessional. Very rarely do I see a manager offering help or assistance to a customer or another employee to get something done."
good,"Most of my issue with working at walmart was the customers, don't get me wrong I believe with my whole heart that the customer is always right, however, when customers would attempted to bring illegal items into the store with them, or large animals, or steal, then get angry when confronted, make a huge scene in the store, it's not good for business, nor fair for other customers. Walmart has a hard time dealing with this kind of thing, as a society, I wish we would do better."
good,"Working at Walmart you have to be willing to sacrifice alot of time and be able to have patience. It can be very stressful and I feel associates at Walmart don’t recieve the recognition they deserve or the pay but it has it’s good things with it as well. I enjoy my department , we don’t deal with management as much and we get our job done well. Walmart as a whole I feel is a great company just has a few things that could be better but thats any company."
good,Change is the number one factor of being successful at Walmart. Managing the daily changes and the people involved in expectations and working environment can make the role exiting.
good,I love people so I got along with everyone - employees and customer alike. I was a Customer Service Supervisor so I was in charge of all cashiers throughout the store and the money they handled.
good,"Walmart works with your hours, and has a good work environment that is none stressful. The only thing that would had made it better was have good health insurance."
good,I loved working there but it become too much of favoritism and unfairness amongst the employees in our department and our hours was cut to under part time Witt being full time.
good,This was a very standard first job. The atmosphere was very professional and regulated. Very organized and to the point. I also built a great base of regulars here too.
good,They do not pay enough for the amount of work. My Manager was awesome but the one that was new played favoritism too much. I believe in the position she was in it should be her employees should be treated equally not based on who is a center of attention type of people.
good,All depends on how the day goes an what time of year it is. Management could be more hands on with out having to be asked to help out or get in trouble to do so and could be more understanding and more realistic on how long it really takes to get the job done. Needs to work on there system on how they run things.
good,Pays well matches for retirement. Very friendly computer system.  Autonomy for use of professional judgement being phased out. Lack of skilled experienced technicians.
good,"Being a cashier was fun because of the coworkers and the awesome customers.  Black Friday was my favorite day to work because I like the challenge of checking out as many customers as possible and quickly so.  I did not enjoy though, that I was trained management positions but never paid at those levels.  I would train cms managers and in customer service and then they would get the promotion over me.  I became the ""fill in when they call in"" person even though I mostly worked positions above my pay. And when it came to the company raise, it was higher than my pay after four years so essentially I was making the same as a new associate even though I was loyal to the company for four years already."
good,"De los 4 meses que pase en ''Super bodega Acuenta'' me sirvieron para aprender a trabajar en equipo, y aprender de diferentes labores debido a su polifuncionalidad, luego de salir de la empresa  por motivos ajenos a mi siento que sali mas preparada al mundo laboral."
good,Usually some king of issue between associates management a the customers. A lot of opportunistic people at walmart who wouldn't hesitate to throw someone under the bus if would help to further their own agenda.
good,It's good money but there's no creative thought involved in anything you do.It's mundane and they basically treat you like a robot. It's worth it for the most part.
good,Okay place for workers as long as you believe in favoritism. most of the job are divided almost equally amongst employees. But not all management have favoritism towards employees they do trade on equally.
good,"Most of the employees where fun to work with. Some of the managers bib not like it when some of use would be having fun wile doing the job that we wear given. Then when something is said about the time that is given to get the job done in is wrong, the manager would say that the time is right. To say that they are wrong you get wrote-up. That is so unfair to me."
good,There’s room for improvement and you can grow in the company my day starts at 5am and I break down freight date and place merchandise on meat wall I learned how to use a hand held tc70 computer
good,Management showed alot of favoritism to certain employees. Didnt know how to follow a schedule. Some employees were good to work with. Overall it's a decent place to work.
good,"My job is very relaxed, but however i do feel as if some improvements can be made. It’s very difficult to advance in a poorly managed environment. I know i could do better."
good,"The environment is fast paced and and makes the day go by fast.. I enjoy working with many people but the safety is a major factor here!! "
good,it is a great job if you are lucky enough to find proper management! but do not expect to be permoted if you are not willing to sacrifice. and employee theft is outragious!
good,The last few years at Walmart were very stressful. They made a lot of changes ho benefits and perks that denifited the company not the associats. A lot of things were taken from longterm associates such as ccumulated sicktine.
good,work was straight job wasnt to hard or easy. staff was straight. customers did test you on a average but u have to push through. schedules was based up to you.
good,I loved working as a cashier since i am an expert in customer service. I had a personality that many customers bragged about. I would say that Walmart does not really value you as a person or care much about personality. They overwork you and disregard your personal life. It was quite hard balancing breast feeding since they dont accommodate moms. Overall i loved my customers and would work hard with a big smile.
good,"I was only working 3 days a week. Not enough to pay bills. So I tried picking up shifts, I spoke to every manager in the store about picking up hours in different departments but nothing happened. I’m"
good,"I like all of the people at Wal-mart I feel they are like family I just feel it's time for me to change my career. I am good at what I do, I pay attetention to detail and I am very good at multitasking."
good,Fun place to work. But I see no reason why all the computer work each month. I see it as a way for employee's to take time from the job they should do. Each year only once should a person have to do assessments.Good company thou.
good,"Corporate wide management is not very supportive of hourly management but are very good with associate issues. I learned a great deal about corporate sales and supervisory skills based on corporate culture. "
good,working at walmart can be rewarding if you are willing to do all thats asked of you.  Managemeent at walmart Is very difficult to follow sometimes.  They ask alot from people.
good,"Clock in, Clear the back and set up any pallets, Set up the line. Begin unloading pallets to prepare to put out on the floor. Sort boxes according to Isle/ appeal. Start stocking shelves and organizing, unload any extra trucks that arrived ( Lawn & garden/ Dairy). Roll frait out to the floor."
good,"Wal-Mart was just a stepping stone to were I am now. The management that I had worked with was okay until the high up management came into play. The customer is always right no matter what, and some people did not believe that was the right way to run the store."
good,"A typical day was not to eventful. I had  begun to learn how to load the automated tellers. Management was complicated at times. the people I worked with were great. Catching people stealing, and customers cursing you was among the hardest part of the day."
good,A day at walmart is fast paced and hardworking. Management is cool. The hardest part of your job is really nothing just do your job. Most enjoyable moments are Accomplishments.
good,I found that Walmart is a good work place when trying to get back of your feet. I wouldn't say it was a good full time fit of me but I'm sure it is for others it just wasn't for me. they do have opportunities for you to advance in the company.
good,alot of working an dealing with costomers i learned that there is a true space for good and bad managers and that alot of people were there to work the most enjoyable part was seeing the happiness you could bring customers
good,Management does not interact with all of the staff & are rarely available for customer complaints/concerns leaving the clerks to have to take the brunt of any verbal assaults. Front end management usually contradicts each other in how to get things done. Associates are not held accountable for poor job performance.
good,"Fun warehouse job, just after 7 years of nightshift it’s getting old and repetitive. I know that’s any job but the poor management and lack of caring about you as a person gets annoying."
good,A typical day consisted of waves of people at different hours and on certain days we were almost too busy to get everyone. The management was great because they were cooperative and helpful in their depaartments and other departments as well.
good,Walmart is a good job they pay well and give good hours I enjoyed working in the deli meeting new people and getting to experience the deli work place
good,"The overall work environment is great, management however is the downfall, And the inability to balance a work and social life. The new overnight manager at store 2540 is not qualified to hold this position. And the new scheduling tools are not effective in working around people individual needs."
good,"Great for getting work experience, but it really does not seem like a place to stay for long. Mangers are often highly stressed which rolls down hill, and many managers seem unprepared for the roles the are in."
good,Working at Walmart can be very stressful depending on the customers and other associates.  I learned how to deal with people better even if they are being complicated. The best part of working an 8 hour shift is the 2 breaks you get and the hour lunch. Some people get alone with the managers and other people don't get along with them at all. The work place at Walmart is if you don't know where something is find another associate close by and see if they know where an item is and go with them to that area so that way you know where it is for the next customer who asks.
good,"Until recently I loved working at Wal Mart except for the pay obviously, it's Wal Mart. The corporation decided to eliminate my position and I was forced to take another job so that I could keep the health benefits."
good,"Overnight Stock shelves, Less people during the graveyard shift. Management will watch you 24/7 and will try to make you work faster than any other worker. Especially if you're the most hardworking one in there. There's nothing hard in working at Walmart other than the constant look in managers when they are enforcing you to work more faster than other employees, just so you can help them too. Most enjoyable part of the job is cleaning the aisles and making sure everything is looking full."
good,"they would have weekly meetings with all employees, projects were all across Canada. Construction projects would be mostly large renovations and new stores."
good,I worked the evening shift at Wal-Mart full time. I worked in different departments and areas within the store. I learned different work skills at this job.
good,If you're looking for a first time job Walmart is a great place to start. The managers are really nice people and very relaxed the hardes part of the job is definitely the pace and the most enjoyable part of the job is the 1 hour lunches we get to take
good,"Working for the Walmart company was interesting, it was a fun job for the most part, the people you work with were good to talk to, got to meet some good people with the position I was in. Typical day was cleaning and assisting people with finding where an item was located or giving an opinion on what was better. My favorite part was knowing that I help people make a better and more informed decision on purchasing an item. Managers were always busy with something, and there was never really enough people to work on the floors or cash. There was always new training, but there was little training on systems used or how to do most things in the store."
good,Steady work flow with little down time which is good. Like most work environments there is a seniority hierarchy. Must have good customer relation skills and time management skills. The hardest part of the job is being the intermediary between the customer and their insurance company; clarifying any misconceptions the customer has about what is and is not covered on their individual plan. The most enjoyable part of the job is truly helping others.
good,Walmart has a great business plan that works well when store level management works as a team.  Problems arise through ineffective communication and high turnover. Work-Life balance is difficult to achieve at management level and is not for someone who desires to spend time with their family.
good,"Refeitorio no local, porem nem sempre é atendido pedido de um funcionario."
good,Love the environment and what they try to do as far as making it feel like everyone has a part but in the end the managers could care less if you lose your job.
good,"como dije anteriormente, si uno quiere experiencia laboral es el lugar indicado, el ambiente laboral es bueno, pero eso depende de los supervisores, por mi parte llego a ser un ambiente de trabajo con mucha presión, mas de la que debería ser, los supervisores poco comprensibles y las decisiones de gerencia son para discutir."
good,Rolas turno trabajo bajo presión 8 horas de jornada pago semanal
good,"Um bom lugar pra trabalhar, mas tem muitos pontos a melhorar"
good,I love my job. I am very grateful and thankful to have my job. I just wish that I could advance my career from within the company. I love the benefits as well. Most of my coworkers are very friendly and easy to get along with. I love working with the public.
good,"This is a great stepping Stone job or First job, however no pay raises or room for advancement. Also very strict about being sick. They DO NOT take Doctor Excuses and only allowed 5 call offs per rolling 6 months. Unaccommodating to medical issues. Unaccommodating to those with children."
good,"Boa equipe de trabalho, ambiente agradável e respeitoso"
good,I really enjoy working in my department with people bringing out new products price changes and customers always a joy to help someone find products  and make sure they enjoyed they experience
good,"While I enjoyed the type of work I did at Walmart, it often seemed that management expected employees to be able to complete more tasks than what was actually feasible during a shift."
good,If you're looking for opportunities and real advancement please go to a Walmart Supercenter and not a Walmart Neighborhood Market. Too  few opportunities for advancement in Neighborhood Markets and they are stingy with transfers when you want to leave to a different store to advance your Walmart career.
good,"Its a great job if you intend to be ther for years on end. eventually you will move up and receive bonuses but not for a long time. The environment id fantastic, but the management at the time was extremely rude and demeaning."
good,I do not want to make working at Wal-Mart my career. I would have but they have taken so many benefits and holiday time and hours and sick and personal time away it almost is not worth it anymore and the opportunity for raises is non-existent except for once a year same time every year
good,They do not expect doctors notes. Also they aren’t very understanding of family life and family problems. Not very understanding that emergencies occur that cause you to need to leave work early or not make it into work (such as family and sickness related!)
good,"I worked in fabrics and crafts, it was interesting and challenging for me.  I had great people to work with and learnt a lot about sewing.  I now make all my own clothes and make many crafts.  "
good,"Ambiente otimo para trabalho, porem o salario não condiz com a função"
good,"Ótima empresa, porém sem oportunidades troca de horário em beneficio a faculdade."
good,"Management position is paid fairly. The  company is very associate friendly. And the Wal-mart culture is strong throughout the stores."
good,Liked working for Walmart. I was doing management work and promised a dept. manager position for 6 months and was not moved up. Got tired of doing the work without the pay. I was also promised day hours which changed to mid shifts which did not work with my family life
good,was a fun place to work always room for advancement free training continuous on line and in store training profit sharing plane and the ability to purchase stocks
good,"Fast pace environment. conducting face to face interactions with customers. The fun part about my job is meeting new people and putting a smile on people's face."
good,"My job in the dairy was ok, but I worked with a co-worker who was verbally abusive, He had been written up for this behavior, but continued to treat other sthe same. It wasn't worth an altercation. I resigned, I didn't need the stress."
good,Stayed with the company long term. Able to switch positions for a change in job duties. If you are a good worker they seem to make you do more work. Don’t always follow through on policies and therefore customers abuse the system and run all over the associates. Associates tend to be treated poorly a lot of the time.
good,Not to much amazingness with the location I was at atleast at my location. They dont really care about work life balance or taking care of their employees.
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers.I wasn't pleased with the management.I learned how to use the cash registers, answer the phones, data entery, and stocking."
good,gostei de trabalha teve algum pontos a deseja sobre liderança mas tirando isso e bom lugar para trabalhar
good,"Contratacion de personal para los diferentes departamentos de la empresa, dar seguimiento y solucion a problematicas que se presentan con los empleados asi como impartir cursos de induccion y el aprendizaje para relacionarte con las personas de diferentes idiologias."
good,Walmart is a ok place to work at depending on the environment there in. You can learn different things that can help in making a career. You can excel here.
good,"I learned much at WalMart, from customer care to stocking shelves. Management did the best they could in any given situation. Workplace was upbeat and quick paced. The hardest part of my job was pretending to care as much as customers did about a 10 cent price difference. The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting genuinely appreciative customers with whatever they needed."
good,"The associates are on their own. Management sticks together."
good,I enjoyed my time working for wal-mart. I met a lot of great people. I learned a lot of skills working for wal-mart as well. I would definitely go back to wal-mart if i had to.
good,The pharmacy itself is amazing. I absolutely love what I do and the majority of the people I work with; on the other hand the Pharmacy manager (M.M.) is unpleasant to work with who uses his masculinity to intimidate those below him. He is extremely pessimistic and find joy in tearing others down. He tries to run a dictatorship and its quite repulsive.
good,"On Cap 2, we’re expected to do a pretty significant amount of work within a regular work day. I, and many others feel we’re treated poorly by others in the store. Including some management associates. "
good,Its a nice place but has its flaws. There are times of miscommunication and disorganization. They are flexible and work with you on the hours. There is room for advancement and some supervisors are helpful.
good,The best part about my job would be the whole team working together and put inventory on the sales floor. What I learned from that was when we build together it makes every decision work out a lot easier.
good,All in all a good work place. Hours are consistent. Pay is consistent. Benefits are decent. Management is ok. Co-workers are great to get along with. As long as job is done everything is fine.
good,"Walmart has a ping pong table in the lunch room. For an 8 hr. day you have to take an hour off for lunch. If you don't you get disciplined for it. The hardest part of the job is when some employees use you to try to get rid of you. The easiest part is just doing your job as you should. The management is alright. One of the other hardest parts of the job is that if something serious happens then you can not take time off during the summer, you have to work through it. I learned that from experience- I was let go because of it. Ohter wise it was a pretty good job to work at."
good,"You were always expected to be in multiple places at once, plus get everything you were expected to do in an eight hour shift. Just because you were assigned to one department didn't mean anything and it was your job to learn the surrounding departments. If you did not complete your tasks in your assigned department because you were required to help customers in another department you were verbally warned and then wrote up."
good,"A typical day for my position is having to move freight in the cooler making it a very neat and safe working environment . I learned how to use scanner to bin products. The management is really good but they also take their jobs serious. The hardest part about the job is putting up with the costumers attitude, but not all of them are bad."
good,"I enjoyed working there,  sometimes i't got annoying with certain employees but nothing I couldn't overcome. Good management practices,  they were always nice"
good,love being a cashier @ walmart hope to be able to be rehired soon i love the fast pace the friendly  customers and co workers    love working black friday
good,This is a great company to work for if you don't have children or like to celebrate the holidays.. You need to understand doing holidays season the company need you the most.
good,"The job itself is a good one, providing opportunities for customer interaction, as well as opportunities for advancement. The problem, however, is that the management (or at least at my location) is not very helpful or motivated when it comes to those opportunities. Progress is slow, sometimes taking months to hear any news. The running state of the store is good overall, with customer satisfaction at a steady rate of approval."
good,"Good first job, or if you need a fresh start over. Everyone was very nice and helpful. You always stay busy. Never a dull moment while working. Always stay on the go."
good,"managing the front end giving lunches breaks placing assoicate in there areas cash handeling etc. Ive learned so much at walmart how to enter act with other my mangaging skill, there culture is good some of the managers are wonderful and some just do not care. The hardest part of the job is communication skills, the most enjoyable part is clocking out."
good,Working at walmart is weird. You have 1 store manager 2 co managers and like 6 assistant managers. Everyone giving different tasks for you to do with out letting others know that youve been reaaaigned
good,"On a typical day at work we would most likely finish what we started the previous day. We would have our weekly team meetings. I actually learned a lot of things, working at Walmart such as how most retails places are ran from behind the scene. Management was always good at the Walmart I worked for. The culture is very helping, willing to teach you something if you're not sure of something. The hardest part of the job was when we had to do extra work because the previous shift wouldn't finish often enough. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with open people. It makes your job that much easier."
good,Wal-Mart was a good job. In need of better communication. Managers worried about the wrong things which wasn't fair to many people. You work overloads with little pay.
good,"It is fun sometimes, they are friendly, but  they expect alot out of the hard workers and not so much of the lazy ones. They only promote people, if necessary."
good,As long as you're willing to work willing to learn you will succeed very well at Walmart. They believe in promoting within. Have lots of bennifit options.
good,"Walmart pays well, that's the best I can say. Often times there doesn't seem to be good communication between the management and the workers. It also was impressed on me that it didn't matter how well you did your job, just as long as you did it."
good,"Great place to  start off, learn a lot of things in one job. meet a lot of interesting people.move up pretty fast thee. hour lunch.alot of potential. withal of room to grow."
good,As with any retail job it had it's ups and downs. My managers were pretty good and the hours were not bad. The job itself was pretty easy too. Most of the customers were nice also.
good,Most days went by normal. But if you had any thought about wanting to advance in Walmart you had to be in good with the managment or it didn't happen there is a lot of favoritism going on there.
good,they promised you an x amount of hours and then beginning and then slowly and slowly over like 4 months I went from 40 hours to 20 hours and then just got ridiculous and instead of giving people more hours they hired more people and gave the people already there less hours with just doesn't make sense at all
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my regular customers come in to shop.  You get to know them and develop relationships. The hardest part about the job is always being short staffed.
good,"As a suggestion to anyone looking to seek employment with Wal-Mart, I advise being self-motivated and relaxed. Part of the problem I see from my experience comes from people having too open of availability and the system making their schedules hard to work with. If you take transit, I advise noting weekends off if it doesn't run to the location on such and finding the time ranges of when bus or trains run. "
good,"A typical work day was outlined for each employee and it involved: getting freight out to the shelves, pricing and general cleanup-proper display. However, most times the employees were stretched outside of their limits or assigned work and so it made it difficult to complete all tasks assigned. We had to multi-task but the hardest part was staying on task due to various interruptions. My fellow associates were the most pleasurable part of my job."
good,The Walmart I worked in didn’t have the best managers and when you don’t have good management it makes your job a lot harder than it needs to be. I wish the conditions where a little bit better in the summer time when it gets hot in the back room.
good,Very good and worked their.for 17 years.  And may return there if possible.  But at a part-time job rather than full time.  May actually try for a management position.
good,"Serve customers by ringing purchases collecting various payment forms..I learned a small amount of Spanish to communicate and make customers feel relaxed to enjoy shopping.  Management at the time I worked there was awesome, could never have a better team.  Enjoyed talking with customers and getting them through lines as quickly as possible."
good,Wal-Mart was a great place to work. I started there when I was just 16 years old as a cashier and worked my way up to customer service manager. I would definitely recommend this job to others.
good,"I worked with them for about 5 years an it’s a good place to start working an building work experience especially in retail. Associates can very nice a supportive as well, they don’t just throw you on the floor without proper training first."
good,"I worked as the overnight Grocery Lead, Grocery Department Manager, overnight cashier and Overnight Customer Service Manager.  I enjoyed what I did in all positions I held but certain Management with ""bigger name badges"" and those on ""power trips"" kept me from going into upper management positions."
good,Be on time.  Have fun while you are working.  Only call out if you really need to. Try to also move up and become a manager if possible. Try to get to know everyone you work with.
good,"The management likes to promotions to a very small friend group and actively ignore the complaints of the workers so they can advance their own desires. "
good,"its a okay job, its like a big high school the management is not the best. but its a good job to get by with definitely. will get 40+ hrs . some management is understandable and will work with you. its not a bad job just stay to yourself."
good,"Friendly and family type of moral with the employees. Clean, fast, and friendly. Employees willing to lend a helping hand in any department as needed."
good,I know a lot of people who still work at Wal-Mart and they constantly complain about the hours they are given and about the security there. I didnt mind it as my first job.
good,"Good money , but very stressful  to work for.  Needs a better health care plan for associates.  Can advance if liked by upper management.  Can change your work hours with a minutes notice, normally not enough coverage."
good,"When I come into work we tour the store and make notes on signing and merchandising opportunities.  I then have administrative time to plan out the evening and what my associates need to do. Once this is complete.  I assist our CAP 2 Supervisor with managing his associates.  I help stock shelves with CAP 2 and assist other parts of the store that make calls.  I unlock garbage and let our associates out that have organics.  I lock up different parts of the store that close at night.  The overnight team arrives around this time and I have a quick meeting.  After the meeting, I get with our modular team to discuss what modular's they will be changing out that evening.  I then meet with my Clean Team Supervisor and communicate the cleaning plans for the evening.  I then get with my support managers and go over the expectations of the evening and we set off to work.  We then go into our closing procedures.  My supports and I verify that our fresh department was cleaned to expectations.  We then do our cash register flips.  We unload any trucks that arrive during the night.  I work with my associates stocking and rotate around.  Towards the morning I start walking the store to make sure no freight was missed.  That everything is being put away correctly and accurately.  The mission is to make the store look like it was never shopped.  First shift assistants arrive.  We walk the store and they make plans for the day and anything they need us to do on overnights.   If any issues were found within departments, I stay and communicate this to the Department Managers.  I also email these"
good,The only problem I've ever had there was some management don't like to do their job and want to put it off on others. Other than that its a very good place to work. Its like a family.
good,"Fuffilment has the only hard working manager. the higher ups try to do things that simply dont work and they dont listen. its an easy job, but people try and make it difficult"
good,"although it's a great company to work for.. you don't get to pick your own days/hours if full time... the management sucks, and you always get late breaks."
good,"Work attendance, and job performance is the key along with good customer service there are alot if good things about Wal-Mart you just have to take advantage and apply yourself"
good,"I really enjoyed interacting with all the customers as they came in the store, especially all the regulars. I also loved working overnights cause I was able to get more work done without all clutter."
good,"friendly culture with team work."
good,It was an ok place to work. I had put in for several transfers to another location. The store manager would not approve them. I finally quite to work for another company. Overtime is not aloud but you can get 40hour work weeks.
good,I guess its okay.  Overall I guess its really okay.  Okay now that I think about it thinks were always greasy.  I would always come home with grease in my hair and eyes.
good,"Working at Walmart provides you with the opportunity to work with great people of all backgrounds. Unfortunately, the hourly pay is very low. Customers can be very rude and receive everything they demand, even if they were wrong in the first place. Overall, I have enjoyed my time at Walmart and the relationships created."
good,"Working At Walmart Made It A Fun Safe Place To Work, It Was A Friendly Place Smiling And Talk With Customer's That Just Come By Everyday Not To Buy Anything But To Come And Speak Because You're A Very Nice And Helpful Person To Them Is The Best Feeling Ever ."
good,Really fast paced work environment. learn to deal with difficult customers and some complicated issues. everyday new learning opportunity and new problem solving skills improved
good,"This job was fast paced mostly, and somewhat laid back. I enjoyed helping out the customer and the feedback I received from them were even more rewarding."
good,Pana Walmart is just not a very good place. poor management leads down the ladder to department managers and that heads down to the supervisors and so on in the employee chain.
good,Wal Mart could be a tough job to handle with the inconsistency in scheduling but it helped me prioritize between work and school. I would recommend Wal Mart to those who are looking to gain experience in the customer service industry .
good,"I get to work at 9 or 11 am, at 11 when I get to work I start breaks for everyone beginning with the first one to come in at 8 am. My day starts off good with filling prescriptions and getting to meet new people. The people I work with we all work as a team to get all the prescriptions filled, applying and recording all the drug orders to answering the continuous ringing phones, I have learned to appreciate my work and my health, The management seems to listen when you need certain tools to get the Job done,The workplace at Walmart is a carefree and very good environment, The most enjoyable part of the job is my group of people I work with, being productive and getting the Job done by the end of the day."
good,Retail is very enjoyable with a variety of tasks to be completed each day. Enjoyed working with so many types of people. I enjoyed working with all my employees and staff.
good,"Our location offers flexible hours, which is very nice. Typical office atmosphere, cubicles that can be personalized and that is nice. The bad is changing direction and lack of interest by Home office."
good,It was not a bad place to work. Had many great friends and co workers. I enjoyed the ability to help people find everything they needed. I would defiantly work there again.
good,"dealing with customers on a daily bases. giving customers information on panel tv's, audio systems, and prepaid cell phones. able to learn the workings of the retail business. while most  members of management were helpfull and supportive, some difficult to work with."
good,The pay is good it is busy there is always something to do they just really dont allow know overtime the breaks are fair they give points for when u are hospitalized or sick you will work with pneumonia or the flu
good,"Después de estar dos años en la empresa terminas muy fastidiado, probablemente por los jefes."
good,Walmart is pretty fun as far as meeting new people and getting your regular customers that come just to see you and go through your line. I didn’t like the schedule that I had because it was never consistent one week I would have 20 hours the next 15.
good,"I worked for walmart for 31 + years but my job is being eliminated. I love walmart but it is time to move on. I am still treated as a respected associate,   and I have learned alot and have grown with this company"
good,"Walmart is a good learning experience. I learned how they decorate cakes and how the bakery works."
good,This job provides a nice beginners pace for a work environment that was also low risk for errors while still giving you a sense of work. The managers were all approachable as well.
good,"For the most part I really enjoyed working for Walmart. However since I had my special needs child they could not work with my hours and she has to come first. I love working in customer service in person, I enjoy stocking the shelves and making what is a mess into ""art work,"" My hours of work would depend on where the store location is from the area my daughter attends school. And what time she gets out. Thank you for your time and patience."
good,"Great company to work for as long as you are part of a strong, honest, team player management team. Benefits are awesome especially the amount of pto days you get after longterm. Just a job that needs your dedication 100% of the time. As a speciality Manager you don't get to spend the time in automotive that the company wants you to. Retail is very stressful in general with not much family time, especially aroumd the holidays. Must have patience to help customers, especially when heaving to explain the claim process if somthing happens to their car after working on it."
good,"Like most, management was not so great. It was a jumbled mess that was extremely disorganized. I did not like the way certain situations were handled, and when you had an issue personally, management could care less."
good,I worked at Walmart almost 6 months and every day from the first to the last I was consistently talked down to. Management told me to ignore it instead of doing anything about the daily harassment.
good,I have bad kidneys and there are times that I do get sick. She expects too much of me I don't like working on the belts at Walmart cause there is to much heavy lifting
good,"Worked well with personal life, gave breaks when needed, payed fairly, my manager was not very friendly nor did she train me herself like she should have but other managers there are polite and take the time to actually work with you."
good,It's hard because it's always changing. Rules always change. Supervisors change just as fast as the employees. But if you work hard at everything you should be okay. Just try and be sincere.
good,"It's an ok place to work,  but when you have bills and you're not a salary member of management it's hard. Good people,  never a dull moment. Very fast pace."
good,One of the biggest struggles I had at wal mart was getting problems handled when they were taken to management. I also felt as if some employees were targeted to do the harder tasks because they were reliable rather than the weaker employees getting the proper training to be able to do more at the store. The store manager did a good job at keeping the things he could control in line.
good,overall it was good at the time being but it slowly started to get worst and worst making it not fun to work and didn't get hours that worked for me and my family.
good,"Often the job would require long hours, a minimum of 50 hours a week. Due to the nature of retail one of the most stressful things in it would be dealing with problem customers, but the workload itself isnt bad."
good,"I intended to retire with Wal-Mart. Company restructure eliminated my position. I loved working for walmart and advanced quickly, however the constant change in leadership in different regions/markets made for shaky ground."
good,"Typical day at work consist of delivering to a store. Usually less than 200 miles away. After delivery, you will either head back to the DC or pick up at vendor. Mostly drop and hook. I do have concerns about the future of the private fleet. Managers are good people for he most part. Hardest part of the job for me is leaving home. Most enjoyable part for me is returning home. I do it for the money. Make no mistake about it, that is the only reason for me leaving home to do this job."
good,"I enjoy a high majority of the people I work with and have yet to really meet someone I dislike. It's such a wide variety of individuals- including a few Trans and Gay associates, which is okay with me- I am friends with a few of them. "
good,"Keeping your head up and your nose clean is best for progression. Stay professional and things will be ok. This workplace is very competitive, you have to prove that you want to move up in order to truly do well."
good,the job is easy ...work day is just a day .....the best part is just being able to work culture is down management is open I learned to be a safer driver
good,"I liked working at Walmart. It was quick-paced so time went by fast. I was guaranteed hours because it was always something to do, and the other workers were nice."
good,"Very stress environment but at the same time simple tasks to be taken care of, busy restocking, reassuring floors are hazardous free and customers leave happy. Learned how to multi tasks and take upon big tasks, customer service skills, management skills and patience. Wal-Mart managment is alright, managers are very understanding in which they also work with you upon the change and motivation"
good,"It was a nice friendly environment"
good,Walmart is a great place to work. They have amazing benefits if you work full time. If you have open availability they will surely give you the hours.
good,"It was a great experience to have working there as a CSM, it could be stressful at times especially being by yourself but any job has its faults. overall I loves my job at the time, the pay was great and my co-workers were amazing."
good,"Go to work, do your job, don't fool around, smile & greet the customer, don't call in, do whatever the manager says to do even if it's extra, follow policy"
good,"fine in certain areas but if you go to different Walmart's now they have certain employees that I believe are not qualified for the position, certain thoughts and beliefs as well as treatment to customers and employees."
good,"collect shopping carts from the lot and bring them back to the designated area. clear lot of any trash. go insides perform maintenance work, sweep and mop floors."
good,"You have to do a lot on your own with. no training. It's not easy but if you do you do your best you can go far. Express your ideas to improve, but don't be upset if they get turned down. Honestly your career advancement depends on you and no one else. It is not an easy job no matter what department, so if you want easy do not bother applying. The store, associates and customers are amazing, but of course you still get rude people. I don't agree with some corporate decisions because they want more money for less work. I'm not trying to say bad things about them. I just wish they would go on undercover boss. Corporate does not understand what needs done on the sales floor, and does not understand the corners that management cuts to be able to get things done."
good,Working at Walmart was fun and always kept me busy. Breaks and lunches were all greats and reasonable timing. Great team work and communication between management and workers.
good,My job at Walmart was something I was proud of for 10 years. These last three years have been a steady decline. We no longer keep our customers happy. We have hundreds of ours and workers are not trained properly. The your goals that Sam Walton had in place are a thing of the past.
good,"I learned different things about retail and the fact that any place can have loyal customers. I really liked working with all these customers and the co-workers were very helpful. I had to leave because of a person circumstance, but i still miss my fellow co-workers."
good,they have very high expectations for stocking. I found it hard to meet those expectations and found that i wasn't enjoying work as i was when i started.
good,There really isn't a typical day at Walmart. Everyday is something new. The culture is wholesome. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers get familiar with the self check out machines.
good,"I've worked at this Wal-Mart for a little over a year now. Though I've changed job position a couple of times I'm a Produce associate. The job can be demanding at times, but it mostly depends on the amount of effort you exert. I've met plenty of good people there whether employees or customers. The turnover rateat this store is high mostly due to poor management."
good,"Not a bad place to work depending on who your manger is. Good family environment, sometimes stressful but normally is go at your own pace as long as your work gets done."
good,a typical work day. the customers were the best part of the day they were from different walks of life each with their own story. they were pleasant and made the job better.
good,"sometimes you cut meat for the customers or made salads, or sandwiches."
good,"a typical day was stressful,depending on how busy it was. how many people we had that day...getting all the carts in in all types of weather. some manangment was gud others jus rude"
good,"If you enjoy working with the public and being a team member then you may find working a Walmart a great place to be.  You can look forward to inconsistent scheduling unless you have strict availability or hold a managerial position.  For the best work opportunities you must have open availability, 7 days a week.  Anyone looking for advancement should let their management know of their career goals to have the best opportunity."
good,"The company itself and it's policies are well prepared to protect both the workers and the company. "
good,"Buen supermercado para empezar una carrera, los compañeros agradables"
good,Lots of work so your never be bored. Good people to work with. Manager assistants at all times. Loved the flexible schedule they worked around my schedule perfectly.
good,"For my first job I loved it, I enjoyed working with different customers from all walks of life. I enjoyed working the register very much but it could be a demanding and sometimes degrading type of a job, not everyone can be a happy customer."
good,I was going to culinary school at that time and they kept scheduling me on the days that I had classes when it was agreed before hiring that they would schedule around that. One manager was always very rude and inconsiderate with the workers in the bakery. Must have a lot of patience due to the stupidity of some customers.
good,"Few years since ive worked there, but they were great with accommodating with school! usually worked 4-8 hour shifts and the 1 hour lunch was always nice!"
good,I would have liked to stay at that job but it came down to corporate getting rid of me for being late one too many times which I'm not mad at because I was supposed to be there on time which I was late a lot because I had my kids at home and I could not leave until my wife got home from work..
good,great company to work with. feel very proud to be a part of this reputed institution. would like to work again with the a company. This place gives gives opportunity to learn and grow everyday. You always have something new to learn and experience.
good,I feel this job was great Being 18 at the time . I was pushing carts collecting them for the store .I would clean them out take the trash out of them for the customers.then I would take them in the store . I would work outside in the summer and winter. I would be store greeter as well.  At times when the manger needed people to greet.  To cover for the employees/worker.  I learned hear dont play at work. And I Learned Disiplinent.
good,A typical at day wal mart is going in to a work area that is almost always has things to do that the other shift didn try to get all your work done then get the other done.
good,Was not a bad job. Like my coworkers. Some managers should have to be watched a lot of things go on in Walmart that no one knows about. I like their pay and how some of the staff are. Enjoy the customer always
good,"A typical day at Walmart can vary. Depending on the day, and the hour. When employed with Walmart, I had worked multiple positions. So the typical day could've been on cash, customer service, electronics, fashion or anything I was asked to do. What I had learned from Walmart is the appropriate way to handle irate customers and various other situations."
good,During my time with Walmart I have experienced many things some good and some not so great. Working in retail have given me the opportunity to interact with people and taught me how to work as a team towards one goal. I value my time there and that them for giving w the opportunity to work there
good,Walmart for me was a good first retail job. I learned allot outside of my two job titles while working for Walmart. I worked hard and was promoted before my 6 month probation period.
good,"lugar agradable de trabajo con una ambiente entre colegas bueno, pero con poco tiempo para la vida personal y una administracion algo desordenada"
good,"Cashiering at Walmart is just about like it is anywhere else when it's a big box grocery store. You spend the whole time in the same position, more or less, and are working face to face with multiple types of people."
good,Overall I learned a lot while I worked at Walmart. I enjoyed helping customers but found that the company was too money driven. You would be forced to work shifts like Christmas Day etc.
good,Working people everyday whether its customers and or associates. Serving customers and keeping assocites happy makes the business run perfectly. It was a great experience
good,It was good the place was nice and stuff pretty nice the management not that good too much politics. Pretty annoying there are groups management does not care most of time.
good,My manager was very nice.  I did not earn enough money for my job.  Neither did my coworkers.  The company itself is a terrible corporation.  Thanks. Have a great day.
good,"Worked as a Cashier and provided excellent customer service to patrons, employees were relaxed and fun to work with, the environment was brightly lit and comfortable,"
good,Walmart is a good place overall and the management was fairly good at their jobs. I would work there again. I’d recommend it to friends. The department managers was the best thing about working at Walmart because they helped out the associates whenever needed.
good,"Wal-Mart would be a decent place, if there wasn't so.much negativity. My manager was good at all, she tried working me more than what my doctor was allowing me. She said it was per business needs."
good,"With the recent changes, everything is more chaotic than it already was. Nobody wants to give us a straight answer on anything we ask and require us to change our availability if we wish to get more hours. The problem is, even if you have a wide range (mine is 4 am-9 pm), you still may not get the hours you want or need. I'm ready for a change from a company that doesn't seem to care about its employees to tell them the truth about things."
good,Aquí no podemos tomarnos ni un momento d descanso porque entran clientes a cada momento alertas para evitar robos y demas
good,Fast paced and easily learned skills. You learn patience and get a rhythm down with tasks given to make the routine fast and productive. Managers are understanding and give everyone a chance to show their potential. Hardest part is dealing with tough and unreasonable customers throughout the day. Best part is helping the customers that appreciate you and are uplifted by your help.
good,"to many hrs not enough one on one advancement, lots of expectations not enough recognition even after 15yrs of employment, treated like a number not a family member."
good,the only reason i left was for more money. The company i went to was the complete opposite of this. If possible i would like to return to wal mart. They did nice things for the employees and offered you a way to advance in the company
good,a typical day started with morning starting of all conveyor systems and started walkthrough preventive maintenance all of all power equipment.and scheduled down time for repairs.
good,"empresa com otimas condições de trabalho,poucos beneficios."
good,Walmart is a good place to work. It used to have a rotating days off and got paid every other Thursday. I liked being an over night stocker and mixing my business helping customers when needed.
good,"The position that i worked was always trampled on by the other managers regardless of how well we did or if some of us didnt get all of our jobs done, no matter what we did we would always have the same degrading things said about/to us"
good,I wish I was paid more for how hard I work. Also for the knowledge I have. I really wish the pay scales where more fair. I've been there almost 4 years and there's people that just started that make more than me.
good,"On a typical day at work I would clock in and go straight to the back room to start unloading the semi truck. Then once that was done if it was time I would take my first break. After that I would start stocking freight on the sales floor until it was time for lunch. Come back do the same until my second and last break. Then stock until it was time to clock out and leave. It was very repetitive day in and day out. Management was pretty relaxed as long as you were doing your job and not goofing off. The best part was getting to help customers and seeing them smile when you helped them find an item. The hardest part would have to be when the management was mad about something or if they got yelled at by their boss. Then they would make you do a bunch of unnecessary things around the store. I am all for helping a fellow worker, but when they are rude just because they messed up and got yelled at for it that is where I draw the line. All in all it is not a bad place to work as long as you do your job."
good,Walmart is a relaxed place to work at. Flexible and willing to work with you on just about anything or any unexpected family emergencies that may arise.
good,"I liked working at walmart because of the long hours and good pay, its not hard to get hired, they do everything they can to provide a sage and friendly environment"
good,A typical day a Wal-Mart consisted of me conducting a store tour and ensuring store management and associates are executing policies and procedures properly. Investigating Shrink or integrity investigations. Ensuring a safe work and shopping environment. The past 25 years has taught me that most people perform more affectively if you manage them with a positive attitude and not by intimidation. The culture of Wal-Mart is still alive and well and is talked about prevalent everyday. The hardest part of my job maintaining a good performing store for 12 months. Keeping it on the right track. There's nothing more gratifying than having a store make it's inventory target. Wal-Mart is a great place to work. However I'm  I feel very underpaid. I made the same amount of money 10 years ago and need to make a change for my family.
good,"Liked working for Walmart.  After 6 months of night work, I wanted to switch to days because shift work had me sleeping all day.  Management was reluctant to switch shifts even though I received above average work performance."
good,"I currently work at Wal-Mart part-time. It is not a career, but a second job. The atmosphere is great, and management will work with your schedule. They offer bonuses every March."
good,Very fun and productive place of employment. You have the opportunity to learn new things and met new people. The management is always there to help..
good,"I was always forced to do other people jobs and i even got in trouble because other people don't know how to do their jobs, they pinned everything on me even tho i have been there less time then the rest of the crew. Always got in trouble for irrelevant stuff you cant control, and bossed around by people who don't even know how the job is even like. being told by someone who doesn't even know what they are suppose to do."
good,"Walmart es una empresa donde se te permite crecer y ser ambicioso, pero a la vez la responsabilidad es mayor, pero te ayudan a salir de ello."
good,"Decent place to work for students and retired folks. Most of my day is very fast pace in balancing customers, daily management notes and other responsibilities."
good,Great environment to work in sometimes but most of the time there is way too much favoritism. You can have fun working here but if you are not a favorite you will not get promoted.
good,"once you clock in you are on the go and until lunch, you stick to your department and make sure the customers have stocked shelves to pick from. managment does help but are known for redirecting some who is not finished with a task"
good,"Greet each customer with a friendly smile and take care of their orders in a timely fashion Retain a clean and sanitary work space Restock shelves if needed, or pull product forward "
good,Get what you put into it however can be stressful. Overall the co workers with the employees you work with are very nice. Can be very busy very easily.
good,"Overall I like working here, the people I work with, and the jobs I'm responsible for. My issue is the scheduling and how it doesn't allow for set schedules or set amount of hours for scheduling kid events or budgeting."
good,Everyday was different for my position. Some days we were short handed so it meant I had to fill in where I was needed. Some days we were over staffed so I had to find things for everyone to do. And some days it just seemed like nothing could go right and everyone was a grouch. But everyday was different so the job stayed fun and challenging.
good,The manager was great and the people I worked with were great as well.  the reason I left was because of the low wage I was paid.  Would go back if the wage and hours were to change.
good,"As long as you know what to do, you're fine. Meeting daily requirements and goals is important and overall good environment and enjoyable with co-workers."
good,"Overall work place was good i had some good days and bad, but more good then anything. The only thing i did not care for was having to get buggies when we had cart pushers that was miss scheduled"
good,"Walmart is full of great people, but the hours suck and it’s kinda to balance a personal life, they say they’re going to work w you but they really don’t."
good,"Uma empresa boa de trabalhar mas não cumpri com horários do funcionário,é difícil uma oportunidade maior,mas a empresa em si é uma empresa boa com benefícios bom ao funcionário."
good,You must complete a decent amount of work in a certain amount of time along with providing customer assistance. If you call out sick or have extreme emergencies then you still receive points towards losing your job.
good,Good people to work with and managers always helped when we had questions. Customers were always kind and had flexible hours for employees that needed it.
good,Help Mourning Shift finish our Fright and stock the sale floor. Help customers with finding thing and stocking the sale floor. as we stock make sure me cull and take away bad produce. Make sure the customer has the best shopping experience and cleanest place to shop.
good,"Fast paced, things really move fast when your a overnight stocker. You have to really move around and make sure that you finish your assignments at a certain time."
good,Management could be a lot better. Fast-paced and high stressed. I worked here while pregnant and they didn't treat me fairly. A lot of drama in the work place.
good,I personal liked certain parts of my job. I enjoyed the people around me but the amount of hours I received were low for the most part. Most of the management team were easy to get along with and friendly. A typical day of work varied. The responsibilities were the same but the activities and things that needed to be taken care of changed on a day to day basis. I learned that everyone is different and that some people prefer certain ways of doing things and others just go with the flow.
good,"Senior Management does not care for their employees, which results in "
good,"Great people to work with, pretty straight forward. semi-flexible hours after talking to management several times. breaks are moderatly on time, but severely understaffed at times."
good,"At Walmart you will defiantly get a lot of hours, was in school and was still able to work 20+ hours. loved the people I worked with but management was a huge issue, had about 6 management changes in the 8 months that I worked there. Never really got trained, did not really had a job just wherever was needed."
good,nice place to work not much advancement I love the deli would recommend to family or friends pay is good as well bonuses received. your schedule is based off of your availability.
good,"Productive place to work, can be stressful when there aren't enough people to cover my department.  I learned a lot about peoples personalities.  The hardest part of the job is the managers inconsistency and not having a set schedule."
good,Fellow associates are amazing; management team is pretty good. Good place to work at during the day; as well raises are fair even despite minimum wage going up.
good,"In the beginning Walmart was very easy, fast-paced etc. overall it was an okay place to work. however, the management of Walmart was very poor, and dint care for the employees"
good,My overall review is that the coworkers had a bit of frustrations with one another and did not always get along and as well the managers were not accepting of sick days or accidents with doctors notes provided.
good,This position required a lot of time on your feet which included retrieving online grocery orders for online pick-up customers. If online grocery staff were up to par with orders then the day would go by smooth but if the department was understaffed then it would be hectic.
good,"Walmart was my first job so I don't have much to compare it to, but it has been a decent job. Management is wishy-washy and don't keep to their word all the time. But the company is trying to improve so maybe they will be much better in the future."
good,This job was very good. The constant work load could get over whelming when all the other team members don't complete their jobs. This jobs allows you to grow a sense of responsibility. I only request that it had more wage an discount benefits for employees to better compensate for the cost of living.
good,"The work was fun an easy to learn. The people I worked with were great. The main problem with working there was working on holidays, nights an weekends."
good,Walmart is an okay place to work. It provides flexible work hours and decent benefits for associates. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a job.
good,"my time at walmart was great, but not everyone there was great. if you haven't worked there for some time, they make it way too hard to try to come back there."
good,I do enjoy working for walmart but the work load is too much in such a busy store hours are cut alot of the time and they are not flexabile with hours.but good company to work for to learn
good,It was ok. It paid the bills so can't complain to much. The management needed some work. They pick and choose who they like and who they dont. Lots of favoritism in that Wal-Mart.
good,I believe that managers cause a store to go down. You need good people with good attitudes and people who care about the people they employ. Dedicated workers.
good,My Walmart did not have good management. I was moved to OGP and worked the amount of time required to receive the raise to 10.50/hr but they gave me the run around.
good,"The people who work at Walmart are great, never had a problem with any co-workers. Management is split 50/50, some are good others are lazy and do not do their part to help you.Customers are also not nice at all, you have to have tough skin for this job."
good,you get to meet alot of people and usually treated with respect but can be stressful when busy with lines stacking up. they give you good breaks for the amount of time you are working that day.
good,Management is not consistent.The hours are there. The pay is awesome. They are strict on rehires. Holiday pay is awesome. Can be a fun place to work!!
good,when I would begin work I would meet with the manager and find out what tasks needed to be done.  I would then begin my work and by the end of my shift I would be finished.
good,"The management was good but it could've been better."
good,"Empresa com chances de promoções."
good,"I would have to maintain the integrity of the department. I learned a multitude of things in order to successfully run my department. I had to learn how to operate the handheld device that Wal-mart employees use in order to keep track of inventory. Also I had to learn how to delegate responsibilities out to the correct people so that they would get done to the best standards. Management was tough, and always on top of everything. The hardest part of the job was maintaining inventory flow. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help people with their every day needs."
good,"Many associates there are competitive to one another. Managers don’t really help the associates unless they feel like they are moving too slow, such as lack of performance and the amount of bourse the freight has been on the floor."
good,"Nothing to write home about, but you can make a decent living with this company if you are willing to work hard. Recent structural changes have made it very difficult to advance past entry level management however, and the future of the management structure is unclear."
good,My days at work are hit and miss; some days we are really busy others not so much. I love the people i work with. Management is changing constantly. but only a certain few i would say know everything in the store.
good,I spent most of my adult life working there it was all I knew and now I am starting over looking for something fresh and new. Ready to hit the ground running.
good,"This particular store has one store manager, two co-managers, ten assistant managers, a department manager for roughly every department of the store (about 15), and 8 customer service managers, all running a store with about as many normal workers/associates. Classic case of too many Chiefs and not enough Indians, managers constantly overriding each other and changing what you need to be working on even if you are halfway through or almost done with the original task. Asset Protection constantly goes behind all the manager's backs to change how we do things on the floor regarding merchandise protection. With proper management and a good structure this store could be substantially better."
good,Uma empresa que respeita os associados e zela pela excelência
good,"Honestly, Working at Walmart can be very stressful! If you have a good, mature, responsible manager you will do well. Some managers are clicky and immature. "
good,Productive.  Good place to work. Advancement possible. Long hours standing in one place. Friendly associates. Very helpful. Management friendly and helpful.
good,"it was crazy to work their "
good,"The job had pretty sweet benefits all around if you stick with the company for more than a year. 401k, health insurance, even stock options are all available at any position you have."
good,"I worked in the Cash Office.  I balanced all the cashiers registers, daily reports, daily deposit to the bank, balanced the room twice a day and rolled coins and wrapped bills"
good,I love the customers the pay is good the hour are flexible it gives me more customer service experience my associates give me the encouragement needed to do my job properly
good,"I was hired as temporary during the holidays but they kept me on working 40 hours a week. when my six months time was up to where I would start receiving benefits, I went to Hr to speak about it. They had me listed as part time even though I had always worked 40 hours. When they updated it in the system, they proceeded to tell me it'd be another 6 months before I'd receive any benefits."
good,"Walmart is a good job to work on, it has a fast pace but its a good job, they don't give you enough hours. Im trying to get a new job because they refused to give me more hours, and I need more hours in the weekdays."
good,"Working for Walmart will have variances from store to store. For example, at the store I was hired at, managers kept an eagle eye on you and did not allow you to stop working for more than a few moments to step back and collect your thoughts and go about your work. At the store I transferred to, management leaves you do your job and doesn't mind if you chat with your co workers for a few moments. We do keep these conversations brief so we don't lose that trust. But the difference is like night and day. Customers can either make your whole day or make you want to pull your hair out. You really have to be able to take the good and let the bad roll off your back. I like being cross trained to be able to mix paint, cover several departments, and help as a cashier as well as unload the trucks. Not everyone gets that much training, but I was either ""volunteered"" for it or picked it up as I went along."
good,"Walmart is a overall great company to start out your career. If you work hard and is amphibious, you can easily move up in the Walmart chain. I have met Co-Managers, Store Managers, and even District Managers who started at the bottom and worked their way up the Walmart chain. The hardest part about working in the company is the constant change in policies. Some things that can be tough would be communicating with your direct manager, because they aren't always there. Another thing about the company is that sometimes the policies may be hard to follow, but luckily the management team and human resource does a great job at answering questions."
good,"It pays the bills, what more can you ask for? As far as upward mobility, it really depends on which store location you end up going to. In the end you are able to transfer to other stores so that's a plus, but if you want to really succeed it solely rests on your shoulders exclusively because no one will help you to take their job. Trust me."
good,Many of the employees were comforting. Got those who were new to this type of job to be more comfortable with the customers. Management was often understanding although tardyness will be met with discipline especially in the first 90 days.
good,"I liked working for Walmart but over the last few years the job security level has dropped dramatically. I was just promoted to the position I last held with them in June, and a lot of money was spent to train us all, just to eliminate the position in January."
good,"greeting customers "
good,"This job was very fast-paced, and you do the same thing all day. I enjoyed working in the mornings when things were a little slower. Also the shifts varied from in length."
good,"Staying at a steady pace is the best. You aren’t over doing it, but you are still getting everything done in time... Would be better with a little help"
good,"I was Employed for walmart for six years. I was hired under temporary help and after showing that I was a quick learner and was fast at my work I was kept under part-time. I moved from being a cashier to a service desk associate within two years. I began to work as a Customer Service Manager but, I was not given the title nor the pay for this position. After two years of working without position recognition or pay I was finally made a full time employee and named CSM with CSM pay. After two years of working this position and being a third shift CSM(overnight) i requested to return to day shift. I was denied this and being I couldn't work overnight and attend school I was left with no choice but to leave the company. I enjoyed my time with walmart but, higher management refused to work with my schedule. I was placed under rehire status with the company. I do not feel nor blame the company for the actions I had to take. I feel that the particular store I worked for was not a store that respected the team environment."
good,Empresa boa para se trabalhar principalmente pra quem estas procura do primeiro emprego eles nos dão esta oportunidade
good,"It was very good place to work. Just some time the comication between the employees and manger was bad,but also the employees we very hard worker and worked together."
good,New Management are not understanding or listening to Associates about our concerns.Some Lack Humility and common courtesy.A Work day is productive with the help of seasoned Associates.
good,It was a very easy and laid back job. It had great benefits. It had good management and good pay for the most part. It had plenty of room for advancements.
good,Helping customer's select the right electronics. I learned so many different jobs while working there. Management wasn't all that good nor were they to friendly. For me the hardest part of my job was work never wanted to work
good,I liked it but I Feel I took it for granted and now I’m sad about that. So now I have to wait a whole 6 months to wait to re apply again at Walmart. I liked the experience very much
good,I have worked here over 10 years and have promoted 2 times have a whole bunch of knowledge do not think I get paid for what I do or what I can bring to the table have been applying for other jobs.  Walmart’s downfall is placing the correct associate in the right placement. Just because they have gone to school does not mean they have the knowledge of the company systems or business that someone that has been there 10 years does. And then has to train the said new person who just moved from another team and has no knowledge or skills for the new position.
good,"Daily tasks were explained at the beginning of the shift to be completed by the days end. Upbeat energy and communication with fellow department heads to help complete the tasks often took place. Follow up meetings with management often took place throughout the day to ensure departments were on track, and if not a game plan should be in place. A well versed array of cultures and ethnicities were on various levels of staffing. The challenges of the day consisted of possibly not completing the tasks and delegating the game plan the others to finish. Enjoying the way staff tried to work as a team and encourage one another to have goals met was very enjoyable."
good,"Worked for over 20 yrs, good company but they are always trying to cut cost and sometimes it ends up costing them more money. This was part of the head office. My team was awesome we had each others back most of them from my Shift was there for more than 10 yrs.Will recommend you find another job this company is not stable anymore more and no Loyalty. They forgot what that word means."
good,If you need a job with ok pay and ok benefits this will work. Not as many hours as you may want but you usually wont starve. Has been fairly decent to my wife and her school schedule.
good,"Cool job but the management sucked. If they had a better management team, I most likely would have stayed. My coworkers were great. I wish they had more benefits but hey its life."
good,"My job specifically is very busy. Overtime is usually silently expected. It took almost two years for management to offer me full time. If youre looking to work alot of hours but only want part time then walmart is a good place. Hard to move up, but flexible hours. Can have as many days off as wanted if you have pto or can afford to take days off without pto"
good,"There was usually three or four people working in the pallet company a day.  We would unload semi's with pallets on them and sort the bad ones to the good ones. Different color pallets were red, blue and white wood. Had to sort through all the different colors and put them back on the semi's to be sent out!"
good,Walmart is a place where every price is low and where customers feel welcome to come in and shop with a smile  our job as crew members fro Walmart is to help our customers in anyway we can
good,Work hard and youll get promoted. A lot of times its about who you know so try to fit in well with everyone and get them to like you. The job isn't terrible.
good,como asociado de la cadena estabien si solo deceas permanecer o tener un trabajo estable pero si deceas creser no solo es ser dedicado al trabajo si no tambien hay que ser un poco barberos.
good,"the best part of this job its to learn and meet people of different countries and learn from them.  management sometimes are not good, not all but we can learn a lot there, the co worker are good and we can fell like family"
good,the environment was good with a lot of room for advancement. The management team was probably the only downfall of the experience. The people were great. you met a lot of new faces. large environment.
good,"Nice place to work, but little to no job advancement opportunities. Open door policy allows you to talk about any problems that may come up. Lots of changes in management detached from workers felt robotic emotionally dull toward employees."
good,"On a daily base I work get conflicting direction from multiple members of management. The work itself wasn't hard and for the most part I did enjoy it, but the biggest stress was management not being on the same page and giving out different instructions."
good,It was good  job and laid back you get to do your job in peace. Nobody over your shoulder rushing you. My supervisor was great the hours good 2 - 11 that straight I just moved
good,Job is a good job for people with not so many responsibilities. Can get hectic at times with work but mainly consistent work. Hours may vary depending on management. Great benefits
good,"Each role has its job but usually my position did the job of the other three time slots. CAP1 is supposed to start the day and keep order by making sure numbers are correct and filling in the holes by pulling from the bins. We ended up finishing the truck from the night before and unloaded the new days truck, completely screwing the system up. When we did get to do our job, it was usually correcting the other crew's rush job or carelessness that was never corrected."
good,Aumentar el salario y tener mas oportunidades de crecimiento
good,It's a good job.. just needs some good management  pretty strict. They work 9 hr shifts with 2 15 minute breaks and 1 hr lunch break. But going over can result in an coaching(write up)
good,I began working at Walmart as an individual contributor.  I was promoted to a warehouse supervisor within a month of employment.  I am thankful that the management team was able to recognize and acknowledge my hard work and dedication.
good,The job experience you earn is adequate but the people talking negatively about each other behind their backs. They don't follow policies as far termination goes.
good,"Walmart is an ok company to work for. I do recommend the place to people that need employment. Since I left the company has made some advancements, but also in my opinion has let some things go."
good,It was a great place to work at Wal-Mart until later on when me and the manager got into a brawl and I was getting stressed out with my life at the time
good,"Working with Wal-Mart was absolutely crazy. Its fun, lots of work to do. Cashiers to train. Money to count, customers to help.. The list could go on and on!"
good,"I needed a job that would work with my odd availability, and Wal-Mart was great about that. I liked being horizontally both horizontally mobile, being able to change departments, as well as vertically mobile, having management opportunities accessible for me to apply to. "
good,It's a good place to work if you like interacting with people. It's a fast paced on your toes store. The people are great. I have been there for almost 11 years and worked all over the store can run the registers and do inventory counts. Price changes. I have been in the garden department for the last 4 years and help maintain the plants and except delivery.
good,I liked my job and the management was good. Did not like the limited health benefits and lack of comprehensive coverage. The pay was not enough to live on even with a second job. They boast that only 25% of their employees have to get Government Financial Assistance. That means that 75% of the employees need help to pay their bills due to low pay.  What an awesome way to look at low pay?
good,loved the job but everytime i had overtime i had to take longer lunches or i had to come in late to get rid of my overtime. I always worked way to hard. i stayed late for over 4-5 hours where i had to stay on lunch everyday for an extra hour to get rid of my overtime.i was kinda pointless. so i gave up with the job when i moved.
good,Walmart is a great place to work. Had a great time working there. Would go back in a heartbeat. Most employees were nice and helpful to any needs that you needed help with.
good,associates are good to work with. management is okay as well but they have their favorites. they are flexible around schooling or other jobs. they barely give any hours unless you beg for them.
good,Fun place to work if you are a peoples person. Show up for work stay in your work area and provide customer service to all who needs help. Dealing with different personalities makes the day go by fast.
good,Being a cashier at Walmart was fun. I worked during Christmas and that was great. They should just have sits for there cashier's. It would help so much.
good,I was a great associate and team member. I.enjoyed staying busy and having a great team to work with. I just wanted to.explore employment elsewhere and.the pay rate was not enough for.how hard i worked.
good,"Since I worked in Sporting Goods, every day was reasonably easy. I did have to give Auto their breaks as well as Hardware their breaks. In Auto, I made keys, helped customers with their questions, and cashiered. In Hardware, I made paint for customers who needed certain color of paint, and helped customers in their questions."
good,"Come in and unload the truck(s)"
good,"Its a really good place to work. They dont over work you they cooperate with your schedule and its nice, You dont have to work overtime unless if you want to."
good,My work hours varied. I learned patience and good customer skills. The management was always new with very little training. The work place culture was easy. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for hours and the most enjoyable was the customers.
good,"Loved working at walmart, hated working for walmart."
good,"It is a good job for young people and giving them a experience of working and functioning their life responsibilities, it does not pay well but if you working at Walmart, you are either really young or really old. unless your a store manager this should not be the career for an adult."
good,The hardest part was trying to stay awake because I worked the overnight shift. Management was not at its best. Even the store manage did not show interest in resolving issues. I was treated unfairly due to age and gender.
good,Walmart is a great job choice. There are many career options to choose from. There is no hard part to this job. You show up on time prepared for the day and you do your job how it's supposed to be done.
good,I would have stayed with the company.  But there was no options for opening in the market I was located in. You had to be able to work around there complaint schedule to be with family.
good,"Serviço muito bom, mais o modo dos lider e gerente não são muito bom de lidar"
good,C Compensation is great. Work hours are ridiculous. Hard to balance a life with family and job. Promise for advancement but no follow through. Warehouse culture. Quite a bit of foul language and rude humor.
good,Company policies do not allow for flexibility when it comes to personal situations without having to take a leave of absence.  Head office is all about the money and not the local store employees.
good,"Terrible management and terrible training, but overall a fun and easy job. Will mostly be self taught from my experience. Transferred departments daily."
good,Overall there is place for advancement and many options in which department you can work in to gain more experience with different areas. Good benefits.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work for an entry level job. The store that I worked at had a very approachable managers. Customers are friendly most of the time. It’s a great working place over all, however, it’s still lacking of proper communication in between associates and manages."
good,Walmart has different positions so everything varies.  Departments have different pays and come with different managers. Overall Walmart is a good job to have.
good,"Buen Ambiente de Trabajo"
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart, the hours were great. I enjoyed that they keep you learning about your job. Walma rt at the time did offer opportunities for  advancement."
good,was great till i had open heart surgery and left cause i needed to heal up cause i couldn't preform as i should but other than that I liked my job very much
good,"It's just that. A temporary job. Use it to make some cash while you look for a real job. You might be able to find some good friends on your way through, but try not to stay for too long."
good,"I enjoyed working at wal-mart. It was a busy place on a daily basis. Hours were different weekly. I did not really like to close, which meant getting of after midnight, but it was part of the job. I got alone excellently with other employees and mangers their."
good,Horrible experience at the location I worked for. The management was corrupt and it was very hard to advance simply by doing the right thing and working hard.
good,Walmart is a very easy place to get a job at. I was not asked to perform any drug test or background check. The management is very inconsiderate when it comes to scheduling. Work can be slow at times and at other times very hectic and stressful. A lot of physical labor is required for my position. A positive is that you are allowed to take a lunch whenever its convenient.
good,The management was less helpful though and will leave you out to dry with no problems. But of you don't do anything wrong and avoid the management. Also don't learn about managers coming in drunk or high. They tend to target you if you learn that.
good,"The only reason I enjoyed working there was the company. I had great co-workers that made going to work enjoyable. As for working for the company I did not enjoy it, found the managers very unorganized."
good,Walmart is a good place to work for either the type who just wants a stress free paycheck or one who wants to challenge themselves. It is 100% what you make of it.
good,I liked working at Walmart. My checks were nice for it being a part-time and me being a college student. I had a good amount of hours and everyone got along for the most part.
good,"I would usually start my day out in the produce department, then soon move over the deli and mid day if they were short staffed I would finish deli clean and help out with cashiering. I was all over the store and enjoyed it."
good,The direct department managers were amazing. There were a few problems with CSM's in the store but overall my department would work as a team and complete the tasks assigned. Once upper management started pulling you from hour department to anywhere in the store basically was when all the problems began for me.
good,High stress environment with no co-workers to form relationships with. Cashiers are not treated well at Wal-mart. I suggest being a stocker because I believe people yell at you less when they aren't paying for things.
good,"Great customer service, enjoy working there lack of communication. Needs to be worked on. Under new store manager, knows what he wants and will achieve it through."
good,Busy busy busy Walmart is always busy and before you know the work day is over with. Everyone needs to learn how communicate in order to ensure that all the customers have the best shopping experiences every.
good,Its a cool company to work for. Its really not any hard work to be done there just a lot of small things that you have to make sure gets done. The only problem I had working there was a manger tthat did like how fast I did my job she would always say im stealing time but I really just work and get done fast
good,It was good for a first time job . It wasn’t the management it was the people . The people makes you go crazy . Stressful soooo strict .when it came down to coupons  .holidays were the worst especially after thanksgiving which was Black Friday .
good,I been working here for the past 2 years and its gradually going down. Front-end lacks associates to assist customers. Some member management are to quick to decisions. Management are sometimes too lazy to help out associates when they do not have enough people scheduled. Get breaks and lunch every 2 hours. Could be fun and smooth going when you have the right kind of people there. It can also be better when they have enough associates to assist customer and keep them waiting for a long period of time.
good,"Trabajo con presion, tienes hora de entrada pero no hora de salida, aveces te cambian de area para ayudar a los compañeros."
good,everyday you come in and not know where you are going to be placed because the place is so understaffed that if you are a cashier you could be stocking in frozen foods. Unstable staffing has effected the roles in the store. However the managers will get their hands dirty to finish the days work with you.
good,"They have good benefits, over all. I learned a lot of skills( management, people). the management was overbearing and not very helpful. Ok place If you like pressure and impossible deadlines."
good,"- Strong culture at Walmart Home Office"
good,"I worked alone for the most part at nights into the morning."
good,"My typical day at work was fun and enjoyable.  I've learned strongly how to deal with customers satisfactions.  Management, was nice and not fair to other associates.  I work great with other culture.  The hardest part of the job when it wasn't busy.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team."
good,Walmart is a great place to work but the employees weren’t very friendly towards me neither were the managers but I still kept a positive attitude for the costumers. I worked there before I turned 18 so I couldn’t do much but there was still always something to keep you busy on the floors.
good,"My work day at walmart was pretty simple, but yet busy! I would clock in and then go up front to the registers and then go to the register the CSM told me to go to. Then i would just cash people out and engage in light conversations with them. When it was break time, i would go outside and sit in my car until it was time to go back to work. The management crew was easy to get along with. I think the hardest part of the job was standing around waiting for the people to show up to the register, i dont like standing around doing nothing. the most enjoyable part of the day was when it was really busy, because time would go by fast."
good,"I totally loved this job, the people are amazing. I would go back in a heart beat. I was scared at first to start this job, because I've never worked in retail before but ended up being one of the best jobs I have ever had. LOVED IT!!"
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart. During my time there I further developed my management and merchandising skills. I loved helping our customers. I feel that I was treated unfairly at the end of my career with Walmart but my overall experience was positive and valuable for furthering my career as a manager.
good,"Barely able to get job done and always having something else added to your job. There is a saying we have: you can get some of everything done, but you can not get all of everything."
good,Oportunidade de desenvolvimento e aprendizado profissional.
good,"Good 1st job or if you're going to school. They change yourgrs with out telling you then will write you up as a no call no show.  The people are nice that work there, friendly and helpful."
good,"I worked in the electronics dept, where I sold electronics.  On a Kiosk, I was able to learn as much as I wanted about the current electronics we sold.  That made it easier to sell.  The hardest thing was when you requested a day off, even though you were told you would get  it, you were on the schedule.  Once on the schedule, it was very hard to get the day off."
good,"Show up on time, complete all your tasks before going home, customer service is a big thing and just don't dilly dally,  watch your attendance, and if told to do anything and you couldn't be honest."
good,"A typical day at work you will always be on the move. Never standing still. Management can be a bit tough especially when going through a lot of changes, but nevertheless they are willing to work with you on anything and everything."
good,Fue agradable para adquirir experiencia laboral en la atención al cliente y manejo de mercancías.
good,"somewhat stressful, but a great place to work....I enjoyed the customers and culture experiences...some of the management is over the top but most are very pleasant to work with."
good,Typical day for me would be to go in and get the items i need that helps me work and work the freight in my department (infants) as well help customers.
good,"Like all retail pharmacy, Walmart is extremely fasted paced and stressful. Because it is difficult to find quality employees, you are forced to work short handed most of the time."
good,Overall my experience with Walmart was very pleasant.  I did take issue with some of the management team being consistent with all team members.  I enjoyed working with many of the co-workers who were team players.
good,"I like Walmart that is why I’ve been there so long , me wanting to grow has nothing to do with the company itself! I just want job advancement! Walmart has been in my corner and I’ve been able to provide for myself since I’ve been there. Very flexible and the manager works with you if you need anything. I have no complaints!"
good,"Muy buena la cultura, metodos de capacitacion arcaicos"
good,"Having proper communications skills is what makes the nightshift more productive. When working in the back inventory room, when other employees bring in freight its important to communication which is overstock, or claims ect."
good,I loved it.  I would go back if they would consider working around my availability. There would be a birthday cake once a month in the break room with your name on it for your birthday.
good,"A typical day at work, I would walk in and zone the sales floor. Then I would begin refreshing the deli line. Then I'd do the work I was assigned."
good,"Benefits good."
good,"Worked with a great team, always helping one another, always focused on getting the job done. Awesome managers who always took time to listen and train you to achieve a higher goal. Associates though need to work on being more friendly toward one another and to their customers, and managers need to frequently recognize the hard work certain associates sacrifice doing everyday they clock in."
good,"Management wasn't bad overall. However, when it came to the maintenance supervisor, he did nothing. He would always go outside for a cigarette. We didn't have a large enough team to get the work done overnight already."
good,worked for walmart all together 10 yrs. great people. pay was minimal. Dept. Manager Toy Dept. ordering merchandise etc. cashier and csm also claims dept.  management was questionable.
good,"As a cashier, I was able to interact with the public on a regular basis, which I enjoy greatly. The management in my department was fair and treated me well."
good,The hardest part of this job was doing everything by yourself for an unknown amount of time. The most enjoyable part of this job for me was stocking the shelves and organizing them. A typical day at work would include a meeting beforehand and going straight to work with two breaks and a lunch in the middle.
good,1 best way it's basically a program showing us how to do things more efficiently in a timely matter and at a quicker pace I also showed us how the cleanup to be more sanitary and to be more proficient when we're dealing with food and contamination
good,Great place to work and I like the people there and the prices for sure.  I can only say that I am not fond of the changing schedule as I like to be on the same schedule.
good,Precisa de muita coisa referencia a gerencia e os lides de equipe.
good,"-I loved the environment and most of the people i worked with. "
good,Work pace was typically average paced and relaxed. Personnel hired were typically pleasant to work with. Management was fairly competent and lenient yet effective.
good,The work experience with Walmart was overall good. The managers were easy to work with. They held you to high standards and pushed you to do your best. Customer service is definitely something you will learn well while working there.
good,good temp job to float through. i couldn't do it for long did not pay enough for me and to many guidelines to follow. just would rather be in a real gerage
good,Walmart has a relaxed work environment and is a great place to work. Manager was descent. I enjoyed the job.the job was seasonal and was easy to move up the ladder.
good,"I loved working at Walmart, the experience was great for my first cashier job. Those who trained me where very helpful. However, when it came to scheduling, myself and other co-workers didn't have a very constant schedule, it was all over the place, unfortunately when you give them an 'open' availability, they use it to the extent of making you extremely expendable. I did like working there, but the work load for a part time associate was close enough to that of a full time...without the benefits."
good,Working here was fine. Management team was great to work with and the hourly sales associates worked hard even when time restrictions on projects were small.
good,I loved working there. I wished I got more hours. They cut my hours to zero but will not fire me. They told me I might work in March. I like Wal-Mart.
good,"This was a great place to work but no chance of advancement to a higher position unless you bend the rules for management, kiss butt for management as well as be the correct skin color or know the right people."
good,"Management needs to put employees not profit first"
good,"It was stressful sometimes, but overall not too negative. The other employees really made the job worth going to. There wasn't much to do in my field, but the breaks were long enough."
good,"Walmart has paid my bills for the last 20 years."
good,Walmart can be a very good place to work as long as you do not participate in the office politics and drama. People there have a tendency to allow too much personal to mix with business however it is not a bad place to work as long as it is in within your ability to remain professional.
good,"As long as you are trying hard and you can accomplish the tasks you are assigned within a reasonable amount of time you will be in good standing with the management. They really do ride you hard to get the tasks done on time but their task are run through a time system based on getting 40 boxes per hour done and some of the times are unrealistic. They live, eat, and breath those times and don't take in to consideration anything that can happen while you are out stocking."
good,"not much chance of advancement,  Not recognized for well done work.  Micromanaged in our department.  Can be very good work place when we do whats required."
good,Walmart Store #1686 has specific tasks and customers are okay. The management talks bad about employees when they are not around and they think they're so cool because they have keys and a radio.
good,"For experienced history professionals, I would not recommend working at Wal-Mart for long.  But it also depends on what branch you work at.  Most of the managers do very well, but they're are a few that don't."
good,"Working for Walmart, tended to be a very stress inducing environment. Management at my Walmart wasn't the best for every department but for mine it was alright the hardest part of the job was constantly staying alert, the most enjoyable was seeing all the new faces and customers on a daily basis. My every day Or a typical day at my job would've been standing at the front doors until near closing Occasionally switching spots and as the population of the store died down. we would Check fire doors(Emergency Exits) and make sure certain parts of the store were sealed off from customers due to closing."
good,It’s a lot of work to be a stocker. And I absolutely hated my job. I wanted to be a cashier and they about forced me to take a job as a stocker. Thumbs down walmart. They also like to mess around on advancing you through the online course.
good,"A typical day of work at walmart can go one of two ways. It can be laid back and relaxed or it can be busy and chaotic. The overall mood depends on the time of the week or month (holidays) and events going on in the area. Magnagment can be nice and understaing of personal situations, but also expect professionalism and good work ethic. The hardest part of the job can be the stress of handling very many customers a day. The most enjoyable part of the day is being able to laugh and have fun with cowokers."
good,"If you have worked in grocery this is the place for you. Typical backroom work, putting overstock in bins, unloading trucks, making cardboard/plastic bales."
good,My co workers were very easy to get along with and my supervisors were never rude. I place high value on these attributes.I would like to work here again.
good,Not a bad job. There’s just a lack of hours and no room for advancement in the location I work.  The work environment is very good.  Clean and safe warehouse.
good,Provide great customer service while maintaining safety and theft prevention policies. act as a deterrent from would be buglers. other then that it is an easy job.
good,"When you have good management generally you will have good employees. I'm not happy there, it could be a different stroke for someone else. The most enjoyable part of my job is my breaks."
good,retail as a whole is ever changing without warning...after 21 years my position was eliminated company wide and was out sourced to a third party.. no job security
good,"Wal-Mart is a little bit to calm for me, I prefer a more relaxed group of co workers and a higher demanding job, it's also just not in the job field I want to work in, so eventually it'll be my time to move on."
good,"Aprendi muito sobre trabalho em equipe, merecimento."
good,"Answering questions, price checks, audits, and coordinating."
good,Most days were stressful but the co-workers made it worth working. I learned many ins and outs of how a store worked and it gave me a chance to see things as more of a whole.
good,You make good money there but you have to be able to keep up with their standards of production other than that its not a bad place to work. I was an unloader on the sams side so i would come in get my truck or trucks and try to find a clamp if a new one was not available i had to use an old one (much much slower)(hard to make production with) then you go start to unload the truck. Every truck has a set tie high which is just the layout of which you stack the boxes some are a pain in the bum. You finish go to the computer input some info print labels and place them on every pallet then move onto your next truck. so on and so forth until its time to clock out
good,I loved working at Wal-Mart the only thing i didn't like was the managers showed favouritism. The only reason i got fired from walmart was because i didnt have a car and my attendence got messed up but i have a car now and i wouldnt mind going back.
good,"not much to say its a job not a career, its retail work that no one respects and will be replaced by a robot kiosk in the future. and i personally welcome our robot overlords."
good,"Se aprende demasiado, la gente esta dispuesta a ayudar, desarrollas la importancia del orden y la paciencia, te ayuda a tratar con la gente y a ser sociable."
good,Often long hours as a manager. Can be trying with work life balance especially around inventory time. Communication is lacking at time when you often hear things through the grapevine before official announcements.
good,"I started as a cashier, then a builder of garden furniture, then a grill assembler, then a forklift operator. Never was compensated for the amount of skill set."
good,It’s an okay job just have to eat out for management they gossip more than the associates and tell things that people should not know but over all it’s an okay place to work
good,Pouca possibilidade de crescimento para quem não é formado.
good,"When I was employed here, it wasn't a terrible place to work, the people who i worked with were the best part of the job, the management wasn't exactly the best, if something wasn't done exactly how they wanted, as quick as they wanted, they weren't exactly happy."
good,"They do offer flex schedules for certain positions so the flexibility is a plus but for the job we are expected to do we do not get sufficient compensation.  I like working at Walmart as it is a very relaxed environment, there is no micromanagement, and as long as you get your job done you have all the flexibility you need.  I do appreciate that.  My only major issue is the pay, and their holiday practices.  I don't understand why we should have to use our vacation (which isn't allotted to us at the beginning of the year, we have to accrue PTO as we work) if we wish to get paid for a national holiday.  The center is closed so we don't have the option of coming to work but if we want to get paid for holidays we have to either use our vacation, make up the time (depending on the which day the holiday falls on), or take it unpaid.  I have never worked for a company that has this policy."
good,"12 hour shifts Sat-Mon. Work is not evenly distributed, and those who can do more make up for those who are not doing the required amount for the production goals. Unfortunately there are more bad apples than good, and their presence overshadows the work of the productive associates."
good,Indico pra quem goste do ramo de varejo a empresa é boa de trabalhar só o que deixa a desejar é gerência e o RH.
good,They were a very understanding company when it comes to home life. work place is so fast paced that its hard to have questions answered. they are really considerate for schedule changes.
good,"You can grow with the company however, its very stressful the more higher your position. You spend alot of time at work- more than at home. Just make sure your pay is worth it all."
good,"Everything is available to you. Sometimes there can be negative people or employers and sometimes its customers but for the most part, it pays well and you can find it fun interacting with the different people you meet."
good,Wal-Mart was a good job experience because your working hard and by the time you look up at the clock your shift is nearly over. I enjoyed being on cash register and making conversation with different members in my community. I also enjoyed being able to do item take backs because it gives you that time to work alone and accomplish your task at a good pace.
good,Could be a great place to work if full time was offered and it didn't over a year to get medical benefits.  The customer service managers were fantastic however the so-called front end manager was not approachable or effiecient in the position.
good,An average day would be me unloading boxes then pushing carts. I learned how to lift heavy boxes safely and push carts. Management was distant barely seen. workplace culture was respectable. The hardest part was pushing the carts in the winter. I enjoyed the friendly employees.
good,It was really physically demanding. I was able to advance with my salary and worked there for a long time. It is not a place for people who are lazy and unwilling to put in the work.
good,"I worked in the pharmacy 20+ years ago while I was in nursing school.  They were able to work around my school schedule and the pharmacist were great at teaching me about different med and mechanism of actions, side effects, etc.  It was a great bonus for school"
good,Clock in at 2pm lay down pallets and put out carts pull the line into the truck and start unloading after truck was done we would pull the carts to the floor and stock the shelves helping anyone who asked where something was
good,The reason I am saying Decent is because I believe there could be much more respect paid to its employees from the management to the maintenance staff and cart gatherers.
good,"A typical day started at 10 o'clock in the evening and ended any were from 6:00-7:30 in the morning, would spend the night stocking shelves and items, would preform small cleaning, bundle cardboard."
good,"When working here makes sure you understand all of the policy's they have. Just do your job don't pay attention to all the political stuff of walmart. Just do the work to the best and safest way you can so that you get to go home and do it all over again. It's really not a bad place, I loved working there I just made a small mistake that could have been corrected had management communicated better."
good,loved working with the people that I worked with. the only reason why I am not there is because I m currently in school for nursing and I have two boys to care for so they did not want to work with my schedule because you have to have an open availability
good,Enjoyed being hired within 2 weeks of moving back home. Learned a lot of things from my supervisor and fellow co-workers. Breaks are mandatory and I liked this.
good,"Friendly people to work with, but not much incentive for a temp to stay unless a full-time opening comes up fast. If you can make it to 90 days as a temp you get an employee discount card."
good,i did not have a good time working in this environment i learned about stock and cashier computing the most enjoyable was leaving i did not like Walmart at all
good,"Walmart is a team-oriented business. Though management lacks punctuality and professionalism, they get their jobs done and motivate their employees. One would enjoy working any job at Walmart if the associate is fond of doing that type of work."
good,"Managers where ok, supervisors where nice and appreciative, my coworkers where nice and friendly overall it was a good for years only reason I left was because I wasn’t advancing and I was there for four years and still making $10 dollars an hour"
good,one of the issues with working for Walmart I found most challenging was a lack of teamwork and unity amongst its employees. A few of my co-workers would avoid customers and stand in the back to avoid service. I most enjoyed the customers and working on the tasks at hand.
good,"Provided patient education on various lenses and frames, compiled patient charts, insurance billing including medicare and medicaid,"
good,"Even if you work your hardest and do everything right, you still have a chance to lose your job. Production is very high, some managers are great people but they have no idea how to run an area. Some of the people that work there are evil and malicious so be careful. However, I actually did love my area, most of the people, and the job I did. The pay, benefits, and scheduling are all wonderful."
good,I was only there for about a month but did not like the long standing without break. I think it is a good job depending on the person but it was not for me. I asked management to relocate me to another department but they said they that all workers at Walmart have to be able to work at the cashier.
good,It was my very first job so i enjoyed it. At times it was stressful but over all the people were like a family. The hardest thing to deal with is rude customers and holidays.
good,"At work, I would push carts inside, help people take their purchases outside to their vehicle, and maybe do some things out back of the store. The hardest part of the job was probably the fact that some of the employees took advantage of who they were. The most enjoyable part of the job was the chance to help people."
good,"Its a productive and long work place , but my coworkers are the best to work with . Love that when i need help with a task or have alor to do my coworkers will help me ."
good,"I loved working at Wal-Mart, but I needed better hours. I was stuck working on the evening shift. I loved always being busy and productive. I had the chance to work in several different departments."
good,It's a decent place to work if you need a job.  The pay is ok and the management can be good.   The best part about the job is your fellow coworkers.  They make the job fun and enjoyable.  But don't plan on making this job a career.  Try for a couple of years and then move up.
good,"Great place to work, poor management, not enough employees in the work area to perform all duties, I learned patients and to be more open to new ideas"
good,"It is a job. I have found that it's really who you know to get ahead at this place. It is difficult work and very fast paced. It is not really hard to do, basically common sense stuff."
good,"very productive place, a typical day is running lanes and stacking boxes in trailors. Dealing with different personalities its very easy but the most enjoyable part of the day is"
good,"A typical day as a sales associate includes stocking merchandise and customer service. You might also be pulled to anywhere in the store to help out if they are short staffed, which is all the time. Management loves to micro manage ever aspect of everything. Don't plan on being compensated too well or being promoted too quickly."
good,was a cahier and customer service desk and I loved what I did. he fast pace made the day go by quicker. And also I was able to assist customers with their needs.
good,"I did enjoy working at Wal-Mart, most of my management team consisted of positive and upbeat people. There was a positive energy that I enjoyed about the environment."
good,"Takes forever to get customer service representatives for price checks, over rides, change for register or coins for register. In turn leaving customers at a boiling point!"
good,It’s a job! It’s not a bad place to work but you definitely have to work your way to the top. A hostess position is more like a lesser pay security job. It can be dangerous if you encounter angry customers.
good,My job was great it was very laid back and the work wasnt too hard. Managers were awesome i really enjoyed my time at walmart i just wish they would have paid more or offered more hours.
good,I have enjoyed working there and will only leave if I get a more lucrative offer. Overall it is a nice place to work but I find it way below my education and skill level. I have been there for almost 4 years and have not seen any sign of promotion even though I've asked for it.
good,"Friendly co workers, very clean and safe work space. Excellent training involved and hands on. The management could have used more training on how to approach people."
good,Walmart isn't a bad place to work. They do treat customers and employees the way they should be treated sometimes. They don't know how to have actual security though but over all the feel is nice they can overwhelm you at times but it is still a team.
good,Good as a first job but not long term due to low salary. Most of the job is to deal with customers and being able to check out customer merchandise quickly.
good,COworkers are so nice and we care about each other. Management just wants to make the most money and don't really care about employees. It's busy work with a lot of rude customers.
good,"management was nice, fun interactive work environment. i learned customer service and how to work fast paced. a typical day at work was laid back and not too stressful."
good,"Good place to work. Low pay, but room for advancement. Can work with a flexible schedule. Career training and is paid. After 6 months can take a class to be promoted."
good,"Walmart is a nice place to work, you experience a face to face customer service with all customers. The department I worked it the customers can be very sweet and sometimes mean. I enjoyed getting to know some customers on name to name basics. The work was very easy and mangable. I was working part time and there was no benefits available unless you was full time it became frustrated."
good,"Walmart was a busy place to work, fast paced, time sensitive duties. Immediate supervisor was fair and helpful. Daily duties varied based upon customers requesting services."
good,"Less stressful, and not too bad... but you will always need to work the weekend... kinda annoying. Nice co-workers, friendly customers about 80% of the time. Upper management takes job way too seriously, as employees don't take it serious enough."
good,"Walmart is one of the best relaxed jobs I've had. It is slow paced, hands on, and names you feel welcomed. Walmart does good with training and getting to learn more about the role you play in the company."
good,"Store manager is great!!!   Most of the managers are.  Love dealing with customers.  I understand the need to ask a customer to apply for the WMMC but when they say no, respect it.  Don't harass them.  This was my only problem with the company.  Working at walmart taught me a lot."
good,Learned a lot about how the company functioned. Lack of opportunity for advancement. Work life balance was hard due to flexible shifts required. The fellow employees were great to work with.
good,"I have recommended working for walmart for 24 years still a great job for students and someone to add an income. Advancement available. Stocking zoning customer service and working in many different atmospheres..deli, bakery, genral merchandise and up front cashiering."
good,life at Walmart is quick paced on some days and slow paced on others so overall it was a well balanced job. The pay was fair on some occasions but the amount of extra work one does at Walmart makes it to where the pay is unfair.
good,Every job has its ups and downs but this one started to have more downs then ups. In the beginning there were grand hope for a better way but through the years they all disappeared.
good,In all I can say that I like Wal-mart. The only problem I have is the management isn't very good. And when I was moved to the electronics department I keep asking how and where things should be done but wasn't getting any help or any answers form anyone.
good,"Family and work-life is not balanced. Work too many hours, but the benefits are great.My day at work is completing the many notes assigned to me by management, managing my employees and my departments to generate better sales for the company.The culture is okay but needs working on to uplift the employees so they will want to work harder to accomplish their daily notes. The most difficult thing about the job is always having to start many other tasks before completing the first ones given. I learned that prioritizing notes, directions, and tasks that are given to me by management to get the job done effectively and efficiently.The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers and seeing them smile makes my day always."
good,working for Walmart was fun because i was able to do what i love in the bakery but the management team and their skills wasn't the best but other then that the hours where good and i was able to be creative on the cakes
good,"Very fast paste great associate n customers. Lots of different task will be giving out, have to ""kill time"" if over workd schedule hours. All about fast clean and friendly"
good,The hardest part of the job is the hours and how much expected of you to do.the most enjoyable is the customers.You learn different electronic devices.
good,"a empresa oferece muitas oportunidades dentro de seus setores, com possibilidade de crescimento e aprendizado, porem deixando o funcionário muito preso a ela, o que acaba atrapalhando o funcionário a se desenvolver em outras da qual não esteja ligado."
good,Walmart was an enjoyable place to work with good people and normally great attitudes. Very good communication between supervisors and employees with very good benefits
good,"O que eu mais aprendi no período em que trabalhei no Walmart é o quanto a cultura de uma empresa é importante. Lá a cultura é enraizada e chamamos os mais antigos de casa de walmartianos. A empresa sempre opta pelo certo."
good,"worked from 6am to 2pm sometimes I work break down shifts to where I go home and come back to work after 2to 4 hrs. there was no paid vacations or sick times for us,"
good,show me how to strip and refinish floors and fork lift. I like working over night. I like the one hour lunch not 1/2 hour.I lock my bike under a hover hang.
good,Lots of change over in management. Work job differently depending on the manager working that day. Management doesn't communicate well with each other. Inconsistency  in information from management.
good,"I loved the people and atmosphere. Anytime I needed help they were able to help, and before I knew it I was almost to customer service manager. If your a fast learner its the job to Take!"
good,fastpaced work environment unloading tucks running the merchendice down the line putting the merchendice in the right  catigories then organizing them putting them on pallets and taking them to the main floor and stocking the items
good,"It's a good job but as far as advancement if management don't like you they don't consider you. Underpaid and over worked. Other associates do less than you and make more. No advancement in the Human Resource dept, no mentor, no anything. Along with underpaid for all you do. As for the management industry that where they put all they focus on with advancement, better pay, mentors and etc...not worth it tho..."
good,"I worked at walmart in the deli. And it was pretty nice. We got paid more but we were able to work customers, cook food, such as preparing deli salads, fried food, and meats and cheeses."
good,"Walmart has numerous positions for every type of personality. They are always asking for suggestions on how to improve the work environment and safety of the associates. Unfortunately, the hours of a parttimer could range from 8 to 40 so a little inconsistent there because of corporate cuts."
good,Wal Mart was a great place to work. After awhile you become comfortable. Not a good job for advancement. Feels like they talk about advancement but never happens. They will work you though.
good,They will not work with your life/ home schedule. The computer sets your schedule. They don't care about your kids being sick or having to go to the doctor even if you bring them an excuse.
good,It was fine working here but management made it stressful to work here sometimes.  The other associates are friendly and hard working. Overall I like working there
good,"Like with every job, you will have good and bad managers, work hours, compensation, etc.  This is a start up, so the going is tough.  I love the discounts you are entitled."
good,"Typical days - bussy between customer service and bakery production tasks"
good,"It's fun working because you will meet different kinds of people."
good,It’s not entirely awful. Very inconsistent I do have to say. Management is either friendly or not at all. Some are great while others are just there. It needs to have a better environment.
good,"Walmart was tough to work for. hours changed quite a bit, face pace, management was awful. I did enjoy the job and it was easy most day. I thought that 10$ an hour was fair for the amount of work required"
good,"Very fast paced and dynamic."
good,I have learned to have patience when working in the retail industry. Working as a cashier for Wal-Mart has been an easy experience. My work associates help out as much as possible and i'm thankful for that. Management can do a lot better with understanding and communication. Overall Wal-mart is a good job and I enjoy it.
good,the diversity of culture at Walmart is surprising and is fun to work with. i made a lot of friends who are of different cultures at Walmart. the management is good and the managers are really friendly and open to talk too. All the associates are really helpful and build up a great team.
good,I like working there but the don't pay as well as other jobs and the management don't really care about there people. As much money this company makes a year I believe they should pay there associates more than they do. and the insurance has a high deductible and someone cant reach if they go to the doctor that much so most people are sruck paying the whole amount
good,"Always new challenges, exposure to multiple layers of diversity. Something for almost anyone. Flexible hours and wonderful co-workers. Great community outreach environment"
good,"I started working at Walmart with intentions of part time only for holidays, I was hired after the holidays for Vision center. I worked there for almost two years then switched to sporting goods so I could attend college. I do love my job, but I would love to work in the field of nursing, what I went to school for. I plan on working both part time."
good,"a lot of changes have been happening the budget cut and it is not the way it use to be ""family like atmosphere"", however it is enjoy and not very difficult to do. I believe this company is good start base for anyone who would like to some money and help build strong customer service skills"
good,"I loved working at walmart ,loved my coworkers.I was treated very good.Mamagement was good to me.i worked in various departmentsthrough out the store.Great experiance."
good,"Walmart wasn't a bad company at all, there were those customers who'd just make your day terrible but then there was all the other customers and the cute babies."
good,it was great working there i started at 4 am and was by myself until 6am. it depended on who was scheduled to know how your day was going to go either i would have to work for the amout of two people or everyone helped there was no in between.
good,Wal-Mart is good company to work for have met new people and new worker there ir have it ups and downs many people said that Wal-Mart not a good place to work for
good,"Pathways is boring and somewhat unnecessary, benefits after pathways are completed are great, offer 401k, discount card fit self and spouse/dependent, some management is great, friendly co-workers, make you feel like family almost, point system sucks when it comes down to emergencies and sickness"
good,More and more expected with less and less benefits. The other employees were exceptional and very good at training for particular jobs. There is a lot of diverse expectations and responsibilities associated with most job titles there.
good,I liked working at Walmart it was a good place to work most times. people treated me fair and respectful. I wish who ever works here had the same type of people I worked for there at Walmart.
good,"Walmart offered adequate training, but lacked in the hours, and offers for advancement.  The wages are unlivable, unless you are at management levels."
good,"Rotating management can make it difficult to know priorities of tasks."
good,"When I first started to work at Wal-Mart, I fell in love with my position. I loved that it was demanding and new to me. As time went on I got promoted to department manager."
good,"They are looking for individuals who fit their scheduling needs. They are friendly for the most part, but it depends on the specific employee/manager you are dealing with as to if they are professional, not necessarily the store as a whole."
good,"Any typical day is good. Great conversations with coworkers and customers. management is always around, learn about peoples lives, its pace depends on the day. The hardest part is when a customer is not happy or unsatisfied. As a cashier there is only so much you are allowed to do. A good person having a hard time in life deserves to be helped out but we can't. No one else even offers help when we so badly want to but can't. I understand bribery. But not every customer who offers gifts wants to bribe. Saying no, I would have to say, is the HARDEST part of this job. it can either go easy or needs management... The most Enjoyable part, is when your coworkers and customers, ALL are in good moods, and are friendly, and ready to just talk about anything. No worries at all."
good,"Not a single day where a trippy customer walks up to you. Managers never care if youre struggling with a customer. Especially the CSM, they are the slowest and worst."
good,"I liked this pharmacy/company overall.  However, I was looking for advancement and that is not offered in Wal-Mart inside the pharmacy for a technician.  I loved the benefits and time off that was given to us as well as profit sharing bonuses.  However, I did not want to work in the retail setting any longer."
good,It's basically a cut throat kinda company. It's all about who you know and what you know to advance to a higher position. The only extra hours provided for overtime is when its near the holidays. Its really hard to get days off.
good,Working at Walmart was a good experience for me. I learned a lot of cashier skills. Although working at Walmart part time there were not many benefits.
good,"Assist customers with merchandise process freight  check out in a timely manner answer phones work on displays straighten the store "
good,"Buen clima de trabajo en equipo , compañerismo"
good,"Career advancement is limited for technical roles.The compensation is fair. The time off (PTO) is pretty good. Health insurance could be better but its better then nothing. Overall, its a decent place to work."
good,"You start your day by going to your locker. There is some leeway between clocking in on time but it is best to clock in slightly before your shift and not after the start of it. You head to the floor were your manager has a list of things that need to be completed before the end of the day. Along this list it can be zoning (pulling product forward, straightening product.) Working freight, setting up product displays, pulling t.v.s to the floor to fill the holes. You may also be asked to start up the photo center or activate phones for customers through out the day. Just remember, if you have time to lean, you have time to clean."
good,Working for Walmart is a great place to work at a lot of opportunities to further your career. I met plenty of nice hard working people and actually grew a friendship with some.
good,"Stock all milk products, stock eggs, pull and stock yogurt, cheese and any other dairy products.  Pull and stock all freezer items when needed.  Check and make sure all items are stocked back up before end of shift."
good,it can do better in like promoting the store an what the store has to offer more an be more active in the community to get peoples attention to there location.
good,Fast paced with many things going on at once.  Employee need to be on time when scheduled. Must be willing do do any job asked of you.  Nice breakroom. The hardest part was finishing everything you were assigned.  within the allotted hours for said stock. Always being cheerful when greeting customers.  Sometime management was hard to please.
good,"I worked there for about 3 weeks and I did not like it at all. In that time my sister went into labor and I had to leave work and go to the hospital. Well when I came back to work I got wrote up pretty much and got a 'Strike"" as they called it. My thing with this is there are going to be emergencies in your life but if you miss any work at all then you have a chance to get fired for per say going to the hospital for a family emergence. Also, for the first year of working there you are not allowed to take a day off for anything whatsoever."
good,Bonne entreprise pour une job étudiante. beaucoup d'employer donc la sécurité et le nombre d'heure est vraiment incertain
good,"A good overall experience.  Keeping up with the fast pace was rewarding. Workplace culture was directly dependent upon current supervisors. Management were not trained well enough.  I trained them, which I actually enjoyed. The hardest part was the end when my position was eliminated and I felt that my hard work for all those years was unappreciated."
good,"there are black hole positions that you will never be abele to leave/ advance from such as sporting good, stockman, cashier and apparel."
good,"Very demanding for a very low pay, especially for supervisors. Responsibilities are added to the workload constantly, but the pay never raises above 0,30 cents every year."
good,"The department i worked in always had everything left for us in the morning, and we never had any time to do any of the actual duties that we were assigned."
good,typical box store fast paced low paid low customer service representatives on floor  learned many departments enjoyed my team mates schedule varies daily job assignment varies daily
good,"decent work managers don't always communicate which can make simple day to day tasks more frustrating then needed, friendly coworkers, decent hours, with some potential for advancement."
good,"A great place to get started in retail and in a leadership role to maximize your success as a manager.  It can become stressful with the changing hours, constant coverage issues, and frequent policy changes -- but you have to maintain a positive attitude to be able to handle those things on the regular."
good,"La empresa es buena, hay que mejorar a los líderes de trabajo y no solo contratar jefes, la vida personal o privada a veces se ve afectada y no es respetada pero no por todos, la cultura organizacional y el clima no siempre son los más óptimos. Si eres parcial en algunas tiendas te cargan más horas los fines de semana que entre semana y no tienes hora de comida entre semana."
good,Wal-mart claims to be all about their employee and they are not. Their policy says one thing and they operate differently. Wal-mart needs to be more family oriented.
good,"Fast paced"
good,Walmart has limited its advancement opportunities for professionals with its most recent corporate restructure.  E-Comme ce is the way of the future for retail.  Operating big box stor s will never not last another 5-10 years.
good,"O trabalho era desgastante mas o salario não atrasava, o ambiente era confortável."
good,"In a retail setting you have to be ready to deal with a multitude of personalities on a daily basis.  As a large retailer, there is a ""one best way"" to perform any task, management expects this to be the only way tasks are performed, even if a more efficient way can be found."
good,It was like being in high school again .to much drama this person talking about you that person has a problem with this or with that drama managers have favorite works.
good,"worked as a greeter in Salisbury NC store.some customers threatened you if you asked for a receipt to prove they paid for item."
good,Worked there as my first job and loved it. I felt as if everyone there wanted you to succeed and grow and get better. I learned the store pretty well and most associates did too. Hardest part were customers who gave you a hard time. The associates were great and super friendly.
good,"•	Train new associates, order out of stock merchandise, execute price changes and fix on hands to maintain accuracy of merchandise, maintained a clean and orderly department, designated tasks to associates throughout the day"
good,It is a good temporary job. They are strict with missing days and leaving work early. But they are good if you request days off. I would not work there for a career though.
good,"I liked the job, the managers were pretty good for the most part but the flexibility with availablility wasn't good. I wanted to get a morning shift but didn't have a choice about what hours I wanted to get"
good,Poor management  no benefits low pay to many hours the managers didn't do they job at all that's why I had to leave that job. Lack of disrespect need new management
good,Fun and enjoyable place to work as long as you saw it that way and made it that way. It could become stressful at times but for the most part it was relaxed and fun
good,It's a good place to work but it's change a lot and the management is not very professional and some are rude. You have to be very consistent and work with a fast pace Third shift is laid back but a lot of hard work.
good,Management was hard to find when needed and they expected so much out of employees but did not acknowledge employees for their hard work nor was the pay rate equivalent to the amount of work needed done
good,I loved working at Walmart but they give you a hard time when it comes to getting benefits or working around yoir schedule. Other than that I loved being apart of there company.
good,"Goofy Place To Work At , Caring People! Mangers Are Over All Friendly , Pretty Flexible And Do What They Can To Help You Out! Pay Is Nice Too , Hours Were Ok!"
good,I enjoy this job the management was kind of sucky but they have improved over the years. They showed some favoritism but the majority of those managers who did that are no longer with the company.
good,"Alot of freight, quick paced, equipment easy to get too. I learned how to price change , supervise other team members when management asked me to practice what I had learned from them."
good,Monday Mornings the weeks starts with a very fast pace. Short period of time to review performance over the weekend and how that effects forecasts. Then on to meetings to review and explain.
good,"I can say that this workplace has room for growth within their company and its not hard to climb the ladder, if you really want to. I loved working with my fellow cashiers, but the drama i could do without. They don't really care about your social life (scheduling could be a lot better), but you have to put your foot down or they will take advantage of you."
good,"Cada dia um aprendizado diferente, com diversos segmentos. Ambiente tranquilo de trabalho com a  equipe. Transporte dos produtos para realização dos eventos realmente complicado e cansativo. Parte agradável; conhecer e trabalhar com diversas pessoas e empresas em vários segmentos."
good,balanced work place. fun with exceptional benefits management has great attitude toward willing to work associate. flexible hours for college or high school students.  great starter job with room for growth
good,Unload Truck and Stock the Shelves.The pay was good for the type of work you doing. Everybody got along and talked on break and Lunch. I think because there was no heat like in a Factory. Overall it was a good Job
good,You have the worst customers so you learn how to retail manage really fast. The hours are flexible and the pay is consistent. The managers suck most.of the time.
good,"I've worked different departments at walmart cashier, customer service, and sales floor associate. I've learned how to be a great at communicating, building relationships with my customers and management. I really enjoyed my job at walmart but they tend to put a huge work loads on associates."
good,The work environment is fast paced. Only con about this position is that you have to be very flexible and are trained in other areas that you did not get hired for. i.e. cashier
good,"Associate friendly, very busy, plenty of customers in need of help. "
good,"E uma empresa com dinamismo e uma cultura de trabalho incrível, valores ao indivíduo."
good,"they are flexible with your hours, you get good benefits if you qualify, some managers suck, but the god ones  you'll love. you get two breaks one lunch. Over time is offer if you show potential. every location is different."
good,It is a caring work environment with kind friendly people. It offers competitive pay and will work around your existing schedule. Overall a pleasant work experience.
good,"The job itself is very easy. I started working at Walmart in the layaway department and move to different departments thru the store in my 11 years working at the company. Management has very poor procedures to solve problems , absolutely no privacy in any concerns you want to talk about with your supervisors. I was never promoted to a higher position. I was never employee of the month even though I have all the requirements to be employee of the month. You have to beg for vacations because they don't want you off for a long time just 5 days."
good,"Descanso entre semana, salario bajo. "
good,"Easy job, lots of fun to work with people. The managers are complete idiots, but that's just retail management for you. Typically 8 hour shifts are available, you won't get full time if you're scheduled 40 hours a week. You'll be part time until someone decides you're ready to be full time."
good,"Walmart was one of my first major jobs. They worked around my school schedule. Some managers were helpful others just looking out for themselves. No consistent schedule. I bearly got to see my son while working here. I met some great ppl. Customers were hit and miss, some good some bad. But it paid the bills at the time."
good,"Remodeled the store which was a contracted job, I was able to repair and maintain displays and fixtures daily until everything was done, this was a temporary job. The most important part of the job was that I didn't have to be supervised because when the supervisor asked me to do something, I always got it done in a timely manner.  The hardest part of the job was that is was done while customers are in the store so we had to be very careful not to injure anyone.  I really enjoyed working for this company.  I learned how to use the fork lift and heavy equipment for loading and unloading the warehouse.  The worst part of the job is that I didn't have any benefits."
good,"My typical workday would consist of working at least 10 your days, so times more. My job was to over see the store was running to company standards and that associates were completing their task, it was also my job to assist customers when an associate was unable to assist them. I learned a lot about business strategy, management, logistics, financial acuman, developing and training, as well as merchandising."
good,"Wal-Mart was fun, but you kind of go unnoticed to management if you just work and not socialize. They have their cliques. I wasn't part of the popular group."
good,"I don't have a review. I don't care to give a review. I appreciate you wanting my opinion, as well. Working at Walmart is okay but they slow with transferring employees out."
good,"Walmart is a good job for young people. They don't offer a lot of benefits.  If you are ok with workong weekends and holidays,  then this job is ok. Tge pay is fair for the job."
good,"As a cashier it was usually standing for 100% of your shift and if you were the only male at the registers at the time and the cart guy is late then they will make you go out and pull carts, even when you are not trained to use the cart pusher. On top of that they will not give you an extended break if you do push carts."
good,"Walmart was a great job to work if you love working and helping customers, also if you want to learn something new all the time, I did learn a lot about vehicles, fast paced work was the hardest part about the job running the cash register and doing stocking on freight at the same time is hard, Especially on a day your only other worker has called in sick. The most enjoyable part is working with different personality's  of customers each day. - Bad benefits"
good,Walmart is a good place to start in the work force. I enjoyed working there. But there's not a lot of room to move up usually. And they are very strict about overtime and going over your set amount of hours which I didn't think was right.
good,"Walmart is a good place to begin working. The days can be routine, depending on where you're working within the store. Many of the problems I had came later. I didn't see how much my PTSD affected my ability to keep a position."
good,"I personally have worked with this company. A good job if you like what you are doing. Fast paced environment, very moody people, customers and employees. Wasting food that is left behind or set out. Even one day past expiration date. And the worse part is Walmart says they give it to the homeless and other donor companies."
good,I was being constantly switched to different departments after I was hired and having being told the one I was hired for. There was a shortage of staff during that period.
good,"Working for Walmart was a rewarding experience. I learned a lot from my employees as well as Management,skills that will follow me wherever I may go in life."
good,I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart. I thrive at customer service and liked the work. I only quit cause I had no set schedule and it interfered with taking care of my children and family.
good,Gostei muito de trabalhar na empresa walmart aprendi muito e quero sempre aprender.
good,while working at Wal Mart I enjoys being a to do multiple things through out the day. I manage about 3 or 4 other employees. The most difficult part of my jobs was when a machine broke trying to allow someone to fix the machine while on the phone..
good,"The store 1584 is in need of new management and human resources needs help.  Better communication between management team."
good,I liked working here but the management communication was horrible. Scheduling every week  sometimes wasn't the best and we were left short handed. Leaving some of us to stay longer or to leave the work area the way it was because overtime wasn't allowed some days.
good,"Apesar de las personas, es un buen trabajo, donde es mas facil que alguien nuevo tenga un mejor puesto que alguien que ya estuvo un rato ahi, los pagos son puntuales,turnos rolados que no dejan hacer mucho en la vida personal, en mi caso personal, mi supervisor o jefe directo, era muy exigente y grosero, comparado con los demas jefes de departamento. sin duda un buen lugar quitando el punto de los jefes malos."
good,"Walmart was one of my first jobs, For the most part i enjoyed my job there.I worked in the fitting room and electronics department. Electronics was my favorite, My department manager was a sweet heart and always made sure, we were taking care of."
good,"The time I worked at Walmart was fairly pleasant, although it was tough later on to get scheduled hours. Depending on who you socialize with, you can advance quite quickly if you wanted to. I had an amazing time working with everyone there and I felt the pay was very acceptable. You are allowed to talk to different managers about picking up extra hours in other areas of the store as long as you don't hit any overtime. Overall, my experience working at Walmart was very pleasant."
good,"fast paced environment, good opportunities for advancement. less work life balance. Less Salary. Management needs to understand teh associates needs at more deeper level."
good,Wal-Mart is a good place to work but management needs improvement. The store is great and clean to be in. Management needs to treat employees the same not special to certain ones that they are their pets.
good,The work was repetitive and it could be difficult to get time off.  The hardest part was standing for long periods of time.  The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers.
good,"The 1980'd was a great time to work at Walmart. They treated each other with respect and knew that the secrets to success was first take care of yourassociates,  give them ownership and pride and let them know the expectations for exceeding our customers wishes and wants. "
good,Different departments pay different amounts. I started in Cap 2 at 9$ an hour and got a dollar raise when i completed training. To many managers and you have a hard time with knowing who to listen to. Customers are pretty nice only had a few unpleasant customers in my time at Wal-Mart
good,"I loved working at Wal-Mart. I was part time so I wasn't eligible for benefits. Approved days off without pay upon request. Co-workers become like family. Raises every year and you learn something new everyday. Most management is great and takes time of of their day to help you, teach you and provide you equipment to ensure the job can be done correctly. The longer your there the better pay."
good,Es una empresa que permite laborar con el nivel de estudios mínimos y por lo tanto es una buena oportunidad para aquellos que no cuentan con experiencia laboral.
good,I do have fun working at Walmart and I enjoy talking to the customers and helping them out as well. I enjoy my job and have no plans of leaving Walmart.
good,"typical day build bikes and and assist customers"
good,I love working here. The people you work can make a big difference on how you look at the job. I would recommend this job to anybody and there's differe type of things to do.
good,"A typical day for me at work was stocking shelves with items, I wanted to make sure that customers were satisfied. I learned you have to be professional at all times and be productive too. Management was very good and top notch they were very patient with me. The hardest part of the job for me was not being able to reach my goal at that time. The workplace culture was very new to me I was still very young and didn't have enough experience under my belt. hardest part of the job was maintaining my area. The most enjoyable experience of the job was meeting new people and earning my money on my own."
good,"clock in  "
good,Work for the hours you are assigned and people will not bother you. Busy Schedule and you get hours to work and earn for your needs which is why most of the people go to work.
good,"A typical day would consist of me mixing paint, zoning, and assisting customers. I learned how to mix paint and gained more knowledge on how to work with it. management was OK, I never had any issues with them. The company does a good job at taking care of its employees and is understanding of there needs. The hardest part of the job was constantly being on your feet for many hours. I enjoyed my coworkers a lot, they were very friendly and helpful."
good,The associates are good people to work with just need  better assistance management training in areas of respect for others treat the associates like they want to be treated more on hands with the associates more interaction with the associates learn their areas more
good,Great place to work. I did was part time so the hours were not to good. I would work like four to nine and that did take away time from my family and social life.
good,"I had a great time working at Walmart as a cashier. Everyday was different, you met new customers and connected with them. Due to certain circumstances I had to leave my position as a cashier. But overall it was my favorite job and I miss working there!"
good,good place to work if you have patiences. Great csm there.  Lot of hours.  Good work place.  You get good benefits but the bad thing is pathways if you don't pass the graduation you get fired.
good,Wal-Mart is a great company bit when I worked there I applied for cashier an they made me apply for maintenance an maintenance was what I had to work I only lasted a month but that was due to not having proper day care
good,The best part of Walmart is that you are encouraged to rely on your co-workers in all situations. You should always have someone to back you up no matter the situation. A typical day is very scheduled. You have an area you work and a certain flow that is expected to be kept. I had more good managers than bad. Some people deal with positions of power than others. The workplace culture is fast paced and competitive. You are expected to complete your job as efficiently as possible while still being helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was seeing people every day.
good,"	Consistently outperformed daily sales goals by building positive and trusting relationships with customers, assessing their needs, and suggesting best-fit merchandise items"
good,"I just don't agree with the management philosophy at store 1077. Every manager is a little crooked in means of favoritism, which can be unfair. The store has come a long way- but it still has far to go."
good,The job itself was very fast paced and you need to be a hard worker to get the job done. It is mostly a friendly and fun place. The open door policy makes coming to a manager easy and less stressful about workplace issues.
good,I have basically enjoyed working for walmart. Only having a few issues with the store manager who at times can make it hard to enjoy work. Overall being a department manager can be very stressful at times.
good,"Its a good job to work for a limited time. This specific Walmart has a lot of drama and the people that work there like to spread rumors and gossip. I feel that management had issues as well. They took the job as a joke and fired people left and right, then complained about under-staffed area."
good,typical day at work was running the cashier and bagging groceries. helping customers and honestly it was not hard work at all in my opinion. Got a 30 minute lunch break.
good,not very understanding when it comes to management if you are sick or emergencies. pay is ok. work environment is ok. has a lot to do with location. ive worked for worse.
good,"I get there in the morning print my schedule,see who is on my tmate and figure out whose gonna be set up where. Get my tills set up and make sure my maintenance are in their assigned areas. Throughout the day making sure everyone is taking their lunch and breaks accordingly, and making sure our  customers are entering and leaving satisfied"
good,"Management of different departments did not talk to each other so no one is on the same page. Crazy work hours, but wonderful co-workers. Great place for insanity."
good,"Greeting Customers and acted like the face of Walmart"
good,"It's a job, not too great - not to bad. I feel like it takes forever to be able to advance into the next position and that is not very good. Lovely customers, management is ok."
good,"Customer service is very important as a cashier. Although management really pushes offering credit cards to customers and smiling all of the time, even when they don't. Most managers don't care about their employees or even customers. They just want to please their bosses even if it means overworking everyone else."
good,"okay place to work as long as you can work what they want you to as soon as u need a change of hours everything goes downhill, Or they do everything they can to get you to quit."
good,Great place to work!! Day to day I learned something new! I learned to stock and use a register. management wasn't to bad. Walmart supports a mix culture environment and do there best to make sure no one s left out.
good,Corporate security is great for someone looking for a reactive job. There is little work to do until there is something generated. The managament does not seem to have a full grasp on how to organize themselves or the department. Little gets accomplished with lots of busy work in between. If you get the position or schedule you want hold on to it or it will be gone. Great place to work to get to know friendly people.
good,I work there twice and would do it again. like every job there have ups and downs. but i really like to co-works they are like a family. Your work is steady.
good,Worked many hours....loved my employees really good people...ops manager bit overbearing....they fired her....tough hard nosed environment....but fun...
good,"Great place to work, gotta be hard working and dependable.  Opportunities are endless at Walmart, you must be dedicated and forward thinking to advance."
good,I worked the night shift. the shift would start off with a 10 to 15 minutes meeting. the hardest part was getting though the night and sometime the manage who was on the shift. the most enjoyable part was the people who I worked with.
good,I love my job! Not enough workers to work freight properly.  Need better benefits and should care more for their employees. Need more room for advancement.
good,The team work sometimes lacks but other than that it's an okay place to work. I worked there for a couple of years and I wouldn't mind working there again.
good,Working at walmart was a nice experience the management at the time was a mess the goid thing about it is you get 3 breaks and emplotee discounts  also bonuses each quarter if ur there over 6 months
good,Had a great experience with Walmart. very good management and wonderfull people. I had to leave because of my school finals. Met some good hard working team workers. Really Great memories with them
good,Management of the store could be way better than it currently is at this store. People in positions they have no business being in to begin with other than that the rest of the associates are great people to work with at this store.
good,"walmart only cares about having a worker they dont care about you, work you hard only dive 20 cent raises once a yr!!!!!!! go by pto hrs now so however many hrs worked you get a half or less pt towards your vacation days. no more holiday pay and wonder why everyone calls off on important days!!!"
good,The people you work with are very nice and helpful for your learning experiences. There is a high turn over of staff. A lot of opportunity to grow in the business. Make sure your attendance is good and you will go far.
good,It's really fun but you will have picky costumers that will push your buttons and make you frustrated but it's fun it's simple and it's a job that will work around your schedule.
good,If you need a quick job that will get you some cash so you don't starve then i would recommend Walmart. If you want a career with a good management team and the opportunity for advancement then i would NOT recommend Walmart.
good,"a good start up job, good benefits. job is physical so one must be fit in order to strive. cross training is available but only limited persons can avail it."
good,"working is a good environment ,people pull together when needed,the management listens and helps when they can.cutting hours hurt for a pay check.you do work with good people who offers assistance when needed."
good,Walmart was a fun and fast pace job! I liked being around people and helping customers! It could be stressful at times but overall it was a job that I would recommend!
good,"I did not enjoy working as a cashier as much as I did being a sales associate. While they did work with my school schedule I always had to remain busy even with minimal tasks, my supervisors were sometimes harsh and had too high of expectations. Not only was there an endless supply of rude customers but managers seemed to be rude and less caring as well."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work for, they do work with you. Management is very understanding. Sometimes they lack in the communication aspect but overall you can tell that they are there for you. Walmart offers good benefits and there is room for growth within the company"
good,hard to move up to any type of management. Enjoyed working with the customers and helping them. The workplace culture is good. Learned a lot about customer service.
good,I liked working at Walmart because I had many times and opportunities to become a shift manager. They give me you a lot of lead way and they let you work to there rules but also fair to your type of work way.
good,"Walmart is great if you are looking for 25-35 hours a week, dont mind being on your feet for long periods, and making 10.20/hr. What really makes or breaks a shift is the CSM's attentiveness and the number of cashiers scheduled. With a speedy CSM and enough people its more like a meet and greet with customers then work."
good,"Right spot for college students, good flexible schedules, opportunity to earn more over time though, no job security. Lack of job specialization. Good place to grow"
good,Work consisted of oil changes and tire changes which become normal. I've learned a lot more about cars than I would have thought due to the automotive atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is dealing with negativity however that goes away when you can help someone. It might be as simple as a valve stem but to the customer you saved their road trip. That is what makes going to work everyday a good day.
good,My coworkers and most managers were nice to work with although the third shift does not have as many workers as they should. The job is be challenging
good,"I enjoyed who I worked with and I got a long with most of the managers. However I had a bad manager who would let some of the worst employees get away with bad work which in turn cause the rest of us to have to work that much harder to get things up to snuff. Eventually the stress of it all made me leave. The 401k, stocks, and eventually health insurance sure helped though."
good,"Buena empresa, falta capacitación y motivación al personal por parte de la gerencia"
good,"Checking customers out in an efficient and fast manner. Issuing refunds, cashing checks. Resolving customers concern and helping them find an item. Thanking them for shopping with us and to come again."
good,Walmart was very busy & a bit unprofessional. I loved the pay but the hours didn't work well with my student schedule. If there was more people being on time then it would be great. A typical day at work was stressful.
good,Just do your job & do as much as you possibly can. Don't stress as a lot of people do to get their work done. You will have a few bad experiences but don't let that discourage you.
good,while coworkers are tolerable management is not. they can do alot more to improve leave of absences. doctor notes were not a valid excuse about most things.
good,me encargaba de retirar valores de las cajas  en servicio y al termino de la h}jornada cuadrar en la oficina todo lo vendido al dia
good,"The typical day at work for me is sometimes having to watch 10 self check out registers by yourself along with keeping maintenance. Sometimes you'll fill overworked by watching 10 registers, cleaning, taking care of ten customers, price checking, stocking, doing with the manager asks, asking for Walmart credit cards, watching for stolen credit cards and scams and watching for shrink with try to get items back or get customers to pay for it. Pretty much running around with your head cut off that some customers claim that I do.This is a very hard part of my day due to all the things I have to do it once if I have no partner to help me. Because Walmart is switching to mainly self checkouts and rarely any registers open."
good,I've worked for Wal-Mart for four years now. It is a good job for starting out or if you're in college. For career wise I wouldn't recommend it per-say unless you get into management or get a full tune position.
good,"Definitely a great place to work, wish there were more opportunities for growth. The people were pretty awesome, I just thing the management needs a little work."
good,Working at Walmart has been great. The only bad thing about it was the management through out the whole store was not pretty great. You get to meet new people through out your days working at walmart.
good,"My short year working there was filled with surprises."
good,"I've enjoyed my experience at Walmart at various points, and have not enjoyed it at others. Over the years, I've worked for wonderful supervisors, and some that were not so wonderful. Working holidays puts a strain on your family and personal life, but that is the nature of the business."
good,"Management was somewhat unorganized but other than that everything was ok, worth the pay and leave they give you. night shift is he best way to go the enjoyable part was the free doughnuts."
good,Go to work never call out certain things can get ukick out addmediatly. But production is every man for them selves. But understand the employee needs. Thanks
good,This was a pretty good place to work. Sometimes not flexible with scheduling. It was challenging at times in terms of customers not being happy with the return policy.
good,"In my 3 years of experience with Walmart, I can honestly say that I love my job!  Though it was times that Management drove me and other workers mad, I really wanted to move up in the company and make a career out of Walmart.  I learned varieties of skills that I wish to use, but the hardest thing about Walmart is that I feel like they pick and choose who they want to promote.  I wish they wouldn't be like that because in my years at Walmart, I done seen alot of great workers quit because they got tired of Walmart treated them."
good,Walmart is a great company it's easy to move up and grow with  this company they should pay more.  They make to muc money to not want to give associates a better starting pay rate.
good,"Revisar correos de pendientes de turno anteriores."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart but I had to leave because  I had moved to live new a different family member. I didn't have no way to work at this person's house.
good,"No hay crecimiento en esa empresa, y sueldo no competitivo"
good,You make your day your own. Come in with a smile on your face with the ambition to work. Not everyday with be easy but with the right attitude and great co-workers they day will be satisfying.
good,"Working in the pharmacy was very fun and enjoyable. Had a few good coworkers, management was ok. Scheduling conflicts were a dime a dozen. Salary left much to be desired but the benefits were really good for that place. Overall, a good place to work."
good,"Overall working for Walmart has been good,  Because It pays my bills. Only issue I've been dealing with is Management not approving important days that I request off."
good,"The pros are you have a wide variety of people to work with and the hours are flexible and some room for advancement, on the flip side the pay could be better and job security."
good,"Working as a Pharmacy Technician, a typical day could include working with irate customers, refilling and filling doctor prescribed medications. Calling doctor offices to request a new prescription to be sent. Calling insurance companies inquiring about a billing errors. Calling customers to let them know their prescription is ready or if there was a problem completing their prescription order. I had to learn to work with individuals of different religious beliefs, culture, ethnicity and disabilities. The hardest part was when I was unable to help a customer with their needs, due to things out of my reach to control. The most enjoyable part of working, was I get to meet new people, I like making someone's day if it's nothing but a warm smile or a kind gesture."
good,"While Walmart is a difficult place to work at, the bonds made help me out as an individual and as an associate. I appreciate every moment spent in learning what I have from Walmart."
good,I loved working here management was a hassle they expected you to do double the work of two people but the people there were awesome. family environment
good,It was hard to move up in this job because of the favoritism. I had four departments and three employees to cover these departments once I got off work.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work. The flexible hours can have its pro and con's especially if you have kids or you busy or like to travel. They will work you. And they do cut hours. Some managers and customers can be hard to deal with, but the pay is good."
good,"The management of the store was hard to work with, Inconsiderate, gave work orders that were clashing with what other managers wanted you to do. Were not very coordinated with each other. They did give you time off when requested. (3 weeks ahead of time) They would make time to talk to you if you had any issues with anything. Sadly the schedules were not set since it is retail. If you are looking for somewhere to work while in school, training, or anything that requires a lot of other time, Then this job should work fine for you."
good,As long as you do your job it is a good place to work. The people there are nice and friendly. They try to be as helpful as they can.You do get a bonus 4 times a year.
good,"It's a great job, management is nice, most of the customers and co workers are friendly, but because I work nights that's all I see.... NIGHT. It doesn't leave much time for a social life."
good,"Cashier"
good,"Typical day of work, you clock in go straight to where you need to be, check the system for what to do, and do it. When I first started it was a new store so I helped in setting it up. It was really good until management got switched around. They swap departments every 6 months so don't expect to get too attached to 1 manager. "
good,i really cant say you might like it or you might not. there is room to grow. good stock program and benefits. other than that i cant say check it out it might be for you
good,"no comment, I have nothing good or bad to say about Wal-Mart stores as a staff or company."
good,"I have recently fell upon hard times and was laid off. I have been a professional manager of operations, sales, marketing and logistics for over 20 years. I am now an hourly associate stocking shelves in the Dairy section of Walmart."
good,"This is a great job for students and individuals looking to pay rent. Walmart is usually good at handing our hours; however during slow seasons, it is hard to get on schedule . At my particular store, The management did not know how to separate personal life and business life and it lead to the department manager abusing their power. Not against me personally, but towards my former co-workers."
good,Walmart is and always will be an okay place to work. The management is okay. The point system is complete and utter foolishness. Easiest way to lose your job is thru the point system. Being late or being sick.
good,"A typical day at Walmart, as soon as we would get there we would start unloading the trucks. Some days there was two trucks, but most days there was only one. I learned how to drive a forklift and other machines.  Management in my opinion was awesome for the most part. Workplace culture was awesome too, I met some friends that I will have for a life time. The hardest part of the job was during Christmas time because there was so much freight, but nothing that I couldn't handle. The most enjoyable part of the job was we would get quarterly bonus checks."
good,"Don't think the DC's are anything like store, because they are not.  Working at the Sterling DC was one of the best jobs I've ever had... the culture was positive and the work environment clean and fun.  Its hard work, but they treat you right here."
good,I loved working at Walmart. You get your fully 40 hours overnight and they make sure you get pto time. I would reccommend to anyone that needs some money.
good,aprendi varias coisas de rotinas administrativas e como lidar com o publico
good,"Management sucks but the work is fun and it's easy to make friends with co workers. Job isn't that demanding when it comes to labor, just do as your instructed and you won't have a problem."
good,It was a good experience to gain and helped me gain a better understanding of customer service and taught me how to deal with customer related problems and issues.
good,The scheduling at Walmart was terrible. The split shifts were awful. There were never enough cashiers or management people. I homed my social skills working there. I am much better with dealing with people. I can handle bad customers and now will do anything to make a customer happy.
good,"Mi evoluvion buena, empec como cajera, pase x precios de productos, stock, vencimientos y finalmente termine como repositora en bazar y textil, rotacion de mercaderia, stock, deposito"
good,"reasonable work environment, short shifts makes it easy to balance work/school. hardest part of the job is there was to many bosses, always hovering over you, could get annoying at times."
good,I love the friendly environment my co workers have for us and enjoyable to work with.  Clean environment too.  I enjoy having a job. Most of the management are good and reliable people.
good,Worked in the jewelry department.  Assisted customers with adjusting jewelry and replacing batteries.  End of shift gathered cash and closed departments for end of day transactions. Assisted cashiering in the grocery area when needed.
good,It was a great experience in Arbor recommended to anybody. They treat you like family and you do get a lot of time off if you earn it. And they are flexible
good,"The position I had at Wal-Mart was a cashier. Though i was still in school when I had this job the managers/ supervisors were very understanding with my hours for school and work combined."
good,"Walmart is an okay place to work, but be prepared to be tested by customers because some of them are very rude and do not treat you kindly. Definitely need good customer service skills and know how to handle disruptive customers when they arrive."
good,"Team meeting with reviews of store performance and profits"
good,A typical day at Wall-Mart would be lots of customer service. It gets pretty busy especially towards the evening and helping customers out to find something short by or helping them can there items would be the main thing you would be doing and cant forget greeting them as they walk to your cash register and leave the store. I learned how to find items by their barcodes and to do receiving in the back room. The management there were very reliable always on call so if you needed help they would come help you as a first priory.
good,"I enjoy what i do just not the environment. Alot of changes need made within the store to be a better work environment. Advancement is tough in the store i am at, i have alot of knowledge and no chance to show my worth."
good,"Typical days consist of going in and taking care of any and all customers needs/wants. Management has there good and bad days. The hardest part of the job is sometimes the customers and sometimes the employee's. The most enjoyable part is interacting with nice customers and having friendly conversations, as well as meeting new employee's and making new friends."
good,Being a cashier for a year just showed that being a cashier gets old quick. And it is very hard to move up in the ranks to get a better job in the company.
good,I really enjoyed working at Walmart. My supervisor was nice and when you work for a big company if you had a family emergency or something come up they were understanding and could always get someone to work for you.
good,"Working for this company was good,a few employees were really nice but others seemed to either be unprofessional or had no respect for others. I did love meeting new people there even though the some things seemed out of order."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, because I thrived with the personal connection I'd make with my customers. I got along well with the other employees, but didn't build lasting relationships with them."
good,This was my first impression job in the retail area and gotta give it to big blue for showing me how management is done. although it did had bad managers but other than that is not bad.
good,it was a nice pt job. i learned a lot.  a day at Walmart was interesting with the customers coming in needing help with finding items. and taking care of their needs.
good,"Walmart is pretty good I would have still be there if they had better benefits, especially for the people who have health issues Its and okay place to work ."
good,"I worked overnight. Some nights were rushed and others more rushed. If you don't work hard they will just put you in the easier departments, on the other hand those who do work hard just get more work and are not rewarded in anyway. If you stand out you will advance in this company. That's all it takes."
good,Walmart was very beneficial that's why I stuck with it as long as I did. It's not just the benefits but the pay also. The opportunities they offered you and the chance to be apart of something big. Yes it had its down fall and ugly side. But then again nothing's perfect.
good,Was a good job had no problems was on fast track for promotion till my manager had to transfer closer to his wifes family at that point a new manager was brought in and he was a racist and i was terminated shortly after he started
good,we would always unload the semi trucks but our manager would never be around and was never around and rarely helpful they would always be on there phone the supervisor would scream over everything i would recommend working there if yOu really needed to
good,Nice place to work.  Besides lazy managers .  . . . . . . . . . . .  they should REhire people . you never m know what somebody got going on ..........
good,"At Wal-Mart, they had me doing manager level work and hours for the pay of a cashier. I enjoyed my job here, and I loved working directly with the people."
good,Wal-Mart is the best store ever there got everything you need in that store work there good job can really explained just said it a store for anything
good,this job just became to stressful with school. i really overestimated how much i could handle in one semester of school and these guys were always asking me to come in over hours. it kind of stunk.
good,good job through college not for long run not many ways to move up and competitive flexible scheduling and management doesn't appreciate you good pay for the job though
good,"Very stressful the managers show favoritism to certain employees. "
good,"The store was quite new when I started.  It was a part time job for me, single mom trying to raise 2 daughters and a grandchild as well. Working in the cash office in the evenings was quite busy, but rewarding.  I got along well with management and other associates. I rarely got a break, but it was okay because I enjoyed what I was doing."
good,"This company has the potential for someone to make this place a retirement career.All I ever heard though, was how to get fired. Very negative feedback from supervisor's, not management! They do not have any flexibility when it comes to absences. Zero tolerance for severe illnesses, bereavement, injuries and any other time related absences."
good,Empresas basada en  cresimiento de expacion y buena
good,Depending on the store you work at there are great employees at all locations but most of the time management is too stressed out to pay attention to the needs of the employees and everyone feels too rushed to enjoy working there
good,I like Walmart as a corporation. Certain stores need improvement in their communication skills with their employees and work on advancement. Workplace culture is a little more male oriented. The hardest part of working here is the daily changing of procedures. The customers are very nice.
good,the pay rate is good but they don't give you hours. and management walk around like they are better than you.. It is easy work for the most part when they make the schedule right an are not the only cashier working
good,"As a cashier, I would say that my job was easy. It was not a stressful place, co-workers were nice and helpful in learning. Benefits and hours weren't the greatest."
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar ,bom salário , participação nos lucros da empresa , com convênio médico"
good,Walmart has fun people to work with. They have a good variety of positions to choose from. Walmart does not pay their workers what they are worth and it is very hard to live on what you are paid.
good,"Por ser uma empresa multinacional, oferece alguns benefícios que fazem o colaborador querer continuar na mesma."
good,se empeña uno en aplicarse en lo que aprendes por que el trabajo es intenso y a gerencia poco se interesa por ti y te preciona para que des mas de tu esfuerzo por lo tanto me agrada el eterder a los clientes
good,best retail job in the industry today. good benefits balance life and work. The management is very supportive and guide you through when you need assistance.
good,"Many of my bosses brought their own issues into work and gave instantaneous attitudes when simple solutions were at hand. ""Panic Managment"", made doing work stressful. Management needs to plan ahead with their associates to prevent last minute chaos. Too many arguments, too many egos. Overnight managers were lenient, kind, and fun. Overnight managers also seemed more successful than day-time managers and even the co-managers. The best parts of the job are always assisting customers and good team performance. I have learned that most management positions are made up of people who do not look back at the pain they have caused. Perhaps this is Darwinism at its' finest and my compassion for the underdog is the losing side of capitalistic, corporate competition."
good,"They company itself care for employees. Managers think they can speak to you any kind of way but the benefits the job offers is good. The hours are good however, you can be part time receiving part time benefits and they schedule you full time hours."
good,"·	I built aisles and used planograms to build the shelves. grabbed items from the truck and stocked them on the shelves throughout the store. At the end of the shift, the whole store is recovered. I learned how to read planograms. Workplace culture was very unprofessional. Hardest part of the job was the long shifts. Most enjoyable part was the co-employees and long breaks."
good,"What they have is a successful business, very much so, but there is a LOT of room for improvement. They need to bring in some new material and possibly expand to broaden some horizons!"
good,"I highly recommend this job for people that need overall job experience. It teaches you how to handle difficult people, and the pay is okay for people that do not have a lot of bills to pay."
good,"I understand equal opportunity employment, but when you have a fast-paced and unforgiving environment like the Deli, there is no room for error or being ridiculously slow. Pay is good, and management tries to help out and be understanding, but there is only so much they can do. Turnover is crazy, out of the seven months I worked there, there were almost two entire crew's worth of people that quit and new hires coming in. People quit because they couldn't pick up the slack, and others quit because they couldn't keep up. If we had a full, competent staff and those people actually showed up everyday (which is another issue entirely), it would've be almost fun! But that was not the case."
good,"I worked in two different departments.  I started in Lawn and Garden and then transferred to Automotive.  A typical day included interaction with customers, which was our first priority..  Helping them find what they needed and answering any questions.  Checking them out when they were ready.  Resolving their problems.  When not dealing with customers there was stocking to be done and kept neat and keeping the department clean and tidy.  At times I would be called to the front to cashier.  My coworkers were friendly.  In fact, some of them I still consider friends.  The hardest part of the job was having to lift heavy cases of motor oil, etc.  I most enjoyed interacting with out customers."
good,"There's always room to grow in this company. You're constantly busy and doing things. "
good,"the management team, and employee to management communication is horrible. favoritism is a huge setback between managers and employees. the pay is amazing if you are willing to live with some unfair treatment."
good,"Loved it, great people and a great store. I loved my job and I loved the benefits that I had. Highly recommend. Management was a little off but still loved it."
good,"The people are pretty cool to work around, the hours are easy. They give you plenty breaks, you do have to get adjusted to being up till 7am but it gets easy after the first few nights."
good,"Fragmented, siloed, amazingly smart people but little direction and too execution focused to be forward thinking   great company but stay away for few years if you are in it or hr"
good,When I worked for Walmart I would work morning shifts 7 am until 4:30 i would come in and open up our customer service desk take returns money order cash checks.
good,It was an ok place. Hours are not guaranteed though. If you were sent to lunch too early or late by management you would get wrote up. It is a good idea to keep track of your hours yourself and push back if need be.
good,A typical day at walmart was balanced. I learned to be myself in spite of the environment. Management was fair but not perfect and I enjoyed it fully.
good,"With so much to do, it makes the day better to have coworkers who like to have fun while working. No complaints from me on this employer. As with any job, there are challenges as well as rewards."
good,enjoyable but boring. I enjoyed cleaning my work area and keeping it organized. I got along well with my coworkers and employers. The hours were long and customer service was a learning curve.
good,Agradable ambiente aunque falta mas preocupación hacia los trabajadores
good,"Overall Walmart is a great place to work at, there are many little issues that management does not consider, time off, compensation to employees. Management seems to not put emphasis on personnel but only the required tasks of the day, employees are normally run down on a shift and when they need time off, it is hard for them to receive time off. Mangers tend to focus on the pressures of company top brass than to employees. If your are person that can handle pressure, then Walmart is a good place to work at, without some benefits from managers."
good,"I worked here for a little over a year and though I found the pay to be better than most companies and it paid my bills, the stress that came with the job was not worth it in my opinion. Management needs improvement. When on the cash register, you could hardly ever find a Customer Service Manager. The assistant managers never help you, and I had three store managers in the time that I was there."
good,"- Deal with lots of interesting people"
good,They put out a lot of work for one person to do. At times the job was fun because of the co-workers. But the management isn't very nice. I wouldn't want to work the again.
good,"The best part about Wal Mart is their emphasis on building your skills up, especially in your job field. I learned more about inventory management from Wal Mart than a class I took at an employment building. However, once you are really good at what you do, it is likely that they will not promote you to something else. I was satisfied with my position, but this is a word of caution to those who want to move up. Management is a mixed bag, some are great, some are happy to just sit in the office. In my experience, all of the employees are happy to help new people. One of the most welcoming places to start."
good,not a bad job to have but must be able to have a flexible schedule.  great job for starting in the work force or going to college but hours are not always available.  great place to grow & advance up the ladder.
good,Great place to make.money but horrible on the family life.  It is always about Wal mart.  There is no sense of caring about you or your family.  I purl in anywhere from 60 to 75 hours a week and that was still not enough.
good,When I started working there the department lead was quitting in a week and the other employees for the department were not coming in. I ended up being hired on full time minimum wage but doing 3 other people's jobs as well as the department leads job.
good,"Out of the jobs I had, working at Walmart was the best one. I loved working with the people and helping move merchandise on the shelves. The only criticism I have is that the managers did not talk with one another, which lead to a lot of people getting mixed instructions. Also, I believe strongly that three of the four managers should not have been managers, as they did not treat their employees well, relying on yelling at them in front of customers and threats to get results. I would like to work with the one manager who was able to remember we were all humans and not pets."
good,Pretty alright I guess I don't very well want to write a a review honestly but for some reason I am required to which is just unfortunate honestly the end.
good,the management sucks at hiring cart but eaverywhere they will higher but they dont anymore people if your a cart pusher your most likely gonna be on your own only at Worcester walmart
good,"Conducted many tasks outside of my designated job. Guaranteed hours and you learn pretty quickly how to do your job. Previous workers do not teach you the right way at doing your job, so you have to learn on your own."
good,"The only ""problem"" that I had with Walmart was the inability on the management's part to commit to making temps into regular employees.  There is no job security at all at this Walmart."
good,Management at place not so organized. They do not care about work you due. There main focus is get thing done without knowing that first task is done before giving out second or checking.
good,My individual experience that I have received here was not too bad. Although there was not enough staff. I was always pulled to cash and was unable to always do what was expected me to do.
good,"I have a great love for the Wal-Mart family. Although we didn't leave on very good terms. I was a victim of a traumatizing crime and when I went to management, was treated as a ""problem"". I feel it was very unfair thus they succeeded in ""running me off"". I still shop there and am planning on mending the relationship."
good,I loved working there until family issues came about and then it seemed as if i was the worst employee. Management is okay but were I worked it needed some major reconstruction of peers.
good,"Management wasn't the best, I had my favorites and my least favorites. They give you an impossible amount of tasks to do alone. They will start you on a project alone and expect you to finish it while you take care of you department and tend to customers."
good,Walmart is a very good place to work. I had good hours and we also had a lot of fun activities and things to wear throughout the year. We received great bonuses every 3 or 6 months.
good,"Fast pace environment ,lots of responsibility not alot of customer interactions. A fair company to work for with alot of options to relocate. For the right person a career is possible."
good,Walmart is a very productive work place you would need to be able to stand for a period of time. The benefits are very good and the pay now is good. The management is very respectful and the team members know what team work is.
good,"The job was a typical retail job. They weren't overly demanding.  There wasn't a clear path toward becoming management.  Pay was minimum wage. Overall, the experience wasn't awful."
good,"It was ok to work there to get the customer service experience. I would not want to make a career out of it, because there is no room for advancement."
good,"The most important thing I have learned working here is customer service and how to deal with people in every day situations. Working in sales has really opened my eyes to the needs of the general population and what I want to do in life. While some of the management is questionable, I try to never let it impact my performance. Always giving 100%, the hardest part of my job would have to be remaining clam in stressful situations. For example, managers who don't are not particularily fond of you or customers who have had a bad day can make things difficult. Although the upside is a sense of independence and a strong sense of community within the store. People always depending on you to get the job done and fellow employees always willing to help whenever possible."
good,"the typical day at work was fast pace. members of management do not oblige by Walmart protocol. work culture is diverse, hardest part of the job is the customers, most enjoyable was never being bored, there is always something to do."
good,You may work in one area but you will be asked many times to go work in another area even if you may have already a day's worth of work to do in your area.
good,"my typical work day would start by reliving the over night worker and then getting the cash registers all set up. Then ill go over my truck report , put up any expensive items, and the do a detailed zone of my area. All while helping the customers if the needed help or had any questions. More then anything I learned was patients, you have so many attitudes dealing with different customers and co-workers. Some of the mangers aren't very good to me at least they don't really have people skills, or care about what anyone may be going through"
good,"Loved the customers, same customers would look for you when they come in, easy work, hours went by very fast, not very long days, but a lot of days in a row"
good,Wlamart is always busy which is nice if you desire a fast paced job. Keeps you on your feet and makes the shift go by very quickly. Tiring but the frequent breaks made it easier.
good,I believe this job is good and nice for a young person my age to start building a path to a successful life and career. There's always room from improvement and you are told when positions are available.
good,Good money when there is plenty of hours. But when it slows down i recommend finding something part time especially during the weekend. Otherwise it'll be just a few hours.
good,"Company overall was good to work for, however moving up into management could be difficult as the expectations and training are not set out properly for employees."
good,An excellent environment to hone and fine tune managerial and problem solving skills that will bode well for future opportunities.  Work life balance was a challenge and not necessarily promoted to the degree it should be.
good,"Typical day is stocking freight and assisting customers either with products or at the register"
good,Most members of management are wonderful and the same goes for coworkers. There are a few that make work more stressful then needed and the work can be both physically and mentally demanding.
good,Walmart was a fast paced company with multiple areas to grow. I enjoyed the customers and the environment. They allowed me to cross train in many areas.
good,My review of wal mart is that it was a fun place to work associates are nice. The management on the other hand were a little cruel. Everyone's nice customers are nice making new friends.
good,"Bad management, customers where very rude . Staff does not try to understand or help work with you . Also it's very difficult to receive a set schedule."
good,"My day at Wal-Mart would be helping customers at the service desk. Doing returns, helping them with lottery, money orders, and checking out items. Communication could be better. The hardest part of my job is not having enough people there to help out sometimes."
good,"Overall decent place to work . good benefits, health insurance, 401k, employee discount . opportunity for advanced . friendly atmosphere to work in ."
good,"Helped customers with their purchases and/or closing sales. Pierced ears, not crazy about crying babies. Wanted to cuddle them. Performed data entry, balanced daily cash, kept department well stocked and clean. Worked alone as well as with others."
good,"There are many positive things about working at Walmart. The pay was competitive, and most of the management were a pleasure to work with. Unfortunately, all associates, including management, are humans, and are therefore imperfect, and can often support very bad personnel decisions. After four months as a cashier, I was asked if I would be interested in a promotion. After eight months, I was promoted to CSM. Nine months later, I was terminated with a false ""reason for termination,"" which I have thus far been unable to get reversed."
good,Its difficult taking orders while everyone else is yelling around you and your customers so you have to listen very carefully and take you time be patient with the customer and employees but its very joyful to know you satisfied your customer with proper customer service tact ticks.
good,"I had worked at Walmart south keys for only a year. At first I really enjoyed my job. But as the months go by, I noticed a lot of favouritism towards those who really didn't work hard, whereas I busted my tail bone for Walmart. When it wasn't busy, I would clean my area spotless, where others are playing on their phone and yet the managers never really cared. I wanted to stay at Walmart for a while, like I did for Wendy's, but I was having family issues and with the favouritism going on,  I really couldn't handle it anymore. I have also been told, however, that the Walmart South Keys is a bad store to work at."
good,"A typical day at Walmart Supercenter in Central, SC as an employee taught me how to put others first and make sure every customer was satisfied to the fullest. I learned that you have to treat every customer with respect regardless of their attitude, persona, and/or actions. To be completely honest, the management there on a scale from 1 to 10 they were probably a 3 at the most. The workplace culture was very diverse and interesting in more ways than one. You meet so many different people from around the city, state, country, and from around the world even. The hardest part of the job was probably having to help the customers that were so rude, derogatory, and just down right mean as a hornet. You always have to keep calm, cool, and collected though or else you wouldn't be able to make it at any job, truthfully. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers find what they needed, when they needed it so they always left with a smile on their faces which means a lot to me considering I genuinely enjoy serving and helping people out."
good,I loved the people I worked with and the customers but the culture that gets passed down by corporate is very bad for the customers and the employees.
good,Overall a good factory just to far away from home. I was a sorter and loader i also scanned. The benefit s were great and they were great to there employes.
good,Es una empresa buena solo que el salario no compensa la responsabilidad con la que cuentas.
good,"The management team was not very helpful when associates needed help, or when needing answers to a question or a solution to a problem."
good,Job involved unloading pallets with product and putting them on shelf. Rotating old product with new product.Helping customers with questions or to find certain products.
good,"Realizar un buen trabajo en equipo, ayudarnos entre todos ante cualquier duda o eventualidad, aprender nuevas cosas, entregar un buen servicio a los clientes para que queden conformes con la atención que uno les brinda, me encanta aprender nuevas cosas y si cometo errores aprender de ellos también para no volver a cometerlos, me gustan los días de trabajo con constante movimiento y la atención de publico."
good,"Perrysburg, OH Walmart is a good place to work, If you put in the time and effort moving up is a good possibility. Friendly work environment, teaches you many useful skills for other jobs."
good,Some days I would go to work and have no one to help me in 3 departments. If I had help would be a good place to work. Iwas able to learn a lot about the mc40.
good,"I love my job very productive work environment and very nice associate's"
good,I worked in the Hunting and Fishing section I loved my job greeting and meeting all kinds of new people if was i lovely thing i got to do everyday
good,Easy work. May have management issues dependent on section or areas assigned. Great job for students or transitioning applicants. Advancement is truly difficult.
good,"The job at Walmart is my first Full Time job in the USA, I appreciate this great company which helped me stand in this country and also allowed me to feed myself and go to college to learn more."
good,Always an productive work place an the staff was bearable. I always came in an hour early before my team an set up the back room an do some counts. Everything was an time limit so i tried to keep us on task even when we have unexpected incidents. When everybody is focused its like click work..
good,Being a cashier at Walmart is not for the faint of heart! I liked my job but your managers do expect a lot from you. The rude costumers are the worst part of the job.
good,"I put away products on the shelf. The job was over nights, so I really did not have a life. Management was ok most of the time, The people were great to work with"
good,enojoyed everything about Walmart. The work living was a little low but that was the whole point for the remodel so we can make it look nice again. the people i worked with were pretty friendly and made the work easier and faster.
good,Popular company so advancements are there along with cross training if you would like. Pay wasn't that good. They try to accommodate to life schedule like medical appointments.
good,The store I work at is not organized some of the managers don't know how to talk to other associates. I work overnight so it does keep me up and alert
good,"Everyone is very friendly and are always willing to help. Sometimes it's hard to find a supervisor to assist you and many assume that you know everything when there's new information everyday outside of what's trained. Overall, this is the best job I have had."
good,"From where I started @ store level-I've learnt the culture @ store level is far different from where I am now. At the store there's more sound management practice. People where more vibrant however @ the Head Office people are far more different ,which clearly goes to show that the different environments impact on people behaviours and this clearly defines the integrity we looking for..in terms of how people should behave. Working in this company I have gained much experience on the different retail sector's ,understanding how this business actually operates. In this company I have been put under pressure on numerous occasions and the outcome was always a win win. What I have learnt in this company which I still apply on a daily basis ,never let your weakness override your strength ,never create wheel spins in a retail business ,always streamline avoiding wheel spins as this can impact negative to cost. I learnt how to maximise profit and minimize costs...right from the source to the destination. This company has grown from strength to strength from the time I started here using innovative ideas -currently I am working with the different people experiencing the different challenges and it's the culture that makes it amazing. I would say that Game is a wonderful place to be in...but not on a long term..."
good,"As a cashier at Walmart the job is what one would expect. It's very easy to do, but quite boring and repetitive. The supervisors and manager can also be condescending in my experience."
good,"Crecimiento lento, poco compromiso con la cultura,"
good,Overall a very fun and laid place to work at. I loved working here I looked forward to go to work everyday. I would still be working if I didn't have to relocate.
good,The company I worked for is a good family palace. You will never be upset if you work with people I have worked with. You get a smile a day and and learn a lot
good,A typical day at work would be beginning with a meeting of all the overnight faculty. Then we would be assigned to our areas for the night and our partners and the managers would sometimes be willing help with freight and other times they would be busy. The work environment was good.  The hardest part of the job was staying up through the night.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the different environments you were put in daily.
good,Management don't care about their employees at all and treats them wrong. When they promise one thing but do another and mess around when it comes to giving full time or position change.
good,"un día típico dependía del horario, del cual se me otorgaba  si era por la mañana las actividades era macar el tiket del pedido e ir a entregarlos a su domicilio, en el caso de en la tarde era atender a los clientes que llegaran a pedir un pedido, y resurtirlo para el día siguiente, aprendizaje era mas de uno ya que no había  mucha oportunidades ya que en el área había suficiente trabajo pese a eso se daba las ocasiones que preguntando y viendo aprendía a el manejo de  la caja, la captura de datos en bases de batos el manejo de montacargas y con los compañeros era  agradable,cordial y amable."
good,"Enjoyed working there until we lost half of our team and management didny find it nessecary to help us pull the weight, left working short, no breaks and rude management"
good,Walmart was probably the best job I've had all my life because of the environment Walmart brought to their employees. It was family orientated and taught me a lot when it came to customer service. The hardest part of the day was probably zoning a area and restocking just because it was so time consuming.
good,"Agradavel de trabalhar com os colegas de trabalho,mas a empresa nao era responsavel com seus compromissos de pagamento e horario,muitas reclamação ja avia na empresa"
good,"I would come in every morning and go through all of produce and make sure nothing was out of date or rotten.  Then I would go to the back and load up a cart of what we needed out on the floor and go stock it.  After I got the floor up and running I would then go to the back and down stack the produce truck into the steel where it belongs."
good,"It's easy work for decent pay, schedules are 3 weeks at a time to make for easier planning around work. Best part: interacting with (mostly) kind customers and (mostly) kind fellow employees. Worst part: manager favoritism ensures promotions for people they like better, not for those who are better at performing their job duties."
good,working at walmart youre always gonna be busy. that is a god thing because it helps time go buy fast. plus its fun getting to see new and returning customers shop at your store.
good,"I made sure everything was stock in place and I clean the store to show every customer that I enjoy showing them where things were, if they didn't have help. I took the time out to help all need if I could. It a good place to work."
good,"Trabajo bajo presión diariamente."
good,"Cashiering and stocking are both good positions however, stocking involves a good memory and a strong body. Cashiering works quickly and requires patients. Co workers and managers are always there to help, but there is no set schedule for either potion. Stocking has more or less set times, but cashiering does not. You can be told to come in any day they want you. It's not a bad job if you're willing to work with it. They do work in a point system and pay biweekly."
good,It was like any grocery store and department store to work for. At times you got really busy and others it was slow.  you need to make sure your work area was clean and you could always find something that needed done. You also went and helped in other departments if they was short handed.
good,"Typical days were busy and what I like to call soul-sucking. I learned how to operate a register as well as deal with difficult people. Workplace was dull but tolerable, the hardest part of the job was trying to keep a high moral. I'd have to say the most enjoyable part was my kind co-workers."
good,"Would recommend working there if you enjoy minimal supervision and hour long lunch breaks. Easy job, and supportive staff."
good,Wal-Mart is a good place to work if you wish to slowly climb the ladder and work you way up or just looking for a part time job.
good,En general aprendes muchas cosas diferentes funciones en general un buen biene así como buenos compañeros de trabajo
good,"Walmart is a good job for those just starting to work and with those who want opportunities in that field of work. The pay is decent and the benefits are excellent. The management there however are very self involved and most of the time don't know what they are doing. "
good,"walmart is a really great place to work just not for me, a typical day there is working with a small group of people at the service desk.Trying our best to help customers and meet their needs. At customer service there are only a few of us, so we enjoy working with each other. The managers are really enjoyable to work with. The hardest and also the best is meeting tons of different people daily."
good,"I enjoyed working with the public. Most days were different, but same job duties. I give my all to everything I do and need to understand not everyone is that way."
good,"Em função de ter trabalhado em vários setores, senti que a empresa tem um plano de crescimento profissional."
good,"The store that I worked at did not have very good management. I worked my back side off for them and nothing was ever recognized, never received any kind of thanks or appreciation. Pay raises did not happen like they were supposed to, every person in the store no matter what they did got the same amount of pay raise when they did finally happen rather then based on performance. My department Manager was not a very good manager, always yelling at everyone of the department associates and never had anything good to say."
good,"Working at Walmart keeps you busy and active. You will meet new people everyday and doing new stuff, different day. There are always stuff to do and always with a team."
good,an adequate place to work for those starting out their careers. many of the employees are willing to take you into consideration and effectively 'Teach you the ropes'.
good,"Clock in, Go to the register, Clean area, Take ""go backs"" to customer service, Clock out."
good,You will need food stamps and government assistance at a starting salary of 9.50 but it's easy to move up to a management position which pays 15 an hour
good,very demading and it takes allot on your body even if your following safe lifting and work practices the job messes with your sleep cycle because I was overnight.
good,I would come in at 9 pm and get together with my team and discuss the plans for the night. i learned how to build fixtures and shelves. i also learned how to build a cash register. The management were rude sometimes but for the most part they were bearable. The hardest part of the job was the actual labor. And i enjoyed helping the guest in walmart.
good,"The people working their are really friendly and help full. Too much politics in the management. After the store manager retired, the new one basically transfers or fire the current managers and employee and bring employees from his old store."
good,Working for Wal-Mart has been overall a fair and successful job experience. It's just hard that there is no safety net when you make a mistake. And once you reach a level of write-ups you have to go a year from you last mistake to have it be forgiven.
good,"Working on Cap 2 as a truck unloader can be challenging both mentally and physically. Team work, communication, and work ethic are key as it is a team based orientated. Over all  this is a very challenging job, but keeps you busy and makes your shifts go by fast!"
good,This job I was almost the some as Winn Dixie.  I worked the deli and did pretty much  the something as Winn Dixie.   Not much diffferrent. I did make a lot of good friends there at Wal mart and we are still friends to this day.
good,"Working here is up and down, but mostly down. There is hardly any work to do and you have to find something to do so that you look busy. everyday is the same thing and management is not very great."
good,Extremely understaffed and unrealistic time lines.otherwise the management is very caring about their employees and will help in anyway they can.
good,None really was great working there. Just hate it was a temporary job. I was manager of our temp team for shipping and stocking.
good,A challenging environment with much diversity. I had to multi task a lot of things and one time in this fast paced atmosphere. Everyday was new and different.
good,"Se trabaja bajo presión, el trato con el personal a tu cargo, mi gerente ayudaba mucho a su persona (superarse y crecer), el trato con la gente fue excelente, la calidad de vida"
good,"Well i worked as an overnight associate duties included control of stockflow, zoning(front facing) you have to pay attention to your co-workers, its a team effort so the manager isnt fully respinsible, allthough he is, it is up to the entire team to assure the job is done."
good,Too much favoritism if on manager likes you then you succeed till they rotate to a new manager over you and they each want to make their mark. My Walmart is better then most... But still a bad boss is a bad boss.
good,"Cashier, stocker"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of unloading freight, stocking inventory, helping customers. Management was and is sub-par. Co-workers are very friendly. I enjoyed my co-workers very much; formed strong relationships. The hardest part of the job is lack of communication and other co-workers not following through with their responsibilities and duties while on the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers. I love people and I enjoy helping people."
good,long hours. at the end of the day you were really tired. when you got home you were too tired to do anything. you get your day off and all you want to do was sleep
good,Walmart is a good job to work but you may need a second job. The pay has gotten better but their restriction on hours you can work can put a serious pinch on your wallet.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work for.  Had no problems, cashiering was easy, but the management is sneaky.  The management will watch every little thing you do, and any slight mistake, especially with money and cashiering can cost you your job.  Proceed with caution!"
good,Never trust management and if you have to complain to corporate about something wrong they do good luck. Employees are very nice and customers are ok.
good,"I worked in toys. Overall, it was always busy. I then transferred to pharmacy, which as well was busy. While working as a cashier, I as well was learning technician duties. I loved my co workers."
good,"Meeting new people. Giving great customer service. Being produtive on the job. It can be rewarding when u go the extra mile to help a customer. At the store. They do stuff for associates.Dinners for holidays,and u get bonus money from time to time."
good,very easy going job co workers are easy to get along with have to have plenty of rest and liquids to work here the pay is good the management is great
good,"A typical day at my current job consists of associating with customers,stocking freight, staging end caps, zoning etc.Some co-workers attitudes differ from others but me as a person i come to place of employment to do my job and i feel like im easy to get along with."
good,My day consisted of cashiering and helping customers.  I learned how to deal with a variety of people from all walks of live.  The hardest part o the job was standing on my feet and the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and helping them to have an enjoyable shopping experience.  Management was supportive within their capacity.
good,"one manager will tell you one thing and the other will tell you something else but then try to get you in trouble"
good,It was a stable job that paid the bills but I didn't really have a life outside of work. I liked most of the people I worked with and the regular customers.
good,"If you ever work for Walmart during seasonal times, watch out when the season is over. They will find some reason to fire you after the season is over"
good,"Good place to work with opportunity for advancement , with a positive and willing attitude . Forklift operator, and bicycle assembler ,daytime hours"
good,"I interacted with customers, I learned that Walmart is the number retail store in America. I unloaded freight everyday"
good,Was not a very friendly working environment no place for advancement and management was incompetent. Pay was low for what they expected to be performed and no incentive to improve. As big as the Walmart company is you would expect a competitive salary but wS by far the lowest I've ever been paid
good,"The job was typical as far as retail was concerned. This particular location was not as proactive as the other location I had previously worked at in the past. Hours would vary greatly and their ability to work with your schedule was not the best (college student, children etc). Co workers were friendly and were a large variety of ages. I would give overall compared to other locations a 4 out of 10 and feel like there are many changes to be made. No room for advancement unless you want to be in a management type or are not currently in school. Took away our holiday pay and other previous benefits and pay was less than other locations as well."
good,"All you have to do is go to work and do your job. you make your money and that is all that matters, nothing else to say. Management may be very strict but hey, if you do your job they will not come for you."
good,I am qualified for many different areas of Management and I would definitely be a huge asset to the company but I'm overlooked for favoritism.
good,The overall experience at walmart was a good one. It showed me how to deal wit rude people and how to humble myself. The work was fair for the pay.
good,"typical day included starting at 10pm , learned how to stock, organize shelves. my coworkers were pretty nice and the managers were okay. the hardest part of the job for me was being up all night until 7am when we clock out, you really have to get adjusted to the change but overrall i loved the work environment just can be complicated sometimes."
good,good for kids just starting to work. or for some one that has not worked for some time. getting used to the atmosphere is a little different. lots of standing around and trying to keep busy.
good,"Walmart remains a  Great place for shoppers and workers alike. Mgmt is a problem though. Pay is worth it. .. & "
good,"Worked in produce, stocked the shelf's, changed prices, rotated product, provided customer service to the customers which was the most enjoyable part of working for Walmart."
good,"Very simple daily tasks, but when i became the only associate on shift it was difficult. I also worked in the winter months, so the conditions were a bit harsh. Management constantly changed while they shuffled job responsibilities. The store manager had to work on the floor at one point."
good,Walmart Management should be more structured and allowance for personal involvement is needed. There needs to be more involvement at the Home Office Level.
good,Typical work day was early in the morning from 11a-7p sometimes.  So had to go in and make sure stock got done.  Got to meet people also so that's a plus.
good,"I really loved the fact that you were able to work in different areas of the store. I enjoyed the ability to cross train in any department you felt interested in. I also really liked the ability to pick up more hours by taking anyone's shift that they didn't particularly want. The pay at this job, was well above minimum wage which was very convenient."
good,"First clock in, then get with your supervisor on what needs to be done, a typical day would have you bringing out around three palets of merchendise and only putting out half of one palet, realizing that everything else is already stocked to the max and having to take the palets back to the back and storing them. Lunch was aroung three get back at four and continue the work day by straightening shelves and helping customers any way you could."
good,"My walmart was a high-traffic store and rarely had a slow moment. I quickly mastered the arts of customer service and handling my responsibilities under pressure. My responsibilities included stock and inventory, keeping the store tidy, and working the checkout/registers in both electronics (when the store got hectic) and the checkout lines. Management was unfortunately incredibly unprofessional which ultimately led to my leaving. My coworkers were mostly wonderful. "
good,"You start at temporary part time, then after a year if there is position available for permanent part time or full time but if not then your hours would be reduced to 0-10 hours a week with out notice."
good,"towards the end of my time with this company, it became apparent that the asset protection department was not as wanted as when i had first started. as a customer service manager, i learned how to multi-task with a short staff and take care of customers."
good,Very busy work place but little room for improvement at the store i was at other employees are greet make you feel welcome. Although sometimes it feels like high school again
good,Would be a great place to work if management listened more & communicated with each other & staff. Working with fellow associates was mainly enjoyable.
good,"The hours are good and I don't have any real complaints with the company. However, minor grievances within the workplace prompted this job search. The company as a whole was a great experience and I appreciate the opportunity."
good,I loved working there but had to resign so they didn't fire me. All because I was 9 months pregnant and didn't get my loa papers in time. They did not offer me my job back afterwards.
good,"muy buena empresa, solo hace falta un poco mas de oportunidad de crecimiento dentro de la empresa."
good,Great place to work I moved up in the company pretty fast and they have great discounts and love the working environment they will work with you to make sure you make a career out of it
good,"Most days at Walmart were alright, I worked mornings until afternoons and sometimes afternoons until evenings. What I learned is to never get involved in ANY company's politics, they are really of no concern of yours unless you're about to either be retired or let go.  Management is minimal at best and overbearing at other times. My co-workers made my day because they felt that we were all in the same boat and wanted to help.  The hardest part of the job was locating managers, no matter the department, they never seemed to be available and the most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the different cellphones and the different cellphone plans out there that are available."
good,"I enjoyed all aspects of the job, meeting new people and seeing old friends.  Helping customers meet their shopping needs and the salary was good, and supervisors were fair."
good,I liked the job but most of the some employee didn't show up .During the work of 2 people will stress you at times. It was great working there. I enjoy it.
good,"I worked 3rd shift and the managers were always on my back. They would write me up for no reason, and I wasn't treated right for the 6 months I was there. I tried to change shift but a week after I brought it up to the night managers I was fired."
good,you could find better at place to work. they are okay to be apart of. the benefits could be much better far as medical insurance. the extra perks are good to have.
good,"Working at Walmart as a cashier is a high speed and costumer focused environment."
good,It takes a long time to get a raise or promotion . I left cuz I found a different job but also left due to them having me unload and sort items in the same day
good,"Hard schedules don't let you enough time to spend with family and friends. Nice co-workers, good managers, good facilities"
good,"Um dia típico no trabalho consiste em desempenho e respeito."
good,Working for them I enjoyed. They just didn't give me enough direction to move forward or progress.  I enjoyed the customers my peers and my immediate supervisors
good,Great place to work. Great people. They make you feel comfortable. Managers work around outside work schedule. Great pay and flexible hours.
good,"Management team seems to always put you down and always talk horrible to you on the floor. Other than that this job is great to work at. Meet alot of customers,friends, and also family."
good,"Wal-Mart is terrible with their employees, they only care about making money now days. They really don't even care about their customers any more which is ashame. I have learned that if WalMart management screws up (higher up) your going to get fired one way or another. Some of the managers are great to work for at WalMart but others shouldn't even be there. Co-workers are great, I got along with all the ones I worked with.There wasn't anything hard about working the job I had and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and helping them with all their needs. I would not recommend working at WalMart though if you want a long term career because after you reach a certain amount of years, they find a way to get rid of you so you don't get your benefits. They did that to my husband and they also did to several others I know."
good,I have learned the ins and outs of Logistics and some of the things it takes to become competitive in this industry. The hardest part about my job is the fact that you reach you full potential in less than a year.
good,"Liked the idea of something new happening everyday. The company is continuously changing, so you must be adaptable.  Some managers can be extremely harsh but once you learn how to manage your manager you can learn a lot."
good,"I learned management/leadership skills and was proficient in 7 different departments within the span of 3 years. Although I did not like the way the management system is set up, I will say that the management training is exceptional."
good,It was a great learning experience. I made it up to Department Manager. I learned alot in the amount of time that i was there. However the opportunity for advancement was few and far between.
good,"I ha a great time at Walmart getting to bond with everyone while building the store. my coworkers were amazing, I learned a lot just after 8 months I stop liking going to work."
good,"Every Walmart is different and no 2 work the same. The codes are the same and the policy, but just like any other job there all different. I've worked with some wonderful people and was very sad to leave"
good,Productive and fun workplace with free food and games in the break room.  Keeping the place neat and tidy for the customers and the employees.  I love to work with people.  The people wasn't very friendly and the work environment was horrible to work for.   The hardest part was dealing with angry customers and unhappy people in general.
good,Great work environment. Great department managers. Good opportunity to learn and practice costumer service and getting use to talking to people. They make it really easy to do your job and to learn everything. All the equipment is easy to use
good,"Clean store..friendly people . very demanding store. Learned a lot of new thlngs such as price  changes , stocking preparing and displaying the meat.."
good,"I loved working at wal mart meeting all the new people there that I would see, talked a lot sympathized with what the costomers would tell me, just loved the interaction, worked and got along great with co-workers, salary was good"
good,"I'm pretty sure everyone has or had a job in a Walmart before, and we all know the stories that generated witch each position held. I had one position as a telephone operator, and although the wage at the time was unfair I managed, I learned a lot about how Walmart started and a little more about my position and how to be a sales associate. The story about Walmart having very rude employees is average , but I barely paid attention to that because I was an employee myself and, I did not care to know about how rude I might have been with a customers , because you will find one anywhere from my personal experience as a customer. I had two very cool co-workers that I became incredibly close to and created  immediate relations with, this job was very easy although what makes it hard is the drama encountered every so often. I was never a part of the drama starting crew but I had a blast from all the entertaining associated with it . The job was okay because at the end of the day my bills were paid and I was able to do what was necessary through Walmart."
good,I work for Walmart for a year and a month and I enjoyed working there they have changed rooms after rooms after rooms they don't know what they're doing they fire people on a drop of a hat they need to start caring for their employees they show no concern no caring I would love to work back with them but I don't know I'm having second thoughts they're inconsiderate uncaring
good,El ambiente de trabajo es divertido y la confianza generada por la misma cultura de walmart es muy buena.
good,"In the ten years I have work for walmart, I have learned a lot.I`ve learned to be more patient,I`ve developed a sense of urgency when it comes to helping people. I have worked with a lot of influential people.The work environment is very comfortable,the associates are like a second family.But I am ready for a career change, a more professional work place."
good,My co-workers were fun to work with. Management was lacking knowledge and skills. Recent changes to policies seem to benifit only the company.
good,Productive environment just wish they had more help on the overnight staffing and they also need to be giving hours instead of taking them away from people
good,I feel like they didn't give me the top that I was supposed to do for my job position they gave me more management position Tas instead of soils associate cast what I work there again if I had to
good,"Very fast paced environment! Need to be trained in more than one area! If you're not outgoing, this job isn't for you! You work with people every second of the day!"
good,"The typical work day includes zoning the area, and assisting customers either in finding products, or in printing photos. In this job I learned various functions of the Telzon, MC 55, MC 40, photo lab printer and kiosks, the Walmart One website, how to set up a pre-paid phone, and a great many miscellaneous tidbits. My co-workers were generally quite friendly and eager to teach me what I needed to learn, or else learn from me as a more senior employee. This job was by no means difficult, and the hardest part for me was working nights with a lot of downtime. It's tough to find things to do when you can only leave the sales floor sparingly. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding exactly what the customer needs, when they don't already know. Figuring out what may have gone wrong with the products they had at home, and telling them the solution, is extremely satisfying."
good,"I provide this review as a former cart attendant working part-time (20-32 hrs/week) while going to school full-time (online). "
good,Walmart needs to hear and listen to the employees. We worked hard at everything we did. I truly believe they need more training work. Shops; one on one. An increase in pay would defiantly give employees that extra kick for motivation.
good,"I like Walmart as a company,however each store is different and have different standards on how to run their store. Company overall has improved since I started working for them."
good,"Boa de trabalhar,com a mudança da gerencia tem mudado bastante para melhor ,porem estou a procura de novas areas onde eu possa  ter mais flexibilidade para me formar e trabalhar na minha area tec.enfermagem."
good,"the people who watched over the cashier workers were rude some times, there was this old guy ken that works there i was on my break and i was buying food for my lunch and he comes yelling at me saying i cant buy food if im on the clock and im trying to explain that im on my break and he just kept yelling at me"
good,"RDC 6010 is a warehouse that is currently at a 60% rate of turnover for associates and salaried members of management."
good,I enjoyed learning new things and meeting new people it was good working with machines and the co-workers was fun to work with. Management was really good about meetings everyday. I become full-time because I am a harder worker and management Said I was one of the best employees they have.
good,"fun place to work at. Great people, great customer service. Its so much to learn from the associates and the customers. The variety is amazing and you get to stay up to date with everything."
good,I love the fact that Walmart let's you grow. Helps you learn anywhere & everywhere in the store. Backroom also showed me a lot on how to run a backroom or department.
good,"Waiting on customers and helping with locating their items. Stocking shelves and cleaning. Putting up displays, and working as cashier. Retail, and all that goes with it. Customer service, and just how important they are. Management is chaotic, too many of them. You never really know who to listen to, because you don't really know who is in charge of you. The other associates are great, and try hard to work together to get things done. The hardest thing- lack of communication, and getting pulled in all directions. The most enjoyable- the people; the customers."
good,"Typical day at Walmart I would find myself in the office, on a register, in a cooler or the freezer. My co-workers were so fun to work with had a wonderful time every time I came in."
good,"El trabajos con cambios frecuentes, el ambiente era bueno, con un grupo de trabajo en el cual, era confiable y ayudaba en momentos complicados, cuando se requería apoyo de los lideres, era recibido de la mejor forma, siempre para resolver el problema de la mejor forma sin afectar tanto al cliente."
good,Walmart is not a forever job. Walmart does have a friendly work environment. They aren't good on treating employees up to entirely what they need to be held to.
good,The manager fired me for going to school. I had to go to him to ask why I had no hours the next week. he said that's because you're fired.
good,"Most days are pretty good"
good,"- A typical day at work was alright, meaning if we didn't have any associates calling in to work. "
good,It alright i learned a lot from stocking at Walmart and other area also but the hardest part is when they change up.God bless me to have a job.I hate they be cutting hours.
good,come in to work go check my pallets and grab carts then I go down stack freight. then I go check out of dates and work my freight at the end of night I zone my area then go home
good,It can be a great job for younger people but not so for someone looking for a career . the best part is assisting customers and making them want to come back . management could be a lot better .
good,The most enjoyable part of my day was meeting new people. I worked well with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was telling customers that are out a certain item. I learned to use various equipment that I did not use before.
good,"there was somewhat a routine."
good,"The pay is good, however the work, and communication among supervisors and associates was nil. The cowokers were fun to be around. But the supervisor should have trained all new employees better."
good,"Working at wal-mart is stressful fun never boring"
good,"i liked working there the people were fun to be with "
good,I think the Communication between day shift and night shift could be better. Enjoyed working for this company. Working over night with some of the best co-workers was by far the best part of this job. Great customer service while stocking freight.
good,I enjoy what I do but there is no chance for advancement and I fear that what I do will soon be replaced with automation forcing me out of work.
good,"Just stocking and zoning products from 10pm to 7am you usually get a slow day not a lot of things to stocks but other days it could be a lot. The management was ok but aggressive at times, the co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job is were there be a lot to stock but very little time to do it. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you zone after you finishing stocking."
good,"A typical day included helping customers in the electronic section -- where i was recognized for customer service more than any other previous employee.  Management varied:  sometimes they were helpful and informative; other times, they were stressed and of little to no help.  the hardest part was working solo with no input or support from anyone else."
good,"Things would change constantly and most would be folds weeks after the fact. It was a good place to work and the people were nice. Good pat, but I wasn't happy there."
good,"Management isn't the best, but could improve. Short staffed in just too many areas and everyone is still expected to do the all the work that full staffing would complete even though it is humanly impossible."
good,There is multiple things to do at Wal-mart. It was a fun place to work depending on the store manager and their assistants.
good,I enjoyed working with people. The work was fun and reasonable. For the most part i had wonderful coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people. I learned a broad range of skills including working and resolving problems and learning how to run a cash register. I also learned things about having a good work ethic and working in a fast pace environment was helpful for learning to work under pressure.
good,"I have worked for Walmart for almost two years."
good,Was responsible for stocking shelves in a safe manner.  Loading and unloading products on and off of skids moving those skids using a pallet jack in a fast paced manner.  Worked in a team environment to get the job done.
good,"•	Dealt with incoming stock deliveries during the night by assisting in unloading trucks"
good,"A typical day involved me collecting shopping carts from the  parking lot and pushing them back into the store. "
good,"Long hours on feet so that was a downfall. Co-workers had mean attitudes. Hardest pary of the job was the long hours, worked 2pm to 11pm with one hour break and so that would began to take a toll on your back. Communicating and helping customers is a upside to the job though."
good,"I would usually get my tasks done during the first half of the day, and help everyone else during the second part. I did enjoy my time there."
good,"I liked working here because it was a fun environment. I enjoyed working outdoors also, but a few managers made the job more stressful than it should be."
good,"Walmart is pretty much the same as every other retail company, but the company has a horrible image that needs to be fixed. It needs to make itself more professional and allow the employees to think for themselves. To many managers 3 managers for a team of 5 a lot of people don't even have a high school education which in the 21st century is unacceptable.  Pizza parties, coffee and doughnuts every month as well as profit sharing and stock are some good incentives for working at Walmart."
good,It is very hard working on the sales floor but if you are in the pharmacy or vision center the work load is a lot easier. The customers are amazing to work with and serve.
good,Walmart is a very fast paced place to work. With a opportunity to work with your neighbor and serve your best-friend. You grow to learn people by their first name.
good,I loved my customers but sometimes you just don't love the people you work with! I advanced from a technician trainee to a certified technician. I was worked to the bone and felt like I lived there. Was scared to call in if sick because they make you feel bad. Hate to feel that way! Left because of my health issues.
good,"Start off work 30 hours a week and they continue to hire, so the employees get less work and then they leave because they get less hours."
good,"Greet customer, check out customers at cash register, cleaned and maintained sales floor, worked in multiple department, stocked sales floor"
good,"Una empresa de mucho aprendizaje, y de mucha experiencia tuve la gran oportunidad de conocer todo para ser un buen mercader el respeto de los asociados hizo que se lograran varias metas en visitas de vicepresidencia nos fue de maravilla al ver los resultados de ventas margen y utilidad nos felicitaban muy seguido, habia mucho trabajo en equipo y eso era muy bueno, la parte mas dificil para mi fue en la utima tienda donde estuve walmart tepatitlan me dejo muy decepcionada ya que no habia trabajo en equipo desde el lider principal el gerente y todo el tiempo fueron regaños y nunca hubo un coauch que te ayudara a resolver problemas se trato de dar lo mejor pero si el lider del equipo no apoyaba el barco asi no avanzaba."
good,"Training for the job was easy and well taught. Coworkers are friendly and very helpful. Management has an open door policy and will always listen and help when needed. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with people you can enjoy and working shifts to fit your schedule. The hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting and constant movement, twisting and working in cold conditions."
good,I enjoyed working around the public. My co workers were awesome. Was able to work in other areas if overstaffed or slow day. My management I worked with daily were knowledgeable and helpful when needed.
good,It was a good experience. But I work the graveyard shift and that was the only hard and bad part about working there. Everyone was very friendly. I started off as a cleaning lady then I went too stocking shelfs.
good,"good pay,good people need better management though.i learned that there better managers than them.my co workers were cool.hardest part of the job was the managers."
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for, it provides competitive pay and great benefits. Depending the location you are in depends on how your store will be ran. Its a great company to grow and be promoted in. But as any customer service position it requires all your time and energy. What little time you do have outside of work, use it wisely"
good,"I absoultely love my job at the walmart gas station. I get to meet new  people and help people which is something I love to do. However, I need to find a company with guarnteed full time hours and benefits."
good,coworkers were wonderful and very respectable but the management needs to be worked on. they didn't have much communication within the work place.
good,good place to work with improvement for the long run. nice people to work with and understanding managers. its not a bad job at all.
good,"I liked working with the customers but management and staff were absolutely horrible to work with. I enjoyed working for the company but my managers were rude, had favorites and act like they did not care about how life happens when it happens to you but wants excuses when something happens to them."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me, stocking shelves and assisting costumers."
good,My coworkers were great but a lot of the managers didn't seem to know what they were doing. the actual store manager was nice he seemed to actually care about everyone.
good,"everything was great about the job except the management, they were very unprofessional, yelling at each other breaking policy's and bad attitudes tword associates"
good,"trabajo bajo presión demanda de equipos de carga, se rolan turnos se trabajan días festivos."
good,"a typical day includes: clocking in, getting your assigned cart, shelving groceries in the appropriate spots, doing as many carts as you can within the 8 hour timeframe."
good,nice place to work. need to pay more to associates that work hard. good for a career path. multi billion company. needs  more respect in the store.
good,"Its a good job to gain experience in customer service, but the healthcare benefits aren't offered to part time employees right away and the varying work schedule allows no room for single parents to find suitable childcare,"
good,"I personally learned a lot with this company. Ive learned structure and determination. A typical work day was always good for me, I was bubbly happy always talking to customers, the customers love me. My coworkers were like family we went to eachother for everything if we needed help from someone in a different department they came over and helped no questions asked. The hardest part of the job was communication, the managers werent very good at that. You would hear something from one manager and the next one would try and tell you something completely different. The most enjoyable part was everyone had eachothers back. We had fun while working and thats the most important part."
good,"A typical day at Walmart is very unorganized, unstable, and frustrating. Most people that come to work are on a 9 hour shift it can be times where you'll get skipped for your 15 minute breaks or even your lunch and you won't get a lunch at all. My co-workers is what made work fun and kept me going. The management was rude sometimes unprofessional and unorganized at times. The hardest part of the job is contacting a manager when something goes wrong with the customer it literally takes management foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to come and by the time they get there the customer is upset and annoyed also the lines in the store can get outrageous because the manager didn't schedule enough cashiers that day so it would be 3 cashiers working with 20 lines closed. luckily  as I've been working there I haven't had a bad or rude customer. some of them understand our frustration. overall great place to work you get a lot of hours a hour lunch and two 15 min breaks."
good,Walmart is an OK place to work for the most part the other cashiers were friendly the management could use some work i enjoyed making my customers happy and providing the best service i could for them.
good,A good working environment where everyone is treated respectfully. A typical day includes conducting customers transactions and providing them with customer service and any assistance they need.
good,the job itself was actually fantastic and i loved it. BUT my schedule was never guaranteed the same and made it hard to have a life outside of work. i loved the people i worked with and management was great.
good,"es un ámbito en el que se puede crecer todo el tiempo tanto laboral como personalmente, su única dificultad es que los beneficios no son para todos iguales y menos cuando sos nueva ya que es evidente que no están preparados para integrar a las mismas"
good,Walmart was a great place to work at because I basically knew everybody there and If you know everybody in your workplace the work will be much relaxed and everybody is friendly no enemy's or any other stuff that goes bad in a work place.
good,Normal work day was 15-18 hours on weekends for 3 days. Solid team that was productive and enjoyed a fast paced environment.
good,"It was a good experience, most enjoyable part is meeting nice people! My co-workers were great, I miss them terribly. Management worked with my Navy schedule and that was something I appreciated a lot."
good,"my responsibility within my job title, is to make sure customers needs are satisfied quickly and efficiently. Along with having merchandise outs filled. A fun part of the job is actually working as a team,and bouncing information off each other to help customers. along with that the hardest milestone is the lack of coverage when we would help out other departments. and shorten are staff in electronics."
good,"I loved working with my coworkers, and the customers. Make lots of friends and acquaintances. A typical day was to answer phones, keep changing rooms clean, put out merchandise, keep existing merchandise neat, help customers.. Hardest part of the job was .. I couldn't get enough hours.. most enjoyable was working with people."
good,I love giving back with generosity and respect to my community going the extra mile displaying customer service to all customers I'm a loyal customer service rep> I love how customers look for me when they come in I love giving them hugs this has been a very uplifting experience my customers know my name and I know theirs this is truly my neighbor hood market.
good,At Walmart I work in the fashion department.  A typical shift for me includes assisting customers needs and solving any conflicts. Ensuring the fashion department is clean and tidy. I also Help out in various other departments when needed.
good,"A typical day at work would include going straight to the back and scanning and putting out any merchandise that was needed to fill the shelves. Then, after going out and filling the shelves, you would go and throw your cardboard away, go back and pick up any trash off the floor and then go to get items that people have returned and put it in its correct location on the shelf. After all the returns were done, you would go to lunch. After lunch you would then start to zone the entire area and help customers with whatever questions they had. The co-workers were very helpful and hard working and the managers got the job done. I learned a lot of social skills and teamwork. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people find whatever they needed and getting thanked at the end of the day."
good,"Uma empresa Boa que oferece oportunidade para aprendizado, uma escola profissional, pessoas maravilhosas e humildes. Trabalhei 6 anos e fui a diversos cargos."
good,"It was an okay job, Had to stock shelves with the products that were shipped to us. Downloaded pallets to the floor.Had to greet customers with a smile."
good,"What won't kill you makes you stronger. Wal-Mart can be a stressful place to work. All types of people shop there. I was in this position for only 1 year, because the amount of stress that came from both the customers and the upper management was unreasonable."
good,"Never get a break, super hot on the pavement, never see management there always hiding in the back, didn't want to work with you on hours for appointments"
good,"I really enjoy interfacing with people.  Just wish the pay was more than $10.50 per hour.  Not a living wage!!  Hardest part of the job is being on my feet all day.  I have a friendly personality, I often get compliments from Customers that I am professional and carry myself well."
good,"A typical day at Walmart consisted of an inventory of all meat cases and ensuring replenishment of low or missing products. This process included dating, zoning, mark downs, and removing outdated items using their computer system ""Telzon"".  I learned how to use my time wisely while dealing with management and customer service. My co-workers depended on me for advice and guidance due to my tenure in the department. The hardest part of my job was ensuring that my time was spent wisely in order to accomplish all assigned tasks.  I enjoyed interacting with my coworkers and customers.  I enjoyed customer satisfaction while helping coworkers to learn new ways of addressing problems."
good,"It was a typical work environment, management ignored the little guys and the little guys were the hardest workers. Its a job."
good,cashing customers out with purchases. interacting with customer in a pleasant and friendly manner. sometimes having to deal with difficult customers. co-workers sometimes interfering with issues not always concerning them.management mostly helpful in solving issues
good,a typical day at workwas making sure my customers were completely satisfied with services to make their day a little easier
good,"I arrive get myself settled. Overview our TMS system to see the work priorities. Ensure we are set up properly to achieve our day. Follow up on any issues from the previous 12 hours, cascade through my emails for any special requests( which there always are)"
good,you feel that your work day is useless sometimes because you are moved from one dept to another because schedules were not set right
good,Good place to gain considerable experience within short time. Arkansas is dull but work is fun. Mixing fun with work will be more helpful for associates to have positive experience.
good,"A typical day at work is normal to the working life, what I learned in this is that everyday is different and you never know what will happen. Management there is some mangers take the position to their head and think I'm over you so you need to do this and whatever else I say. As there are a few mangers where I don't care to do what they want as they will talk to me and see first if I can fully do the job with the other things I carry out the day. If they see I need help they will leaned a hand or see where I needed help at. Then there's one manger I will listen to as he treats me equal as he self and knows we aren't there to do their job but to work and make a living just like him. He also understands that life isn't about deadlines. Its about how you spend your time and enjoy what you can. Now the co-workers some have their spots but everyone dose. Some people there I grow close to knowing they have my back and are there to help if need be. "
good,"Currently I am not satisfied with a lot going on at my current job situation. The main reason being that we have to work with broken equipment also other job hazards that they absolutely ignore until they have to repair the problem. I can talk to management but across the board management really does not listen to their employees, also sometimes belittle them or over all a very unprofessional work environment."
good,Walmart is a very fast paced store. There aren't many times throughout the day that you are not busy doing something. Which for me is good because it makes the time pass by. I enjoy helping customers and meeting different people everyday. I was always the time of worker that liked to make sure that my customer had a smile on their face.
good,"I loved the company just hated the management. Wal-mart is a great company. And I love the benefits. It was exciting, very fast paced. You will always be busy. Good hours"
good,Good job to have while going to school because of the flexibility of the hours. Many of the managers will make the job  harder than it has to be.
good,"I loved this job, but had to leave due to harassment from the shop manager and assistant manager because i had to change my availability by two hours. Great department manager. Great training. Good lunch and break times."
good,Waiting on the customers. learned to stay busy .management was very poor .co- worked together to get are stuff done. was not knowing how to do something.was seeing the happy faces when they were done shopping.
good,"its an ok place to work but management is never on the same page, I understand multi-tasking and can multi-task but management takes it to a whole other lever. co-worker are good and fun people to work with, they are usually the ones who help you get thru the day."
good,"In my ten years with this company, there was always little to no training on your job and expectations. I prided myself on not being that to the associates I over seen. If I knew how to do something... I made sure to show them all how to do that as well. My associates always got more then enough training. "
good,Working with the public is always exciting and fun. Quality of life is the hardest part of this job. Everyday is completely different.
good,"very nice but ran into a little bit of problems"
good,"count money, check on cashier breaks. take care of customers. handle any training questions from cashiers. make sure every one is following policy. cleaning, register audits. make judgment decision."
good,"very good opportunity...fun and friendly atmosphere but lack of hours ....cont"
good,this job was fine for me due to it being a hobby from the beginning. i liked the people i worked with everyday. working on vehicles is just fun for me and this job was just paying me to play so to speak
good,a typical day working at walmart would be going to see where the csms needed me and going to my register and staying there unless being told to go somewhere else
good,I loved my job at walmart but the managers were the worst managers I have ever worked for. They did nit respect you at all; they would talk down to you and continuously refuse to do their job.
good,"Generally is a fast paced environment with lots of challenges to troubleshoot and resolving issues."
good,I liked the job very much it was very hard to move up but i always made the best of it and the people i worked with were some of the best and hardest working people i have ever known
good,"Busy"
good,"I learned all aspects of cashiering, customer service, price checking.  I was able to make informed accurate decisions rom the training I learned.  Most of all I loved being busy all day."
good,Working the overnight shift was good to jet some extra income and working there had taught me to get tasks done in a timely maner.
good,I liked the pay and the hours just not the shift it was a great opportunity. I would have liked to work their longer the only thing I didn't like was one of my supervisors. i did my work saved us some time and got the production done most of the time for our whole area and she just hated me. She would tell me to leave my work area and clean other machines with a wire tooth brush.
good,"The work day is straightforward and full of customer service. You learn how to appease customers and to interact with employees to get the job done. The peak of holidays are the difficult times, which can be hectic and busy. The hardest part of the job is dealing with employee shortages."
good,"Typical day at walmart...you never know what you are going to experience or see. I learned there to just do your job, do it correctly and have good customer service at all times. management was alright  but had a few bad apples but hey there is always on or two. hardest part of the job was dealing with the rude customers, they always seem to go to the extreme when they can get something or feel singled out. most enjoyable part was just enjoying all the people and other activities within the workplace."
good,"I have always enjoyed my co-workers.  The department management has varied over the years, which is to be expected.  Each one brought to the area a new perspective to work with. I enjoy the daily tasks and the work schedule."
good,I learned to work at a fast pace while interacting with customers. I also learned how to handle difficult customers. The hardest part was finding something to do when things slowed down.
good,"Overall was a good company to start off working with. Making friends and working with many individuals was a new experience, this job prepared me for being out in the real world. It was always a pleasure to assist customers."
good,It was a great chance to earn some management and customer service experience. I rarely had any problems with employees and if there was a problem it was taken care of in a professional manner.
good,This is the same as I posted before. If you want to have no family life and work random hours the is job for you. If you are looking for something to keep you busy this is the place.
good,Work days were really easy and i learned alot about how to maintain different things at once but the management could have cared a little bit more. All the co workers were friendly and hard workers but i really enjoyed helping the customers with there needs
good,It had very friendly coworkers all the time. When it came to the task at hand which was my job the tools almost always needed to be repaired and didn't'. They gave us some food every now and then.
good,I loved my coworkers and the customers who came in. I never had a problem with the management team. They were easy going and easy to work with as long as you did your job. When I had problems with my daughter my manager worked with me.
good,My previous job at walmart was a well organized and functional working environment. The company treated the employees with respect and very helpful.
good,I met many different types of people while working at Walmart.  The diversity of the clientele made every day an adventure.
good,"I enjoyed my time here and learned many skills. I had a difference made in me. Meeting new people, making friends, learning to multitask"
good,"A typical Day at work was Scrubbing down every cash register, stocking the Smoke Box and impulse items. I learned how to stock items, and how to deal with rude or impatient customers. Management at Walmart is a joke. They do not talk to each other, they just simply send one person on a wild goose chase all night, so they can't achieve anything, but they yell at you the whole time while you try to do what each manager has asked. The Co-Workers were the best part of the job by far. That place is like a giant family and those workers stick together and work very hard. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management. But the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see the public in such a raw setting."
good,"a typical day at work is always fast pace because the store is always busy. i learned that you have to have a lot of patients to work with people. the management at this store is poor, do to the that the management doesn't have customer service as there first priority. my co-workers are awesome they are wonderful to work with. The hardest part of the job is not being able to take care of the customer when you dont have the supplies to help them. the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing and making the customer happy."
good,while working at walmart i learned  how to handle the way you talk to people as they came thou my line . the people i work with was great.
good,I learned how to move at a fast pace  in order to reach the company's goals. My co- workers were really friendly and I enjoyed working with them.
good,"Better Management Team Training"
good,"Very Busy and Bustling work atmosphere. No time to relax except on breaks. It is fulfilling when you have a good team, and get all of your work done."
good,"All in all, a good typical work day. Nice work flow with great people coming through. Good staff to work with also. Pay and hours are the biggest turn off"
good,"Walmart Is a great Place to Work! I really enjoyed it. My co workers were real friendly, Along with my Managers. Understadning with any Problems that came up. Helps with your Socializing"
good,My manager and co-workers are very nice people. The place is sometimes very hard to locket in because some costumers are not polite.
good,"A typical day for me at work had originally been coming in, taking control of whichever register needed to be occupied, covering others breaks and enduring however long it felt until your break(s). It was highly convenient having the grocery section, a deli and other functions literally in walking distance from your station. Most often, it was tiring listening to the same complaints from people about not wanting to participate in our credit card program and arguing with relentless customers about how they thought they were correct in how they understood our coupon and AD matching policies. Once I switched over to the pharmacy, I felt more capable handling not only ringing out orders, but processing prescriptions and handling the shelves. It was amazing to be able to say ""yes"" more often than ""no, that's not allowed"". management changed dramatically in the switch. Instead of being left to solve problems for myself and trusting in myself that I had done a good job with the customers, I now am critiqued every single time the manager sees anything that he personally saw as a mistake, like posture when standing, not showing my hands, word for word responding to customers and other minor details that were never considered on the front-lines. Nothing that broke the rules, but still not as he preferred, like speaking a few simple words of Spanish to ask ""What are you looking for?"" to the Spanish-speaking customers, though I am not certified to translate medical information. He is incredibly conscientious of image. I feel like I need to do more now after the switch, though it came along"
good,I liked this job as customer service I loved working with the public and coworkers would like to return if I could parttime
good,"Had some issues with the assistant manager whom I didn't even know. Liked all the other managers and co-workers, but she was very rude. I know of some people that decided to go to the main GM and complain about the way she treated me because they had noticed it."
good,Loved it there but the 9 dollar and hour wasn't paying the bills being a single working house hold if I made more I would still be there
good,the co-worker who has been training me is exceptional at training and seems to truly care about the job she is training me for.
good,I supervise the unloaders and Asign duties for the day. And also make sure that they are doing their jobs through out the night. The management will not stand behind me when i ask them to do something. the hardest part of my job is having associates do what i ask them to do. Working with my team.
good,"was happy over all with my coworkers, and enjoyed the company perks. I was able to meet new people and learn new skills. I was not happy with the management because I was told to do something by a supervisor and then was told to do it differently an hour later. it was very confusing and frustrating."
good,"Have to go out and buy your own black/white clothes. I believe they should be provided to you."
good,Every store is different. It's a great company but if you get stuck at a store with bad management you will hate it. Every store has its ups and downs. My store was fun to work at. But I've also been at a bad store to. Just all depends.
good,Worked here as seasonal help a couple times for the holidays before getting full time status. Worked on the receiving docks and as a high reach forklift operator putting palatalized merchandise away in the assigned slot in the racks.
good,We would get our task and get it done on time. I think that overall walmart was a great experience. I think that they could improve on the management area but overall very good.
good,"Decent pay with a lot to do. Some employees didn't seem to care about anything that happened. Management didn't show much integrity and lacked a bit on "" getting things done right' or at all."
good,"Cashiering for the most part was very fast paced at walmart, time went by quickly.  Most Customers were very nice and I enjoyed my coworkers and the managers"
good,Management only cared about bonuses and it paid not enough to take care of family. I wish they cared more about their people.
good,"Over all i loved the environment and the work place. i loved working period . it was something different for me . the most enjoyable part was my co-workers , there were so many different race and cultures , it was an amazing experience working with different people."
good,"I started as a sales associate and by the time I left I was a Department Manager. I've learned any things from this job that will prepare me for mostly any other job i will have after this, and that is most companies everywhere are out for themselves. There were a good amount of managers and depending on which one you had to deal with, you could have had a good experience or bad. The best part of the job is meeting different people and helping them out. the worst is dealing with what management wants you to do and whats actually possible."
good,i really liked working with the team members. i enjoyed making the customers happy and helping them when they needed it. great for advancements.
good,Wal-Mart's it's self wasn't a bad place to work. The management team and my coworkers were great. I sometimes expirenced difficult customers but my coworkers helped me through it and made sure I always had a smile on my face.
good,Offered assistance to consumers and provided excellent service. Aides consumers with locating merchandise pricing and quality. Monitored floor stock and organized merchandise on the sales floor and in display areas
good,"I would work weekdays, usually in the morning. I worked in the garden section of the store. I was in charge of keeping all shelves stocked and helping customers with heavy loads. The work was distributed among three other employees. Their duties were more a less the same as mine. There where some days where I felt I had been doing more work than usual to make up for lost time. I enjoyed the atmosphere though, it was nice to be around plants. The job was a nightmare on hot days though. I rarely saw management in our area too. Overall I fairly enjoyed my time there but I was not satisfied with the compensation for my work. I learned a lot more about customer service and even some botany."
good,"The employees are a very nice group to work with."
good,i enjoyed working for walmart but they are all about family till you need the time off then you are threatened to be terminated after they say you can have said time off.
good,"Holidays were always noticed with everyday low prices, co-workers are very friendly & will help you with anything you need or ask."
good,"I was a repetitive routine work at P.O.S. but I always managed to look to do things more enjoyable and kept myself busy around the the cash registers. I always tried to learn how to serve and assist the diverse customer population either translating from Eng/Span or vice-versa or assist them in searching for availability of items or discounts. My close managers understood me on my way on doings things in order to please the customers and provide the best customer relationships at the store. I had good co-workers relationships and good teamwork with cooperation and concern of others while on training. The hardest part of the job was the rush during hurricane season and when the store had to close due electrical shortage and the P.O.S did not respond or bomb threatening and have to evacuate the customers including employees and management and wait for police and firefighters. The most enjoyable part of the work was during meetings with some fun, dinner, recognition of employees of the month and bonus which was cancelled later on; and during Christmas season. The store was lighted up in all the departments with new merchandise, discounts, music and events for the customers; it feels great seen all the children laughing and singing aloud all over the store."
good,"When a particular store would require me to solve a problem, I'd be called upon by my contractor to head there and fix the issue. I didn't have any direct experience working in the stores, just managing their networks."
good,Arrive on time.Open registry or take over registry to cover breaks and lunches for co-workers. Clean surroundings and prepare for business. Greet customers in a friendly and respectful manner. Professional management staff. Friendly co-workers.The hardest part of the job is the constant elimination of work hours.I enjoyed working at Walmart overall.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Walmart. My supervisor was easy to get along with and helped in any way he could. The atmosphere was relaxed, structured and supportive. Their products are of good quality for an affordable price. Would work for again!"
good,"They were good to schedule your hours around your life. Your family. Good to give you sunday mornings off for those requested it. I also liked the fact that they gave the cashiers flexibility with the customers is always right, within reason of course"
good,I enjoyed my time with this company though it was temporary. still enjoyed it. made some life long friends in a short period of time and got to experience new things I didn't think I would.
good,"A typical day at work is being a cashier, sorting returns, cleaning my area. I've learned a lot because a night cashier at Wal-Mart has to know how to perform the same functions as the Customer Service Dept. because Customer Service closes at 10pm and that's when I start. I have to do customer returns, loading and unloading gift and credit cards, cashing payroll checks, rules and regulations of selling cigarettes and alcohol, sorting store returns in right bins, ringing up propane tanks and propane gas, fishing and hunting licenses, cashing e-cards, redeeming coupons (vendor verses store), WIC transactions (paper and card), tax exempt transactions, dealing with irate customers properly, answering phone, knowing products we carry to answer questions that phone call customers have, etc., etc. Management is tough on us because we have a skeleton crew because people don't like working from 10pm-7am and we have to wear several hats in order to get the job done. I've had to door greet, sweep and mop floors and wash windows. etc. I get along very well with my co-workers and enjoy their company. The hardest part of my job is the hours and the constant standing all day! The most enjoyable part of my job is my customers and cashiering."
good,"A Typical day at work is stocking, ordering, and making sure i have everything the customer needs."
good,I enjoyed the fact that you could always keep busy in this job.  You never run out of things to do and it could also be very challenging at times.
good,The good thing about working for the DC was that you had 3-4 days off each week and it was set.  Pay was good in this department for where i lived.  A lot of politics for the company and a lot of changing in policies all the time.  You are expendable as they clearly show on a day to day basis.
good,"Overall Wal-Mart is a decent place to work. Decent benefits, good overall attitude toward customers."
good,I started as a seasonal cashier and was called back after the holiday and worked my was up quickly. I worked at the Customer Returns and Exchanges desk. I dealt with just about everything; from people trying to return bricks in a weight set and just regular returns. I learned to always check in every box that came back no matter if it still had the safety straps still on it or not. I think I really lucked out on my front end team members not just the cashiers and the return desk team but the csm's and the front end managers as well. They really tried to make it a joy to come into work.
good,"Great team work with positive feedback. It's a great way to stay fit, and the quicker you learn the faster you move up in position. I really enjoyed working at Wal-Mart."
good,"I clocked into work, went to the coolers where the produce is kept, I would go to the floor and see what needed to be filled, go back, get the produce and fill it. I would check dates as I was filling and take out expired produce. I learned quite a bit about expiration dates, and working with others. I learned that not everyone works the same way and we have to compromise so we have a successful team. I got along with most of my coworkers but did struggle with one individual. The hardest part of my job was cutting boxes down as they were large and very thick. Also collecting and getting rid of the compost as it was heavy and hard to lift. I enjoyed working with the customers and helping them find the things that they needed."
good,management sucked but the coworkers and nice and helpful. its a fun place to work because you meet new people every day. not really organized and some managers had their favorites.
good,"Each morning I go into my department and do a quick walk through and note areas of need. I then stock freight and bin the overstock. I will then put returns away and zone problem areas. All the while assisting customers. I've learned patience, time management, and efficient work methods. The best part of the day is seeing all of my co-workers and customers. The hardest part of the job is planning and execution of change of merchandise for seasonal change. A great challenge. Co-workers are the reason I've stayed, customers are a pleasure most of the time, management not so much. Very unavailable or understanding."
good,"Typical day starts with the outlook emails and various correspondence for followup."
good,worked hard and got along with most everyone.  was a laid back environment but no room for advancement.  was not supportive when injured
good,"Fast pace work environment, with supportive management, very enjoyable experience. Learned a lot about my co-workers and grew and developed personally. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them."
good,It's a lot harder job than I expected. There's quite a bit to know but the time goes by so fast. an hour can seem like 10 minutes
good,"balance registrars, do daily deposits, daily paperwork, co-workers are great. I sometimes run a registrar. I also enter daily audits."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of warehouse duties such as packing and shipping. Additional duties included excellent customer service, and cashier services."
good,"Co workers were good, for the most part management was too, except for a few. Great teaching on how to run the business from a to z.  Dealing with the public was a little nerve wracking from time to time, but overall good.  The company took a wrong turn during a corporate restructure and it wasn't a good idea to follow.  You can manage a tire shop like you do a bake shop.......terrible idea."
good,Good company and people to work for also with good benefits. The most enjoyable part about the job is being able to help the customers with their needs
good,"some workers are hard to work with. I liked working for the company"
good,Decent Company to work for while you are looking for other work.  Pay and Health low but should be better since the company makes billions of dollars and the employees are one of the main reasons so they should be taken care of better
good,"An over all day working for Wal-Mart can be challenging and rewarding, but most of all a continuous learning experience with every new associate and customer I came in to contact with.  I loved the fact that everyday would be slightly different than the day before.  actually thinking about it every hour was completely different than the previous hour.  Each task could be related but every customer and their needs were different.  I enjoyed the challenge of making every customer fell important and that their business was truly appreciated."
good,"Great company, well trained managers and supervisors. Good work environment. Its a team effort department and learned lots from co-workers and managers. good quarterly bonuses."
good,Not enough advancement within the company.  Easy to balance home life and work life.  Not enough hours or compensation.  Benefits need to be better for familys.
good,"Relativamente bien, aunque descansar entre semana y no los fines es algo pesado"
good,It was very fast paced and lots of fun people to work with. The management sucks. The hours given if you have a second job are not desirable.
good,I enjoyed working with others as a team and building experience. The environment was friendly and everyone helped eachother.
good,"loved working with my co-workers. Had to check my schedule everyday to make sure it didn't change. It changed a lot. There is movement within, but you have to be in the in-crowd. As a whole they strive to be the best. Had a lot of customers that stop at the Willows location just because of service, and it being clean. They preferred Willows than there ""own"" store. Most of these people live over a hour away."
good,"I was happy to have a job here, but it all felt a little impersonal. There are a lot of managers and higher up's. I felt as if I wasn't wearing my name tag no one would have been able to remember my name. The shift I worked most days kept me late and I missed dinner with my family frequently. A lot of policy changes and educational updates are on the computer, that's also where you need to go if you need a day off for appointments, you need to request the time off on the computer. There isn't much tolerance for calling out sick, I only did it once, I had to leave in the middle of my shift due to illness and everyone seemed to look down on it. I mean, it was a good first job experience and I'm glad they gave me a head start in the job market, and apparently they gave me a good reference because I have taken on other jobs since then. There are many benefits and insurance options, though I can't say I ever tried any."
good,"A typical day at work involves setting priorities for the team and following up on company processes and procedures. Coaching your team for improvement and development is part of every interaction in store. Most difficult portion of the job is being able to lead, develop, and delegate as well as how to integration work/life balance. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people interaction and the commitment to driving top line results and sales."
good,"a little unorganized ,busy,everyone got along and its always something to do. the pay does not add up to the way the managers worked you."
good,"Typical day at work was always moderately busy with many friendly customers to talk to. Learned about good customer service, how to be a cashier, how to stock merchandise. Managers were very good, but had a lot of travel time between different parts of the store, so there was either very little or a lot of waiting involved when one was needed. Co workers were friendly and hard working, and I enjoyed making friendships with them while I worked there. The hardest part of the job was to try and work quickly when lines began to form at registers and the wait time for managers when they were needed. The most enjoyable part of working there was all the great conversations I had with many of the customers."
good,"Un dia tipico dentro de Walmart, esta en caja rápida o de productos variados era bueno, con un ambiente de presion por el flujo de personas dentro del establecimientos, con horarios cortados y pesados pero trabajar con muchas personas solía ser agradable y divertido."
good,very long hours hard work which I like it keeps the busy and helps time go by. I LOVE MY CO WORKERS. THE WORK IS ALWAYS A FULL OVERLOAD BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO BE A MULTITASKED PERSON WHICH I AM
good,Everyone was friendly and really good to work with. The CSMs were really nice and helped with any troubles or questions. I would love to go back there and be a cashier again.
good,Although the job doesnt pay much or have great benefits i have made the best of it and gained several friends throughout my time there
good,In my experience at this particular pharmacy I was introduced to the billing part of pharmacy which was a new avenue for me.  I did enjoy the learning under the Pharmacist.
good,"Work at Walmart was always busy,and employees were continuously helping customers and making sure they were satisfied. Management was always on top of things, and co-workers worked together. Sometimes things got stressful when there was many customers lined up and were frustrated, but it is important to stay calm, respectful and patient with all customers. It feels good knowing you satisfied a customer, and knowing that they will come back because they were provided good service."
good,"Empresa agradavel de trabalhar embora não segue a politica na qual vem da matriz q é nos USA. No Brasil é muito diferente no qual os gerente são promovidos por tempo de serviço e não por qualificação profissional."
good,"The job itself was enjoyable, they ran me around a bit and I was doing a ton in multiple departments but otherwise it was fine.I quit because of the general job culture,it was just a giant high school lunch room with some of the associates and managers.Very unprofessional at times and filled with unnecessary drama. Other than that I really loved my actual job, though I tried to transfer to another department and the manager didn't even consider me. I would work there again if certain people left that particular location."
good,"Their willingness to not only allow you to learn new software, techniques and languages, but they are willing to teach you these skills is what I find most appealing."
good,Nice fellow coworkers. A typical retail work environment. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all aspects of customer service. Difficult to share ideas with a large corporation.
good,"Needs to hire more people, Im tired of having to cover for others that are not there and having to do a job that Im not getting paid for."
good,"WalMart is a good place to work. The demands and projects set before you to complete are explained, demonstrated and you are assisted with the work. The hours are difficult and non-negotiable. Advancements are difficult but does happen.  Hard work is the name of the game at WalMart...period, and that should be expected going in.  Management is pulled to and fro but they too gain a world of retail experience not found at lesser managed retail chains."
good,"Helping customers finding items they are looking for"
good,The management at Walmart needs to listen to their employees more and work better with them.there is a sever lack of proper communication
good,"Direction to 5 department manager, schedules, attending to customers needs and wants, stock rotation, stock taking. Attending the Walmart school for manager was a great learning experience."
good,how to work as a team and understand costumers are always first and right no matter what no costumers no jobs is the bottom line
good,"Low pay"
good,"Receiver of overnight product, "
good,"A typical day at Walmart is regularly a 7-11pm shift a few times a week. Unfortunately, I enjoy longer days and more hours as I need to pay for school. I learned a lot of basic communication skills, money handling, money laundering, WHIMS, and health and safety. Sadly, I believe management should be more strict in not only getting the job done but to have it done properly. I feel they do not put their full efforts forward. The hardest part of my job is just the constant 7-11pm shifts, I enjoy long shifts and being busy all day. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of my job is the people. I connect in some way with almost everyone in Walmart. I enjoy the inside Walmart jokes, the friendships and smiles from customers, telling you, you did a job well done."
good,Working at Walmart has increased my customer service skills drastically. I've learned how to control the the flow of the work day. The management team helped me become a better peoples person and they taught me how to never let the customer steer the outcome of my mood for the day.
good,"A typical night for me at Walmart consists of clocking in, receiving any job assignments and working steadily throughout the evening.  Though management and staff do tend to turn over a lot, I have learned that I am able to persevere.  The hardest part about the job is staying awake overnight but the benefits out weigh the bad."
good,"Always had something to do, most managers were very understanding but some expected you to know things when not being trained to do so. i was not properly trained and was expected to do things i had no idea how to properly do. hopefully they will start training their associates better in the future."
good,"Started working at Walmart when I was 17, I loved it. The customers and friendly associates made the environment good. Management wasn't so good, they have an ""open door policy"" but it doesn't really help at all."
good,"It's not what you know, it's who you know. If you know someone in management you're golden, otherwise you're not gonna really thrive."
good,"As a cashier I inter-acted with customers and that was fun, the people who worked there were fun to work with, the hardest part of the job was being on my feet all day."
good,worked here for a while good place to work employees was friendly and helpful management needed major work with communication skills
good,It was definitely fun and challenging working here but at the same time because it was a competitive job you were always at risk of termination.
good,"This was interesting. I liked my manager he was very attentive. Clean environment. Organization with schedules were on point, always."
good,A typical day at Wal-mart was very enjoyable dealing with customers. Helping them get through their day and learning how to stay productive and efficient in a busy organization. Management at Wal-Mart does so much running around and helping every employee and customer making it a much easier on everyone else. They are out there just like everyone else trying to interact and help out the customers.
good,"This is a fun environment. Co-workers are like family. Pay is not great at all, neither are the raises. But for a second job I'd recommend."
good,I would ring up customers products and I would take money and give change. when the customer service desk needed help I would help customers solve problems and return unwanted items.
good,"I have worked all over the store for Wal-Mart. I have had great days and horrible days. I worked at eight different locations and held seven different positions through promotions over twelve years. Everything is regulated like the government. It is private business but over the years as it continued to grow it regulated everything at the store level. When I started you could be creative with merchandising and when you went to lunch, how your back room was organized. My first store was a 100 million dollar store so we had a lot of talent. Unfortuantely some stores underperformed and as a public company strategies were devised to reign in control to the corporate level. For example I worked at one store for six years that was on the poorer side of town. Each month we advertised merchandise known as TAB. Some months once, some months two or three times depending on the season. Each store was allocated a certain amount of each product based on past sales, store trait, and negotiation with supplier on product. The issue with this is we would recieve high end appliances or linens with customers that had no interest of purchasing them. Then the merchandise takes up space. Then you have to wait for markdowns which the store manager had to budget for the entire 200000sq ft store each month. Result shelf space on feature ends was wasted for products that nobody wanted and backed up quality features that sat in the backroom. When you take away 95% of the control away from people at the store level you lose valuable insight because they see whats happening on a daily basis for that particular"
good,Every day was different. You'll have days to where it wasn't so busy to days where the lines are super long but not enough registers were open. My co-workers were great! The hardest part I would say is you have to be fast and patient.
good,easy to work for and busy all the time.good hrs. cold in refigerators and good emloyees. easy to learn task. good benefits
good,Working here was a great experience. I was able to meet many new colleagues and friends. It was a great place to improve on customer service skills.
good,I wasn't at Walmart long but I had fun working there. The other cashiers made sure I knew everything . They took care of me like family.
good,"Everyone pretty much worked together. Majority of the time you were by yourself in a area, it allowed for your own personal structure for getting things done really worked."
good,"It's a good place to work.  The company is focused on it's hourly associates.  Salary positions have gone downhill though.  More hours, worse hours and no compensation.  8 weekends off a year is no where near enough.  It's my only complaint, the schedule for salary managers."
good,"I worked in multiple stores. In bigger cities, the store doesn't pay as much, but in smaller cities, the store is the place to be!"
good,It was an ok place to work. Entry level job. Not really room for advancement. Heavy retail environment. Never enough coverage.
good,"Wal-Mart is very flexible when it comes to scheduling your hours around your school hours, unless you have a position with a set schedule such as a department manager.  Management wise, it kind of sucks because they lack communication.  Sometimes you get so overwhelmed with work because you have three or four managers asking you to get three or four jobs done in a given time frame.  Sometimes I feel that the pay isn't worth the physical labor.  (I worked IMS and as a receiver.)"
good,Overall folks who work there are Brain dead!! a few Go-Getters Bust their tail to get the Job done and keep freight on the shelves. But most are there for a check for doing nothing/
good,Currently employed.. Loved to be challenged in a fast paced environment like walmart. I am very  well at multi tasking in basically any work environment.
good,"Work was hectic at all times, though I learned how to handle such a hectic envoirnment and how to manage working in a setting like that. I loved the co-workers that I worked with, though the hardest part of my job was the drama inside the store. I try to stay away from drama and try not to feed into it. I would just stick to my job and keep to myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customers needs."
good,It was hard working 11 to 8 almost every day as a single Mom and never getting to spend time with my Daughter or spend time on Photography.
good,Some stores are not run right and are hard to change the culture new stores and Neighborhood markets are good. You can move up quick and salaries are better than any other retail if you bonus
good,"very productive, learned about team spirit, management was great about meeting needs, co workers weren't so productive, staying busy, enjoyable part was interacting with customers and kids always seeing there smiles."
good,Just help customer service with looking for items and finish the night with no worry. Work well with my co-worker keep busy with no or little talking. None at this time. getting to know the customer and co-worker who make the day go by fast.
good,okay company to many employees to address one single person  pay wasnts good enough management was not good  great benefits though
good,Walmart provided me with advancement and security i have never had at any other job. The environment is very fast paced and always exciting
good,"it was very family structured at the first  but after a new ceo took over a lot of core standards went away,then things changed"
good,"it is hard work,the people there are great,very helpful.you work four tens so usually weekends off.the hardest part is getting up early for 5;00 am start..management is lacking though-they are just concerned about numbers not the workers.healthcare is horrible-"
good,"The managers were all really nice and made the job better, but hours weren't guaranteed and the night shift was killing me."
good,"I managed three teams of developers with two managers and 12 associates reporting directly to me.  I handled multiple projects at a time ensuring they were on-track, on-time, and within the budget.  I would handle project conflicts and help guide my managers and associates daily.  The best part of my job was helping my team grow and achieve results."
good,"As far as my job here goes, I appreciate and like most of my average everyday customers but the management varies and I really think they may be part of the problem I have with this company. To many people have a title and they take it to the head when they started at the same place in the company as I was at and now with a little power everything changed. It's sad to see and terrible to deal with."
good,"helping customers,leaarning how to solve new problems an working at a faster pace everyday,management isnt bad they do take in your ides an concerns.my coworkers are pretty good we work togather as a team.i wouldn't say there's a hardest part,working at walmart theres always a challenge.to me the most enjoyables is meeting great customers an seeing some some of my usual customers ."
good,"I worked as a Pharmacy Technician and I loved my job. We have a certain amount of leeway working behind the scenes than does the regular employee. Though, inside the pharmacy there isn't really any room for advancement, you can go into the main store and advance there. It really is sad that Wal-Mart doesn't treat their employees as if they matter any more. They took away any perks/bonuses that made a person really strive to do a good job."
good,"The best thing about this job is getting to know your customers. The worst thing is the slow to advance. I learned that no matter how hard you try, you can always be replaced. The other workers were wonderful."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work over all. Some of the issues that I am currently having is my mother had a heart attack and they are giving the run around. My co workers pretty well stick to themselves. If you are not in there group they wont talk to u. The management has there favorites,"
good,"A typical day would consist of me getting my proper uniform and vest on. I would then clock in and ask what work was needed to be completed that day. I would be given a list of things to be done as well as directions to what to do and how to do them. Most of my training covered all work positions. Daily, I worked with my customer service skills to go above and beyond giving customers the best experience possible. I would receive two breaks and one lunch depending on the amount of hours I worked that day."
good,Working for Walmart.com was very fasted paced. Always many task to perform and complete. As a QA Associate I worked with all other departments in the Building to insure the highest quality standards for customers orders as well as ensuring the integrity of the inventory. I also trained new hires on QA procedures and policies.
good,Walmart was an ok place to work. management wasn't always there when needed but luckily the job was easy. in need of more cashiers
good,"Years ago it was a different place to work, most people were happy with the job they had inside the company. I enjoyed my coworkers and could take a few minutes to swap jokes or say hi to someone you haven't seen in awhile, without getting yelled at or having the job threatened. Now, not so much."
good,"Being able to be out on the floor, completing my work duties, and helping the customers was the highlight of my day.  I would rather talk, help, and listen to the customers (regular or new) than be in the backroom.  It was important to get my job done in the back so I could be available for the customers."
good,I love the people I got to work with I also learned a lot about management and how to help customers enjoy a friendly and efficient shopping experience.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work, but my managers were poor in Fairview,Tn. I would consider working at a new Walmart. I would work 6 hours or more every shift."
good,"Provided excellent customer services, dealt with complaints and solved problems by following company procedures and policy."
good,I loved working for Walmart. It was fun to work with everyone and get to know the customer... if you're not a people person this is NOT for you at all. If you want to be a manager at Walmart you better get hired as one you have a low chance of being promoted
good,"Days flew by at work, as the store is always busy. Time flew by though, which the endless list of to-do's ever longer. There were never enough hours of the day to complete everything, however I leaned a lot working there. I learned both from management and from interacting with the employees."
good,I am a sales associate in the Connection Center. Its a fun workplace. I enjoy the customers that come in and the ones that I've built a relationship with.
good,"8 hour work days, taking prescriptions, counting pills, bagging prescriptions, cashier work, answering the phone, and any duties a pharmacy tech is responsible for."
good,I was a cashier so a typical day would consist of checking customers out. I would need to make sure my area was clean and also my surroundings. I learned on how to be more efficient. My co-workers were alright didn't talk too much but got along and was a professional environment. The hardest part of the job was when I would get off at 12 and had to go back to work at 6 or 7. The most enjoyable part was that I was able to have time to go to school and spend time with my child.
good,My day would consist of preparing my work area for the day.  Keeping my area clean while checking out my customers purchases.  Making sure all shelves were fronted and stocked.  and being accountable for all monies in my register.
good,"An ever-changing work day, multi-tasking and detail oriented work. Opportunities to change position(s). I learned Management skills, electronic systems used within the company, and met great customers."
good,"The first Wal-Mart i worked at i loved it. Management was amazing and always helpful. Everyone worked as a team and helped each other whenever possible. The hardest part was trying to meet our times because we had so much freight on the floors (Worked midnights) but over all an amazing store( Colorado). Management was amazing at this store, very helpful and open to new ideas. My second store wasn't so great as the first one. Managers were rude and refused to help anyone. The employees were always in a bad mood cuz they hated working there. i had the worst experience at this store especially when i became pregnant and had morning sickness. The managers were always yelling at me when i would get sick but i couldn't help it i was pregnant and then for them to tell me i was faking being pregnant when i had the papers from my doctor stating i was pregnant made the situation worse. I would definitely recommend the store Colorado to work at but not the one in Pennsylvania."
good,Walmart Overall is not a bad place to work it just wasn't my favorite place to work. I was always stressed out and tired while working there. There was lack of communication between different departments and the managers lack of knowledge on all the departments made things a little frustrating when they have managers switching areas every so months. Also every once in a while there would be issues with being short on staff in one department to where others from a different department are working in a different one for there shift and some unsure on how to do that specific job. The only thing that really made me get through it was the fact that I made some good friends while working there and they really helped me stay motivated on getting the job done.
good,"- Managing both in store and e-commerce assortment and overall sales"
good,"I loved my job at Walmart, but what I DID NOT like was the fact that no one was ever on the same page. Also, the wages weren't livable realistically. Also when I became pregnant, I was in and out of the hospital because I had a very complicated pregnancy, instead of them working with me and giving me time off as I asked, they fired me."
good,"The employees are nice and good to work with. Hours are somewhat flexible, the only thing that needed to change was the pay. Now that the starting pay is higher, people might actually keep working"
good,"Unlike Walmart U.S. Continental , Walmart International has a tendency to underestimate their employees capabilities and focus more on presentation (dress code). Really how do you expect an employee to do their job if the dress code is casual to former and the work that is expected of the employees is nitty gritty. "
good,"very flexible with school and work, room to advance in company, works off of productivity and very fast pace environment"
good,"Each work day, I would either work as a cashier or I would work as an overnight stocker. I also assisted customers in locating the merchandise they wished to purchase."
good,"Como empresa otorga estabilidad laboral y es un buen piso, sobre todo para quienes optamos en su momento a trabajar en el Retail para compatibilizar los estudios, aunque no en todas las areas se recibe la misma renta, dado que perteneci al area de cajas me sentia comoda con la remuneración."
good,This was an awesome place to work and they really worked with your schedule. Being that I was in beauty school it was very close to the location. I learned that when you are in management you cannot mix business with pleasure. if you befriend or seem like you are you employees friends things become harder never mix business with pleasure. I would say the hardest part of my job was pleasing everyone all the time..
good,"Walmart has great advancement opportunities.  I moved from a assistant manager up to store manager in less than 4 years."
good,I love working for wal-mart. I just think they need better mangement. Working at wal-mart taught me nothing new. The hardest part of working for wal-mart was the mangement and the most enjoyable part was seeing the customers happy.
good,"Walmart is fast paced with lots of opportunities to engage in customer relations. Management keeps everyone busy and often pushes its employees. My coworkers often are upbeat and resilient to sometimes high demands. The difficulty to gain benefits are most difficult to deal with but, the close knit employee family is very enjoyable."
good,"nice place to work, maintained the appearance of the products in the women's department for the public to enjoy. I really enjoyed when I was placed in the home line department"
good,"Indoor temperature controlled environment, polite coworkers, padded mats for standing, clean good breaks. you stock cake counter and ice cream cake freezer with premade cakes, you then take precooked and shipped in cakes cover with icing using shipped in buttercream or whipped icing, same with cupcakes, then your decorate them with cake kits, airbrush, edible images,sprinkles, ribbons or decorative toy rings. box them, label them and fill display case by flavor. you also take cake orders and decorate some custom cakes put in cooler till picked up. write wording on cakes for customers. wash,rinse and sterilize all  decorating tips, knifes, spoons, wash and mop  cake area. restock bakery freezer with incoming cake related freight."
good,"Can be a experience for the person that has not worked retail."
good,This store has better management than most in my experience.  It at least gave a solid feel for coming into work every day and not extreme excitement to leave at the end.
good,My time there was a great experience. A typical day at work was never the same always a new experience. Using my skills and knowledge to serve the customers was great. The management changed each year but each co-worker was able to adapt. The co-workers were the best.
good,"Time went fast while working, everyone worked well together, the  hardest part of the job was the rude customers,i liked the stability of the job, knowing that i had stable hours and a set hourly rate."
good,great company to work for like i said was fast paced always bust and custmer service is very important to the company.has its own challanges but everyone is willing to help everyone when needed
good,"Customers are very hard to deal with, management is terrible, best thing about it is going home. I learned how to deal with customers and how to use a cash register."
good,"Walmart"
good,"Walmart es una empresa que permite desarrollar habilidades y tener un crecimiento en medida que nosotros desafiemos nuestros propios límites, en lo personal adquirí muchos conocimientos en la parte técnica, pero en calidad humana aprendí mucho más."
good,"AM stocking as well as stocking food through out the day."
good,The work day goes by smoothly usually. I learned how to stock and restock merchandise from the back room. The management were ok. Most of my co-workers were polite and honest. The hardest part of the job was keeping everyone on the same page. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
good,"AS the IMS associate I was responsible for inventory accuracy of the in store inventory."
good,"mi día típico en el trabajo fue: una mañana al llegar a la tienda y ver "
good,"Bad for lower employees and most people that work there. Very few holidays,very few breaks long hours. Good for shopping poor place for humans to work."
good,"Malheureusement nous sommes tres peu payer pour tout le travaille que nous avons affaire,ses tres malheureux car ses une tres bonne compagnier avec de belle valeur!Mes pour l'avenir de mes filles je dois me trouver quelle que chose de plus payant!"
good,strive for excellence by providing the best shopping experience for the customer show respect for the individual by respecting my co worker.
good,"After busy times they basically stop scheduling you. I tried to transfer to a Walmart closer to my home because i took the bus and was told that i should walk the 2 hours to get to work, others do it."
good,"Its a mixed bag. "
good,"Typical day at work consisted of showing up at various schedules and getting straight to performing my duties as a cashier. After awhile of that I was noticed and given the position as a Customer Service Manager until I left the company. "
good,"i learned how to work in different departments and every department was different in which i had to adapt to the team and get everything stocked in a time manner before the store was open for the public. "
good,There was too much emphasis on selling additional services to customer when there was customer contact which was unnecessary
good,It was a cool place to work however the work load that was expected of an single individual was almost impossible to complete I the time allotted
good,"the place was a good place to work for i came in did what i need to do to get the job done, accurately, safely. i was in charge some nights told people what there jobs will be for the night."
good,"Nous rentrions le matin et nous placions les commandes , par la suite nous fessions du service à la clientèle et on effectuait les services sur leurs véhicules tel que demander par celui-ci. Nos journée étaient similaires sauf dans les temps de transition entre l'hiver a l'été ou vise versa."
good,"Had good hours, the associates were friendly, and the job was fun and easy to do made it worth going to and made me want to get more hours."
good,Loved my job loved my customers! Got fired for taking home food from deli that was being throwed away anyways. Home was in my car in my walmart parking lot. Couldnt get food stamps. Gov claimed i made too much. Didnt want to starve. All managers knew my living conditions but still let me go. Other guy accused of stealing still works there.???!!??!!!
good,"Under staff private business, that has a high turnover rate with management as well as caregivers. The hardest part comes to the office employees managing under staffed cases. Although providing care for those in need is most rewarding."
good,"very fast paced"
good,"Management is a huge issue here, but the individual non-management workers are great people and hard workers. Store was understaffed, despite managements position on topic. Loved the job I had but only left to pursue a great opportunity."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was a good experience. The team I worked with gossiped a lot, and had a lot of issues with pay and management. I was a maintenance tech there and got paid less than everyone else. I did everyone else's job though. I cleaned, ran a register, restocked and faced shelves, and I sometimes even did resets of whole shelves."
good,"I learned the food service how to temp, sanitation, and rotating product."
good,employees are very caring and well organized. get to learned all department in Walmart. experience all different types of customers.
good,Working at the neighborhood market was fun and the management was well trained it was easy to move up the ladder. with a smaller work crew everyone knew everyone and we worked as a team.
good,I loved my co-workers and enjoyed completing the tasks with my co-workers that was assigned by management. Communication was good learned alot about sales and products. the hardest part was that it was overnight.
good,"I would clock in and make sure the  bay was clean and fully stocked with everything needed. Tires, oil filters ,wipers, oil. And then begin greeting the customers. The co-workers was always good to work with. Always worked together as a team rather than against each other. Managers was good and understandable if an emergency had occurred and had to leave quickly. The hardest part for me would have to be the heavy lifting of tires. 17in tires and bigger was always hard. I enjoyed the people and being able to work inside and outside all at the same time. It was a steady moving job which it was I like."
good,"Money was great. Great place to meet all types of people,  management a little hard to work with. but most of all love to go to work..."
good,I enjoyed working there altho labor to wage ratio was extremely off
good,I liked working there because I like working with people. It was very busy and the people I work with were very nice. WE just did not make enough money. The work is very hard because it stays busy all the time.
good,"Great people, great work. Locating all your in-house talent in Bentonville, AR is soul-sucking."
good,"I get to help my customers and make memories for them during the most special times of their lives. I enjoy the client relationship aspect of this job and get to interact with people on a one on one basis throughout the day during their appointments."
good,I was not happy at this store as I was not in the department I was supposed to be. My co-workers were nice. I just didn't feel as good as the previous store.
good,Loved meeting the customers and helping them. Was able to work part of my 10 year in the cell phone department and really enjoyed that. Then I moved to Cheyenne Wyo. and I was put overnights didn't care for that shift.
good,"Friendly coworkers, rude management. Even time at work and off work to enjoy life. Not enough registers open so got way too busy and stuck feeling. Was not completely taught how to run register so got yelled at by front line manager. I did enjoy seeing several nice and returning customers. Made friends of coworkers."
good,"I would work five nights a week from 11pm-7am in the health and beauty department. We would get white boxes called break boxes that had lots of different singular items;(mascara, a hair brush, a bottle of shampoo, etc.) I would sort those items into the aisles they belonged to then stock them. Following this there would be many cardboard boxes full of 4-8 items;(4 bottles of shampoo, 6 razors, etc.) I would put the boxes into the aisle they belonged in then go threw the aisles stocking the items. If the items could not be stocked I would have to bring them back to the backroom. Lastly, I would have to face all the items in my department to make it look clean and put together. I loved this job, the time flew by and it was basically a workout. Unfortunately three months into the job too much product started to come in for one person to stock and I was unable to eat during my breaks due to running around so much while I was working. Then I had to start staying till 8am just to finish stocking. It took a toll on my health and I had to leave."
good,The Wal-Mart store is  a Great Place to shop. It has a lot of customers and employees that are always changing throughout the years that its been open.
good,Walmart is a huge company and with that comes working all shifts including overnights. To have a family and have a normal work life just doesnt happen when working in retail especially walmart.
good,"As minimum wage jobs go, it doesn't get much better than Walmart, professional management with lots of employee benefits, as long as you work hard, you can expect to do well."
good,"Good company to work for, but now it is more profit driven than people driven."
good,"A typical day at work is standing in the same spot, ringing up customers. Its nice to met new people and challenge your self rude customers. I learned to control my attitude and kill people with kindness. My co-workers as awesome at times. The management is somewhat good managers. The hardest part of my job is nothing honestly. The most enjoyable part is meeting different people and getting to know customers."
good,"Productive "
good,"My co-workers, for the most part, are friendly, helpful, and encouraging. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the difficult customers and having to make decisions that disappoint of upset customers. Talking with my customers and co-workers, helping them is the best part of the job for me. I love to be able to help someone, even just helping them put their groceries in the cart."
good,"At Walmart, any given day you can be asked to clock in early even after you tell them that you need to eat or do something of importance. There have been several times that I was asked to clock in before my time and had to beg for my break because I was hungry to the point that I started to feel sick."
good,"A typical day would be clocking in and checking your tasks. Working in electronics has taught me so much about phones, TVs, batteries, cameras, and etc...Fortunately for me, the management team hardly gives me a hard time although some are rude and belittle their associates. Co-workers are pretty good and easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job may be helping customers while trying to complete all tasks. The best part of the job honestly is helping people find what they need although it can be stressful from time to time."
good,"I was only a seasonal employee, but it seemed like a good place to work."
good,"The employees are great, mostly, and the staff works with your schedule. Sometimes it's hard to deal with customers who hate the place, but shop there anyway."
good,"e um empresa boa de se trabalhar agradavel amigos"
good,I enjoyed the learning experience became a team leader enjoyed the work enviroment was able to gain valuable experience working in the optical department acquired skills i still use today.  Became more patient since i was working in a field were i interacted with different individuals everyday.
good,This was more or less a job during school. Paid any bills and placed some money in my pocket. More of a learning experience and made some connections which helped down the road with Pepsi.
good,A enjoyable place and company to work for.Opportunities to learn new and different jobs.
good,"Working nights at walmart made it easier to complete college assignments. I had most of my day time free and made a very decent wage for working late. The hours were good and schedule flexible, but I wouldn't recommend making a career out of this job. It's good money for college students but anyone working at walmart should strive to achieve more in life."
good,"The management and fellow employees are great to work with! We all have our ups and downs good days and bad. But I try to have a positive outlook and spread the cheer by being that Helpful employee who wears those crazy hats around the holidays. I know that the employees enjoy them and it boosts moral in our store. The customers also enjoy it especially the families with small children."
good,"I worked here for just over a year. I liked it and I made a several friends. A typical day at work I would scan my badge to find out where I was suppose to go first. Depending on the time of day that my shift started would depend on who I was re-leaving, it may have been for a break or a lunch, and the same would happen when it was time for my breaks or lunch."
good,"cashier, unloader, automotive. my co workers were very helpful the most part i enjoyed about the job was the laughther"
good,"Every day was busy. We learned new skills often, management was helpful. The co-workers were amazing. every one got along very well. The hardest part of the job was training new customers, as they would get frustrated easy. I loved working with customers"
good,Walmart was a place of employement where you can meet alot of people
good,I like working here love to work around people. There was always overtime offer here.
good,Being a cashier i am able to interact with customers on a day to day bases. each customer has special needs and request.
good,"	Completed all night time baking and packaging"
good,"Constantly moving, and don't have a problem finding something to do."
good,"qualquer experiência pra mim é válida, aprendi a lidar com pessoas totalmente diferentes, sair mais por motivos de horários, e a distância mas valeu muito a pena gosto de novos desafios e esse foi um que amei e muito importante na minha vida pois foi meu primeiro emprego registrada"
good,It was a okay place to more for a little while nothing to make a career out of.
good,"Most the people that work there are late aged people and teens just out of high school. The only thing that made the job unbearable was the grapevine, where rumors and gossip spread like wild fire. Although you may get along with them they will try to demoralize you by talking behind your back and there are ststero-typical groups there."
good,"Depending on what shift a persons works plays a major part in the balance of work and life. Does have good benefits if you work full time and can purchase stock in company upon first day of employment. Hard to get a full time position and most employees are only given part time hours. A typical night of a stocker consisted of going to assigned area, opening boxes, putting product on shelves. Assisting customers when needed. Did learn to drive a forklift, operate a walker stacker the first time I worked for wal mart. Most of the time coworkers would help when a persons freight task was overly large. The hardest part of the job was throwing freight  that was two persons lifts with out help such as furniture. Seeing the end result of the job."
good,enjoyed working with the public and helping people find products
good,there ok the work was good the people were good team work is encouraged thinking was allowed
good,"Need to generate orders for Produce and Meat,Dairy though market visit although the Business Development Associates are available, the Assistant Manager is held responsible for generation of Sales ulimately."
good,"Co-workers help the day breeze by as long as you show respect, it will be returned."
good,"In beginning of shift we are to organize the department to make clothes look nice and all signs and clothes racks are straightened. After I am done, I scan my baby food wall and either order or replenish goods as needed. Once I am done I create picks for the merchandise I need from the back of the store to replenish shelves that the store has in inventory. I also scan my outs which are counters that are empty and make sure there is none in the store and order if necessary. Process merchandise that arrived off of truck. Replenish diapers and organize the wall as it should be for example right size and brand by the upc bar codes and how the modular is set according to store. Then its cleaning up the department again and putting returns away. Occasionally when the need arises department managers set in on interviews for those who are seeking employment and depending where that person is applying for they will sit in the interview process as well as ask questions that may be needed at the time of interview."
good,"Typical day:"
good,Nice Place to be at. Love the work but hard to work with the hours.
good,"I began as a cashier but in 4 months time i was a stocker a csm etc. but was only being paid for cashier and it wasn't fair,i felt i was being used but overall a good company but get prepared to be taken advantaged of."
good,Everyday I came in we would start unloading the trucks we were to receive that day what I enjoyed about the job is how we all worked as a team and got the job done in a timely manner.
good,"Acredito que obtive muitos conhecimentos na última empresa que trabalhei. Lá, por se meu primeiro emprego, aprendi a ter minhas primeiras responsabilidades como profissional, conheci bem o modelo de gestão e sei que isso vai me ajudar em qualquer lugar que eu esteja. Fiz amigos, com os quais eu me dou bem até hoje, mas sabíamos respeitar bem o nosso ambiente de trabalho. Tive dificuldades para impor as regras e normas da empresa aos colaboradores, pois muitos se recusavam a segui-las, por outro lado, tinha um bom relacionamento com os clientes e isso facilitava o bom andamento dos processos."
good,the hardest part of the job was pulling out backstock and pulling pallets.
good,My day at work consist of Labeling and Placing Merchandise on to conveyer line. I learned how to function in a heated environment with a daily percentage of 100% to be met. My management team were well trained coworkers are the best part especially when we pull together as a team. The hardest part of my job was Lifting antifreeze and Motor Oil to place on conveyer line. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my team and making sure that I completed my daily task at a reasonable time.
good,I personally enjoyed my co workers and loved helping customers
good,"While the walmart environment was a great spot for a student or part time employee, i cannot in good faith reccoment this company to any person that wants a long term place of work. the company tries to entice its employees, and offer them promises of advancement and opportunity. this is not the case, the store has a ceiling, and only a select few manage to breach it. associates are hired on as part timers, and given full time hours, only to be cut back every 9 weeks, to avoid giving them part time. "
good,"I would arrive to work on overnights and head up to the frint end after clocking in. As a cashier I was responsible for making sure the front end was neat, I would go threw the unwanted merchandise and sort them out the take them out to the floor. I would on occasion stock shelves while working the register. I learned how to be efficiant and accurate, developed good communication skills. Management was professional. Co-workers were fun, they were helpful. The hardest part was running back and forth between the floor and register. The enjoybale part was lunch was always close by considering the fact they sell food."

good,"I stated out as an initial cashier and eventually ended being a customer service rep, check cashier, bill payer, money gram operator as well as a store returns associate."
good,"New management, new dictatorship is really the only fault here. Everyone was a blast to work with."
good,working at walmart was a great experience and was very enjoyable but at times very confusing
good,"Nice place to work, co workers are great and fun, enjoyed making the customers happy."
good,A ypical day of word consits of unloading freigt and downstacking pallets for distribution on a timed task system.Co workers are easiy to get along with and are wiling to work the buddy system.Management is what they are managers.The hardest part of the job is downstacking pallets.The most enjoyable part is getting finishned at a reasonable time.
good,"I was the operation manager , hiring ,firing and coaching employees for improvement . Counted deposits, gave out loans to registers and money center, Counter change orders. Scheduling and supervising over 200 people. Provided customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job was work with people ."
good,If you did your work you can stay if not the turn over was very high. There was always something to do. Most of the time i worked in almost every area in Wal-Mart besides grocery.
good,"Customer Service: returns, money orders, purchase orders, answer phones. "
good,greet customers and fellow associates clock in and go to work.while working at walmart i learned to have even more patients.Management could be better. Appreciated the associates i worked with gotten to know.i hardest part of the job was overall condition of positions.And the most enjoyable part of that was the hour long break
good,buen ambiente de trabajo con algunas preciones. solo que no me dejaron seguir estudiando al quitarme el dia sabado de descanso el cual ocupo para la carrera de derecho
good,"Pretty decent place to work, no advancement. They understand when you have to leave for the sake of your children. The pay is horrible for what all you have to do,"
good,overall a fun place to work and meet new people and learn new things
good,"When entering Walmart, I felt everyday was a good day, customers were nice & patient. I love helping customers with whatever it is they needed help with in the store. I've learned that being respectful, kind , and helpful makes the customers happy. Management was hardworking, My co-workers were respectful, kind, and hardworking. The hardest part of the job is when a customer is not happy and as an employee your job is to try to make customers have a happy shopping experience. I enjoyed helping the customers, making sure customers have a happy shopping experience at walmart."
good,"Every day is a push to check customers out as fast as possible, dealing with friendly and rude customers alike. You learn to multitask well through talking to the customer, ringing items up, and bagging them all while looking at the customer. Co-workers for the majority are friendly but most management will not show a concern for you unless you suck up to them first. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the rude customers while smiling at them the whole time and agreeing with them even though they are wrong. The most enjoyable part is the fun you have when you get a exceptionally nice customer come through your line and they make it a point to make your day."
good,Working at Wal-Mart the best job I have had so far. I love the interaction with customers and co-workers. I worked in the front end as a people greeter and had a wonderful experience. I also worked as a cashier for a short time.
good,"well I was a cashier so the most of my day was spent at the register and I love meeting different people, I love working customer service my co-workers where fun and management was fun too the hardest part of the day was during rush hour but u always have to have a positive out look.."
good,"this is a great place to work. you stay busy, their is always something to do. you learn team work and major skills, when store first open they had the best management in the world. they believe in fun in the work place. we had water balloon fights, kids modeling event to show off Walmart kids cloths, cook outs. it was awesome. co-workers always had a smile on their face, hardest part of the job was satisfying some customers. after lunch was the best time. everybody seem more happy. but now the management is awful."
good,"A typical day working at Wal-Mart meant assisting customers and keeping a well watered,neat and tidy garden department. I learned a great deal at Wal-Mart as a sales associate. Management was a little on the unorganized side as sometimes they would often forget to assist customers or move in a timely matter for cashiers to complete transactions in a timely matter.My co-workers were often cheerful and friendly and fit the Wal-Mart fashion of helping customers as well as co-workers alike. The hardest part of my job was trying to get other associates and assistant mgr's to go with any new plan for speedier work and trying to get someone to listen to your ideas unless you kissed a lot of bu**  It seemed to me most wanted to work in their own slow pace. I wanted to work fast and be productive during my hours on the clock. The enjoyable parts of my job was seeing the same customers and helping other associates solve problems big and small and teaching basic work ethics which many had little of."
good,"Walmart ,overall, is a good place to work;BUT; lately there are not enough employees to take care of the customers.  They are making their current employees feel overworked and unappreciated.  I like the company but I do not see any chance of things changing in the near future."
good,"co-workers are good to work with."
good,great customer contact   cahier  never get to  do to much  just please and thank you
good,"i was a tire lube express service tech and every day i did oil changes, repaired and replaced tires, replaced batteries, replaced head lights and tail light, and did headlight restorations."
good,"Everyone is welcome"
good,"At Walmart, I mostly worked in the Health & Beauty section. I assisted customers, returned products to their correct place, stocked new product, straightened products on shelves, set mods, and helped keep a clean, safe, orderly and friendly environment. Working at Walmart taught me how to do customer service. The management and co-workers I had were pretty easy going and nice. Working there could get hard sometimes when the customers would be rude and sometimes the hours felt extremely long but it was still a fun place to work and I enjoyed working and learning at Walmart."
good,It is a great company to work for the managment is not all great. worked here for ten years and moved up in the company.
good,"trabajo bajo mucha presión"
good,"it is nice sometimes, it goes the other way. Walmart will always be walmart!."
good,Nice co-workers and good direct management team. Day to day resposibilities are physically demanding but not difficult. The moral of many co-workers could use some work.
good,"Not the most exciting position this business offers that is certain, but I am thankful for the seasonal work!"
good,"A typical day at work was easy. We'd come in and punch in with our badge, then go to the front and find our supervisor for the day and find out what register we were assigned to for the morning. When we get to our register we would check our register to see if we need to fill the register and after brakes and lunch we would switch registers throughout the day. We learned how to process checks and other forms of payment and how to do different transactions on the register. Management was nice. When you needed help or had a question they were always right there to help or answer your question. The co-workers were always nice and helpful when you needed it. The most enjoyable part of the job was just helping people and making new friends while working."
good,Loved working a Walmart the management was great i learned really skills of cashier also to have great customer service.The best part of this job was seeing the customers go home happy.
good,"Always busy and more work than you can imagine. Loved being busy and working hard, loved waiting on customers and the excellent reviews and evaluations I received. Was able to train and grow employees and prepare them for management. Was important to me to continue as an hourly employee, who worked M-F 7-4, every weekend and evening spent with my family. ordered, grew and maintained a department from less than one million in sales to over eight million, and took great pride in my work and appearance of my department. supervised an average of 12 employees at any given time and learned to delegate and train with great results. The favoritism and lack of fair work practices at our store, under new management resulted in intense pressure on me, not by them, but by myself. I had worked with the company for 29 years and knew what it's beliefs and goals were. New manager tried to force people like me into salaried positions, working nights and weekends, and never allowing enough time to keep my area up. Help was given to people who didn't work and help was taken away from those few of us left, who actually worked hard and did an excellent job. An ex security guard was given a co-manager position and had no idea what he was doing. When questioned, he complained and when I got permission from one co- manager to come in early and set a movie release modular, he tried to get me to straighten the grocery, and when I challenged him, he became belligerent. I told him I would go home and come back at 7 for my regular shift, he said I was walking off the job. Although I received unemployment"
good,Its an ok job. The burn out factor is fast and the pay is very low but you get to meet a lot of nice new people everyday.
good,"-new to the company"
good,Working at walmart was a good starter job for me and helped me get through my first year of college. They worked well with my hours and worked around my school schedule.
good,Not a bad place to work very secure but becoming full time is near impossible.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job are the happy customers the ones who treat me with respect and not like I am just a person who has to do as they say. I good attitude will take you a long way with me.
good,"making sandwiches and salads, frying foods, set up the displays, stock shelves, stock freezer and fridge."
good,"Greet customers entering establishments. Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards. Issue receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customers. Count money in cash drawers at the beginning of shifts to ensure that amounts are correct and that there is adequate change. Maintain clean and orderly checkout areas. I learned who to work and deal with other people of different backgrounds and successfully work as a team."
good,managers are all for themselves. they don't know how to talk to or treat their employees.
good,Wal-Mart could have used more workers in the backroom  to keep up with the deadlines of inventory.
good,I really enjoyed working there everything wasnt about me and was about helping the constumers and making sure that I applied good servive and that is what I did.
good,"I loved working with everyone. Everyone worked as a team. If i couldn't find a job, I might go work for the company again if I really need to."
good,"I was a cashier, I enjoy meeting new people everyday, making the customers happy is a A+. Management was poor."
good,"easy going , able to fulfill other duties. smooth job placement for a school kid."
good,"Restocked all food merchandise, disposed of cardboard and trash, collected freights and stacked them outdoors. returned all merchandise to the stock rooms before morning shift began. Difficulty adjusting sleep patterns to overnight shift. I was allowed to play music while working."
good,"One of the good things about the company is that lets you grow up in others area. It have good benefits. It's never boring. We have three communication meetings to get the day started and set priorities for the day. Throughout the day I follow up with notes and projects in my areas of responsibility, and allocate any additional help to finish the tasks for the day. I also handle management calls, follow up on personnel paperwork/training, assess merchandising, follow up with in stock levels, and keep a constant flow of communication between the associates and upper management for up coming and current changes in the store and the company."
good,"Staff changes quickly along with management, but overall i enjoyed the people and fast paced enviroment. On the down side you never get praise for going above and beyond."
good,"Working for Moody Plumbing for 1 year already,working on gas,copper ,pex ,cpvc,ast iron,drainage,jetting ,snaking. Working as a residential and commercial plumber."
good,Great place to start your work history with. Great place to meet new people
good,"I work 12 hours shifts. I clock in at 7 pm at Walmart. I check in on the radio and proceed to the manager office to get my store keys. I check the computer for call in for my shift. I  help my assistant manager assigned tasks for the overnight crew. I proceed to receiving to help the unloader with the trucks. I inturn help the unloaders pull the freight out to the assigned areas.  Ten o'clock i help my assistant manager with the 10 clock crew, telling them which areas they are assigned to. If the crew  are short hand that night.Then i help stock departments and assistant with the call on the radio , that includes let truck drivers in receiving for unloading merchandise or vendor,and assisting  with the cashiers."
good,"Great place for young people to grow in the working world. Trains the younger generation for what has yet to come in their life as they are advancing in life and search for careers. Punctuality, discipline, rewards, teamwork, balance and all other aspects are taught along the journey with this company."
good,A normal day at work involves a lot of interaction with our management team but even more interaction with customers.  At Wal-Mart customers come first and notes come second.  I have learned a whole lot since working at Wal-Mart like the correlation between inventory and sales.  The management team at Wal-Mart were good on giving directions but I believe that improvements could made on helping associates grow within the company.  The hardest part about this job would have to be helping the large amount of customers.  Sometimes it get very hectic in the store and crowd control is essential to making sure all of the customers get taken care of.  The most enjoyable part of the day would have to be working with my team.  I think I am surrounded by a great team that enjoys doing their work and makes work fun and enjoyable to be.
good,"Era um local que exigia muito equilibrio, paciencia. É um lugar que pra vida é uma escola. Onde tu aprende o que é trabalhar de verdade e me mede os teus limites a vencer. Mas pra mim foi bom passar por este local, descobri ate onde posso ir ou nao, me formou profissonal."
good,the company is ran rather poorly due to communication flaws but other than that its the closed minded managers that can make the job difficult.
good,"The hardest part of the job was that there were too many managers. There were about 7 Zone managers, then above them were about 12 Assistant managers and then the store manager. Every one of them had an agenda for you to do and you had to do them in order of status of the manager."
good,"Working in a fast-paced environment in a team with collaborative  efforts. Ensuring that  quality services  are delivered in safe environment."
good,"Very busy like any other retailer, however the staff and management make it a fun and creative place to work."
good,"I began at Wal-Mart as a sales associate in the toy department. I was advanced to cashier after six months.  About a year later, I became a cashier in the pharmacy.  I was a very fast paced job and I enjoyed the customer contact.  The last four years, I was a certified pharmacy technician."
good,Loved my Job. Learned a lot of information on how a store operates. Love co-workers.
good,"Fue mi primer trabajo, mi jefe siempre enseñando lo que sabía, enseñaba de todo el trabajo, había mucha rivalidad entre los compañeros de trabajo y es de esos trabajos donde te ponen a hacer de todo."
good,Wal-Mart can be a very fun job if you are willing to work. If the managers like your work ethic than your day will go by quickly. A typical day at work would be zoneing our area and putting return carts away. This is the worst part of the job but it makes time go by fast when your trying to get your job done. The hardest part of the job is being pulled to different departments or put on another task while trying to finish the first task assigned. The most enjoyable part of this job would have to be being able to help people.
good,Employees are excepted to accomplish much but on very little salary and no full time benefits.
good,walmart is a good place for a starter job but not a career the pay vs living expenses is way out of pa portion
good,"It's walmart!! Although I loved my job due to constantly being busy, it's walmart. You hate us and we hate that we get... told... it all the time."
good,For a typical day it was my responsibility to get together with the leader of my crew and he would assign us a few tasks for the night. three of us would get the duties to cleaning the floor whether it was sweeping scrubbing or buffing we had to work together in sync to get the job done. when i was finished with my job i would either help the others get caught up or make sure that our supplies were in order. the most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
good,It was good experience to work in a Wal-Mart environment as a manager.  Every day brought new challenges!
good,was a  good  place  to  work but owner didnot  pay enough and  no  benifits   so i  had to  leave. but i did do all dutys of a  managers he was  barely there
good,need more management to communicate to staff and other management better. management needs to try and get better staff promoted to make better management not who was working there longer.
good,typical work day was slicing deli meat for the customers. also made party trays. what i learned is the different grades of slicing deli meat.the hardest part of my job was having to fry orders for the customers the party trays also have to change out the fryer food in the hot foods area all at one time. the most enjoyable part was my regular customers. management was not very nice to the customers or employees.
good,"a typical day at this job was ok. I learned about different products, ways to work faster and stay productive. The managers could sometimes be a little cut throat at times. co workers were very friendly."
good,"Was always busy, very little down time due to lack of communication between staff. Was always busy loved my job, but the hours I worked didn't work out due to me being a single parent."
good,Lo que mas me gusto de trabajar en esta empresa fue relacionarme con las personas y aprender a escuchar para poder asi ayudarlos con lo que estaba a mi alcance ;
good,i unloaded trucks in the back of the store and also stocked shelve while the store was starting.
good,"learned customer service"
good,"Coming from a family that deals with businesses on the island,I enjoy working for this company.I learned a lot dealing with customers on how to satisfy and work with complaints."
good,"I would arrive and take stock of cold case salads cheeses and meats"
good,return or exchange items for customers. put up returns and be a cashier if need.
good,"emporesa paga pouco e faz voce trabalha todos domingos"
good,"es un ambiente muy bueno de trabajo,aprendi mucho sobre atencion al cliente, manejo de alimentos y seguridad laboral"
good,"I had worked at Walmart a few times, as most people do when it's not looking good as usual. I enjoy all this company has to offer especially for people in need of a job A.S.A.P. However, I would not recommend working night shift here unless you are single with no children, because they beat you down mentally and phisically. Have a strong will and can take a beating! Do not give 100% because they will expect that and more, but I believe you shouldn't at any job. Employees come and go at Walmart quicker then the interview is over, which may leave you with the brunt of the work. Managers are my main issue with working for Walmart, from my experience they won't hesitate to break you down to fill their quota and don't hold your breath for new hires to help out considering paperwork is not their specialty. As well as people who have frequented over nights do not want to return. You are supposed to move up quickly in the company which may not be the case, especially if you are an over nighter whom they have a tight grip. I can go on..Every Walmart store is different but from my experience, watch out for this Walmart. Peace* :)"
good,"I get to walmart and ask my supervisor what she wants me to do. I do what she says by 11pm she needs us on a registers because second shift lives. at 12am she gives us our first 15 mins break. I come back and either Im putting up returns or zoning. She sometimes gives me my lunch break at 2 or 3 am my lunch is an hour long, When I come back I start zoning whatever she tells me to zone. By 5 am I get my second 15mins break. When I come back we stock candies or put up returns by 6:30 am she needs us at a register because it get full of customers. At 7am I go home."
good,The job was alright.It taught me to move at a fast pace and also how to associate with customers at different levels.Some of my co-workers were polite and helpful and some were rude.The hardest part of the job was trying to work and stock while guest were shopping.
good,"its a great place to learn new things.  Management is productive and coo-workers are absolutely amazing. I find it hard to work in holidays because it always have to adjust personal options specially time adjustment, and I enjoy seeing myself doing my best at work everyday."
good,Enjoyed working with co-workers & customers made my day!!!
good,Wal-Mart isn't a bad place to work overall I'm just looking for a change though to learn more
good,My day would start at 7 am and would end at 4 pm. It mostly consisted of stalking the shelves. I learned that there are all different types of people out there and that we are all just a like but w our own little quirks. My Management team was helpful when I needed to ask them questions. The hardest part of the job I'd have to say is getting all your work done in one day and not being worn out. The part of the job that I enjoyed the most was just meeting and helping all the customers that I could.
good,"They don't pay well and the benefits are not good.  However, they are friendly and the managers are cool as well."
good,love work work on cars and big rigs any rigs  really that pays well and keeps me bissy
good,"fornecem bastante estabilidade, porem e muito trabalho para pouco salario, para ganhar mil reais por mês eu enfrentava uma jornada de dez horas de trabalho diario de segunda a sabado. para poder tirar a diferença fazendo horas extras duas horas por dia."
good,"I learned to stocked shelves quickly and efficiently and unload freight trailers and dairy trailers in a safe manner. The management was okay but it seemed they had a hard time communicating, multiple managers would come up to a different work group that their own and give different instructions that what is provided on the task computer. i mostly enjoyed stocking shelves the most i found it relaxing and i was very quick at it."
good,no comment lack of leadership no struture.employer come go as they work when an miss as many day want.no one saying a thing
good,go clockin go speak to manager about what need to be done if its get on a register or go watch self check stay on my task for 2 hours til my break then go on a 15 minute break come back work til im almost hit my 5th hour go to lunch come back get on a register and work til its time to go home
good,"I worked for Walmart for 8 years and overall it was a very beneficial learning experience for me. However, I've witnessed managers treat their associates absolutely horrible and essentially nothing was done about it."
good,"slice cheese, meat, deep fryer, hot box, temps., customer service. close, clean. go home. I learned that I was faster than most other girls working deli. management was ok. co-workers were friendly, helpful but slow. hardest part was trying to pick up slack for slow girls during lunch and dinner rushes. most enjoyable part was making my customers happy enough to come back again and ask for me to wait on them."
good,"Well this is a typical plastic factory job. It was more of a dead end job with no where to move up in the company. I would take parts off of a conveyor and inspect the parts, pack and label them for shipment. "
good,"Walmart is very friendly with customers, all the workers are treated like family amongst each other. I've learned a lot about customer service and how it takes a lot to deal with different types of personalities. As far as management goes, they are unorganized at times.The co-workers are friendly and everyone treats each other like family. The hardest part of being a cashier at Walmart is trying our best to please customers. At Walmart,the most enjoyable part about working on the front end as a cashier is meeting lots of new people each and everyday."
good,"Dealing with customers, changing clothing set ups, directing associates,"
good,"Handling large amount of money, working with the public and managing over employees."
good,Job is alright but they expect you to be super people.they expect you to do to much with not the right equipment.
good,Okay place to work. Benefits could be better. Upper management definitely needs improvement.
good,"They just consolidated their young managers."
good,fun to work at but management could use an upgrade. job was very simple help customers. long hours but went by quickly
good,"Clean the store, Grab carts out front, garbages. Interesting people to work with"
good,"Walk all areas of store to see what needed to be addressed daily.Staffing in service areas, check call outs, cash office deposits verifited, returns at service desk,backroom freight worked. I learned everything I know from a former manager or from looking up on computers. Work well with management team. My associates are the best part of working always willing to do whatever was asked of them as I aslo worked along with them,not just watching. The only part of a hard day is when we had lots of notes to complete and other members of management sat in office all day and at the end of shift we was rushing to get there notes done. My most enjoyable is the associates I work with and the customers."
good,Some days are slower than others. I have leaned where to locate different items. The communication seems to be lacking. I enjoy working with my co-workers as they help when needed and I do the same. Hardest part is when it is slow and you try to keep busy. Most enjoyable is the connection I have made with some people and learning new things.
good,"i was a deli associate and i loved this job i wished i never quit, the management never bugged you if they knew what you were doing and did it right. i love my co-workers. the hardset part of this job was how much work you would have to do."
good,"Es una empresa que da herramientas para desembolverse libremente en los ambitos laborales y personales , aprendi muchas cosas de indole financiero que me ayudaran a cultivar mi experiencia ,"
good,job was ok but we were always short handed due to they were more concerned with total hours worked rather than having enough people to do the job and there was to many managers and not enough communication between them
good,i learned customer service carts and janitorial while working there i was always willing to help around the store whe others did not want to.
good,Fast working environment where personal time management of duties is need to accomplish work for the day. Ever changing work duties and responsibilities.
good,"Management team is not so good. The shifts are pretty good though, when it comes to hours that you want to work. Co-workers are friendly."
good,"ambiente tranquilo ,equipe muito disposta,a parte mais dificil do trabalho era a carga horaria"
good,"Before I became an overnight stocker I worked as a cashier at Walmart for about three years. In this review I will talk about working as both a cashier and an overnight stocker. Like every job, there are always pros and cons. Walmart offers a steady fast paced job. There is never a dull moment, as most Walmarts, as many are very busy. A typical day as a cashier consists of cashing out customers, helping customers with various questions and concerns, sometimes zoning around your area and customer service and sometimes covering other tasks asked of you, such as break covering for a greater or other cashiers. Overnight stocking is completely different. Stock the shelves with product, change prices and zone (clean up and bring items forward) the area as you go. Regardless of what ever position worked at a Walmart your co-workers are fun loving friendly people. The hardest part of any job would be working quick and effective as a cashier and properly prioritizing your time as a stocker. Everyday is a new adventure, which makes coming to work an enjoyable adventure to be experienced with your co-workers and management."
good,"In this environment I learned to be a leader in the retail industry. I had to think and act quickly to be successful, and often came up with solutions to issues that the answers were not readily available."
good,Wal-Mart overall is a decent company. Always busy and fast-paced. Customer service is key because we are the last employees they see before leaving the store so we want to make sure their experience was as smooth as possible. I really didn't have any problems with my co-workers. I actually got along with all of them quite well including the managers.
good,I found that all of the rumors that Wal-Mart are mainly false.  I had the opportunity to be self-motivated and also work at my own pace.  I found that the management were very understanding and used the open-door policy to be used correctly.
good,"the management is very particular on who they would like to promote which is usually a friend of some sort. It is a very stressful enviorment  all day while working, you feel like your walking on egg shells."
good,Helping other's and difficulty citation when they are trying to buy gifts for love ones for different arrangement reason.
good,You get to meet a lot of good people associates and customers
good,"I loved all my coworkers and my repeat customers, they all made it an enjoyable place to work. The work was not hard, I learned a lot at Walmart especially in customer service. Most CSM's were wondeful. The management was average."
good,"I give them a 7 out of 10 because the day and evening shift always left an overload of unfinished work and they blamed it on night shift and no one tried to resolve the problem, and plus they were constantly cutting hours."
good,"A  typical day is auditing files from previous day, work on new files that come in, follow up on files that have issues, and return missed calls.  Management is great they are not on your back  and as for my co workers  they are great we carry each other's work load and love for one another. The hardest part of the job was dealing iwth rude people, but I managed.  The most enjoyable part of  the job is meeting people the ability to talk to one another."
good,Walmart was a very great company to work for there were many chances for advancement there but I was only there for seasonal but I made the best out of it and got my job done when needed to
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and fast pace. I learn so many things while working in electronics from video games to laptops. The management is very down to earth and are good at helping you out. The co-workers vary, some are hard workers while others could be improved. Hardest part of my job is keeping up with the pace and making sure all of my customers have been helped. I enjoy making sure my customers are satisfied."
good,Over all great team work. Learned a lot about 3rd party billing and insurance. The hardest part was the often (weekly) updates and changes.
good,"Dependiendo del turno que me tocaba en la semana, cada día aprendes algo nuevo sobre todo en el trato de los clientes."
good,"use to work a lot overtime and cooperate with my employer in rush time, good relationship with my jobs partners, available all the time"
good,The company itself is great to work for the downsides come from some of the actual site managers and/or supervisors you work with.
good,"I love being a people's person, Wal-Mart is a place to work where you meet so many diverse people. The Management team listen to all employees opinions and suggestions and make you feel like an important part of the family. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting people and helping taking care of their needs."
good,"* In overall a good day at work "
good,"getting to know your co-workers"
good,I would go in at 10 p.m. and Worked hard. Most enjoyable part of job was having my Boss tell me i did a great job.
good,walmart is a job that is not too taxing. You get out of it as much as   you put into it.
good,"When I was in the stock room, all I'd do for 8 hours was pull the boxes off the truck and sort them out. They'd then be delivered throughout the store in the corresponding departments. "
good,"Now that my kids are raised I can work any shifts and hours. My job here consisted of lifting packages all the time. The weight of those packages ranged from 40 pds. to 100 pds. The job also consisted of alot of organizing, lots of paper work, and fun. It is fun to have team members that work together.The hours were hard to get used to because they were from 10pm to 7am. Great times"
good,A day a Walmart is exciting and fast paced. I have great co-workers and nice managers.
good,Great co-workers that help you learn. Helps build skills in Retail
good,"A regular day is getting your job description as well as additional projects that comes with the knowledge of your job your doing that night and sometimes it can be a little challenging but in the end it, it can be do able."
good,"A good place to work if you don't mind repetitive motions."
good,"As I worked the midnight shift, a typical night at work was enjoyable co-workers, along with team work and supervisors that were a joy to work for. I have worked in this field for a long time the customers are a joy to work for and help. Management was supportive and very easy to work for. My co-workers were absolutely great to work with. The hardest part of the job was being on the midnight shift. The most enjoyable part was the customers and working with the friends that I had made."
good,"I would have loved to have kept my job at Walmart, due to disagreements with management and my co-workers I could no longer stand to work at a place I slowly can to dislike."
good,They require dedication from you but in return they offer you things as well.
good,you clock in go to the front check in with the CSMs they give you a register you go and sign in and check out and assist customers as needed. The only probably with Lexington Rd. in Athens is the CSMs can make life miserable if they feel you are a threat to their position. Will try and stone wall you every opporunity.
good,Enjoy meeting new people daily and excellent co workers. the hardest part of the job is the hours which are at a bare minimal of 4 a day which makes it hard to have a family.
good,"Busy"
good,Well typically i started the day by stocking the floor making sure all isle was stocked properly then i would go around fixing everything that need to be fixed up my co workers werent the best to work with but they were good people
good,"Wal-Mart has shown me better ways to take care of others problems."
good,"The managers at this wal-mart sucks, they treat you very unfairly and will take any opportunity to throw you under the bus. But I loved my customers and the my peers that I worked with."
good,I worked as a Sales Associate. I worked 40/hr week. Some days were better than others. I usually had to work out of the area I was assigned to.
good,"As a courtesy associate, I kept the parking lot clear of cart and kept the bays stocked full. I also would help with any carry outs. My co-workers sometimes would be a pain because of poor work ethics. But all in all a descent job."
good,"I really liked working at Wal-Mart with the exception that they really need to be more family oriented, allowing for flexibility with people who have kids that have appointments, school performances, school sports; allowing to make-up the time or work an extra day.  They need to also work on their issue with scheduling as having to give a months schedule is sometimes difficult especially if something comes up unexpectedly as with most people it does happen."
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers, but my managers where so hard on the employees."
good,"Walmart is a fast paced, work heavy, and highly repetitive environment. It has good values and good management, with a tough customer base. This job requires an abundance of patients and customer service skills. The healthcare benfits for partime workers are terrible but it does have a great stock program. opportunity for advancement is great."
good,"it was a okay place to work, coming in as a cashier with 2 years of exp they still start you pay at the lowest, most of management was nice and honest but some if they dont like you from the moment they met you you will suffer each day. co workers where great for the most part but you do have a few lazy ones that want to do there job."
good,"The first time I worked there was great, but the second time the management didn't communicate with each other well and always put to much of a workload on its employees."
good,"A typical day at my job is handling customer returns, while also offering friendly and knowledge service. Each day I learn something new; while also passing it along to my fellow co-workers. My co-workers are what helps make the day go by without any complications. We all team together and make sure all tasks that are assigned become accomblished. Dealing with certain managers can be the roughest part of the day; but all and all still a great time. My most enjoyable part of the day is taking care of each and every customer with a smile upon my face."
good,"uma empresa em que o dia de trabalho, rende e muito!"
good,"A typical day would be handling money operating cash registers, customer service."
good,"A typical day at work would be exciting and adventuress, making sure everyday learning new things. I've learned to be multitask, fast paste, and prudential. My co-workers were loving, caring, and very helpful when needed. The hardest part of this job was to make sure to keep the doctor happy at all times. Making sure everything was in order at all time, not hard but sometimes intimidating. My most part of the job was the patients and people i worked with, and can't for get the free lunches every month."
good,The hardest part of my job was to work with co-workers who didn't do there part of the job during there shift and having to work twice as hard to get my job done. I learned to do my job no matter what the circumstances where and not worry about my co-workers doing theirs.
good,"I enjoyed my time working there wit the exception of a few things. But overall they are clean, accurate and on time."
good,"Walmart has been a blessing for me and my family. They were willing to give me a chance at something new. Although providing customer service is the one thing i am great at, retail was a new arena for me.They promoted me twice within my frist two years. I went from a cashier to the customer service desk to my current position as Customer Service Supervisor.It felt great because I have extensive experience as a supervisor. They see my potential."
good,management is very hands off and doesn't know what each shift is doing. Insurance sucks.
good,"It was evening shiftwork.  Hours were from 11:00 pm to 7:00 am.  I was responsible for the maintenance of the compactor and cleaned the back storage area.  I also would stock shelves."
good,My work schedule is pretty flexible which has allowed me to achieve and maintain a reasonable work/life balance. I enjoy working with and around other people. I thrive working both as a team and independently.
good,I would work my shifts and go home. The customers were sometimes helpful. If they could nt find anything i would take them directly to were the products were located
good,"learned how to get work done in a timely manner, management could be better, not very good communication"
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart I liked the people I worked with.  I had only one problem, that was with a department manager, whom in my a pinion was very unprofessional.  Other than that I liked the job more than I thought I would when I started."
good,"It was a very productive environment, but it was not a fun place to work. You were not allowed to joke or have fun with other associates."
good,"The ideals at Wal Mart are great. They believe in customer service, friendliness, personable faces and attitude. I was a temporary employee for the holidays. I learned a great deal about prioritizing. The management were good, stern and knew the best way to get things done. However, I do feel management could have listened a little more to their employees. There were times that I felt that employees were brushed off by management, however, things are run smoothly and as needed to keep the store efficient. My co-workers were all hard working, honest and decent people. A joy to work with. My co-workers communicated in order to keep things running smoothly, and that was what helped the most. The most enjoyable part of the job, honestly, for me was helping the customers. Considering it was Holiday season and customers were in a rush to get their shopping done, it was a pleasure being able to get what they were looking for, for them. A typical day at work started off slow, putting away returns, and doing zone work to make sure the area was clean and safe for customers to move through. Then the rush of customers would start just before lunch. Second shift was busy right from lunch on to about just an hour before closing. It was difficult managing responsibilities, opening and closing fitting room doors, locking them, separating returns, repairing damaged goods and reporting damaged products, returning items to their designated areas and answering telephone calls, and working with customers in person at the same time. But it was during this that I learned to organize myself even more,"
good,Typical grocery store atmopshere. Nice place to work.  Other associates were nice to work with.  Supervisors are well trained. Customers were fun to be around.
good,"My day starts at 7am I check to see what freight has been left behind by the overnight crew. Whatever is left behind is then put on the sales floor or sent to the back room. We then straighten up the floor and get ready for the customers."
good,Not a horrible place to work. Waiting of an override can be annoying if your in electronics / photo lab and customers are really rude there.
good,"Scrubbed floors, empty trash, cleaned bathrooms, vacuumed carpets, and cleaned the offices and back rooms, operated trash compactor, and cardboard bailer. Learned more about the retail business. Really did not learn more than I already knew from operating my own business. The hardest part was the retrieving of shopping carts from the parking lot, especially when the cart retriever broke down.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of leaving work with a clean store, an enjoying my work."
good,"I would do anything I was told to complete. "
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart consists of a lot of customers and moving a fast pace. I learned how to operate a cash register, how to lead a group of people. I learned how to manage a group of people, I enjoyed working with co-workers who strive to work just as hard as me to get the job done. "
good,I worked third shift so I did not get to spend a lot of time with my family. 
good,"Overall Wal-Mart is a good place to work, there are daily morning meetings that were very informative, a management staff that cared and was willing to work with you to accomplish the task of the day. They have ever changing policies and I believe this makes it difficult on the employees as well as the customers. Overall I enjoyed working here and the interaction I had with the customers."
good,Working at Walmart is as good or bad as you make it. There is good opportunity for advancement. The pay is really bad. You will have to work there for a lot of years before you make a good paycheck. 
good,"During my time with Walmart I had huge opportunities to advance with the company.  I took all of them.  I was able to learn things that typically I would not have had the opportunity to learn.  I loved working with the Community and Growing the business and relationships between the two.  "
good,"Learned the value of customer service, the day consisted of assisting customers and to provide sales and knowledge of groceries and different meats."
good,Working here is basically making sure the customers are happy. The management isnt always around however; when u need to stop one to talk they may have an open mid. I love the open-door policy It allow you to be heard. The hardest part of the job is running into a rude customer. The best part is making them smile before they leave
good,"A typical day of work consisted of doing answering telephone calls, returns, exchanges, replacements, online ordering, money transferring, money receiving, credit card payments, mortgage payments, cellular payments, etc. I learned how to manage customer's needs and find appropriate answers to the questions and issues at hand. Management was very understanding and easy going, able to be flexible with scheduling and assisted when in need. I enjoyed my co-workers and we all worked very well with one another helping each other to the best of our ability. The hardest part of my job was when customer's would be argumentative. I enjoyed my job to the fullest, I perfected my position, made it into a successful routine and executed each task accurately."
good,Comfortable work enviroment. Learned in and outs of shipping. Hardest part was dealing with some of the other workers. Most enjoyable part was fast pace.  
good,Hardest part of the job was; trying to deal with Co-workers who acted extremely childish and having the managers do nothing.
good,This job is almost always enjoyable! I loved clocking in for work!
good,"It was a very nice place to work. Some of the employees were very yucky, but you just have to learn to deal with them."
good,A good company to work at. happy to give you the time you need as long as you let them know in advance
good,Working for this company is a hard job in its self. The values of the company are higher for the corparate employees than the store employees or the customers.
good,"I loved working here, I just did not like the fact that di not want to work around my school schedule, after they said they would."
good,"unload trucks, take inventory, stock shelves, help customers."
good,"Depended on day, was trained for many positions, could put where they felt. Busy day, usually went by fast."
good,"i would start my shift at 10P.M., usually this is a big shift change where all the cashiers and customer service supervisors would be leaving for the night. so i would have to hurry to the front-end to take over. Once we would get everything under control with the customers, and i have assigned all the cashiers there registers. i would start my nightly goals. this consisted of counting how many return carts where on the front-end and how many cashiers i had to split them evenly. after that i would have to count down the supervisors till to make sure that the money is at the exact amount that is set for us each night. then i would schedule out all the cashiers breaks and lunches based on who was at there registers first. management for the most part let me run the front-end however i wanted to, just as long as there weren't any extra things that needed to be taking care of for the store. i made sure that all of the cashiers that were under me were treated as a team and if that had any concerns they would come to me and ask and i would relate back to the managers if i didn't have an answer. the hardest part of the job usual only came during the first of the month, this is when we would have move customers than usual so sometimes it would be hard to take care of all of our other task because we had to take care of the customers. the most enjoyable part about Walmart was that there were often times where i got a chance to work in other areas beside the front end i like to switch up thing and learn something new."
good,"Too many management levels, employees unsure of job objective for the day."
good,"Generally on a typical day you interact with customers all day, on your feet most of the day as well. The people I work with are very nice including most of the management. Most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people everyday."
good,A normal day at work for me was afast pace inviroment you had to be good at cunting in youe head and quick on my feet. 
good,"Decent place to work.  I work in the morning, must multi task to open the Deli on time. I've learned good time management skills.  My"
good,"I was responsible for keeping track of inventory in the warehouse.  I also kept track of all the recycled waste that left the building.  When merchandise would arrive in receiving, I would take the items off the truck using a forklift and count the items for accuracy."
good,"clock in and check your hub. I would log in all the cell phone serial numbers. we would also log in all the ipods and ipads. do a walk, which is to clean and make sure everything is zoned and pick up go backs. help the customer with there questions and set up cell phone contracts. helped customers in the photo lab to cover breaks. I also helped in hardware and sporting goods while they took breaks. and if and mods or new displays had to be done we did them."
good,"A typical day at work was busy and exciting. I would start work with getting several chores done and helping any early morning shoppers find what they need and suggesting things that go with it. The day would progress into audits and stocking shelves. I learned more of the management and paperwork side of sales at this job. The hardest part was getting backed up on all the things to get done, however I tried to make sure that I didn't leave any work at all possible to my next on shift"
good,"There is always something to do at Wal-Mart in every department. A typical day at work is stocking up the shelves, zoning the department meaning to maintain the area clean and organized and keeping up with the return carriage which are items that customers return."
good,A typical day was come in organize your till and ring up customers until the end of your shift
good,"As a company, Great place to learn and grow. As seen through the eyes of an associate,The work load put on the associates is too heavy. An average 8 hour shift for a Walmart associate is made for 2 to 3 workers. Holding 3 different titles in one basically. Corp.wise, I understand trying to merge departments and to try to keep staff at need be but it is something that needs to be watched with close eye. There is no room to grow in Walmart because the associates have no time to do anything do to the amount of work they have put on them in one days work. Inventory is ordered at a bad rate. If department managers can not find freight that they are looking for, they take it out of the system and quickly order more which brings up an issue with shrinkage and on hands."
good,"typical day at work would include customer service and zoning my area. always being available to help a customer is my job."
good,Management showed favoritism. I always had my breaks late. Co workers were fine they fired me cause I was high risk pregnant and I kept having to go to the hospital cause they kept making me lift heavy stuff. I almost miscarried due to them not caring about my condition they said I had bad attendance .
good,"mis horarios eran de tarde de 16 a 22. mi rutinas de trabajo no eran las mismas todos los dias,  habian dias que estaba en caja, otros dias reponia, asi tambien  estube un tiempo en atencion al cliente  y manejaba mucha plata en podio. (se hacian varios arqueos de cajas) y rotabamos en cajas perimetrales como autocenter, electrodomesticos y centro fotografico. como vendedora tengo experiencia, ya que aveces, teniamos que ayudar a los compañeros de electrodomesticos, y demas sectores que me mandaban. Durante siete años aprendi muchisimas cosas, manejo de telson como hacer banderines de precios y demas cosas. Por mi parte estoy dispuesta a encontrar cualquier trabajo, ya que, me adaptaria a lo que sea. Mi dispinobilidad horaria es full time."
good,"Muy cuidadosa, muy buen trato con todos..clientes compañeros, jefes."
good,"I worked in the shoes Dept and Ladies Dept., purses, and other  not stop me.Depts to help others. I learned very well with others in other Depts. Management was another story. My co-workers loved working with me. I always finish all my work before I went home. There were alot of hard jobs but I still finish. I enjyed helping customers in what they needed."
good,I worked in the Money Center and i have to say this was a pretty easy job for what i was getting paid. no complaints about the job. Most problems are customer related. 
good,"I won't say anything negative about this place - just that working there as a Pharmacy Technician is okay, but I'm ready for something new. "
good,"A typical day at work: For me it was trying to learn the job and get better at what I was learning, weather it was watching the cameras"
good,"Assist in the merchandizing and operational functions to company standards."
good,I learn a lot from people who comes through my line. Management is okay. They come when you need them. My co-workers are fun to be around and helps a lot. The hardest part of the day is making sure my drew comes out right and I love my 1 hour breaks.
good,"Aprende muito a controlar o meu emocional, a ser uma pessoa dinâmica e saber trabalhar em grupo. A ddireção  precisa se preocupar um pouco mais com os funcionários. Meus colegas muito unidos. é que tem hora de chegar mais não para sair."
good,"I worked in the Deli for six years, what I liked about the job was helping customers. I learned about food safety and handling and educated myself about the products we sold as consumables. The hardest part about my position was putting the loads away and the lack of help especially on our busiest days of the week."
good,Can't live off of just working for Walmart. Pay is minimum and hours part time. 
good,"I worked here when I was 16. I enjoyed being there. The pay wasn't all that, but at 16 I guess it was good enough."
good,"If you aren't looking for stable hours, and you are physically fit to stand for extended hours than you are going to be fine. You must also have GREAT costumer service."
good,"Starting I received almost now training, and was thrown at the sales floor, customer service managers(supervisor to cashier) were nice and hard working seeming to care about the customer."
good,Foi uma oportunidade que tive nessa empresa e
good,Would clock in at work and go upfront and hop on register. Would run register and stock shelves up front and zone. Would have to clean registers also.
good,Enjoyable place to work and get work experience. Everyday was a different experience due to the customers which made the job very interesting and exciting.
good,"Assisted customers with returns, sending money, finding products and much more. The job is great, the employees are great, the pay was not, great if you need a part time job."
good,"At Wal-Mart every day was basically the same, unload trailers with there product, use scan guns and computer systems to label boxes/cases so they would be shipped to the correct store, productivity was always a demand, safety, and good job performance, productivity was always going up, had good days and bad days all depended on the type of freight of the day, I trained many associates at Wal-Mart, training new associates is a very easy task if you have the patience, the issue was constant manager and supervisor changes, co-workers were great we were all like a family there, yet there was always drama, Wal-Mart was a good job, at the end of my Wal-Mart career things in management were going down hill, I was also having issues at home which was interfering with my availability to work, these issues have been resolved at home, things are great other then I am not employed at this time."
good,• Round up all empty un-attendant shopping carts inside and outside the store.
good,Go in to work set up back room for receiving a truck or two worth of fright that is used to restock the store. I have learned about other area's close to mine that can now complete. My direct management is really high quality. The hardest part of the job is making sure that every thing gets done with less people than you would need to do the job.
good,"Set up bay floor for semi to unload general merchandise all by hand. go to grocery side and unload their semi and down stack all the food onto carts and pull to grocery isle.After lunch pull pallets of merchandise to all areas of sales floor.pick merchandise from shelves to be restocked on sales floor.Management most of the time very easy to talk to and are willing to work out any problems.Most of my co-workers are young adults, and majority do not have very good work ethics.Hardest part is merchandise can be very heavy at times to lift.Like all aspects of the shift because we change what we do every few hours."
good,"I have learned how supermarkets operate, even though it is hard to work nights. My work day involves unloading pallets and getting the dairy load separated from the lunch deli load, and then stocking the shelves for dairy, and returning any stock that does not fit on the shelves to the cooler."
good,"Stocking shelves, loading and unloading trucks, building end caps, regulating inventory, rotating products, etc. I learned how to better my time management, work with a diverse group, customer service, people skills, and operate a pallet jack. Management was a great group of very down to earth people, easy to talk to, and always willing to help. Co-workers were friendly, helpful, and productive. The hardest part of the job was, again, dealing with upset customers. The most enjoyable was being around people, and feeling accomplished at the end of the day."
good,When I started working at walmart it was GREAT! I was raising my daughter on my own. People were nice and I'm still friends with some after 6 years. I worked there for a year and I felt that I had to quit due to being uncomfortable around a manager. I asked for my job back after walking out and was made to apologized to that manager for walking out on the shift. The store manager didn't believe a word I said. So I sucked it up and did what I had to do to get my job back. After I left the second time the manager finally got fired from being hired at any walmart.
good,had fun at this job.. I got a chance to work and help people at the same time..
good,"Its a good job. I grew a lot and learned a lot. However, the same thing over and over gets old and the only thing that keeps you going are your co-workers. They do a really good job at hiring balance of personalities. The have a horrible system in place of part-timers. If you are part time you get no benefits, only 3to4 days of work (No. your off days are not together) and you are only allowed to work 72hrs per pay period. Because the are no sick days or vacation days if you call in/ late more than 3 times in any given year You Will Be Terminated no questions asked. They do not accommodate for sick children or what could be a much needed schedule change. Its Walt-Marts way or the highway."
good,"fast paced environment, fun competitive sales games. The store manager was a very fun and free spirited person that made us strive to better the company by making our work fun."
good,"i like working with people,specially as a sells,working with other and working as a team,,i didnt like i was only part time and didn't pay much"
good,Moved from dept to dept quickly based on my quick learning abiliies.
good,They were very good to me when my husband got sick about unexpected doctors appointments and trips to the Emergancy room.
good,Loved what I did but there was no communication between managers.
good,I enjoyed going into work. Because of the friendly and positive atmosphere.
good,• Part time supervision
good,"Walmart is a very large company that could employ more workers if it wanted to. they cold also provide insurance to its employees sooner then after 1 years of employement, and at a cost that is efficient to the workers. They could also start there employees at a higher pay. This company does offer advancement but only after you have been there 5 years or more it seems. They could also offer full time employment instead of part time start out only."
good,I enjoy working with all of the different people who make a Wal-Mart Store Opperate.
good,Open tag and place products on shelves for customers. Clean and maintain lobster tank. Most difficult part of job was downstacking incoming product in the large refers. Management tends to be very severe on each other.
good,Its a good start job if your just starting to work for the first time. Can learn alot of experience working as a team and how to handle customers first hand.
good,"My typical day would be to go in and pull cake orders, start on making the cake orders, stock the store cake case with new cakes, help customers by taking orders, helping them with ideas of different cakes other than what was shown. Helping others in the Bakery with putting up stock. The hardest part of the job was working in the freezers putting up frozen stock. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the happy smiling faces of the customers when they come to pick up their cakes and they loved how they turned out."
good,"Overall this is a good place to work- it's hard to find jobs that pay this well without a college degree, and I work with a lot of fun and interesting people. The hours are 3:30am to 12:00pm, which is hard to deal with and maintain a normal life with a family that needs your time and attention during ""normal"" daytime hours. This, and the near hour drive from my home are why I give it one star for work/life balance. Once you complete training and gain a decent knowledge base, it is rather easy to get promoted to assistant management position, but this almost always requires relocation to another warehouse- usually in another state- which can also be hard to do with a family."
good,Pay was great as well as the people yet they weren't flexible enough to schedule me around my school schedule
good,"I was hired to fill in for the holidays, enjoyed my short time there."
good,"clean,organized and very conscience of safety.liked the very fast pace"
good,working at walmart is a good place to start working but not a career
good,Excellent communication skills are required as well as the necessary range of soft skills.
good,I enjoyed working for walmart for the most part. I was really fond of my co-workers and they made going to work enjoyable. I liked some of management for the most part. I think the hardest part about working at Walmart was that their scheduling was always messed up.
good,Worked at the registers had an amazing time meeting new people
good,I enjoyed managing cashiers and front end staff.
good,"Sempre fazendo o que era designado a fazer, convivendo com todos da melhor forma possível, local de trabalho otimo."
good,"Uma empresa que te da estabilidade e um bom plano de saúde, porém peca com os funçionarios na questão da sua vida pessoal por necessitar de muito tempo dentro do trabalho e pela dificuldade de promoções."
good,Enjoy customer and co-workers. Cashiering is a job I enjoy and have over 20 years of experience as well as customer service.
good,good place to work other then pay. managers are very helpful fun place to work sometimes.
good,It is a basic retail establishment.
good,Worked third ship stocking shelves. Came into work at 10 p.m. took stock from back room placed on pallets by receiving and took to department to stocked shelves.
good,"I worked for walmart for almost 4 years. I have had no issues with them, was never disciplined, or had any customer complaints until i transferred stores. When i did that i was faced with a strict no talking rule where any side conversations were harshly disciplined and we were told that if we talked about anything but work we could get fired. I had a supervisor in my department who verbally harassed myself and five others but when we went to the management team like instructed nothing was done about it, I had a very hard time with this because much of that supervisors aggression was targeted toward me and it affected my ability to do my job. Because i worked hard i was able to gain customer loyalty and assist them with things that other associates wouldn't."
good,"O tempo em que passei na instituição tive bastante chances de estar se relacionando com diversas culturas, e formas de difíceis de se levar o desconhecido com cobranças mais acima de tudo oportunidade de ter feito verdadeiras amizades."
good,"When I left, I was a Receiving Clerk for Grocery. Starting at 4am-the deliveries started with greeting the driver, and then counting the product that was on invoice and verifying the actual product being delivered. After the product was delivered, verified and finalized, the paperwork was signed and set aside for filing in the invoice office."
good,"Working here was a good way to meet new people, great job management and co-workers were good and i enjoyed customer service part of the job, getting to know people was the best part, i learned how to handle upset difficult customers and learned how to make them happy. Great hours and always got you'r breaks!!"
good,A typical day at work would be gathering merchandise to stock onto the floors or merchandise that is coming off of the trucks to stock onto the back shelves. I check the roster to get the details on my job description for the night and continue with my work.
good,"enjoyable workplace, learn how to provide customer service and make sure the customer is always satisfied, most were helpful in showing me how to do the job, trying to keep the customers satisfied, working with the public in general and meeting lots of new people"
good,Did not like the low pay and cutting of hours to save money. Also liked the managers that worked there.
good,"This company places a great deal of interest in its cutomers, but lacks on the interest of its employees. Overall it's a good company to work for."
good,Upon arrival it I walk my departments to determine what my day and my associates day will entail. I check all inventory in the departments and determine if orders should be made or not. Merchandising certain products to the customer is a decision made myself or instructed by Home Office. My managament team will assign miscellaneous tasks that need to be done in my departments or that in surrounding departments. My associates in my department rely on me to instruct them on their duties for the day as well as train them in areas need and/or interested. The hardest part of my job is conducting price changes and managing all in the inventory in the department in a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I can manage many aspects and personnel and being satisfied with that knowledge.
good,"It was a good place to gain valuable work experience. The pay was ok for the job, the co-workers were great. They really made the experience much better!"
good,some are cut out for it and some are not
good,I would work while enjoy the customers at wal mart. It is fun and challanging.
good,I learned a lot there from building the store from gondolas right to selling stuff it was a good experience. When i got put into the photo lab it was the most enjoyable part of the job i couldn't wait. I loved working with everyone there.
good,This is a typical job that you can kinda do what you need to do to get the job done.
good,A typical day is ringin up customers. I learned that working with diversity is essential. The management style can vary from department to department and I have to be flexible. My co-workers are diverse and I have to be flexible. The hardest part of the job is trying to make a customer understand I am not the one who makes the rules just enforce them. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with all kinds of people.
good,"Cobrança , motivacão , cultura liderar pelo exemplo direcionadando sempre reconhecer seus associados , embora o retorno sempre mas os dias são bem puxados ."
good,"Typical day at work is scanning items thru in a productive time,helping customers find items,help wherever is needed.Ive learned that alot of patience is always helpful,ask alot of questions if not sure of whats needing to be done,coworkers need to follow thru with the customers at all times,hardest part of job is being able to complete one job before your told to do another.Most enjoyable is being able to work all areas."
good,"Nice employees, easy to learn equipment. Long shifts so easy to pick up extra hours. Customer service based"
good,good day fast and busy. Co-works was nice and customers.I learned Im not the only one that love shoes. No hard parts about the job. The most enjoyable part about the job is Customers and co-workers having a smile on they face.
good,"A gerencia que não e muito boa, desorganizada. Os colegas de trabalhos são ótimos, aprendi que sempre temos que fda o melhor de nós."
good,"I don't know if the whole company is structured the same but the location i am currently employed at has the worst management team ever. Not all of the management is incompetent, but the most important ones are. They have people in positions of management that have no experience in merchandising, or the use of wearable computer (i.e. Telxon, Scanners). You know its bad when lower ranking associates are showing higher ranking associates how to operate basic functions of the company. Im sure the company is wonderful when at full potential but this particular location has jaded me slightly."
good,Walmart is a fun environment to work in. Management is always willing to help you and teach you new skills. The hours never being steady was the biggest issue I had.
good,Go into work count the money in my cash drawer to make sure I had the correct amount of change to start my day.
good,I worked in the jewelry department so I had to handle jewelry and customers while keeping my work area clean and orderly. This was a great job.
good,"Clocked in at the begining of my shift, informed a supervisor of my arrival and procceded to my post. Put on my vest and started my duties. About one co-worker would assist me on every run, 8 cart pushers worked with me, an average of 4 cart pushers were scheduled each day. I had no problems with any of my co-workers and got along with my peers just fine. I had no issues with my superiors except the lack of verbal communication. I enjoyed the freedom to do my job with no complaints nor often instruction by supervisor, did excellent work when on the clock, hence no need for complaints. The hardest part and the part i dis like the most would be when i was on the shift alone a majority of the week."
good,"At Walmart I learned how to work and interact with many different types of people. I learned many things about retail and the business. Management is generally fair, there were some managers that played favorites. One of the hardest things was when management wore their heart on their sleeve and took out their frustration on us, causing the whole store to be high strung and anxious. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers and the public. Some co-workers were extremely negative and didn't want to do much of anything except collect a paycheck. I would try to encourage them and remind them to be thankful. Many people took advantage of breaks and down time."
good,It was a fun place to work. Worked with very nice people and meant alot of new people was a great experience.

good,"Like any job it has its good and bad points,it can be a great place to work at, and also a not so great place to work at. A typical day usually involves unloading trucks, pulling items from storage, physically moving them, stocking shelves, filling displays. Certain managers can be friendly and easy to work with, others not so much at times. The co-workers for the most part are enjoyable to work with, and friendly."
good,"It was a good place to work but when you think you are soing a goos job they shut you right down, if one manager gets yelled at it gets taken out on you, I did learn alot in retail experience, I loved all my co workers, i got along with everyone i worked with, I was always willing to work in different areas in the store and willing to go work at different stores."
good,"changer tire and oil, i learn alot about cars and i had to teach the new worker"
good,I actually liked my job at Walmart. They had me doing everything but I really didn't mind it because it's a way for you to learn every part of Walmart inside and out.
good,This was a good productive work place. They tried to help you help with any thing you needed help with.
good,I worked in one dept. but when needed I had to help out in other depts. For me this was great because it keeps you busy and that makes the day go by fast.
good,I like working I like meeting new people. I like to keep busy.
good,I loved working there I just didn't have enough pay and they would not give me 40 hrs a week.
good,I would go to work at any time of day. I would handle customers face-to-face daily and handle cash
good,"Working daily in some way of itemizing, facing, zoning, customer service, and cashiering. I was flexible and willing to work where ever was needed. I read blue prints and used power tools to build shelves and racks for merchandise."
good,Not a bad place co-workers are friendly management was alright. if not in position with set hours your hours are all over
good,"Customer service was most important checking the customer out and making sure they recieved all their belongings. Long hours of alot of standing, always customer first. Had to be able to deal with stressful situation when a customer was dissatisfied."
good,"Stock the shelves in a timely manner. The job is all about balance, you assist the customers while making sure your department gets done on time. The most enjoyable part is stocking an empty shelve then 5 minutes later see a customer grab that product because I know I helped them out."
good,"- Operadora de caixa, um dia típico em abertura e fechamento de caixa."
good,"en general comodo, te dejan desarrollarte bien, ya que al saber el trabajo a realizar diariamente tenes el poder en un 99% de tomar decisiones"
good,"There's always work that needs to be done working a typical day at Walmart. My learning experience wasn't difficult it was actually fun and interesting. Management and Co-workers, well some are all about the customers while other were more concerned about themselves and what time the shift was going to be over. There is no hardest part but the most enjoyable part of this job was the learning experience."
good,great job. i enjoyed greeting people as they come through my line. making sure they didnt have any customer complaints.
good,Love the customer service and people. Working for this company I learned alot of trades.
good,Interact with customers and vendors; provide customer service; maintain that all merchandise is in stock and on sales floor.
good,"company is good as long as you go into a manager position, and from my experience they cater as well as other companies to the college kids. benefits package not great. and if you don't kiss up, you don't go anywhere. this company is the one i have had the most experience with. depending on what store you get with Walmart has the rep that they are there for the mighty dollar they dont care for the workers."
good,"A typical day is very busy so, time goes by fast. Training is well organized and updated regularly."
good,• Assisting with Daily and Monthly Budget Reports and Department Inventory and Supplies.
good,A typical day insited of me first speaking to the supervisor about my assignment for that day and once told I completed it.
good,Made it very easy to move up if you're a committed employee. This job does get demanding at times but it's not a bad place to move up if you're dedicated and very hard working. It is not as bad as they say.
good,"customer service rep, in a fast pace environment i learned to deal with unhappy customers, my coworkers was loving but the hardest part about my job was nothing because i like working fast pace."
good,Empresa que dar oportunidade de crescimento profissional.
good,Working here was alway about the people no room for selfishness here. Once you were at the register you were immediatly forcusing on the costomer.
good,- 12 to15hr work days.
good,"Each night begins with setting up modulars due that night and delegating to team members important information regarding job responsibilities. The hardest part, in some cases, is not completing responsibilities in the amount of time given by the store manager, resulting in non positive vocalization from the head boss. The most enjoyable part now, is only working with my other team mates. Due to this, keeping quite and working till the end of my shift is what I have learned, because the management has their own agenda and is never on the same page with each other. On the other hand, all co-workers are hardworking and are all fun to be around."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if you have no family. They do give the schedule 3 weeks in advance, but the hours you seem to get make it impossible to spend time with your family. The hours are never the same. The managers do not always do their job as well as they should either. Most times, I would not even see a manager there my whole shift. Walmart has plenty of opportunities for job advancement but it is very difficult to change your position, as the managers like where you are now."
good,"-Trabajo Interesante, y diverso"
good,"Typical day at work was working 1-10pm everyday with no change even when stating it would be better to vary my shift since I was doing security and didn't want to be seen at the same time in the same building everyday which would make less stops on my part. Learned how to file case files appropriately, type cases on the computer, how to apprehend a shop lifter and use local and state law enforcement in assistance when needed. Hardest part was working the same shift and not being able to catch so many shop lifters due to the building being so small and being recognized so easily."
good,Clocking in and being able to talk to different people while scanning their items was fun. I learned that I am a mutitasker! I never really dealt with management. My co-workers were laid back and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was getting trained. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see how fast I could scan the item to get people through my line faster.
good,it was good working with team members and learning how to worl in different departments
good,"Es un ambiente de trabajo donde existe la constante comunicación y el trabajo en euqipo. Cuando hay cierre aunque no pertenezcamos al área que tiene que cerrar contablemente el mes nos apoyamos unos a los otros. La oportunidad que día a día nos enfrentamos es que las tiendas o clubs nos envién en tiempo y forma su información, la envían a destiempo y lo cual provoca retraso en el manejo contable de dicha información."
good,"Working with the divercity, and the different languages. Was a challenge. However, it was a perfect learning experience."
good,"clock in go up front and get my register assigned, clean off my register and sign on turn on my light and start taking customers. If somewhere along the day i needed change or needed a void their were never any managers to be found i would have to hunt one down to get my line moving again. First break was 15 min. when i came back i had to be asigned to another register. they had me on like 5 registers a day but every thing was done by numbers which i still do not understand because if the person you are releaving took two hundred dollars you would never know and neither would they so that system just does not make sense to have. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers but i felt so sorry for them if they had to wait for management."
good,open store clean fitting room perpare regerstier.set up merchiandize and clothes greet customers keep ec=verybody happy and having fun at the same time Typical work day.managements great coworks awsmoe.not knowing what the customer stlye was hard but help them change they looksand they wearing it out the store after buying it i enjoyed the most
good,"Get to work early, find out how big the truck is, relax before we start tot throw the truck. I learned that hard work does pay off. My co-workers are alright, they are in the same boat as I am but they are seemingly satisfied. Where I am not. I would love to be somewhere that I feel appreciated.The two different shifts of managers are as diferent as the the times that they work. No commuication is exhibited between the two parties. But its not all that bad its a job, I'm looking for a career. Somewhere I can give twenty, twenty-five years and retires with my wife and children."
good,I loved walmart I beeen there a year I stayed to myself I really didnt have any problems except the fact that the one that I worked at couldent keep a store mannerger.Its one of those jobs where you will have to make sure nothing and I mean not even a bad thonder storm keep you from working. I had my down fall but I would work there again
good,Sempre sobre pressão
good,I sold jewelry. I repaired jewelry. Changed watch batteries took out links as well. I restocked and reordered when items got low. I did inventory. I ran a cash register drawer witch was balanced daily. I pierced ears. I swept the floors and cleaned all the glass daily. I did advertising signs for the area.
good,Friendly envirnoment and learn new things everyday. Great location and management was very easy to work with regarding scheduling and outside life.

good,I really enjoyed this job it just It was good job.very clean high technology organization. manufacturing of baby formula .
good,"Loved the job, loved provding customer service. Picking and binning all overstock merchainse, loading, and unloading trailers. I learned how to rotate dairy, got my power lifting Lincese."
good,"A typical day at wal-mart would include, Stocking supplies and products, loading gardening supplies or products for customers, unloading trucks. I learned basic skills needed to work in a retail store. The hardest part of the job was working in the hot sun in the summer, or in the cold in the winter. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around such a great group of co-workers. The only thing that was bad about this employer is the fact that, if you applied to be a full time employee, they would hire you as a part time employee and you would receive part time benifits."
good,"typical day: clock in, go to csm(manager) get orders, since I was a cashier I had to get a register number. clean area before start working. greet customer,check out customers, bag all items, help out with all customers needs. Keep area clean and neat. When done with shift manager will tell you when you can leave then you clock out."
good,"A typical day as a cashier involves greeting the customers, maintaining a pleasant small talk conversation while scanning items, bagging items, and managing monetary transactions. I learned how to tell the difference between honest customers and dishonest customers and how to react to them. The management at this store didn't always go by the company's policies. The hardest part of this job was working with the dishonest customers and working an all day shift and not seeing my daughter. The most enjoyable part was getting to know all types of different people and getting to know everyday customers."
good,"a wonderful place to work. greeting and meeting alot of nice different people and the management ,the co-workers are the best to work with."
good,"walmart is a good place to work, some what friendly depends on what store and managment you work for."
good,"i learned lot. management is not good, they dont encourge emploee."
good,"I have learned a lot in this store like how to do inventory, mechandising, unloading trucks, leadership holes, an how to multi-Task. The management team will hand out opportunities is they see that you are a hard worker and/or if you qualify for a certain position. The co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is scanning products into the bin location. Once you get the hang of it you will be just fine."
good,Unload back room. Unload truck stock shelves and then but the stock back into the back room. Fast moving and always something to do.
good,"I actually worked for Prologistix, which is a Temp. service. They only needed us for the the month of Thanksgiving, Holiday rush. So when the holiday was over we were released. Typical day involved doing some picking, of freight at the beginning of the shift. They would hand us stacks of labels, and we had to go to the locations to pick the freight. I mostly worked in shipping, were I would scan the merchandise. When the labels printed out, I put the labels on. Once the merchandise was labeled I then had to scan it to the semi trailers. Finally we loaded most of it into the trailers with the double riding pallet jacks. We were only there a month, but I got certified in the double riding pallet jack. Walmart dot com was a great work environment. I do like warehouse work, it can be hard work, but found it rewarding."
good,"I really enjoyed working with walmart, i worked my hardest and put in effort in everything i did. I learned alot of work ethics there, and my coworkers were a blast."
good,Ringing out customers and bagging groceries. Answering questions that customers asked to the best of my ability. Keeping my work station clean
good,It would be better if they would have hired me in their streetsboro store.
good,depends on what shift your working for and who your working for and what you can handle on an day to day basis.
good,a typical day at work
good,The people are very nice to work for. But working for minimum wage is hard and only part time.
good,A typical day at work is usaually filled with many smiling faces and a sense of purpose to fulfill a customer's expectations of Wal-Mart. Each day is busy and has enough tasks to complete so that the employee will hardly notice time is passig by. I learned how to work with people of many different backgrounds. I learned to diversify my approach to match the customer so that each customer felt important to me and to Wal-Mart.
good,Muy bueno para los estudiantes que necesitan algun apoyo economico para seguir con sus estudios.
good,"Abrir a loja e fazer com que a loja no básico esteja limpa abastecida e precificada pra que batêssemos a meta do dia, aprendi a lidar com pessoas e ser gestor de uma empresa, enquanto as pessoas que estavam acima de mim eram ótimas não estão aonde estão sem méritos, meus colegas de trabalho eram ótimas pessoas cada um com suas qualidades e defeitos mas importantes para empresa, a parte mais difícil do trabalho era tirar o melhor de cada um dos associados afinal cada um tem sua personalidade e cabia a mim fazer com que cada um desse o seu melhor e a mais agradável era ver os resultados que podíamos alcançar é muito incrível saber que podemos chegar a qualquer lugar basta ser honesto e trabalhar muito."
good,"I enjoyed working at walmart, on some days. Management was not exactly the best and needed some work but other than that, it was fun and entertaining. I loved my co-workers, we became more like a family as time passed by. The hardest part was working with the overnight managers and the most enjoyable part was meeting the new people."
good,"straightened shelfs, worked on tires, cashiered, entered information about vehicles in the computer."
good,"We had a lot of customers coming in constantly, I can now multi task extremely well and under stressful conditions. Managers were ok, great co-workers"
good,I enjoyed working at this workplace except the unfriendly workers.
good,Loved the job management was that great customers was okay.
good,"I thought there was a lot of management miss-communication. Work was exhausting. co-workers were unreliable, missing too much work. over load of work for one that did show up to work. enjoyed meeting and assisting customers."
good,Well Walmart was overall a good job but the management team wasnt..There was always a confusion or a dispute between them and the workers...
good,"I would go in at 6:00 AM, sort buggies as to where the defectives would go. Scan the defectives and place in a box, throw it away, or it would be shipped back to the vendor. Would have to make phone calls to get return authorization to send merchandise back or throw it away. We would have to handle hazardous waste material and put it in the right barrels to be picked up once a month. Would have to get packages ready for UPS to pick up. Would have to audit the boxes with the store manager to make sure it was done right."
good,typical work night for me a handfull of co workers re stocking products peaceful and quiet
good,Love working with the customers and helping them in any way possible.
good,There's nothing special about working at walmart except there's now flu shots and you get a break
good,"The atmosphere is both relaxing and calm with always something to do depending on the department depends on the how much work you do as far as assisting the customers. I was ably to learn more about the corparation from both side management and associates. I learned most of my skills in retail throught this one store. The hardest part of the job was manily when the schedules , computer generated, needed to be adjusted and finding a memeber of management to make the proper correstions."
good,"A typical day at work was speaking to mostly the elderly about precriptions needed, verifying insurance,also speaking to their Dr. and Nurse to verify correct medicine and mgs needed. Co-workers were great.The hardest part was learning the different medications."
good,Being a Wal-Mart Cashier is fast paced. Your day really goes by fast because you are steadily working. You get to meet new people. I learned how to deal with many aspects of customer service and different types of people.
good,Working with some of the most warm and welcoming individuals.
good,Being a cashier at Walmart is an interesting experience. The pay was decent for me since I was going to school still when I was working there but it's not really enough for what you have to deal with from customers. The store that I worked at the customers are ignorant. I had one customer insinuate that I'm stupid and that's why I worked at Walmart when she was the one that was giving me far too much money and was going to receive most of the money back.
good,I enjoy meeting the different customers I ring up. Learned things that you didn't know before.
good,"Developed into multi-tasker with extreme customer-service skills on the phone and in-person...the hardest part of the job is when you are left high and dry management takes away all your help and laughs behind your back....you do everything from stocking to inventory to cleaning up the front end to include carts outside setting up for the morning crews. All in all, Wal-mart was there when I needed them the most when the economy was and still is down, they will have your back if you have their back. Very family oriented from brothers and sisters to grandparents that work there. I miss the friend's I thought I developed even in management....good place to develop your retail career or just to find your self and where you should be."
good,"A typical work day here required a lot of standing on your feet. The management team at the store I worked for was really messy, and so were the co-workers so I really kept to myself. The hardest part of the job was angry customers but the most enjoyable part was being able to make an upset customer know that things were going to be okay and that I would handle their problem to the best of my ability or find a higher authority to get them taken care of."
good,"Advised customers on purchases, and merchandise on sale. Provided exceptional customer service. Developed reputation for prompt, efficient service with high level of accuracy. Maintained thorough knowledge of store merchandise in my department to provide helpful pieces of advice to customers. Compiled and maintained non-monetary reports and records. Developed constructive and cooperative working relationships with others, and maintained them over time.the management was fine and my coworkers were great."
good,Working for Wal-Mart was a learning experience. I developed skills that helped me realize my potential and encouraged me to continue my education.
good,I had never worked in a warhouse before nor did I know how to drive a forklift until I started here. Once I did I loved driving one and became the trainer for my shift which was a high honor for me. This was a production job so being aware of your surroundings was a must.
good,"Again with a place being in the public I enjoyed working with the customers face to face and having the visable interaction, it is just amazing the things that you get to talking about and the side conversations, its very enjoyable."
good,Atypical day at walmart is very busy. I manage 30 plus employees at a time as well as handle customers. Walmart has taught me about good customer srvice.
good,"A typical busy day from open to close. I learned how to use an telxon, learned the diffrent types of plants, learn how to work with different types of people. The management was ok, but they change them to many times. They had to many favoritizom to those that really dont work. Co-works was ok. No hard parts. The enjoyable part is to those customers with wonderful attitudes that make your day."
good,I started out at walmart as a stockmen merely pushing and gathering carts but moved into the store quite quickly. I was a homelines associate at the end of my time at walmart. The managment was aware of merit and hard working workers. The job was very diverse and I could find myself in different parts of the store every day.
good,I enjoyed working at McDonalds but it was only a temporary job for me and I wouldn't work there again.
good,As we all Know Walmart is one of the great retails store throughout United States Of America . They have good benefits and you can become a manager as long as you work for it.
good,walmart was a good job. working for walmart was a life experience for me and i liked it
good,Ok job to get by people are nice My position is pretty simple if you have great judgement as far as returning items and taking care of the customer you'll be fine
good,i didn't mind it expect for the fact i got stuck there longer then i was supposed to on some nights because people didn't show up
good,"Friendly coworkers, great atmosphere to work in, and overall its a job."
good,"Great place to work to build customer service, warehouse, stocking, cash handling and management experience."
good,I have worked at Walmart for over 20 years. I have cut my hours to 28 (still full time) because I want to see what I have to offer the rest of the world.
good,good place to work
good,"•Supported the facility as a vision center associate handling cashiering, layaways and customer service."
good,I really enjoyed my stay at Walmart as a Casher. Iwould love to work part time anytime. I love working with customers and strive at customer satisfaction.
good,"I like everything about the company except the management. Some managers tend to bend the company's policies for their own success. Example; Not exersicing staffing schedules set by the company, using reverse phsycology to manipulate associates, take, take, take and no give, leaving associates feeling like the only thing there is to do in that company is what you are told and you have no say in it."
good,"I really liked it there, but when it came to harassment, management didn't do anything to stop it."
good,"Walmart had given me the chance to start working in business management. I was unable to finish my management training due to my preemie baby, but what I did get to learn was incredible. I want to eventually manage a business."
good,"Wal-Mart was a good company to work for. The managers were great. However, rules were always being changed, or new rules added."
good,"I enjoyed working at walmart fun, fast steady place meet new people from all over the city great experience for someone who is just starting out."
good,"I loved working at the Walmart because I started in Toys, moved to sports, then horticulture, then hardware, Furniture, housewares, Electronics and so on and was trained as a department manager for housewares and hardware. Two years there went by quick; I was always called upon additional chores. I quit hence my family needed me to help with their business."
good,This is a great place to work if you enjoy the challenge of working in a fast-paced and sometimes demanding environment of dealing with the public. The hours you work is unpredictable from one week to the next.
good,Training was good but on a system that was different from what you actually worked on. You get breaks and must buy what you eat and drink. The drinks are cheaper in the break room. Most cashiers were the sole support and had to be on food stamps.
good,This company would do better if it was more concerned for its associates rather than their profits .
good,"alright place to work, but a lot of unneeded presure for the job"
good,like wal -mart is a place that trys to get every dollar out of there workers.
good,They have really good benefits and if you want to make career in walmart It's really good opportunity.
good,"If you're looking for part time work, this is a really good place to work. There is an opportunity to work in different departments. I work as a cashier and also am the door greeter sometimes. Some also do the service desk. If you like working with people and have patience with some of the csm's it is a good place to work."
good,"With 17yrs with this company, I had excellent benefits. You have to fight tooth and nail to advance within the company."
good,Wal-Mart is a fun place to work because you get to interact with the customers and get to communicate with them on a daily basis. But the work hours don't really revolve around your schedule. I was in school and couldnt make it at a certain time but they still scheduled it anyway. So sometimes yu have to pick and choose between work or other things you have to do.
good,Over all it's fast pace most times just pay attention and have proof of work when you hazmat. Try to stay up to date in your computer training other than that you'll be fine
good,"Working for Walmart was an great experience for me. I enjoyed learning all the next this they had to offer. I Loved working as a person shopper while I was there. The manager in that department was amazing. Being a personal shopper was the best part about that job. On the other hand, the managers can be very nasty to their employees."
good,"Aplicación de exámenes psicometricos, aprendizaje en diferentes áreas de la empresa"
good,I make others feel good and have fun breaking the monotony with making others laugh. Many customers of Walmart and even employees have requested that I return to Walmart. My work ethic is to work safely and have fun with my work.
good,"Despite the steep learning curve, I was able to gain very valuable life skills that will help me in future professions. I met many wonderful employees that treated me as there own and learned how to help customers as efficientl as possible. There was of course the usual drama such as upset customers as well as unprofessional employees, but the rigorous work kept us all busy enough to keep moving forward."
good,"I haven’t worked at other pharmacies, but from what I have seen and heard, staffing isn’t as much of an issue and it’s pretty easy. The company has high standards which is good, but management doesn’t always uphold them."
good,I enjoyed working there for the most part. Management can be difficult to work with and the hours aren't great but its a friendly environment and a family nature.
good,"Pay may start low, but there is endless advancement opportunities.  They will work around your schedule, and you will have the option to learn many different departments."
good,Not a bad place at all to work just must make sure location management are all in same page and not just out for themselves most associates work together as long as they feel the others are pulling their weight
good,"É um local bom de trabalhar, mas pecam numas estatística."
good,"Walmart is good for new employee, but you never learn something. now i am ready to work somewhere else to improve my knowledge. i hope i can find other job."
good,Was a positive and work driven environment. I felt needed and useful throughout the work days. My time was always spend working on projects and collaborating on projects with my coworkers.
good,"It is seldom you will have forty hours a week, and quite often you will be moved, more often at your request just to fill in hours, this is year round. All management, are treated much the same way, and seen as ojt and move up or out. Management termination is quite often."
good,"The most important factor I love is coming encounter with special people.i love what I do,love giving my all...superior customer service at all time..Customer satisfaction is what I strive for on a daily basis.."
good,Good working with co-workers but always rushed from supervisor or management to complete everything in a span of a specific time. Management would always be supervising the work.
good,"Walmart makes their employees in the produce department feel important and valued, the work can be tough and fast paced but there are always fellow employees willing to assist you. The management team is also very accommodating."
good,"My time working there was nice. It was a little challenging to get used to because the time I worked there, I had no work experience. But overall, I'd say I enjoyed my time working there"
good,Walmart is a great company! I enjoyed working there as a cashier in 2009 and recently in shipping and Receiving at Walmart Central Fill. I resigned due it being a conflict with my personal life and family time and part of my duties was wearing me physically.
good,Walmart was a good place to work. All coworkers were a delight and the job itself wasn’t terrible either. It consisted of unloading trucks and stocking freight but was a pleasant environment. Compensation could have been better.
good,It is a good opportunity to learn different skills. I really enjoy the relationship building with the customers and my coworkers. ability to transfer departments.
good,"Was a good job, some management could have been better leadere, were good at team building, not that great at time management. Salary managers weren't exactly helpful when needed"
good,"Not a job you want to keep forever but great job for people 18+ who need a steady income well going to college, tough times but overall a great place to work"
good,"Everyday after school, even holidays, I would come to work and out on my safety vest and go outside and push carts in to the doors for the customers to grab and shop with also would help check them out if need be."
good,"De modo geral é uma boa empresa!"
good,I enjoy working under all of the management team there. I like working in my department I work in electronics and i enjoy helping customers find what they need
good,"The job and coworkers were great, late hours were stressful as there were many unsavory people roaming the parking lot. Being in an are known for trafficking made this hard to deal with."
good,I love working a Wal-Mart. I am good with my hands and like to work on vehicles. I learn new things from my manager and other employees every day. I have made many friends in the short time of working there. Only downfall is not having a set schedule.
good,I love my job and i love working in the envoirment that i work in around customers and delivering excellent customer service to the customers from supervising my employees
good,"All of the co-workers were very friendly and helpful. This pharmacy was in a small university town  and the employees in the pharmacy were either there for a long time or part-timer college students that came and went frequently. Manager was very friendly and helpful on the surface, but had her favorites, although she probably did not realize she was showing this characteristic. Also, since I was part-time, I was only guaranteed 25 hours a week. Had to scramble for extra hours for call-ins and stay lates when busy, so it was hard to make any personal plans. I liked working here, and only left because I was transferred to Sams for a full-time position."
good,I enjoyed the job. Wasn’t bad. It was easy balancing school and work. Pay wasn’t bad. Had some horrible customers sometimes but that’s not the stores fault.
good,Not all managers walk the talk. But it is a wonderful place to work if you are self motivated.  Find trusted mentors and sponsors..who can speak for you when you are not in the room.
good,Overall I like the job But the hours were difficult to handle any business Staff was very Generous and helpful Also it was one of my first jobs Even though I spent most of my paycheck there.
good,first time I started working at the port orchard Washington Walmart I learned how to stock product on shelf's really fast and neatly keeping the floor loaded up.
good,"buena empresa donde te permiten ser tu mismo, empresa con valores"
good,"Not everyone has predictable lives, and the 4 point attendance system seems to punish people for having an unpredictable life. its not fair i have to choose between suffering pregnancy related illnesses at work or staying home to make sure im okay"
good,Stocking the floor with products was my everyday task love doing it because you get to know everything in the store and can locate anything in the store too
good,the store is well kept but a lot of people didn't do there job so you end up doing more than one job .they also don't hire enough people. overall its a ok job.
good,Overall working at this company was a wonderful experience. I learned how to operate a forklift and was actually amazing at operating a reach. I never thought that I could enjoy working so much as I did.
good,"They are always there for you, it's also a great place to work if you want to have a lot of hours because it is a company that is open 7 days a week and most of them are open 24/7 so there is always opportunity to work more shifts"
good,Walmart was a really nice job the staff was very helpful at times. The work environment was always clean customers had moody days but the staff stayed respectable
good,"Primary roles include scanning coupons, applying discounts, processing payments, and ringing up sales on computerized cash registers. Cashiers also take responsibility for handling returns and answering questions about merchandise, store policies, and ongoing promotions."
good,"It was a typical nine to five job. Barely any schedule mangling which is also, quite unfortunately, typical as well, which was great for me and my coworkers."
good,Walmart is a job that does give you experience and opportunity but management isn’t always the best. I did create memorable moments and was able to gain more experience in customer service.
good,Good company to work for. Everyone at this company are super friendly. If you ever have questions there is some always there to help you out. Great place to gain experience.
good,"Its a good work environment when not on the floor, on the floor is demanding and they want hard-working people and no messing around, they expect you to meet your given time in your section."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Walmart I had the pleasure to meet new people and putting smiles on faces. I would love to enjoy the team again someday soon.
good,"Es buen trabajo y no es pesado, pero el salario es bajo para el tiempo que dura la jornada."
good,A typical day can be taxing and stressful quite often but not always. Working an early shift seems to work the best for most associates as I've seen and dealt with. 7/10 would recommend.
good,Overall Walmart is a great place to work it’s a free environment you are pretty much on your own once you get the training time u just come in and do your job
good,No complaints set schedule not much customer interaction and it was handled as a team which was very assuring and completion of goals for the night where accomplished
good,Work hard and you'll be treated well. Slack off and you'll be miserable. Working to impress yourself instead of others will give you a better outlook on this entry level job.
good,Great opportunity oay was great overnight was about to kill me but I managed easy to do with day to day life people are great.........................
good,It’s good place to work and I got five there with amazing managers good experience I quit from Walmart just because of my study at college that’s it I think I don’t have a lot of things to tell you about Walmart but I think I got a lot of good experience from there
good,The hours are part time. A lot of gossip. People tend to talk about others behind others backs. Flexibility of hours if u have personal issues or go to school as a student.
good,"I worked as a cashier for a few months. Overall, it was a great job. It was super easy to learn everything I needed to do. I wish the point system was a little different but it wasn’t bad. I’d recommend working here."
good,"Very nice people and customers. Good and fun environment to work in. Always get to do something like sticking, ringing out customers, pushing carts, helping people all the time also."
good,The pay is decent for what you’re intended to be doing. However management can be incompetent and short sighted at times. Hours/ flexibility is a real helpful section of the job.
good,"It was a nice variety job. I worked in as many departments as I could and learned a lot. The only reason I left that job was because of a miscommunication between associates, otherwise I would’ve stayed on for years."
good,There wasn’t really much schedule flexibility for customer service manager. The balance between home and work was usually off quite a bit. It’s very important to balance the two to ensure positive behavior between everyone.
good,"walmart was like my second famlily. "
good,A very busy and big company to work for. Flexible with hours if you are in school or college. You get to meet new people everyday. Great place to start employment.
good,"The working condition at Walmart is great, lots of training and friends to be made, however the management, while effective, is much to one-track-mind, and has no consideration for the people they employ."
good,"Fun to work great environment."
good,"It would get very busy at times, but still a great place of employment. I would recommend others to try it out. Especially if it is going to be a first time job."
good,Needs better pay it was a great environment to be in great managing skills but they just need to pay the employees more for the great work they expect and is done
good,"Wonderful company family oriented, great  investment inspiration insurance and also great vacation time. I’ve been there 14 almost 15 Years management has helped me succeed and move up."
good,"Friendly environment with co workers and customers . I’ve worked here now for 2 1/2 years soon 3 years .. "
good,Challenging job but the pay is good. After you get the job their will be assessments you will have to do in order to keep your job . You also will have to learn how to be responsible if you want to keep the job
good,"Job description is accurate and job duties are clear-cut. Most management and supervisors are supportive of employees.  Starting pay is, generally speaking, superior to other establishments of the same nature."
good,"very good environment,  Nice people, Good arrangements and fun job. moreover the staff is also very helpful. Overall its a great pleasure to work in th security company and posted at Walmart."
good,"The Walmart I worked for was really good compared to other Walmarts, but the store manager does not care about you or your issues. The workers are super nice and make everything fun but one thing we realized is that complaining about an issue to certain managers never gets resolved unless we took it to someone higher or HomeOffice/Ethics. However, there are some managers that really care for you and what you have to say so it does balance itself out. In my opinion, Walmart is not a bad company to work for, they have decent benefits and they are willing to work with you if you let them."
good,"Walmart is great for a younger person just starting out in life. It does have flexible hours, as long as it fit in with the companies earning goals for the month, year. Walmart Manager are very direct on what they expect their employees to do. If you fall short of the expectations, you usually get coached or released."
good,"It was short but my time in walmart was hadworking but I worked as a team achieving good targets."
good,"Provided a pleasant work environment, variety of patients and always willing to assist when needed. Always answered questions readily with no delay or being made to feel the questions were not warranted"
good,I learned how to be more outgoing then i was. I also learned how to be more patient and understanding.  love to help people so when i had to help the customers it made me happy and i felt good about myself. I learned a lot about the different kind of produce. I met a lot of people not only customers but associates also. Working in produce and in Deli kept you very busy so the timewent by pretty fast.
good,It's a good day at Walmart would be making customers happy scanning their products and making sure that inventory is good stocking when there is nothing else to do
good,Everyday was something new for me. I like having a lot to learn. Most the people are enjoyable to work with. And I really like my customers. I enjoy helping them find what they need and hearing stories they enjoy telling.
good,"System changes alot with little to no notice, hours vary alot, dont care about family emergencies. Certain managers are horrible and rude. Favoritism is a big issue there"
good,"Buena experiencia laboral, crecimiento y desarrolo laboral. Puntualidad de pago de salarios."
good,I want a different experience. I did not like how my hours were. It was not steady always went up or down. The pay was good but still did not have enough to pay for bills.
good,Walmart is a good company to work for especially for college and high school students. Works well with availably of the student. Advancement to move up in the company.
good,I worked a lot as an overnight shift worker. My co workers were great the only bad thing was I was still kinda new so my bosses out a lot of pressure on me. And not only that but I had rumors going around the store about me.and my bosses believed them.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart. I was a young adult when I started to work for them. I made many friends. People came and went. If you want to meet many people this is the place. Customers, co workers, management."
good,"They are very good with hours for employees, great at letting employees off when needed, I just feel instead of teaching employees things if they do wrong it’s “a coaching or write up”"
good,"Best place to work"
good,"Cashier at Walmart is for people oriented workers . Do work long hours, weekends and must be reliable. Can be versitle if you want to change departments."
good,"I enjoy working with Walmart, though the chain of command has changed several times, our goals remained the same and within reach with exceptional communication and teamwork."
good,"I worked at Walmart as a cap 2 supervisor for a little over a year, the job wasn’t the easiest in the store, had to make sure the trucks were unloaded on time and isles where done by the end of the night with very little people, half of them being unmotivated, I was constantly taking the heat for this no matter how hard I tried, management wouldn’t not help in these situations so I left."
good,Un muy buen ambiente de trabajo que se hace muy divertido y llevadero cuando estas rodeado de buenos compañeros y superiores
good,"Muita tarefa para pouco salário, todos pegam peso indiferente de sexo e idade."
good,good place to be. pay not so great. hope to stay few more years untill retirement.  best environment i ever worked in and am glad to be there. co-workers for the most part are awsome
good,"Upper MGMT. Did not like a woman running the garden Dept. They would not give awards to the ppl I would recommend, etc. Ordering plants for the San Antonio area was my specialty, and I was not allowed to do that. No extra help hired for Xmas!"
good,Communication in general could use a lot of work. There's too much miscommunication going on. Either something isn't said to the right person or it takes too long to receive information.
good,"Working at Walmart is a fast-paced, friendly environment. Working as a cashier is rewarding for many, because you interact with customers every day, you see family and friends shopping there."
good,I personally enjoyed working as a Walmart stocker because you get to work independently most of the time although I didn’t last very long for personal reasons.
good,Es una empresa donde se puede aprender mucho ya que como asociado de la misma eres multifuncional
good,Walmart was a great place to work for learned a lot of different things at my time at Walmart worked in different positions in the store so I could learn as much as I could about the store
good,Walmart will work with your schedule if you're a student so that's always a plus. They do occasionally have scheduling issues but it's not usually anything that can't be fixed.
good,It was a good place to work. Kept busy it made the work day go by really fast with alot to do and good people to work with. I was responsible for checking in all products that came in on tricks. Made sure all items were counted and put in the system
good,"Offers great benefits and pay rate. Certifications and education in safety is a priority to enhance awareness and to prevent serious injuries from occurring. Overall, you will be taking care of."
good,"Aprendí sobre la logística y distribución, atención al cliente"
good,"Tive vários momentos bons nesta empresa, tive vários oportunidades, fiz carreira valeu a pena para meu crescimento profissional.."
good,"My favorite part about this job is how equal they try to make the work environment. You can have colored hair, tattoos, identify as who you are and not have to hide, and have a number of disabilities. Everyday it seems like I learn something new. Although it does seen like somethings aren't communicated to the employees you can ask a member of management and they are always happy to answer any questions. the hard part of the job is probably the hours, they vary week to week and often there isn't that many. But they are very accommodating and if your just looking for a part time job it's a great place to work."
good,"Enjoyed helping and talking to customers"
good,"Always new job openings, friendly staff, and good work environment. There is also lots of room to move up in the company for hard-working and long term employees."
good,"Good job and hours. Flexible, works with you on availability to work . Being g a cap 1 associate you get to move around . Not stay in one area ......."
good,Managers were willing to communicate with employees about projects that needed to be completed. Customer service was an area that was harder to master because of the varying types of consumers that shopped at the store
good,It matters who your manager is. They have some excellent ones and some not so good as well. The biggest mistake I made was not following one of the good ones to a difficult store.
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart I enjoyed my job the people the associates . Everyday was a new and exciting day. Room for moving up Is always possible no matter the goal.
good,The job was overall good. Pay was ok if you are teen and don't have many bills starting off. You can work your way to different positions and better pay. It can be a good career if it's something your are interested in.
good,My time working at Walmart has been a great experience. Staff had no issue teaching me new things. Other staff helps each other most of the time. Has flexible work hours.
good,"The pay wasn't that great but the health and vision and dental were great. "
good,Walmart is a great company it has many opportunities to come by if you trying to come up in the company. Wal-Mart work great with the community and offers help around the world especially crisis victims or just simply donations. Wal-Mart give great prices and quality product im glad to have had the opportunity to work with the company.
good,"Really like working here . They respect break hours , they’re very flexible . Most Coworkers were nice others like to gossip and cause drama . You learn to mind your business"
good,The good about working at Walmart was everyone was encouraging and friendly it made me want to work harder. The bad about working there was not getting the help I needed at times.
good,I loved my job couldn’t ask for a better place to work I worked well with my co workers was treated very fair. I loved that I got to make customers smile.
good,Walmart is a good place to work with good benefits and decent flexibility for work hours. The pay is is good as well. You can make a good living working here.
good,Walmart is a good place to work to get retail experience.  Takes strong minded people to deal with the day to day grind dealing with all sorts of customers.
good,Walmart is a job that is great for people who are learning about customer service. It is also a place for people who like to deal with people all day.
good,they are very organizes and make all emolyee's feel comfortable.they make sure to have team meetings on things we can improve on and all the mangers come together and help each out when it is needed .
good,Walmart was my temporary job when I get into US and then I went to school for achieving my goals which is being a graphic designer . So worked at walmart was a great experience!
good,Worked in the automotive service since 1994 recently moved to service desk due to age and physical demands. Enjoyed working in the garage but also like the people and costomers
good,I really enjoyed working with the customers. The company has a very good training program. The store manager I worked under was very understanding and helpful.
good,The interviewer was polite and made sure I understood what she was talking about and made it easy to understand. As a first job I would recommend Walmart they pay well and for the most part the work is easy
good,Working for walmart is great being able to work for a big company such as Walmart being able to help customers and make sure there time at Walmart is so great they want to come back and tell others about us
good,Managers suck on front end and don’t pay attention to cashiers needs during the day there are rude customers on a daily making my job worse. I was never understood on my struggles with my disability and I could never take personal days or leave when I was sick without risk of losing employment.
good,"Cliquey, and somewhat toxic. Management was mixed, some were fantastic,and others were outright lazy or rude. Tons of drama. You have to be able to keep on top of your work, and it can be fast paced and very demanding  especially around holidays!"
good,"From my time there, I tried to be the employee that management can go to for any and every kind of task and there were instances in which I was but eventually when I tried to move up, I was unfortunately held back. I spent months trying speak to higher management but was never given an opportunity."
good,Out of the 5 years working at Walmart I was a supervisor for about 4 and when I was put in a position I was unfamiliar with I felt like they didn’t fully train me and allowed me to struggle to get to where I needed to be rather than helping from the beginning
good,Good job. Walmart is the best although my checks went back to the store lol. No better job in the world than Walmart you get to experience everything while here.
good,"The customers are great, most of the time. Some jobs are easy and some jobs are hard. The schedule that I was on sucked. And only gets paid on certain days at certain times"
good,Some days it would be slow and others very fast. I personally like it when it gets busy the time goes by really fast. We can’t be standing at the register so we would have to be walking around greeting customer and asking them if they need help finding anything. It’s a really fun and easy work environment. I loved working up front with all the other cashiers.
good,"If you need a job, work here. There's no shame, somebody has to do it. They pay well, lots of opportunities to pick up shifts. You need to give yourself purpose though, motivate yourself, that's how you get through."
good,I've been there for 3 years now and have learned Alot about the public and how to work as a team be a good leader and comunticate well whit others. I've gotten to be able to make my way up in Walmart but feel like there's more I could do.
good,"Se trabaja de manera pasiva, es un buen lugar para conocer tu primer empleo"
good,It was a decent job.  I was working through a temp agency.  Nothing bad to say about the job. Only work there for the holidays. The freezers are the only parts I hate to work in because it is winter time. Very cold here
good,"Live working around people. Very team workers and love helping others."
good,"I enjoyed working there, the people are great, Co workers are terrific, and pay and benefits are good. I would go back if given the opportunity. I especially liked my co workers."
good,"I liked working at Wal-Mart the the few weeks that I worked there. I didn't stay long enough for the discount card, but I did like the fact that I was able to get a break often when possible."
good,Management didn't watch out for their employees and let customers yell at them and curse at them often. no matter how nice you were to them customers knew they could abuse the employees. I left because of that and the stress is terrible.
good,very fun atmosphere. the boss was nice the hours were good and it was a cool job. i would go back to work there but as a manager or something hire. it can get a little crazy at checkout on busy days plus rush hour.
good,"This is a good place to work; however, the hours were not as flexible as I wish they had been.  Other than that, it is a great job for individuals who do not have small children or health issues."
good,i learned a lot working at walmart granted it was over 5 years ago. the hardest part of my job was being a young manager and trying to oversee people who were older than i am
good,"It was an okay job. I am semi - retired and the hours were great. It was a seasonal job tho. The pay was good, and the people there were pretty cool. I liked it."
good,Working in Walmart was a good experience you got to meet a lot of people it was great working in a team oriented setting when you didn’t know something you could always ask there was always answers also the training was very good in this company enjoyed working there a lot
good,"fast pace"
good,"Being an associate, you have to deal with customers from all walks of life. But it's pretty boring, especially zoning. Pay is low, but they do give fair breaks and paid time off. As a pharmacy tech, the pay is higher but the hours are grueling and there's only one 30 minute break, even on a 12+ hour shift. You have to learn a lot in a short amount of time and customers can be downright cruel."
good,Each day could be either good or bad some of the management could have some better people skills when it comes to the workers. The customers usually seem to be happy and dont get too snippy
good,Good company with opportunities if willing to move to other places around to world. I would recommend Walmart if you are looking for experience in the logistics world.
good,It was a good experience worked in the morning and got out at 3 in the afternoon so it gave me the whole day to do whatever I want but it was a good experience their
good,Just if you do get hired stay to yourself and stay away from the drama its a lot of clicks there. Including some of the management are friends with associate's and over look alot.
good,"Putting away freight for your department,helping customer find what they are looking for keeping your department clean your shelves clean and your prices and signs right"
good,good benefits and competitive pay also very hot in the summer very cold in the winter very physically demanding job dusty high production goals safety orientated
good,Job was easy and easy to learn also the managers was cool and helped you out if you needed your schedule changed ans the schedule was flexible and also the people was fun
good,Something to grow from and continue to look for better work. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. I was needing a change to better myself and my family.
good,I worked overnights and loved it. Yes it was hard at times but once you get the hang of things it was great. The managers were wonderful and some of the staff were great.
good,Wal mart was good at the higher levels of management with working with my school schedule. Depending on which manager rotates to which departments determines the quality of the work day.
good,"Be on time, make sure you work your scheduled days. Be the person you want to see when you enter a store. Practice safe methods of work. Lift with your legs."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. They offer a good rate to start. It's a big company to work for. They offer benefits after 90 days. They will work with you for what you want to work.
good,The job is mostly about unloading trucks with merchandise and to sort them. Then you are to unload pallets with food items and take to the sale floor. Finally you stock it on the selves. The work isn't too bad but at first it will be overwhelming.
good,"Working for the biggest retail company in the world, you immediately learn the culture, and how they have become who they are.  Management is there to grow you to the next level.  They provide you with the tools and additional training in order for you to succeed.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was the many of team building events.  This allowed you a way to bond with your team members, and helped to build morale."
good,Walmart is going thru alot of changes.. must be adaptable to change..that's how the company grows .. they try to stay ahead of technology and the times
good,very nice place to work with good work safety procedures.good supervisors. they give on time lunch and breaks for all associates. good customer skills
good,"Empresa muito boa para trabalhar. Entrevista inicial justa e eficiente. Apesar de está passando por uma reestruturação, mantém sua ética e linha."
good,Walmart is a good company to work in. They respect their employees and salary is also fair according to your needs. The system is also good to work. But a person must learn to manage his/her time.
good,My manager and assistant managers are so understanding and helps and listen to you specially when you need your schedule to be adjusted according to your availability.
good,"It's Walmart, so to be honest, you are a dime a dozen. However for the most part, if you actually go in and work and earn your pay, you get recognized. Be lazy, you still have a job."
good,"It's ok to work here, but it is tough because of constant orders. Then sometimes the end of the year sales are hectic. But law away can become very tiresome."
good,As a starter job it wasn't a bad workplace however it definitely is not anything permanent. You learn basic customer service and communication skills.
good,"i loved waking up to go to work every morning and taking care of my 3 departments paper ,chemical,and pets love taking care of the customers and giving them a real good shopping experience every time i smile and greet them and also helping them find what they need to make there shopping easier"
good,I was there for a long time .. although the people I worked with was great.. however I do not feel like I was being paid properly for everything I had learned and done for Walmart.
good,"It is a job, flexible hours are a key bonus though. I helped customers and employees. Stocked shelves, unloaded trucks, corrected item locations and other tasks as well as my own decicions as well."
good,Walmart is a good company but their policies are very strict and easy to get into trouble. An example is their policy on missing work if you miss more than 4 days in the first nine months you will lose your job.
good,"I was hired and then stocked groceries and merchandise during the night at full time. It was a low paying job although I enjoyed it but I had to get back to daytime living and sleeping at night for my health, So I moved on."
good,I really liked working at Walmart it help me understand things I never really understood before. Walmart is a place to improve and go higher up if you out your mind to it. They help you learn how to treat people and ignore when you get negative feedback from customers or coworkers.
good,"They are good to work for. Just do your job and they will keep you."
good,"Muito intenso, muitas possibilidades de crescimento profissional, mas é necessário muito esforço."
good,Was a very good and easy going job I like to constantly be working with my hands as a cashier would do  I would highly recommend Walmart if your a people person
good,I had gotten to work at Walmart in between school and they were understanding when I needed to leave. I wouldn't choose it again because it didn't fit my personality but overall an okay job and environment.
good,Good people and dedicated workers.works well with family.  My experience there was good for me.  That's all I have to say about walmart.  It's a good company to work for.
good,The management is unbelievable they don't work with you when unexpected things come up that needs your undivided attention. They are not flexable with the hours and most of all they never know who is in command.
good,I’ve enjoyed my rule at Walmart when I was their and made friends along the way that I consider family now it’s a great place to start or make a career out of if you choose to go that way for yourself too
good,"Most of the day you're standing in one position, just scanning groceries. Considering that for the most part it is just that easy, it's a pretty decent job. Lots of training on the computer, it's okay to ask questions and get help if you need it. It's pretty boring and if you don't have a social personality/ you have deep social anxiety, you're going to hate coming to work everyday. The customers are okay for the most part but just like anywhere else you have those customers that just do too much and when it is crazy busy, you're going to wish you were any other place but the more groceries you scan the faster time goes by. Hardest part of the job for me is trying to keep a conversation going with the customers and trying to keep a smile on my face, because i was just trying to get them in and out... but you got to understand that for some people, it is the only interaction that they get out of the day."
good,Work goes by pretty easy  I pretty much learned everything in the store  from stalking  management is good  and it’s a good place  To work It’s easyyy
good,"Stock, manage employees, customer service, maintain inventory for department. Great management and fellow employees. The ceiling is unlimited to how far you can go with the company."
good,"Bueno, solo que absorbe mucho tiempo diario y no queda mucho tiempo para ti, aprendes mucho y también te apoyan mucho si estas estudiando"
good,Very great company I really enjoyed coming to work. You meet so many great people. I learned a lot working for this company. I love the flexible hours.
good,They are easy to get hired. They have a flexible schedule and hire almost anybody.  It's a good job for extra cash.they are very understanding and fair.
good,"I was good worker but the more I worked the more they pushed,they expected more and more."
good,It was a good job and I loved the people I worked with. There just isn’t good communication with shift / team leaders and regular associates. You also don’t get trained by the books
good,I started out as a cashier. It was some times fast paced. Other times you would have to find something to help keep busy. I then was given an opportunity to be customer service and I took the promotion. Customer service takes a lot of hospitality to please customers.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers receive their groceries and online shopping. Seeing the smile on their faces when they didn’t have to come inside the store with their screaming children is worth it.
good,I was a stocker in the frozen meat section and fresh meat section they can call me if they need me I was reliable They strongly believe To have a good customer service for the customers
good,"- great benefits"
good,"Go to the back, have a meeting about how much freight we have and how much of what department. Unload the truck(s) until first break, we go to lunch or later if there's 2. Rest of the day is spent either on the sales floor helping customers and stocking shelves, or in the backroom sorting items. On Fridays 3 people backload the truck with pallets for the distribution center."
good,Walmart had a good work environment and had some great people to work with. It just wasn't for me and didn't have alot for me as for work  goes found a better opportunity and I moved on.
good,"Walmart has been good through out the years, but there have been some recent changes within the company that is leading to more and more full timers as myself seeking different opportunities."
good,"There are opportunities to grow with Walmart, they offer benefits, and an opportunity to further your education, I have enjoyed helping customers daily and the times I have been able to assist other associates in learning the ever changing ways of Walmart"
good,"Walmart is a good place to work it offers many benefits, you also get a bonus every 6 months not only that after 3 months of being with the company you are given a discount card which is great with helping you safe money on food and any thing that the store sells ."
good,"Working at Walmart has been rewarding to a certain extent, I love the customers that I have grown a relationship with & my coworkers but as far as the pay for your work ethic it’s not enough ."
good,"It is an inclusive, multicultural company, they also are very discouraging of bullying at the workplace. It is a fast paced job and multitasking. Customers first is one of our best rules but due my position I don’t work directly with customers.  I am the one responsible for instructing and managing my crew.  I am responsible for managing my teams expectations in regards to instock and presentability of the store."
good,Working at Walmart you had a lot of task to complete with a little amount of time. Also they played favoritism at Walmart with different people i didn't like that.
good,Working at Walmart is a stressful job you always have to make sure your helping the customer and sometimes the customers can be very rude. the hardest part of the job his trying to re-stock items when there is so many customers on the floor.
good,Good working atmosphere and awesome employees. Enjoy providing excellent customer service and public assistance. Great opportunities for learning and advancement.
good,Flexible work hours and you got to work alone for the most part. It's great interacting with customers at their discretion and the pay was pretty good.
good,it was a good job I worked there for a long time. I liked coming to work everyday and saying hello to my coworkers and other customers I would work there again
good,Working at Walmart was similar to any other grocery store with there being long hard hours. It was a fair job that I received a decent wage for. Unfortunately there were too many people with no clear leadership which allowed for numerous associates to slack off without the supervision of their manager.
good,The job is really easy to be honest. You just have to stay focused and not be on your phone as much as you want too. Always be willing to help customers in the store.
good,"Love working for Wal-Mart, love working as section leader and have supportive managers and co-workers. Benefits like Maternity Leave are a great perk."
good,Started off at 40 hours and then hours dropped a lot to 32 and sometimes lower . Good pay doesn’t do any good if I’m not getting the hours . The company is making a lot of changes and people are loosing their positions and pay due to it . I left while I had the chance
good,"Awesome place to work with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. Fast pace environment that requires good judgment, customer service excellence, and the ability to follow-up on productivity."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, I had a better job opportunity. My leadership team helped me out on becoming a better manager. I learned alot about what it took to be a successful dept manager."
good,Depending on who's your manager it could be tough. Working on holidays is a must but they pay extra. My job experience there was average. I worked in a lot of positions
good,"i loved walmart the hours were great and they treated you like family and thats makes u want to work that much harder, THe mangers always tried to help out as mucha they couldplus if youworkedharder than most ou got rewarded withovertime."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart consisted of unloading and organizing products off of the truck into stacks for various areas of the store. Afterwards, products were moved to the respective areas and staged for the stocking crew. Once the initial unloading was done, the grocery truck was unloaded. Once that was done, the unloaders would clean the back room and help the stocking crew, if there was time. Management was strict about deadlines and efficiency. The hardest part of the job was learning the entire store by department numbers, but the best part of the job was being able to memorize them when unloading the truck."
good,"Most shifts are overnight when business is slow. Hi paced environment, with multitasking a must. Leading a team from 12-40 individuals on everything from moving or building fixtures, to merchandising. Learning new technologies and incorporating these for employee and customers alike, all while reducing your impact to the customer experience and reducing disruption to the store."
good,"It was a good workplace, but the only reason I had to leave was that I attend a university that's in San Antonio. I would recommend it and they're taking more safety precautions to make employees feel safe"
good,Very informing and learning to move with change. Easy to get along with other associates. Upper management is difficult with deciding what the over all plan is.
good,It was a great place to work but I need make more money to support my family. I would recommend them to others. If I didnt have a disabled child I would still be there.
good,"I was basically just a janitor, but I don't mean that with a negative air. In fact, I was already very resolute when it came to keeping my home clean. Doing it at Walmart felt a little natural to me, except that I like to keep to myself when I'm working focused and of course Walmart was a little crowded for me. Still, when I think back at my time there, I'm really happy that I was able to help a popular store like Walmart."
good,I really loved working at the Corporate Headquarters for walmart. They treated their employees very well and had excellent 2 week training. They also have very good benefits as well.
good,Able to form bonds with some coworkers and customers that has lasted longer than the job did. Depending on which management is on shift depends on the type day you would have at work. Pay was good. Benefits were good as well. Workload was fair.
good,There was always so much to do during the long shift but it is also a relaxing environment. The managers are always making sure we are understanding whats going on and what needs to be done.
good,They treated me really good but they didnt give me enough hours they had really good benefits and really good pay. They were flexible with your hours most of the time
good,"The work wasn't the easiest and the work team was understanding of that, they would help you and cooperate with whatever was easiest for you. However, if there was a work void you would be expected to fill it even if it was outside of your job title. Overall I enjoyed working for Walmart and would recommend it to anyone seeking entry-level work"
good,I got really suck and had to quit the job. I spent alot of time in the hispital and now it's hard to find a job. I wish I could work at Wal-Mart again so that I can pay for College
good,"Un ambiente de trabajo profesional, oportunidad de crecimiento dentro de la compañia"
good,Working there was cool people was nice didn’t take me long to get the work down I was always good at learning new things would always help others and the same for me
good,"I stayed with the company for two years before I moved and I really like the store I worked for, the people were nice and the management was decent. I enjoyed third shift over anything"
good,After college and having enough of McDonalds. I switched it up to do a job I had never done before. Walmart made the transition easy from fast food to retail. Stocking shelves and unloading trucks seems like only a trained few can do it. That is not true with the right managers and a little training they help you strive.
good,"The company itself is under a constant state of change as it is keeping up with the advancements of technology and demands of its clientele.  Because of this, all associates are expected to keep up with these changes within the company in order to help everyone within succeed.  While that might sound discouraging to some, it truly should be viewed as a challenge.  An opportunity for those that believe they are capable of doing more than most and wish to demonstrate this in an established company that welcomes those with aspirations of greatness and to help others."
good,Never a dull moment.You are always actively challenged with new and exciting intiatives. You are able to meet new people each day as you administer your services
good,Walmart has been my employer for 6 years and I am ready to move on and they were willing to transfer me or work towards finding me another position. They are providing me with a reference.
good,Acomodar mercancia en el piso. Servicio al cliente. Levantar cajas.
good,Even though my experience at this job was a nice one.The job did not leave much room for growth. The point system they had made it very difficult to deal with life problems that so happened to arise
good,"I would ring up peoples items "
good,"Good work experience.  Always staying busy, left alone enough to get the job done.  Getting help is easy, the to bosses over you are really knowledgeable and easy to talk to"
good,I was ok with the job I had it paid fairly well. I’m glad they hired me. The job was hard work but honest work. If I would suggest a job Walmart is a good starting point.
good,I was a cashier at walmart over the holidays a few years ago. And eventually got hired on full time. I got very sick and ended up in the hospital with the flu and ended up getting pointed out.
good,I just was the person for the job and i was going through a lot at home and with my releationship that the job just went down the deep end but if i had a chance to go back i would forsure
good,Over all is a good company but they need to work on making sure employees are appreciated and feel valued. They offer semi flexible hours. Will work with you if you need days off.
good,My experience there was pretty good. Sometimes I had rough days but I pushed myself further and to do better for myself and for the company it’s a nice facility to work in.
good,"Company let's security treat customers with loud demeanor, no hours weekly to strive on,  not enough staff to cover shift, employees paid different for same positions,"
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. All of the employees were welcoming and the managers were understanding. My manager worked around all of my needs to make the best fitting work schedule for me. It was a fast-paced environment most of the time but I really enjoyed it.
good,Walmart deli was a great place to work. Hours were decent and people were super friendly. Only thing is the different days off each week got a little hectic but was manageable when going to college
good,Walmart has poor management and communication skills. Managers need to be more courteous and explanatory and helpful. When schedules are changed they should let employees know .
good,People I work with made it difficult to continue being excited to come to work. I felt at times I was doing a lot of the work and others were given credit for it. Those slacking off or not doing the work didn’t receive any disciplinary action.
good,"Have enjoyed working at Walmart, even though there are internal issues that they seem to work around rather than address and properly fix.   Middle management is too preoccupied following guidelines and loosing sight of basic people skills."
good,Decent place to work. Paid well for the area and offered three day work week. Area managers and operation managers  look out for their employees. not a hard job if you do not mind working hard at times.
good,"I had fun at walmart. A few of the managers became real life friends. I learned a lot working here. Respect for customers and workers, time management, friendship, computer work (pathways) it was a good environment."
good,"I like working for Walmart except for some managers that I feel don't like me at times, alot of favoritism going on with the younger workers especially females. I have been with Walmart for 5 years now, I feel we should be paid alittle more than we are making."
good,"I realized one thing. The people who complain the most, perform the least, and want the most. There are opportunities to advance. There is a game to be played, but there are opportunities."
good,Walmart is a good job to have. If you enjoy being around people and a steady work pace. Walmart is the place for you. Highly recommended and the pay is ok.
good,I definitely learned a lot from working here it help me become more social and versatile I was working garden center but could go up front and work a register or go in the back and help unload trucks I was able to learn how to make hunting and fishing license and also mix paint
good,A typical day at work includes greeting the customer before cashiering and bagging their items. This job also includes making sure the customer leaves the store happy and content with their visit.
good,"They will work with you in your schedule. When my mom was going through treatments, I was able to switch to part time, and back to full time without a problem. For the most part, I have been able to get time off- or manage my attendance points with few issues. The work load is often demanding, and the more you know, the more they out of on you that kipthey should probably be doing for themselves. Yea you are cross trained but with no extra pay"
good,"Working at Walmart was alright , I was young and was going to school so I got tired of working so much and going to school the next morning. I asked for days off and still had to go it"
good,"Boring to work there, it makes you feel as though it’s not essentially difficult to work there, more or less you seem like a zombie patrolling the area and fulfilling your job, or someone else’s job plus your job or nothing that pertains to your job code at all. Management differs from shift to shift, strict people or very arrogant people, which CAN make the job worse, plus there’s a added bonus! Stress and anxiety, with a sprinkle of vulgarity from some entitled customers!"
good,I would have rather been a cashier cause the clothin department is a little unorganized. Overall it was an okay job. It could use some more planing and meetings so everyone on the same page.
good,A typical day at work was pretty good talking to customers and scanning items getting your breaks on time some of the CSMs are friendly and understanding. Working there is pretty good. I would recommend working there 100%.
good,Don't work for Walmart they dont treat their employees very well at all its not worth the money for working there its not a fun working environment just dont
good,"management overworks you, puts you out of your dept and gets upset when your dept isn’t fixed, great pay, room for advancement, pto was janky, overall recommend"
good,Very welcoming and supportive overnight management team. I learned a lot about management and respect by working there. Walmart has a very respectful and diversified work culture.
good,"Once you come inside the Deli Department, the supervisor will send you to do various task upon on what you have learned. The supervisor does not like any conversation within the associates outside the job. Depending on the hour in the department, there are many customers for cold cuts and lunch plates. Cleaning is not an option, its a must on a daily basis. Our number one priority  is safety for the customers and the employees"
good,This job is a good job for a person in high school or college that is not looking for a forever job. This job comes with challenges like dealing with unorganized management.
good,Overall there careers paths are dependable & acceptable. With the proper training any employee should be more the capable of performing any job task or duty in job description that bst handles each scenario of job.
good,I have worked at Walmart for few months now and I have learned a lot. The main things I have learned at Walmart would be having good communication skills.
good,"A typical day at work is fairly calm. The people there make it more enjoyable at times. However, some nights can be stressful. It feels rewarding to know you finished all of your work. I would say the hardest part about working there is the managers. Do get me wrong, some managers are more helpful than others, but if you have a lazy or mean manger it could really deter you from working."
good,"Experience differ from person to person. The interview process was professional and  after the process they made you feel like you would "
good,I like working and learning new stuff. I was mostly more down loading the stuff from the back. Also answering costumers questions. I like working there but it was to far
good,"Everybody is determined here, we are determined to reach our goal in sales, CFF scores, presentation, and safety.Working at Walmart taught me how to be more careful and looking out for the customers safety."
good,Walmart was great start for my first job and it was a great experience to start working here. Everyone is friendly and have so much positivity in them.
good,Customer service is manageable. Fellow co workers are equally so. It the leering threat of management and the trickle effect that will stress a worker out.
good,walmart has many jobs and ways to work up in the company.   It has been a great job for me.  I have learned a lot about retail bussiness.  I have stocked many depts.....  zoned them also.   For the past couple years I have been trained to change the modular setting .... Printing the documents needed and putting it into place.
good,pharmacy manager dnt know what he is doing he is not knowledgable of anything. We have awesome tech and and a staff phamacyist who needs to be the  phamacy manager
good,its probably one of the most active jobs ive had cause i was constantly moving and sweating and kept something to do. i wokred long hours and was exhausted by clock out time but the money was good.
good,Wal-Mart can not keep people in there stores because they don't want you to call out sick even if you are . If you miss more than 5 days in a 6 month time frame you will be let go .
good,"It was very great experience I had. It was an okay staff but some were very great. Also, Walmart doesn't take doctors excuses which in some situations it can be very serious matter."
good,Pays well. I liked working there. Cashiering wasn’t difficult for me but customers got on my nerves sometimes but you just have to think about the paycheck.
good,Was good but stressful job for someone leaving school going straight to work in a freezer overall paid good everyone was nice and good environment disliked the time schedule u had to meet
good,It's one of the easiest jobs I ever had all you do is put stuff on shelves. The hard part is trying to make the times that they put on the pallets of stuff. I had  one hour to do 2 and a half pallets of a bunch of little small stuff like sponges and dishwashing soap and that would take me like 2 hours and they would get mad when it wasn't done
good,I am a part-time employee in Walmart. Because of which i do not get good pay and other benefits. That is   why I am looking for a good and secure job.
good,"I started here unloading trucks. I moved my way up to Human Resources. I loved my job at first, but as I moved up and eve tried to advance further I realized that the management was unacceptable and I felt uncomfortable working with the managers in my market. Not to say all managers and or markets are bad. But I personally had a bad experience that caused me to leave the company and now I am seeking better career opportunities."
good,"Sadly my experience didn't start great but ended well. My co-workers were why I pushed forward and eventually promoted. There were a lot of communication issues and lacking in some training that I addressed early on. Once it was achieved, things were not bad."
good,"Walmart is your typical conglomerate that recycles employees and makes it seem like it's a dependable company to work for. For a short term period, it's a passable with experience."
good,I like Walmart it has good benefits people are good there I had to stock all merchandise off the pallets I would sort all merchandise from each department I would make sure all pallets are worked on an all overstock binned in the bins
good,Clock in find out where I would be working for the day I’ll try my best to meet every customer needs and assist them and make their shopping experience better
good,I check associates attendance and coach or fire if need be. Ensure notes are down by my Dept managers and follow up on notes that have been given to them.
good,the customers omg and some managers..........the hours are good the pay stinks up on your feet all day and making on 11.00 really you have to take so much foolishness from different people.....the end
good,"I love my job. Changes are coming and I didn't feel I made the cut. Poor management can runaway good employees..   It seemed to become greedy, caring more about $ than their employees. Felt very unappreciated."
good,Wal-Mart is a good company to work for. I enjoy being able to help people find what they need and there isn't really a hard part about my job. The hours are reasonable and it's not to difficult to balance my life with work at the company.
good,annual evaluation are done only on work done at walmart at present workplace however there should be consideration of education skills and knowledge background and HR team should assessed how an associate can be more useful and benefits for the company.
good,"Walmart was cool, but it was kinda rough at the same time. My work often went unnoticed, so that took toll on me. The money was ok. I thought it would be a load of money, but it was moderate."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. Good salary depending on your position good benefits for full time employees. Decent benefits for part time employees. Starting salary $11/hr
good,"This is a part time role with many late shifts and weekends. "
good,The atmosphere at walmart was very pleasant. The employees we amazing and the management team was very productive. I learned fast and was given bonuses for the quality of work done in the section I worked.
good,Ambiente agradável;  boas relações interpessoais; horário de trabalho 6x1
good,"Walmart has many options to work within the store. They have meetings to set expectations, and have follow up meetings. Walmart is a growing company with technology to keep up with the competition."
good,i Enjoyed working there for the most part. There are a lot of perks. 10% discount. Management is not that well. Too many bosses or people trying to be.
good,Got along very well with my supervisors and loved dealing with the customers.  Great opportunity for a retired person to get out and be around people.
good,I wouldn’t have a problem with malmark or working it was a nice job it get a little hard at times but there’s no job a man can’t do so far malmark has been great!
good,I learned how to work as a team member and was able to learn better social skills. I also learned how to handle money better then before I started working there. Overall it was a wonderful experience and I learned plenty of skills I will use throughout my everyday life.
good,"It’s a pretty decent company to work for. The work itself is easy- lifting up boxes, pulling pallets, counting product, labeling boxes, etc. however, it can be challenging. Being able to work with a team and ask for help is a must. Management is pretty laid back and easy going. But If you don’t like team work, customer service, or fixing other people’s mistakes, this isn’t the job for you."
good,They mostly have part time hours. They avoid paying benefits. Job expectations are well defined and clear cut as far as what was expected from employees.
good,"Walmart is a wonderful company. Many benefits, pay is competitive at the salaried level. Culture is fantastic and the company encourages employees to be their 'whole self'."
good,Team work and schedules are big issues. Management needs work helping the associates. The wages are not enough causing most people to get more than one job which is overbearing.
good,Fast pace and learn a lot from there. Definitely recommend to work at this place. I had a great time learning from the managers there and they taught me a lot.
good,Each Wal-Mart has their own family within the workplace. It mainly starts with the caring people lead who strive to do everything for each employee.  They are a good company to work for who cares.
good,It is a fast paced work enviroment. It is easy to learn and pick up on the task as they are pretty repedative. The staff is friendly and easy to work with.
good,They need to train people better. More than 30 minutes.. And not pick the hours they want you to work. Loved how busy it was made the day go quickly always had a line of customers.
good,"When i began working for Wal-Mart, I was a fresh, 19 year old with no ""real"" job experience where punching a clock was necessary. I started in their meat department as an hourly associate making a little over minimum wage. After about 2 years of hard work and learning every chance i could, an opening for supervisor in the department became available. I interviewed and got the job and saw immediate success and turnaround of the department. There is so much room for growth and advancement, but management and superiors tend to throw their weight around. I have learned so much in my altogether 4 years, enough to last a lifetime. Being a team leader, a teacher, a mentor and role model is what i enjoy the most and what keeps me coming back with the same upbeat attitude every day of work. The culture is so unique from store to store and in my own it's one of a kind. Hardest part of the job is having to discipline people that are fully capable of doing the right thing every time they are presented with an opportunity to do the opposite."
good,"You just have to have a lot of patience with patients. The most difficult part of the job is not the customers themselves, but the frustration of not being able to have their insurance pay for their much needed medication."
good,"At Walmart, the focus is customer service but we have a lot to do as associates, which makes finding one difficult. Management are hit and miss, you have some who are all about the Walmart culture and wanting to teach all associates and some who are only looking to work their hours and go home."
good,Fairly well basic questions of job and responsibilities . Detailed summary of job and experience at the current facility and prior to being interviewed for the position.
good,"Walmart is a great store, but it’s only okay to work at. In my experience it can be good and bad, hours can be good money can be okay at times it feels like your hard work is under appreciated by management."
good,"Port Perry Walmart is a laid back, flexible, work environment that is perfect for either first time workers or for a retirement job. Perks of working for Walmart include profit share and a 10% discount on merchandise in the store."
good,Didnt agree to review the company. A good starter job not much else i have to share about the company. I dont believe im reviews as everyone is different and because one has a good or bad experience doesn't mean it will be the same for you.
good,Working here is for the supervisors back there employees and are always willing to help.  Even when there are challenging day I always have the support that is needed.
good,"It is a relaxed workplace, very flexible work schedule, the management team could use some work in some stores, the hardest part of the job is having to work around the customers in order to do your job properly. The best part of the job were all of the people."
good,"Working with my associates was the most enjoyable part of my job.  Meeting new associates and giving them their orientation.  Enjoyed "
good,"Les collègues forment une équipe agréable à travailler. Cependant les outils de travail sont désuets et souvent insuffisants. De plus les salaires frôlent le salaire minimum. Walmart c'est une transition, pas un avenir."
good,"The Managers frustrate me because there is no consistency. That's all I have to say. The work is hard, but I don't mind it. You make a lot of hardworking friends."
good,During employment as a truck unloader I found it energetic and interesting. The way that Wal-mart is run is interesting in itself. Hours were always certain and given two weeks ahead of scheduled day.
good,Walmart is a great place to start and move ahead in life work hard to support yourself and family. Gives opportunities and a chance to move forward. Very thankful.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of checking customer orders/ picking customer orders, working with members of management to ensure all customer and business needs are addressed."
good,"Ambiente un tanto pesado por las multiples tareas y tiempos para realizarlas a veces flojas otras mas pesadas, se aprende a lidiar con diferentes obstaculos el salario  no es bajo ni alto."
good,Its fun and easy if you can can tolerate random schedule changes. Sometimes you gotta deal with it other times they will work with you through your problems.
good,"I DID WELL THERE. For a long time,got new management and didn't do so well after that. A good place to work is not always the job but its who you work for."
good,Outside of poor management that literally only babysat everyone it was a fun place to work also second shift never does there job. I worked night shift and we always had to pick up second shifts slack every single day
good,"Bonne ambiance, excellents avantages (les assurances sont dures à battre) mais salaire trop peu élevés par rapport au cout de la vie et productivité demandée (j'ai travaillé production de nuit, je ne peux pas dire pour les autres postes)"
good,"This was my first job when I made it to Texas I worked over night stocking shelves. It was a nicefast pace company that always played music which I love. So I got a 2 for 1, I worked and danced all night"
good,It was a great experience an I've learned alot great job an nice environment that u can learn alot from to grow in lufe with to be more responsible at that company
good,i enjoyed working at walmart! The customer service experience has helped me communicate better in life. The managers and other employees were also respectful
good,Working at walmart wasnt too bad I quite enjoyed myself and the people I worked were really great. My only problem with walmart was I got tired pretty quick and being a big guy like me it's to be expected.
good,Walmart helped me build up character! I was never a talkative person nor did I like being around people but working at Walmart and as a guest service agent at Amara Resort and Spa! Definitely made me become the successful person I am today!
good,"Direct and coordinate activities of the restaurant that concerned with production, pricing, sales, or distribution of products."
good,Es una empresa donde puedes empezar adquirir experiencia
good,THis job is a good part time job but wouldnt be something I would want to maintain longterm or for 40 hours a week. Highly customer service based and standing all day can be bothersome.
good,"It's a good job.  Environment kinda sucks, but it pays the bills and gets me by barely.  Wish pay was a little better.  Certain mangers are great to work under some others not so much. I would go back."
good,"Walmart was a good job as far as money went, but they do not spend a lot of time focusing on their new employees. I left because they were not flexible enough with my schedule for me to keep up with school."
good,Walmart is a constantly changing company. They have rules against associates that are being violated by customers being able to fight back or protect themselves. They have policies where a racist or prejudice person can by fired but then rehired but a person who shares their discount card with another associate will be fired and never rehired.
good,"Formas parte de grandes equipos de trabajo, gente comprometida con sus resultados, una empresa con grandes avances en liderazgo y preocupada por la capacitación de los lideres que mueven a los equipos de trabajo..."
good,"I would recommend walmart the benefits are great .the pay is good ,managment needs some work..they have ways for advancement into managment positions."
good,Scanning groceries. Worked the money center with check cashing and money transfers. Customer service. Closing registers with the management team. Ability to multitask.
good,I worked on Cap 2 and the work is hard but good. Need more instruction in beginning. Management is very busy and hard to get time with. I started right after they opened and it has gotten much better as everyone started to figure out their places.
good,"Overall, relatively nice, not much to complain about. Nice people to work with, work environment was alright, could have been better though, not much concern for those with a sickness, or pregnancy problems when under the temp position."
good,"You always had things to do and there was no down time. There was a large staff to help you with any questions. I was a seasonal worker, but they treated me like I was there for a long time and like one of them."
good,"Good staff, okay money i would go back i really had no problems working there at all. it was easy money and i had no real problems besides the customers."
good,I love working there  but they really are not a family company like they once was  I would go back  loved the people that I worked with and the customers
good,"I’ve learned to be more organized, work at a faster pace and make decisions as a team. The hardest part was taking over more tasks when short on people."
good,"Nice people to work with. Lite stress, kind of clicky. I made some great friends and was sorry to leave. Management did play favorites but I pretty much stayed away from all that"
good,Had good hours for almost 3 yrs. Dropped my hours down to 12 so I left. Left me up front alone. Did managerial type stuff. Liked the people and customers I worked with
good,I liked the company system and scheduling. The pay was well which is important. I like my position as an unloader and was motivated to complete tasks.
good,"Retail is fast paced, and always changing  Working in retail gives the opportunity to cross train, and work in many different areas.  This type of environment, helps give skills enabling performance in many tasks, and the ability to help out, when/where needed."
good,A typical day at work is very busy depending on position and management. Right amount of staffing is a vital to make sure work is done on time and efficiently.
good,muy buen personal con el cual entablas aparte de compañerismo una amistad
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart was working full time hrs but didn't receive any full time benifits.i really enjoyed my customers and getting to visit with them. Coworkers were pleasant to be around.
good,"Trabalhei 5 anos nesta empresa e pra mim foi muito gratificante, agradeço pela oportunidade que tive em trabalhar no Walmart.  Obg"
good,"lots of hours,must love people,fast paced,co workers are helpful,able to work the register and promote walmart mastercard,computer training is nice,suoervisors are helpful"
good,I loved working there but it is placed by favoritism at the Chillicothe Walmart but I overall enjoyed my time there and would love to work there again.
good,Very very good company to work for. I enjoyed it throughouly and would work for Walmart any chance I got. I love the environment and loved all my co workers and loved my bosses.
good,"Gran escuela, se aprende mucho."
good,"This job can be really good for college students because they pay at a good rate. The managers are usually really nice people. They are always in need of cashiers, so definitely recommend applying."
good,"every day brings challenges. "
good,I enjoyed it there but it was like highschool with management. But I was able to ignore it for the most part I love the people who would come and they are who .ade my days fantastic
good,I really enjoyed working with the employees and I would have loved to stayed but they wouldn't give me any help or support which I believe is the key factor in a good company
good,"Over all a good place to work. "
good,All the time i worked the evening shift 1-10 pm or 2-11 pm it was usually busy when i clocked in worked the weekends.i learned different type of payments that included how to spot a fake check and counterfeit bills.Management offered me a manager position but i rejected the offer.followed the instructions that management gave me.i learned the environment in the store the hard part of the job is when you request the money when cashiering and your waiting on managers to come to your register to bring what was requested to continue checking out customers but sometimes it can difficult when you don't have the change to give the customers and your waiting on management.The most enjoyable moment is attending the customers
good,"Due to relocation, I feel I can do more. Evry store feels different. I miss my store in eastlake #3516. I miss my co-workers there. Now that I'm in Utah, I want to start a career that will further the knowledge I have gained from walmart in California."
good,"Pay is decent and having understanding management is not typical, luckily for me my last supervisor was very good at showing a good example and being good to his workers"
good,"It's hard to get off of third shift after you start. They have a high starting wage but it's nearly impossible to earn raises. They're very good with breaks, 15 minutes every two hours, an hour for lunch if you work at least six hours."
good,"The distribution center runs like a fine tune machine. Great benefits and good pay. Keep in mind its hard work, no ac, and your performance is tracked by the second. Turn over is crazy I've never see anything like it. But it's because its hard work. Better be in shape and have strong recovery time if your going to order fill."
good,"It was easy and decent money,not much else to say...would have stayed if it was so far out from where i lived family friendly and holidays are a blast there"
good,I stocked in the pharmacy department and helped customers as needed.  I was trained to do this as well as doing stock in the warehouse.  I also did resets when asked to do them.  I also helped put stock up in the HBA sections of the store.
good,Walmart has lots of resources to help you grow to do what you want to do. You are paid well and the benefits are good. It is easy to leave work at work and enjoy yourself on and off the clock.
good,"Had bad management, expected too much, and overall showed major favoritism and lack of care for associates and their requests for advancement and reasonable accommodations."
good,Very good place to work took a lot of good customer service skills with me. I just moved recently looking for employment in the grand forks area. Thank you
good,It’s was a great job but little advance career moves. The benefits was great and the management was good at times. They worked with my hours and time off
good,"I loved my cash register job, didn't mind cleaning & resetting registers, bags or cleaning up aisles. I didnt mind unpacking partial shipping boxes & sorting them into baskets for the departments. What I minded was the inability by management to understand that I was on a restricted hourly budget for each month & could not work over the hours allowed. "
good,"Well the first thing I do when I get to work is get my equipment out of my locker. Then I go to the back and see how much freight I have then I scan my Bins. Then I go out to the floor and zone it (clean it), then I work my freight that's on the floor. I work my price changes. Set mods. Help other department managers if needed. Scan my outs in my department. Put out features. Do my notes from my managers."
good,"Its a job, you make of it what you want. I enjoyed my time there and would go back if i could. Its the co workers and good management that make a job worth staying"
good,"Working for Walmart was fine, it was the management and how none caring, they only ever walked around and complained about our works loads not being finished when they could easily have helped multiple people to make it easier on us and them but most were to busy walking back and forth the store"
good,"Multinacional, com fortes valores culturais, apoio incondicional a inclusão e respeito a diversidade."
good,Dont have really any issues with walmart in pratt. It was fast paced and in enjoyed it but had to move and could not wait for transfer to other store.
good,it was fast paced. they were always holding some kind of competitions for one thing or an other. Always had good prizes. The management was always there to listen.
good,Get full time job. Contract. More experience. Get training and capacitation. Good schedule to have a day to take medical appointment . More cvls to practice
good,Easy to move up in the company with dedication and hard work. hires from inside stores. friendly staff and very helpful. Professional work place and organized environment.
good,"Overall a decent job. The pay is okay but the benefits are good. Very accommodating of my schedule, sometimes. Depends a lot on the manager. Left because was only offered cashier position after remodel and I don't want to cashier. Like most jobs the quality relies a lot on who your direct manager is. It's an average job overall, but a good or bad manager makes or breaks it"
good,It was easy and pleasant. I really like the questions they asked and I was really really happy answering them. I had a wonderful time working for Walmart.
good,This company is a great company to grow with and they work with you if you are looking for something while in school or have 2 jobs. The managers are nice
good,El trabajo es bastante estresante puesto a qué es un trabajo de servicio al cliente directamente más aún debido a que por lo general siempre el staff no está completo
good,"Empresa no geral Boa para se trabalhar sim."
good,"Busy days require a lot more work, but the days go by faster when you're working hard. The other associates also help make the day go by faster and they try to make the day more fun for you."
good,Working at Walmart was very rewarding.  My coworkers were great and the management cared.  The health insurance was very good.  Walmart takes care of its employees.
good,Working there is not bad but a lot of angery customers come there and they blame you need to be calm and just takecare of it with relaxed energy not much to really say
good,I was promoted to cap 2 assistant manager position trained then had to move family court reasons but I learned a lot before I left my special skill is know the hard workers and getting them to work in a calm and easy pace for them do it right and also neat so customers have room to see what we have to sale them hard work and
good,Trabajo nada estresante y bien pagado por trabajar medio tiempo
good,It is a good to gain experience that anyone can start in and grow from. It is Walmart so you do deal with a few characters but overall its pleasant to work there.
good,Was there for almost two years and it was fun while I was there but management was not that good they didn't care much about the employees and there best interest
good,"Cashiers schedules are all over the place.  Because of this, I don't know what day it is.  I'll work one night til 11 pm and have to be at work the next day at 7am.  This isn't easy for me... There are two CSM's that are rude to the cashiers, one of them is just overworked and very stressed out.  Love the other employees and the the breakroom banter.  Also love most of the customers."
good,It wa so jay chill since it was at night some nights you do have to Hussle but all in all wasn’t very hard once you learned and created a routine to stock items
good,"Es una agradable empresa para desarollarse y aprender nuevas cosas, como en todo lugar el trabajo se logra apoyandose en equipo con la gente, lo unico decepcionante (no incluye a todos) son varias personas que tienen como lideres."
good,When it comes to working here you have to have a strong mind because if you don't it can break you. Some of the people are mean and could care less about privacy
good,The most enjoyable  part  of  the  job is helping the customers.  When you help them and they tell you thank you for your help it's a good feeling to know you could  help them.
good,I got lots of hours over the Christmas season and enjoyed the other employees I worked around. Only complaint was back end management was way overworked and definitely needed more assistance during the busy season.
good,"It can be a good place to work, but if you get on the bad side of a manger, it is hard to get out of that place. You must know the right people and be able to talk the right way to get promoted."
good,Walmart is a basic entry level retail job with competitive pay and good hours and benefits but simply had poor management at the time and I at the time--did not have reliable transportation to and from work as it was on the opposite side of my city.
good,"Always busy, Lots of customer and associate drama. A lot of good people work there. I really enjoyed my job and the people.The Store Manager sets the tone."
good,"Walmart is a good job to work for if you’re wanting to experience and learn good customer service skills. However, if you’re not looking to work there for a long time then I wouldn’t really consider it, because you can find other jobs that are more secure."
good,"En bodega aurrera izucar es una empresa "
good,It was a great experience helped me out alot I wasn't very social but this helped me out of my shell and able to be around people and get my work complete
good,j ai bien aime travaille chez walmart beau defi bonus bien
good,This job was not that bad it was actually I good job to have I just get tired of working overnight because after a while overnight start to wear you down slows and I must say for myself I just got tired of doing it in all honesty.
good,It's a fair place to work and I would recommend others to work there. But it wasn't enough for me once they cut hours. I needed my hours and pay but overall I kinda enjoyed the experience there.
good,"It was great at first, but then the manager showed his true colors and did everything he could to prevent me from being considered for a department transfer. He is still the automotive manager, but at a different store. I would work for walmart again, just not for him and I would want to be full time instead of almost full time. The store manager even told my department manager to make me full time, but he refused to do so behind the store managers back."
good,As an assistant manager there is never a normal day. The different days of the week have differnet things to be done. You work more than your scheduled. The store needs to be more important than your personal life. Has good pay for salaried positions.
good,i come in help customers until store closes. when store closed use my pallet jack to go get my load. bring my pallet to the floor and remove items that dont belong. after making sure all items are on shelf make sure that they are neat and able for customers to receive easliy.
good,"Cashier "
good,it was was a good experience and nice too to work until favortism start showing and unfairness it tought be a lot and how to be patient a lot at thing a whole nother way but every one should be treated equally in my eyes
good,"At this job I learned how to scan items, put them in bags that would be easy for the customer to carry, and help the customer with any questions they had. I also learned how to operate the self checkout machines and work at the customer service desk."
good,"Can be counted on to show up every day to work, early and stays late when necessary, to ring up final customers. Consistently meets or exceeds daily productivity standard of scans per hour.  Interacts in a professional manner with customers. Sets fine standard for new hires to follow by leading by example, keeps a well cleaned work area."
good,I interacted with several different people.  By doing so I learned several ways to addresses future issues  head on. I learned a lot about working ethics .
good,Great company for young professionals to learn and grow. Multiple lower level roles to switch between to get cast experience.  The higher the role the more difficult to cross between different types of roles
good,"Good place to work, loved working with the people.  Management made working there more stressful than I feel like it needed to be.  Was not able to communicate well with management."
good,"fast paced and busy environment.  Good chance for advancement if that is what you are looking for.  The customer are pretty good, only a few not so good ones"
good,everyone is friendly and dedicated to there job. The work environment is very safe. The company gives it's employees good benefits and bonuses at times. overall an okay place to work at.
good,Didn't check big dude cough couch such fight book chat such book chat such book fight couch shutcheck got bought fight couch change cough again such f
good,"In charge of classifying merchandise and processing the inventory,  started working in this state, had to leave Tampa for a family matter and once solved decided to go back to Tampa FL"
good,Walmart is a great place to work when you're starting out. However I wouldn't say I enjoyed my time with the company itself.  It seemed as though there were too many rotating managers making it confusing on who to turn to when in need of one. Other then that the job was acceptable. Decorating cakes was definitely an interesting career.
good,I didnt work there long. I was an overnight stocker nothing too fancy. 11pm-6am kinda fast paced and organized. Bonus is time passes by fairly quickly.
good,A typical day of work at Walmart requires cleaning our registers and around our registers.After that we help other team members stock and do their cleaning in between taking care of customers and making sure their satisfied.
good,"Working for Walmart wasn't a horrible experience, but at the same time most of the managers were ungrateful for what could be done. When things didn't get done I would stay late making sure everything was done. They hired employees who didn't care about the job and then wondered why nothing got done."
good,"Good company to work for. Great environment, management was also very good. Scheduling wasn’t the greatest but associates were helpful and dependable. Would recommend Walmart for a work place if your looking long term."
good,"Its like most places, as long as you go to work everyday with a good attitude, ready to work, on time, and don't let the customers get to you you'll be fine."
good,This job was by far one of my favorites. I worked alone most of the time or maybe every once in awhile with a coworker if there was enough people working. It was good paid and pretty easy job.
good,Un excelente trabajo y buen ambiente buenas prestaciones y muchos beneficios
good,great place to work. enjoy all my time with friends there. taught me alot of great things. would continue to work there in the future. would suggest it to anyone
good,"typical american business, fast paced ... always in a rush ... focused in goals, in sellings.. need improve interactions with others cultures people..."
good,"As Store Operator I enjoyed the job. Between freight, telecommunication, walkie-talkies, customers, and fitting room duties, I stayed very busy. The people came and went, but they were all great."
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work as management although when it came to corporate restructuring in the company and the mass layoffs of assistant managers, it was more of a popularity contest then it was a decision based on merit and achievement."
good,I was a cart pusher. My shifts were usually from 3pm to 1130pm or 5pm to 1030 pm. The job is fine but the people you work with might make it harder not to mention the weather.
good,"Met new welcoming people, always having a great time working with them, became sort of my second family. Work isn't that hard, always working as a team."
good,"Great place to work. Management is awesome, co workers get along. Benefits are amazing and close to home. Would definitely recommend it to anyone and I enjoy working here."
good,Es buena empresa y buen ambiente laboral  con prestaciones seguras.
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work. The job its self keeps you busy and in your down time of cashing people out, there's plenty of other things to do. Plenty of room for advancement."
good,"This job was nice when I had it, but with the management team that I had, they looked down on the crew. They care more about the people that were there for a while than the newcomers."
good,"Stocking at Walmart is very easy. Management tries to work you as hard as they can, without giving incentives to work so hard. Rules on how to do your job changed daily it seemed. No one ever seemed happy in the environment."
good,I loved working here when the remodel started. After not so much. My nights weren't as busy as when remodel started. Half the nights we were doing mods half the nights we weren't even though we still had plenty to do. It all depended on whatever the managers wanted us to do.
good,"I loved working for Walmart great staff, great work place,great hours.Thay help you to make the goals and objectives and thay help you make your goals and objectives."
good,I loved working here but some managers need replacing benefits need employment and the way employees are treated by management need improving.  The customers are great
good,"it has always been good working at walmart, they helped me a lot through my school, and my family life. i was able to change my schedule, every semester, i was pregnant and had my baby, they kept my position for me, i was able to transfer with them and i kept my position and wage. i love walmart!"
good,Walmart has great benefits if only they could get better manager's. I would have stayed. Other than that it's a great place and one of the easiest jobs I've ever had.
good,Walmart is a good place to work you just have to be moving in a fast paste and if i was to never move i’ll most likely still be at walmart. You get a discount card after you’re been there for 60 days so that’s pretty cool.
good,"For a career growth in the retail sector, Walmart is an excellent place to start a career, its a huge departmental store with different departments for various day to day functions to learned and used"
good,"When I started we had 3 people that made it run smooth, then after about 3 months it turned into 1 person doing 3 jobs everyday for 10 or more hours.."
good,I looked forward to coming into work everyday because all of my fellow employees were nice and understanding. The managers actually took their time to talk to you before your shift and make sure you were doing alright during those busy times of the store hours. The downsides were the unwelcoming customers and too short of breaks.
good,"Being a department manager at Wal-Mart can be very stressful if you are low staffed, on the other hand Wal-Mart can be a job with great changes to advance in."
good,"Working for walmart requires a lot of time and effort to grow within the company, you learn a lot of retail, sales, leadership "
good,Only problem I had were with the customer service manager's. They really didn't help like they were suppose to. They would have bad attitudes and disappear when the cashier's needed help.
good,"The job I am in On-line shopping is not for the weak or lazy, the job requires heavy lifting throughout the day, walking nonstop on a hard concrete floor, I have tracked my steps and have walked 101/2 miles in a day, soooo If you want to get exercise then this is your job!!!!"
good,This would be a good place for those starting out with work. I would not mind going back to work if the pay was right I'm a mother of five and trying to survive. I was getting paid less than $9 an hour in order for me to survive I'd have to make at least 12 an hour.
good,"Overall, it was an enjoyable and educational experience. I loved my coworkers. Training was available for job position. Wages were comparable to other employers in the area."
good,Start at entrance welcoming customers. I learned how to give services. The culture was employees helping and learning from each other. Management was relaxed and helpful. Most difficult part of the job was standing without much movement. Most enjoyable was meeting the customers.
good,It’s okay gets boring after a while and you have some Walmart’s with better management than others unfortunately I was given The short end of the stick overall a good first job
good,The one thing I like is Walmart works well with my schedule and the pay is always a plus. But of course any retail is hard and when the store doesn’t have enough hours to give people you’ve are always understaffed and over worked. It gets hard going to work especially since I go to school in the morning and then they schedule me late at night.
good,"There would be times where you would get a task to do and that manager would leave, but then another manger would come right behind them and dismiss what they took you to do and have you to something totally different. Its a lot of miscommunication going on and a lot of management that takes their role to the extreme when it comes to talking to their associates. I had a manager come and speak to me in front of customers like i was her child talking very loudly pointing her finger at me. I could have very well spoken back to her in same manner she spoke with me, but i chose not to."
good,you have to be fast know what you are going and know where everything goes. you have a tune limit to finish unloading the trucks if you have 2 trucks you have a short break after you finish 1 truck
good,"The days were really long and my co workers barely helped me gather carts, so basically I was going all the work by myself. The only good thing I liked about working at Walmart was the pay. $11 an hour is really good if your just starting a part time job or something."
good,It’s ok for full n part time. Easy to advance since there are so many stores. Worked 8 years and held plenty different positions to gain all my experience
good,I was a single mother and then raised two sons working at Walmart.  I struggled but I made it happen. I think if I wasn't a member of management I probably wouldn't have been able to do it
good,"It is definitely a job that keeps you on your toes and you always have something to work on. Once you have finished your assignment, if you have questions, there is usually a supervisor that can direct to help in a different area."
good,i absolutely loved my job. And the people I worked with on a daily basis. Just not the management at the location that I worked at. They didn't really work with anybody on anything.
good,"Walmart has great pay and flexible schedules for their employees. The management is great and the staff is polite. Also, we get great benefits such as discounts on general merchandise and paid vacation!"
good,I was trained on the job and got to learn tons of new information! I loved the social interactions with all our patients! My co-workers were good and made my days go by quickly!
good,"Good place to work in a fast always changing environment. Working with numbers, inventory and most importantly helping customers. Management plays the most important role in creating the work culture."
good,Good place to earn good money and if you enjoy helping others than Walmart is a great place to work nice environment good people there always seems to be calm good prices on the merchandise and great deals for employees and also on lunch Also good areas to take break and a lot of raises and advancement oprotunities great place to work
good,I personally don’t think Walmart is a bad place to work. The issue most have is inconsistent management and a lack of communication. There is a lot of good things other than the poor management
good,It was a good job and I enjoyed it a lot. My only complaint is that some of the managers were power hungry ave expected to much when there wasn't enough manpower to do it.
good,"As the Cap Lead Supervisor, I was in charge of the crew that unloaded the consumable/general merchandise trucks. The job came with lots of problem solving. I would start off the day with a plan and have many disruptions as the day went on. Certain things such as, call offs, trucks coming late, spills, and assistance needed in other departments can disrupt the plan. It was my job to perform as well as possible with the resources I had."
good,"Checking cleanliness of the store,any issues that Associates might have, "
good,"Typical day at work: 8 to 5; individual tasks; collaboration wit different departments"
good,"I worked in the Grocery pickup department for nine months. In that time, we switched managers THREE times. This made my job feel a bit impersonal. My dept was the most time-sensitive one, so there was A LOT of everyone tripping over one another, but otherwise it had a generally good atmosphere for a workplace."
good,"I stocked merchandise thru out the entire store so I learned a little bit about each department, I loved working with the public and helping them find what they needed"
good,"Being a Walmart associate is great but there are some downfalls that have been addressed such as, lack of employees, and miscommunication among associates and managers. There are always ways to make a better working environment for the associates and customers."
good,"Took care of customers orders, enjoyed meeting new people and getting to know the regulars that come back every week.  Great atmosphere, everyone I worked with were team players."
good,"I loved the pay and the job itself, but I never went one shift without essentially being verbally harassed by a customer over the simplest of things. For example, if I would let them know that we didn't have an item in stock in our store currently, but would give them the address to the closest one that did, they would yell and complain at you for not having it delivered to them."
good,"Highly demanding workplace, being the top retail company in the world. Walmart as a whole, demands high efficiency in all aspects of the job. Have to be able to meet deadlines consistently, and balance multiple projects simultaneously."
good,Walmart starts off as a good place to work but the way hiring & firing rotates and you meet some good people and not so good people it makes it hard to stay.
good,"Customer friendly, fast paste depending on the day most busy on the weekends Friday & Saturday, fair management, team effort between co-workers. Everybody’s happy to help"
good,"Wal-Mart was not by any means a bad place to work at, it just wasn’t for me. And on top of that with the problems I was having with my knee at the time definitely didn’t make it anymore enjoyable"
good,"Precisei desenvolver melhor a minha resiliência, ambiente bastante agitado, clima organizacional desafiador, houveram muitas mudanças repentinas."
good,Walmart is a productive and progressive workplace. It requires you to collaborate with other employees and customers. It offers you a chance to build your communication skills.
good,"No período em que trabalhei no Walmart sempre recebi meu salário em dia, a comida ao qual pagamos uma parte poderia melhorar, empresa boa."
good,"Always put the customer first when engaging in daily activities. You must be flexible in order to get the job done and overtime is a must, even though its a salary position."
good,your work day will be busy sometimes and slow at times. be prepared during the holidays. the management honestly just depends on the people. hardest part of job would have to be customers who get angry when someone has alot of groceries and you have to remind them you are going as fast as you can.
good,I enjoyed my job at walmart it was easy and there was never a dull moment. Walmart is a busy place so I was always meeting new people and have a chance to help them so I felt good working there.
good,Casual work environment but high tech programs and opportunity to learn new skills and advance.  Management could be a little stricter alot of wasted time by associates.  Good team events
good,"Completing paperwork. Meat received is identified by the percent of lean in the product. These percentages typically range from 50% to 98%.  For example, the meat with the least lean is called 50’s. Most meat is delivered fresh cut in 2,000-pound fiberboard containers; however, occasionally we get meat, which is frozen and packaged in 60-pound boxes. This product is high lean content. "
good,The Walmart I work for is a college town so everyone is expected to have a wide availability.   It is a good place to work.  Most of the people are great.
good,"My background is education and biology so this allowed me to help pharmacy customers with their needs, When I was not sure about an answer I would take them to pharmacist. In general merchandising I stocked and was also on the floor to help customers find their items. Customer service was satisfying. I was part time, but hours were not consistent at times. I do realize though that this is the nature of part time."
good,Working for Walmart was pretty fun as long as you work with the right people. It was very fast paced and for the most part as long as I did my job the upper management left me alone.
good,"The typical Cap Team II day is pretty easy. You just put things where they go then move them and put them where they belong once again. It was so easy in fact we had no supervisor for most of my time there and for much of the time my coworker were there. Slacking coworkers was the most annoying part, but otherwise it was a pretty mellow experience of putting products where they belong on repeat in different areas."
good,This is a high volume pharmacy! The systems they have in place really makes the volume manageable. The only downfall for working with walmart is that they have very short lunch breaks and will write you up if you go into overtime.
good,"Working as a cashier at Walmart was very interesting. There would be different personalities all day, throughout the day. Sometimes you would get not so happy people as well. But for the most part I had a good time at Walmart"
good,The company is a great company to work for. Be sure to work at a store with great management. That will cover all determine your experience working there
good,"Good benefits, but terrible management, at least in my experience. Some weeks I'd work every day and sometimes I'd go 8 days or more without any shifts. Eventually they stopped giving me shifts all together because of a 'glitch' in the scheduling system."
good,Walmart is an alright place to work. You are able to make a career working at Walmart. They will work with you somewhat concerning your schedule. If you work on the front end you will be on your feet all the time.
good,"Flexible schedule for students. Enough breaks given. Fast-paced environment, and mostly hands-on. Independent work, but require mobility and long standing."
good,During my time working for Walmart I learned n gained a lot. No everyday wasn’t easy but I pushed through it was a great start to my working life. I will take all I’ve learned with me on my new journey.
good,"Read labels, stock merchandise,use cardboard compactor, use box cutter, use pallet jack, sweep work area, help customer find merchandise, finding merchandise in right location"
good,"Llevar la mercancía del almacén a las góndolas "
good,"A typical day at work was pretty easy. If we were properly staffed for the day, everyone would handle their duties as normal. We would get breaks based on how long the shift was, and what time the associate came in. If we were understaffed which we often were things would get more hectic. Sometimes I would be working two or three sections at once when lines were long and breaks would get pushed back a bit further. While I was there I learned that being part of a team not only means doing your part, but helping fill in the line when something is missing, or when another team member is having an off day. "
good,"Pay is nice for minimum work and not needing experience. Management is either very helpful or not. Say availability is top priority but they will try to sneak around it. Job is easy, if not understaffed. They do take any form of harassment Extremely serious so I always feel safe wormong there."
good,"Definitely an extremely easy job. Pay is very generous considering the work done. Not a job for anyone who dislikes interacting with people. Interacting with people constantly for hours really takes a toll on your mental health after a while.  But on the other hand, a literal child could do this job so it's really up to personal preference. I'd recommend."
good,"Walmart has changed over the years. Some for better and some for worse. I recommend it for people looking for a solid job. Advancement has proven to be a challenge, as company advancement is based on more who you know, not as much job performance."
good,Great fast paced place to work. Well paid for the hard work I put in.  Production environment but encouraged competition and also encouraged the open door policy.   They were Always open to new ideas.
good,Typical day at work wasn't very hard. You'd go to work at 10pm check and see how much freight you have. The job really taught me how to manage my time and finish my work more effectively. Management was nice they were very helpful.There wasn't really anything hard about the job and the most enjoyable thing about the job would be the praise you'd get. gdexcellentdoinexcellent job and finishin
good,"Clock in when I was supposed to"
good,if you need a seasonal job this is the place. they work well with your schedule and have a good system for getting paid and for calling off or taking other positions.
good,"Lots of changes happening there.  Was glad to have a job at the time.  No excuses for being sick or not being to work on time, no doctors notes accepted.  Expect weekend work every weekend."
good,"U derstamdthat basic family emergency happen."
good,great place I am being forced to do this review or else I cant continue to searcg for jobs. it also states theters.  review must be a minimum of 150 charac
good,At first I didn't like it cause it was my first night job but as the months rolled over I got use to it and the work was hard work the only bad part was lazy workers
good,It payed well but the hours were very inconvenient with my current school schedule so I had to quit. The work was pretty fast paced and repetitive at times.
good,great company to work. managers are very cool. co workers are cool. I have learned how to handle cash register and technology that use for photo lab and electronic.
good,"It's not that bad, most of the managers is pretty understanding, it depends on which department you work in. Most of the associates are pretty nice as well as the managers"
good,"During my time working for Walmart I learned a lot about the retail industry and was able to work my way into the ranks of management. The Walmart culture does a wonderful job at promoting and encouraging enthusiastic go-getters while keeping productive workers happy and secure in their jobs. The lack of flexibility in work hours allows for the company to maintain a positive work culture and provide benefits and stable wages to its employees. If you are planning on having another job or going to school while working for Walmart, I would recommend being upfront with your needs during the interview process and be very productive when you work."
good,your work day starts as soon as you walk in till you leave. its a very fast pace work environment. you have to be ready to service your customers with the best customer service.
good,"Un día típico en Walmart es trabajar en cooperación con mis conpaneros para poder realizar todas las tareas y darle servicio al cliente para facilitar búsquedas y dar opciones."
good,"Almacenaje de productos, acomodo de mercancía y ubicar productos antiguos para merma, y pasar los productos nuevos hacia atrás y los próximos a caducar hacia delante"
good,"What I learned working at Walmart,  was how to check inventory, work in a fast paced environment, working overnight for the first time was overwhelming"
good,"Walmart is only terrible on the weekends through Monday. Tuesday-Thursday is great. However the weekends are never, and will never be staffed appropriately."
good,"Es una empresa en donde se trabaja en equipo y constantemente lo están capacitando a uno y lo más importante es que la seguridad tanto para los clientes cómo para los asociados,además de mantener precios accesibles para toda la comunidad,ósea qué cumple una función social."
good,A good job where you are able to learn alot if you have the drive to do so. However there are alot of changes that happen higher up in the company where it is difficult to move up quickly.
good,"Good place to work. "
good,"If you work day time there's some wiggle room to move between positions but not much. However, If you work overnights, you have many different responsibilities between stocking, maintenance, modular resets."
good,Customers varied between good and bad. Learned out to the job while working. The hardest part was angry customers. The most enjoyable part was the job.
good,"Wal-Mart gets a bad rap a lot of times. Every job has its perks and its problems and Wal-Mart is no different. If you just want to show up and do your job, its fine."
good,Walmart was always busy or you was always busy doing something lunch breaks and 15 min breaks was provided along with a break/lunch room to go to  was a easy job overall
good,"It a decent place to work as a first job. "
good,"Wal-Mart does pay fairly well so i did start at $11.50 as a 17 year old, and the jobs they ask you to do are never too demanding to not be worth it but the downside is it seems the majority of people that work there aren't typically very happy about it."
good,It’s an okay place to work at. It’s a great starter job. The training leaves something to be desired but it’s a great job for high school students. I would recommend it.
good,"As a CSM the job is not as easy as it looks. You have to manage all cashier break schedules, make sure customers are served according to Walmart’s one best way. Fast Friendly and Fresh. Management will always give you tasks to do which might interfere with work you are currently assigned to. Overall Walmart is a great company to work with."
good,"Ok work place ,good environment , but manager dnt really kno how to manage nd the really be running around with there heads cut off.... But overall a ok place to wrk..."
good,"It's an okay company with decent benefits and a comparable pay rate. Open availability is best."
good,At Walmart there were racial situations with customers and managers/csm’s. Overall walmart was decent and had  good pay but towards the end of me working there I seen racial situations.
good,I enjoyed working over night maintence except with 1 night manager alway wanting to do things her way and her was most of the time wrong and time consuming not allowing us to finish our regular tasks on time. Other than that I really enjoyed working there.
good,I am an optician at Walmart. It's a great and easy job. I love helping people and seeing them smile after the try on their glasses and can finally see better.
good,Depending on which department you work in it is a really cool place to work. One of the best jobs I've had. I recommend trying out for yourself and seeing how it works out.
good,When you get there. You go and click in and since I worked night shift I sat in the break room because we have a meeting first. After the meeting we go and do are work.
good,Los horarios eran alternos pero un ambiente de trabajo muy bueno.
good,A typical day at Walmart for a stocker was putting to goods on the shelf in the designated area you were assigned too. I usually would do housewares and on specific days I would help with unloading the truck. There was many friendly employees that were easy to work with and helped you when needed.
good,"Walmart is a fun workplace, fast paced with on the job training. Always room to advance. Always room to work in other sections of the store. Access to computers for more knowledge of the store and area of interest."
good,It is a great place to work which teaches you core values and beliefs and instills a hard working attitude. It challenges you think upstream and supports innovative ideas.
good,"Was a good place to work at, the employees were friendly and easy to work with. If you need help, the Managers are there to help you. All in all a good job."
good,It’s a nice place to work but the management could be a little better. Some of the supervisors are quite nice. A welcoming team to joins. You can advance when they see you’ve earned it.
good,Great management at my location and busy as well. Weekends were typically very fast paced and the most difficult part of the job since other departments would need additional assistance.
good,I would recommend for people to come to Walmart and work . The job was very easy and they helped you when needed . I loved that job and would go back if it’s possible .
good,If you want to move up you better be ready to work. Always changing work . The most secure job in the job market today ... Walmart is not going anywhere anytime soon.
good,"Horarios rolados,apoyo con vale electronico,ahorro de caja,prestaciones,vacaciones,premio de puntualidad,premio por ser el mejor vendedor,al año una evaluacion para aumento de salario,utilidades,aguinaldo,comvivio  "
good,"It was good. People were as supportive as possible, always willing to train and teach you things to get in the hang of. There are really nice people to work with as well"
good,Walmart was a great place to work as far as pay goes. It was just hard to advance and there were times when you would work harder than the rest of your peers and they got more recognition than you.
good,"Overnight work , it work very good if you are full time associate, poor  management, very stressful job because they expects impossibles tasks every day for everyone. It good to begin with more if it is gonna be your first job"
good,I worked there for two years and had the best management team. Most of the other associates at this location and very friendly and easy to talk to. You can also move around a lot here and explore new areas of interest within the store.
good,Working at Walmart is working at walmart. It had its good and bad days. Coworkers make it fun. The salary is very low for a cashier as they make the business run. They need to pay more.
good,It was a great work place atmosphere. Friendly co-workers and great management. Very fasted pace at times but also it is a job depending on if you are working slow or fast.
good,Management can be a bit all over the place. Most of the staff are good to work with but the way people progress to higher positions seems strange and often doesn’t seem to make sense. Overall good to work for.
good,"If you want to know what it’s like working third shift, I would start with Walmart. Easy pace most of the time but occasionally there are nights where you have to be on your A game which doesn’t require as much as it would in a factory."
good,Will get opportunities to work on new technologies. A typical day at work include morning scrum meeting followed by technical discussions and then working on the user stories assigned.
good,The availability to work can be determine by you.  The time you are scheduled to work is monitored by the home office.  Management do not take the time to train associates.  Associates are on their own to find the answers to their questions.
good,"The work environment is nice, everyone lends a helping hand when you need it, the managers try there best to supply you with the materials needed to do your job"
good,"Don't have much to say about walmart. The pay was horrible for having to do so much work the machines where always going down, angry customer. overall a great leaning experience."
good,"Good paying job, great opportunities for bettering yourself. Management can be a bit frustrating, and customers can be confusing but overall a good first time job."
good,Walmart is a decent place to work if you don't mind fast paced work environment and hard work at same time I was a truck unloaded and sorted out the merchandise and put it on shelves
good,Work as hard as your management team works for you best tip for survival do your job and go home communication rules the nation be careful what you say out loud
good,"O Walmart é ótima empresa é uma companhia que dá muita oportunidade. "
good,"It works quite well only that they must review the competence of managers, managers who can be impartial and fair in decision making, work distribution and ability to perform at work."
good,Great for teaching you how to deal with people and develop people skills. And great for learning all the entry level things about working retail and management
good,"un dia normal es cargar, estibar y emplayar, estar checando productos, cargas bastante, pago en la noche es lo mismo que en la tarde y en la mañana"
good,"Come on breaks on time, work hard , less points as possible, adapting to job titles , good customer service,flexibility,Displaying your issue, accepting improvements"
good,I would love to get back to work at what i do best and a place that feels like home. But i had to move for better choices for my family. They hours were great I made some good work relationships and the training staff was very helpful.
good,Everyday was a good day for me with the employees.They can do better at woodville Walmart with managers . I actually learned a lot about talking to customers
good,"A Good Company, Everyone there is very respectful, their helpful and very co-operative. They help you out with your schedule and with everything you need."

good,"Excellent co-workers, team environment, fast paced, Interesting customers, no set schedule for associates, difficult to become full time employee, good job"
good,Walmart is a dope place to work but sometimes youd get done with tour work and need to find something to do. I dont like being cashier so id choose to stock
good,"Intensely customer forward facing. Retail is not for everyone. It can be a career for those who can accept retail. It is stressful, but you can have fun."
good,"Managers are well involved and supportive. I've learned better time management and how to work better as a team. Workplace is friendly and easy going, employees have the freedom to express their selves while maintaining professional."
good,"If you want full-time work, apply for a full time position from the jump. Most walmart start people part time but if you're already on board as FT, they arent allowed to lower you to PT! The work was not bad, but expect to be on your feet 95% of your shift. I started at $11/hr and now I'm at $12.34. I started as CAP 1, I am in online grocery now. They don't pay a wage you can live on but it's something."
good,The job was easy for the pay. If you worked nights sometimes you would get sent to electronics to watch that department. After 3 months you receive a discount card for 10% off purchases.
good,I worked for this company as Customer Service Associate and Cashier both full-time and part-time. They were able to fulfil my employment needs for either positions.
good,"I learned how to work in a fast pace environment and under preassure. I learned to be organized, work as a team with my other coworkers, work on customer service."
good,"I work a lot of Departments, work was consistent. Do a good job and you get a raise. Pretty basic. Customers are interesting. You get to see the season changes thru retail."
good,I consider it more of a starter job. Most are overworked and underpaid. Everyone does what they want. The night shift is horrible. Some people work and others stand around chit chatting.
good,It’s ok working there but i would like better hours and a better pay. Managers need better communication skills. I like working here but I prefer a better job
good,Very laid back management. HR great! Not too bad customers.good benefits for part time employee. Down side Not enough hrs though only 12 hrs per week.
good,"Es un buen lugar, te agarran detodologo, pero si aguantas te suben el puesto rápido"
good,I would recommend this. Great company to work for. You can find you career at this company. Not a hard job and the benefits are pretty good. I became a manager within a year of working there.
good,"This was one of the most fun jobs I’ve had. Now that I’ve done other jobs and got paid more, I wish they would pay more at Walmart. I would definitely go back!"
good,It was a nice and friendly place of business . Must be a hardworker and want to work. There are many ways to grow in this company. There are also many benefits.
good,"Working at walmart was an enjoyable experience except that they scheduled you around the clock. They frequently went outside of your availability making it difficult to adhere to their attendance policy. Nonetheless, Walmart will suck the life out of you if you have a life which is why I left. I can't be scheduled to work every weekend with a weird combination of days off and never being able to leave at my scheduled time. It became too much."
good,My job along with more than 600 more employees is being relocated to an offsite contractor.  I am in Phase 1 of 5 phases where our jobs are being relocated.
good,"A typical day at work involves checking out and assisting customers from the start of your shift to the end."
good,I never work in Walmart so I’m lost but I would love to work in Walmart it seem more peaceful and moved Quicker I feel like Walmart it ahead of they game
good,"The only negative comment I would have about my previous employer is that the company eliminates positions often, job security is uncertain. The culture of the company if family orientation, That was the best part of my experience with Wal-Mart the people and culture."
good,"Es una gran empresa con políticas y procedimientos cimentados, me gusto el apoyo y trato que se le da a cada integrante del equipo.la satisfacción de dar un buen servicio."
good,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart until I had to transfer back home because of family illness and my hours and days were cut. I enjoyed helping people at the service desk and also around the store.
good,This job is good for gaining experience in customer service and organization skills as well as prioritizing multiple tasks and utilizing the tools around
good,"As a fulfillment associate, it requires a lot of hard work and time management to perform daily tasks at Walmart. Workplace culture at Walmart is like any other retail workplace culture."
good,Work the floor to help cusotmers with items and point them in the direction that they should go. Work the cashier register  when the cashier was short.
good,You go in at 9pm n leave at 7am . They expect for you to take out the stuff u need to stock. And sometime everything need to go out.  Their was about 9 pallets or more u would get .
good,i loved working here my only problem was they didnt allow sick days. i got extremely sick and got doctors notes but they failed to tell me in orientation that doctors notes dont mean anything here! i was pointed for each day i missed even with the note
good,I would go back to walmart. I just had a little hardship that caused me to leave but it is truly a good company to work for. They have good benefits and the job is not hard. The hours can be negotiated but Wal-Mart is a great company.
good,Very easy starter job after finishing high school. Management very supportive of learning new departments. Worked for Wal-mart twice. Second time there was because I knew it would be an easy job for in between finding a more permanent career
good,"I did get trained by a very good csm, I feel like she helped me a lot to learn an give the customers a good Walmart experience. I loved my managers, I felt like they could have done their job a little bit better than what they would do occasionally. I loved my main boss, she made me feel welcomed the first day I had my interview. I had knew from that point I had a found a group of great, hardworking people to work with. I feel like working at Walmart helped me a lot in life. Made me realize I do love working with people an putting a smile on the customers face."
good,"The job isn’t really difficult but at times it can be stressful due to what the work load is for that day, the amount of people scheduled to work, and members of management."
good,"Nothing was ever the same as far as your duties for that day, only that it followed the minimum job description.    Management vary depending on the day, some were better than others"
good,This job is not hard but it is very productive. You have a lot to do in 8 short hours so you have to be able to figure out how to get it all done. If your good with working with people i would highly recommend it.
good,Walmart is a busy place and a great place to work but you have to move around a lot. That’s the bad part but the good part is they will give you a raise for just moving around
good,"I liked working at Walmart. I love working & meeting new people. My favorite part was at customer service, learning more ways to work on the registers."
good,"Walmart does not like to hire full time so if you're looking for a laid back, good job with great benefits for part time employees, you've found it! Just know that it is very possible that your hours will be remarkably cut- especially if you work on the sales floor."
good,Muito bom de trabalho com valores aus funcionários
good,Good benefits good place to work depending on the location depends on how much they pay you and also the position you work but other than that it’s good
good,Good job ! Love working as a cashier . Loved ringing up people items and communicating with them! Didn’t like that employees didn’t keep things at the job professional
good,I would actually love to work at Walmart again loved all the Co worker got along with everyone including others managers just had a problem with one worked their 8 mts but let me go on points but had a Injury and haded been released but doctor if I had those points would have come off but they let me go before they did but I would like to have my job back just at another location
good,Pretty easy and laid back environment and pay is good too. The pay is about 11 and hour as a cashier and you get hired as part time but you get about 70-80 hours every two weeks
good,Friendly work environment with caring Management not a back breaking work place busy all day no down time always work to be done with some customer service on the side
good,It’s a nice place to work at but they need better management I was one of they good workers I did what I was told was never disrespectful always respected my managers and co workers
good,You can advance fast working for this company. From stocker to management less than two year's. If that's what you want. It can be a stressful job at times but what job ain't.
good,I have been with this company since 2010 and I enjoy it but its time for me to move on in life  I want to work at a hospital to learn new things and grow with that company just like I did with Walmart I have nothing bad to say about Walmart great company to work for
good,This company is just like any other big company everyone is replaceable but you get out of it what you put into it. Unfortunately I found out the hard way because I was hit by lightning while on the job and suffered a lot of injuries for it and that's when you find out how little the company part comes in and takes over.
good,great place to work. Managed multiple people. Loved working there had to move out of state to take care of family issues just moved back and ready to work again. I think I want to try something new that's why I am applying for this job
good,"Working at walmart helps you work in a more fast pace manner. Working here definitely helps you learn how to multitask also. Some days are very busy, and other days are a easy walk through."
good,A great place to work in terms of structure and demographic. I enjoy the multiculturalism and the fact that you get to interact with people from different walks of life.
good,adquirir bastante experiencia. Pouca oportunidade de crescimento.
good,"Its Wal-mart, its a retail job. So there are positive and negatives working a retail job. Its been a few years since I worked there. I was fired back in 2016. Some of the ways things were done are different. Hours can vary from week to week. That is the biggest problem there. Pay isn't bad, but not the best. You have to deal with the public so there is that. Mangement isn't too bad. They do get pressure from home office. So they can be pushly at times. Some stores are good to work at , others not so much. Its retail so things change all the time."
good,A typical day of work consists on scanning pallet tags and transporting pallets within the dry warehouse to slot locations.  On average I haul 200 pallets a shift and I'm able to meet all of my production goals.
good,Walmart is a great place to work only if you're ready to work it is a fast paced job in which you have to make productivity every day or if you fall behind you will get written up  and another great thing about Walmart is the benefits and 41k which is all great things but you become quickly topped out after 5 years unless you do get promoted in which I was giving the opportunity.  And giving  opportunity  I would work there again
good,One of the best places I’ve worked associate wise but work wise i feel like we could have been paid more than it was plus the managers not all but most of them was kind of obnoxious
good,I thought it was a great customer service experience. I liked working as a cashier they give really good hours. The breaks were nice because you use to get a full hour
good,"Not that bad of a place, job just got stagnant as there was almost no advancement. the associates were great and the team i worked with was some of the best ever"
good,"Walmart is a good place to work, but with all of the changes happening it’s hard to know where the department managers will go and the assistant managers."
good,"Aprendi bastante."
good,I Honestly don't think that Walmart cares  about the employee all that matters to them is work. They never really takes time to figure what's the problem when two employees can't get along together
good,"great staff, good for people seeking team orientated positions, very understanding staff and open to suggestions on how to improve the work place and customer service."
good,Work for Walmart if you are single at first advance to where you want then start a family. Has great benefits and pays well at start. Has great deals to help you develop skills.
good,"Check out customers in a timely matter, interacting with customers, be friendly to customers. When not helping customers, you clean register, zone area and redline."
good,depending on what position you have depends on the tasks that are given.Some managers can be more understanding of situations than others.The work is not difficult to do.the only thing I didnt like was that my schedule wpuld always change without notice.
good,"I recommend working for Walmart, everybody is very professional and nice. I enjoyed it alot, made friends, connections with customers, and I'd suggest to anyone who needs a start in life to work there."
good,It was fast paced and the people the were great to work with. The hardest thing about this job was getting your merchandise out before dayshift arrived.
good,I loved the management and the people here. it was a great first job to have and if I could I would probably still work there. I unfortunately wasn't getting the hours I needed to support myself which is the only reason I left.
good,I worked as a cashier and later in the fashion department. I loved at cash counter because I love customer dealing and talking to people. Working in fashion was boring. There was no manager in fashion department for couple of months.
good,It was a good place to work for with a good atmosphere of people as well. The only part I didnt like were my hours were set in stone and it varied on the week but other than that I had no issues.
good,"Shoveled cement and other materials into portable mixers; and mixed, poured, and spread concrete"
good,worked  there for 8 years enjoyed most of it going through a lot of departments I enjoyed my time there but as time went on the management and cooperate mentality set in and was not a good place to work
good,Me gusto trabajar en esa empresa solo que me tuve que salir por cuestiones familiares
good,"Job security is great. Wonderful people work here. I loved working with the people I worked with, and the bosses are wonderful. It doesn't feel like work when you're surrounded by joyful people!"
good,I hated walmart it was not that great . they treat there employees like not good for all that you do i worked overnights. they work you even harder. this job
good,"fue una grata experiencia de trabajo, aprendí mucho"
good,"Overall, working here was a good experience.  There were changes in how things were managed that created a larger divide between employee and upper management, leaving store managers caught in the middle."
good,"As retail goes, you should know what you're getting yourself into going into this job. However Walmart as a whole is very. Understanding when it comes to the needs of its employees and are willing to meet them Half way depending on circumstances with the company's rules and regulations."
good,Management was always good to me. Liked my co-workers. Had good hours as a department manager.  The pay was not great and raises were poor but that may be better now.
good,Besides the upper staff the working environment was great. I was  simply tasked with taking cart and putting them back in the garage for consumers. Simple.
good,Um ótimo lugar para trabalhar onde eles dão oportunidade para o associado crescer na empresa aprendi muito a trabalhar como fiscal de prevenção e perdas.
good,It’s a good company to work for besides sometimes it could be a lot but overall it’s a good job to have rather it’s part time or full time. It’s a pretty chill job
good,"Empresa ótima, benefícios ótimos, ambiente agradável, ótimos profissionais."
good,The atmosphere is cool yet stressful. It is a fast paced environment with about thousands of customers coming in and out the store. Managers are helpful and always ready to teach you stuff that will benefit your position
good,Great start to my career and I found advancement easy early on. Great feedback and encouragement from managers and staff. Great people to work with and spend time with.
good,"Aprendi muito no walmart, como me comportar e como me desenvolver profissionalmente."
good,"I liked working for walmart, it was fast and easy and I liked talking to new people as more and more customers came into my line. The hardest part of the job, was the returns since the store was always changing. The easiest was the checkout process."
good,Walmart has a terrible reputation for how it treats their associates a d most of those claims are false as far as I have witnessed. It's the managers and customers that really set the tone on how awful your experience is going to be working here. The benefits are nice. I particularly love my vision insurance. I do recommend Walmart to my friends.
good,It's good working conditions. I liked the people there. I just didn't like working graveyard shifts. It something that was hard for me to to adjust to.
good,You get out of it what you put in. Enjoy working there.... Hope that there is an opportunity to advance with the company in order to make it a career.
good,One shift may be early morning the next might be that same night close to when you got off work. The trainers and the workers were very understanding and helped as much as they could. You can apply for another position in the store that dose pay more and gives more stable hours.
good,The days where long & the customers was very friendly .Well sometimes. Most days where easy & fast pace! Working there makes time go by fast because it’s non stop working & I like that.
good,"Working for Walmart was a life changing experience. You can learn so many trades and grow."
good,"Walmart is a very good place to work. They offer so many benefits, and are very understandable with your schedule. The work load is pretty easy somedays, but can get sometimes very stressful."
good,This job taught me more about customer service. Customers often come in with a bad mood but the best was to work around that is to conversaré with them and make sure they get what they need.
good,Very productive yet management was horrible you never knew what boss is your immediate boss. I work was easy yet expect a lot to get done in a very short time.
good,The job was ok it just wasn't enough hours or benefits and the manager wasn't willing to give me the opportunity to experience other career pathways that I was interested in.
good,"This job was awesome and loved working here. I was going through a lot of family issues going on while working here, I missed a lot of days due to the family issues."
good,"there is always plenty of work in majority departments of the store. though it is a fair paying job, working does come with the position. the hardest part of it would be being consist with keeping up speed throughout your shift."
good,"Pros"
good,I worked for walmart and to me it was more of a job for teenagers because the hours change a lot some times you get full time hours and some days you get hardly any.
good,"On a typical day you would unload and stock items. As far as what I learned, I learned how to work fast and smart to be on time with completing task. Honestly management was poor at times and other times acceptable. The other associates were good hard working people and they encouraged me and others to work hard."
good,Pay rate has been risen but hours are cut dramatically. Supervisor and upper management is ever changing; you never know if you have a position that you have worked hard for or if you are being forced to take a large cut in pay and step down.
good,"The job is a good place to start in the retail field, and a good place to learn a lot about how big companies work in the sales area. Management varies greatly but for the most part they’re all wholesome people just like we are."
good,"Checking out customers, bagging, customer service, etc. Did not have the best management, but gave good pay. Mostly stayed upfront and/or did returns."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Walmart, most coworkers were layed back they were very flexible for me. I enjoyed working with furniture freight I enjoy lifting heavy and my manager always gave me the best rating."
good,Its a great place to work. Competitive pay good benefits. Its inside a warehouse so it does get hot. Room for advancement. Overall it's not a bad place to start a career.
good,"Good company to work if you have the right management. Pay is decent, if you have retail experience it’s good. Not a bad job if you are starting off in retail."
good,No matter where you work at Walmart they will keep you busy your entire shift. The management could do more to help out but that is the policy for them.
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart, it was a nice easy going job with great people. The only reason I stopped working there is because the store manager got replaced with a new manager that wanted to change everything about the store."
good,Truly enjoyed my ten years at Walmart but some things with end management could be different. I truly thought of them as my family until I got sick and I felt very unappreciated by my store only a few associates should conceals checked on me not any management.
good,"Unload trucks ,stock shelves   worked in Meat department ,Worked in dairy and in electronics department . i learned how to keep the store in a moving timely  clean fashion .Gained forklift license"
good,"Everyone goes to walmart , it’s a great place to get what you need for the right price! However , the company does get a little too ahead of themselves on security."
good,"This job is fast paced, lots of benefits and overall a good place to work although I would not recommend for the older crowd as I would average 20k steps a day in my 8 hour shift. The pay is good I’m my opinion ($11.50hr)"
good,NEVER AGAIN will I work there. Poor management and dosent treat workers how they are supposed to be treated. Lack of motivation and will never recommend to anyone.
good,"Walmart is an awesome company to work for . I did leave because the lack of hours I was receiving, but I was a minor at the time. The company has a great way of setting everything up."
good,Poor management has run down morale. Company is constantly changing quicker than needed. Always room to move up if you are motivated. Pto is fair although this is a new policy
good,Make sure the sales floor clean and apperal section go through it with the push broom n the bathrooms make sure it has hand soap toilet paper clean toilets n when you get a spill u got to clean it up as well n make sure it's not sticking or wet that can cause a accident
good,"A typical day, we had to make sure the floors was clean and wax, it's just managers was not on one accord when it came to directions, but my coworkers was great"
good,Work atmosphere was great. The fellow staff members were very friendly and approachable. Walmart taught me how to manage and how to properly train and evaluate people.
good,"In Saint Clair Pa. the employees were friendly and easy going,helpful. Managers were working managers with a positive outlook on our work plus our store family. Questions were answered in minutes and problems were always having solutions."
good,"Walmart in Farmington ME is an okay place to work. Great co workers, wonderful customers, but the management seriously sucks. I was fired over one accidental typo, because the managers are super strict and even making one mistake near them makes them come down hard on you."
good,"Not a bad company to work for. "
good,Co-workers were awesome but the management at the store is what lead to me and many others leaving. The store was in a bit of a sorry shape as well but everyone was very friendly most of the time.
good,"I had to prevent theft & refund fraud, by checking customers, receipts, and be very knowledgeable & observant to my surroundings, stay alert & on my toes, & not put anything past anyone.........."
good,"I enjoyed working with the staff at WalMart. The pharmacists, technicians, and pharmacy clerks were great to work with. I liked that WalMart provided computer based learning to each employee to help with diversity and keep every employee on the same page especially in Pharmacy department."
good,It’s fast paste and your always doing something productive but you have an hour lunch and two 15 minutes breaks on the clock it’s a lot to do but it’s easy after you know what your doing
good,"buena empresa excelente ambiente , solo que me slai debido a que batallaba con el transporte y el salario no cubria mis nececidades"
good,"You are considered very ""replaceable"" at Walmart.  Great place to work and great people, but there is no job security.  This creates a culture of constant fear and anxiety which makes it difficult to work."
good,Benefits where a 10% discount my days requested months in advance whee ignored no real open door policy and the schedule was. Everywhere. With a child a set schedule is needed and no real compassion for employers.
good,They help you understand what you need to do. They also are very understanding with new associates. I liked everyone of the higher up people in the company.
good,"I feel that during my time with this company, I am not only enhancing my customer service skills but learning patience. We provide services to a diverse group of customers which gives us as employees the opportunity to come up with different yet effective ways to deliver memorable customer service."
good,"I would recommend this place to others for a few reasons. One if you like a fast paced job and working with the public, which has its pros and cons, than you will like it there. Second the employees there are fairly easy to get along with. They expect like every job for you to pull your own weight and be dependable. Finally there is always someone in management that you can address if a situation needs to be dealt with."
good,Working overnight at Walmart is nice there’s not a lot of people around during the night so you are able to be more time efficient at work as well as helping other employees
good,"Everyday is different, some more difficult then others. Ive learned how to engage with customers and associates, how to listen first and then ask questions. Some managers are more helpful then others. You build relationships with your regular customers."
good,"A typical day at work starts with a big challenge that requires you to brainstorm a plan on how to handle it, in order to have a productive day. Communication is also a big par of my day to keep my team and managers on the page at all times."
good,Communication was very important at walmart. Team work is also another big factor that played a part at walmart. Working front end as a Self check out host/ cashier gave me excellent customer service skills.
good,"So many possibilities if you take control of your own career.  Great exposure to a true huge company experience. If you can't make it here, you're not paying attention."
good,"Es una de la mejores empresas con las que he podido colaborar, pues el área de comunicación es prioridad y de un alto rendimiento."
good,I miss my co workers more than anything. Customer are crazy no matter what line of work you're in. Mandatory breaks and lunches were nice. Their insurance was too expensive for me. The discount card after 90 days was nice.
good,"The store is clean, co-workers are friendly and very helpful, and overall a great work environment. Management works hard to make sure the store is neat."
good,So I would occasionally sit down from time to time but the job was pretty fair from what I thought but the managers could have been a lot better with there attitudes
good,"i would walk in get changed into my uniform, clock in go into the garage area and start doing oil changes, tire rotations, the works really. i learned i had to watch out for myself no one cared about the job like i did. management was ok but too much favortism, hardest part of the job was dealing with very un happy customers, the most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that i felt accomplished after every oil change and tire work i did on a vehicle, knowing that they would not be back till they needed new service done to there vehicle. i always take pride in my work. im a firm believer that if you take your time with any job it comes out 10 times better than expected."
good,Walmart was a nice place to work because their was always something to be done. The fast pace working environment made sure you were always working on something.
good,"I enjoyed the stock options at Walmart in Michigan when I transferred over to NV the management was a little hard to communicate with people I worked with were negative and it made it hard to stay in a good mood, I liked the fast paced jobs I had there"
good,"The work environment was okay however most of the time in the garden section it was slow pace, I enjoyed everything but the insects they where not that nic, but I loved tending to the flowers."
good,I learned important skills that are essential for retail work and managing customers efficiently and professionally.
good,"Not a bad place. to work. Fast paced, ever changing daily expectations. Being a claims associate was rewarding and allowed me to be a productive team member behind to scenes."
good,working at WalMart as a part time employee has been beneficial to my financial way of life. The managers are professional as well as my co-workers. I have learned a great deal about customer service and teamwork while employed at WalMart.
good,Always stay in motion was a great experience I worked everywhere in the store mostly done al it of stocking and removing merchandise from the truck to be stocked in the store
good,"My time at Walmart was fun, the pay was decent and coworkers are cool, but management at the Walmart I worked could use plenty of improvement, I have a friend that works at Walmart and he tells me the company is making poor choices and loosing lots of people, feel free to apply but be ready for a tough time"
good,I worked at Walmart for a year and absolutely loved it however the issues were just about how the managers and the work environment was handled. Certain managers would not help you if you need further instruction on tasks needed to be completed.And you could sense the way not many people cared about the way customers were treated. The most enjoyable part of the job was I always tried my hardest to break the stereotype that Walmart cashiers were rude. Instead I was the most friendliest and helpful cashier possible. This became something my managers would get complimented on and I would get recognized for.
good,"It can be busy especially during the holiday season but the evening time slows down son, pretty relaxed when you know what you’re doing, you have to have good people skills"
good,its a fun place to work but the managers here suck they do not care about their employees. you will also overwork yourself for sorry bonuses. i will not recommend this place for people stay away from walmart maybe good for people who already got experience and maybe teens other than that this place sucks
good,I really did like Walmart people are nice their their were great just stressful some times because their would be so many people but they never really had lines opened their would be like 2 opened n it’s overwhelming
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers. I did not like working on Thanksgiving day. I usually worked the closing shift and became friends with a few Walmart associates.
good,Walmart is a great first step into the work industry cause they're really flexable around your schedule if you tell them ahead of time and are really great when it comes to those unexpected days off for being sick
good,Assisted with unloading and sorting the merchandise truck and sorting of break-packs and clothing. Stocked shelves and ensured cleanliness and safety of store aisle and shelves.
good,It was fun working for Walmart however it was a constant struggle with the customers and employees who abused their power. Overall the job was fun and easy but the friction with the people was too much.
good,A good place to work for your first job or I'd you have free time the hours are good sometime management is really nice and they listen when you have a problem.
good,"it can be a fun place to work at but, they can and will take advantage  of your kindness and will to help them out and they will work you. but if  you are going through a rough time as long as you go to the managers they will work with you and help you out."
good,"While employed I did enjoy what I did. Work was challenging at times."
good,Working at Walmart GBS is a very fun place to work at. The atmosphere is very lax and always desirable to bring forth inspiring ideas as a leader in FM.
good,I've worked here over 3 months now and I must say that I still enjoy it so far. The management is awesome and the coworkers are the nicest. The job isn't the most difficult and the pay is better than a lot of other places. My only complaint would be the scheduling. They don't stick to their word about it.
good,"It was a good summer job with very helpful coworkers. It gave me new experiences each time I worked there, and it always kept me on my toes and focused on the job at hand."
good,The people were cool and the work place environment was alright. the only thing that kindof sucked was home office but the store associates were cool.
good,"hard work, limited communication, but nice environment. pay is good, industry seems shaky. layoffs. benefits are pricey. somewhat relaxed. lots of rules"
good,"A typical day at work involves filling prescriptions while using proper verification steps to deliver the right drug to the right patient without any contraindications. Pharmacist supervises technicians to ensure efficient work flow, being compliant with state and federal laws, and providing the best possible patient care. Best part of the job is getting to know your staff and working as team to reach a common goal."
good,It’s an ok place to work. Fast paced environment and pretty competitive. There are a lot of responsibilities we have as well. We get full benefits for full time associates.
good,Fast worker I stay busy a little wore out for homeless to long as a young man  I’m bout any job for a slow positioning  try my hardest to knock it out soon as that
good,Good  place for a low income  family  or first job hard to advance futher in the work place  coworkers are sometimes  hard to work  with customers  are also hard to please
good,The pay is decent but the amount of hours you receive weekly will depend on which department/area that you work in. Be sure to check your schedule daily.
good,"Smooth and productive working environment, i maintain a uplifting spirit so the job was easy and even though i pick up others slack i do it comfortably."
good,I worked overnight stocking shelves but was crossed trained to work other positions.  I learned many aspects of the retail business.  Management changed often but in general liked all of them.  The workplace culture was positive and we were treated to many treats during our breaks.  The hardest part of the job was working overnights.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting or exceeding a job task that was assigned to me.
good,"Walmart is a good means to pay your bills assuming you can get the hours. A day at work is typically non-eventful depending on your position. Management can seem incredibly absent at times, particularly when they're most needed on the floor. If you don't fall into the drama shared among associates it is a reliable job. Stick with lower tiers, such as Cashier, to avoid some of the unnecessary stress that comes with management roles."
good,Working at walmart was a career boosting experience. I learned how to worl with Money. Provide customer satisfaction and service. I learned about products and always had certain customers come in just to see me.
good,"stocking food on display"
good,I loved working with my team and to this day still consider them as the extended family. Great working to provide excellent customer service and making all goals. There is nothing bad I can say to having this job other than my schedule not being consistent with my availability. Other than that there is nothing different than any other job.
good,Working here at Walmart has been an amazing experience. I ve never worked at a store before  so coming here was different. But I've gained so much experience in areas I would never imagine myself working.
good,I liked the work but not all of my co-workers. Some of the people really are into gossiping and some are very lazy and some are rude. Although there are a few good people that i loved to hang out with. But the managers were awesome and really helped me out.
good,Company is very strict on tardiness and absences. Very fast paced with plenty of work. You get two twenty minute breaks in a twelve hour shift that goes by really quickly. Break room and restrooms are pretty far.
good,Was a great place to work while I was young and only wanted a part time job. This job is difficult at times you have times at every job it can be like that you have to be willing to work with managers and people.
good,"Prior to me working at Walmart I have never worked retail before. I must say it can be rewarding along with challenging. My schedule is never consistent but the hours I do work are not that bad. I believe it's more of how you present yourself when dealing with the public. As long as you show respect towards everyone you come into contact with, the outcome with be positive."
good,You get to learn new areas throughout the store. You help the customers get in and out of the store. Got to make sure shelves are stocked. Help others when needed.
good,It was an over all alright experience. Fast paced and fun social environment. Working for Walmart was a good time but it was very stressful during the holidays and cold weather.
good,"I was a support manager that worked a overnight shift. I would Arrive early enough where the store would still be open so I could possibly end up on a register or helping on the floor. I worked where ever help was needed until the store closed then I would manage the floor, help with the unloading of the freight from the trucks and the restocking of merchandise"
good,"It is a wonderful place to work. They tend to your needs if you have a family who has special needs. The time off to go to doctors apts. In my case, I had surgery. Overall, a good place to work."
good,"It was a great experience, they start you off good with giving you simple tasks and supervision, but as time goes on you might not like it due to management or the long hours that you have to work. It's a good job for young people since Walmart start you off at $11 hourly."
good,"You Stay Busy, But Also Enjoy Working With Co-Workers And Customers. The Managers Are Understandable And Helpful. Customers Are Friendly And You Learn Something New Everyday On The Job As You Go."
good,You find help anytime you need it and I had a really supportive team. You can find great people and the staff really care about every associate. It was a very good experience.
good,WalMart good place to work. Enjoyed working there . was ready for a change. WalMart has great hourly associates. Was with them 30 years I enjoyed working with the associates.
good,Good job until the forced health plan was applied by law that made alot of companies cut hours making it rough to stay. Overall I met some serious good people and still know them to this day. Good for as a temp job.
good,"I quit the first time due to my team bullying me and nothing being done about it, they refused to help me and ignored me. It was brought up to management but nothing really changed so I left. I often think about going back because of the pay and the benefits they offer."
good,Too many chiefs not enough Indians when it comes to management they want you to move fast pace but pay is not so good so they basically work you like a dog for Less are always willing to hire without the company outside of the company did instead of with the end
good,Workplace is a consistently paced work.  You know how and what you are doing on a majority of daily schedules.  Management can improve on their people skills with associates.
good,"I started out in Wilmington Ohio as a Cap 2 associate in 2017 until I transferred in December of 2019 to Hillsboro's store."
good,"It’s ok I hope they do better with the tardiness and point systems, employees have family and things happen in a blink of an eye they cannot come to wk they need to take doctor notes"
good,I enjoyed my time with Walmart. I learned alot and the customers were the most interesting. I had a very successful career in the company. After everything that my life has been through I want a different career now.
good,I dont know what to say exactly for my feelings about my career at Walmart are a bit bias and directed towards the manger and overall terrible experience I had once they arrived however pior to that change in management I was proud to have my job happy with my wages and was able to honestly state that I Loved My Job
good,Overall good place to work just needs more structure and accountability and less favoritism more under standing of the employees on top of strict rules
good,"My workday begins around 10 A.M. and ends around 7 p.m. As far as management goes, once you have a problem, it matters who you go to solve an issue/s."
good,Walmart was a nice laid back job. I learned a lot from working with this company. I will use everything that I learned into my careers I choose in the future.
good,"The Pay and benefits are good. Every one is friendly and easy to work with. They have a nice consistency of work throughout the year, so there’s not many slow times."
good,The experience received at Walmart is both educational and fun. Walmart establishes a fun and serious work environment for outgoing people that don't mind passing time
good,Often friendly customers when or if they speak to you. Was a nice place to work and would highly suggest it as a first time job or good part time/full time job.
good,"As a salary member, working scheduled hours were never followed. Being one of the highest paid Assistant Manager, when salary wages increased to meet the standard, everyone received big increase except me due to already being paid above the average salary. I believe I worked very hard and long years to be where I was and deserved increase as well."
good,Walmart had plenty of ups and downs but for the most part it was very relaxed. I also like a lot of my coworkers which make the job more tolerable in my opinion. There was some things I didn't like about Walmart also for example didn't get paid sick days and the one holiday we don't off was Christmas.
good,"The job experience overall was fun, i learned a lot while there and it will help me has i progress in the world. It is friendly for anyone who is just staring out in the work force and can help them grow as an individual."
good,I personally fell like Walmart was a good place to start at such a young age. I was able to learn from so many different people and about myself really. A typical work day was fun and the energy levels were high even when there was not much to do at the time. The most enjoyable part of my job was all these different people trying to blend together and figure out what the best ways are to work as one cohesive unit. My managers/supervisors were very supportive even when I was having some personal issues. I really felt important to them and not just another employee.
good,"It's really not that much to say. If you do your job and work with a sense of urgency, your time there will be easy. They have a fair attendance policy which helps when you have emergencies. As long as you communicate with management, everything will be okay."
good,Management needs worked on but overall a good paying job. Management does not care about anyone’s well being unless you’re up high in the company but you will meet some special associates.
good,"The company is great if you had managers that abide by what we are suppose to,  company policies and procedures.  There are those stores that have a really good team if your lucky, other times you've got those that.only care about themselves."
good,"Busy but some days slow"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of collecting carts and interacting with customers as often as possible. I've learned to be more outgoing and interactive with people. The hardest part of the job would be the weather, when it'd get too cold or hot, when it'd snow or rain would make for an overall bad working experience. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the ability to meet so many new faces on a consistent basis and be able to work on my people skills."
good,I like working with new people n like learning new things I learned more working for walmart n would like to learn more for any job I get b i am a hard worker
good,"I enjoy working for Walmart. It fits my drive for challenges. They're is no restrictions on learning just one skill. I have worked in almost every department and if there is something I want to learn to improve my work experience, they are more than willing to train. Definitely a company you can move up in and not remain stagnant if you are willing to put in the work,"
good,"Walmart emphasizes employee rights and safety, which I greatly appreciate.  My biggest complaint would be an inflated upper beaurocracy that makes it hard to do anything other than clock in and out for your shifts.  Otherwise, not a bad place!"
good,Good company to stay with and they give you good hours. The people there are great to work with and the people you work for are just like you and respect hard work.
good,Working at two different locations showed me how two different stores are ran. The first store was amazing and cared about having their employees advance to the next level. The second store picked who they liked better for advancement and did not take into account of how long workers have been in positions or how well they did their jobs.
good,Alot of teens. Good food. Long shifts. LGBTQ+ friendly. Piercing allowed. weird orientation/training process..................   .. . . . . ..    ........
good,"I extremely enjoyed this Walmart store. I transferred from Lima, OH to Cocoa, FL and immediately quit. Walmart is a company that varies greatly store by store. In Lima, my store was fun, laid back, and very easy positions. The fresh Cap 2 position is extremely easy. The only downfall with this position are the hours. That is, unless you prefer them. The morning shift starts at 4 am and tmyou get off at 1pm. They work with most of the truck and stock for the day. 2nd shift is 1 PM to 10 PM. The shift is focused on keeping the floor filled and the food fresh. There are some pretty disgusting tasks (disposal of both the meat departments write offs and the produce departments write offs.). Still both very easy tasks. tHe hours, for ke, were too early and too late. But the job was great. Most of the managers were great, some a little over bearing but mostly friendly."
good,"The Wal-Mart in Shakopee currently is staffed with an amazing group of people.  Half of the current technicians I employed in the last year as I have put a great deal of time into building a solid team.  It is a very busy pharmacy striving to provide excellent customer service and increase clinical services.  Clinical services include: providing immunizations, specialty medications, and point of care testing for blood pressure, blood sugar (including A1C), cholesterol, and BMI.  Additionally, working with Medicare patients to improve medication adherence.  "
good,is a great place to work at if you looking for a good paycheck and good hours plus you get paid every week. weekeng shift you work for 12hrs for 3 days than off for 3 days wich is fair for me.
good,"Work with many different ways to pay, helping people very often, a lot of well needed breaks. Put items that are messed placed or unwanted back on shelves."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Walmart. I was always treated with respect, they worked well with any personal issues I had in my life, or in the workplace."
good,It was a good place to work for me while I was in high school. But didn’t intend on staying after graduation due to pay. I need more to live on my own.  But in all not a terrible place.
good,this is a great company to work for. you learn how to multi-task in different areas of the store. There are many jobs available for you to reach the top and achieve goals set.
good,The managers at Walmart are very efficient and are good at helping employees with their schedules. The employees at Walmart are friendly and easy going.
good,"Walmart Legal has lived up to Walmart's principles of respect, excellence & integrity. Recent leadership change & reorg has negatively shifted morale."
good,"My typical day consists of zoning, throwing freight, and working registers. I've made some really great friends while working with fellow associates and customers. Working here has been a great experience for me."
good,"Always freight to be worked or customers to help, but there's always another associate that can help if need be. I've learned how to efficiently help and talk to customers, along with how to be a better worker."
good,"Walmart is a good place to start a new job however, if you are not prepared to work the hours or have a back-up plan for when you don't have accommodations to get to work then you must rethink applying to Walmart. Just for the fact of the new policies that have been stated from Walmart might affect someone who relies on ride of transportation."
good,"A typical day at work we would go to the backroom and help unload trucks, then take grocery items and stock for the remainder of the time every single day. management was poor because a coworker and I asked to change positions for a few months and they ignored our requests because they needed us in Cap 2, which made it more stressful to work there and do the same thing over and over again ."
good,"Great pay. And good hours.  "
good,I enjoyed the work experience.  Most employees were team workers but some were competitive. Supervisors sometimes have picks and chooses of likable employees.
good,I actually liked my job at Walmart. It was very fulfilling and it kept me busy. I hated when I had to leave. Temporary position suck and they don’t work for hard workers.
good,working at Wal-Mart was conducive to the schedule that I needed while attending school. The work atmosphere was great no stress with my job title or cross overs to other areas to assist in other areas of the store with shortages.
good,It was a good place to wrk.. ii just wish my car didn’t mess up at the time and family issues that kept coming up .. other than that ii would've probably still been there
good,Interesting working with the public. Meet plenty of new people. Black Friday is always a fun time. Not bad place to work but pay is biweekly. I prefer to to be payed weekly
good,"All the co-workers was nice and we helped each other. When we worked together we got things done quick, so it was never a problem and when it was. It was easy to talk to the manager or your boss"
good,I really liked working at Walmart. Great pay with excellent benefits available. The only reason i left was because we had to move. I applied for a transfer but could not get it approved because I didn't work there for a least 6 months.
good,"Loved it because of my manager. Other than him, I would have quit because the workers are underpaid. I would suggest this job to a child liege student or Hs student"
good,"Walmart does a great job of taking care of their employees, this was my first job and I learned alot of skills here that I still use today with my jobs and will continue to use throughout my life."
good,Walmart gives people decent hours depending on the position you work.The pay was more than the average job would pay.If you worked in harder positions you would get an increase in pay.Overall Walmart is a good starter job.
good,I enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart n would like to return if possible. Everyone works together for a common goal. The supervisors have a hands on relationship with its employees. I would highly recommend
good,"When I first got the job I was excited to get paid more than my fast food job, I work less days than I did at the fast food place but I get paid more, one thing is for sure you need to make the rate that they ask and not a unit less or you’ll be slapped with an occurrence, they do hand out occurrences like candy but as long as you work hard everyday then no need to worry"
good,It was an okay place to work bad management not enough hours and not enough pay no room to get a raise or succeed. Very easy to cooperate with customers and get along with people though.
good,"Walmart has an awesome atmosphere, and great environment to work in.  Also great benefits, which including profit sharing and pay evaluations every six months."
good,I like the atmosphere the challenge and freedom.  I didn’t like the disregard for work life balance and quick decisions to release people based on lower managers feelings rather than facts.
good,I do not have anything to complain about working for Walmart. I worked hard and they appreciated it. I believe there is opportunity for advancement here
good,"most enjoyable part of my job would be to help people with their specific needs and make their life easier. i deal with a lot of money transfers, returns and bill pay inside the store."
good,"Overall I had a good work experience there, great staff and associates, always friendly and happy to help. If I had the opportunity to work there again I would"
good,"Love the coworkers. Management needs lots of improving. Overall it is a great company. In my years, I've seen lots of favoritism from upper management and certain associates. Low moral."
good,"I learned that management will be any one a chance if the really want it."
good,I got a lot of experience working at Walmart. I enjoyed working in a team and helping people. I learned about teamwork and I enjoyed working in a great company.
good,Walmart is a productive and enjoyable place to work. Lots of room to advance up the career ladder. I  just need a more flexible schedule due to circumstances.
good,"I loved the fast paced and constant people coming and going. I loved being busy all the time and being able to interact with other people. As a CSM I was always running and doing, I don't think I could keep up the pace now that I did when I was 22! Great people worked with me and life long friendships were made."
good,Management at that time was awesome. We worked very well as a team . No complaints  the always had my back and could always count on me to ensure that the front end ran smoothly
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for. They have great insurance, that allows you to get shots for free. The flu shot is offered once a year in the break room by the Walmart pharmacy."
good,Id say walmart is a good place with good prices and very nice staff. I would definetly recommend shopping there and if your looking for a job then maybe even working there would be a good decision.
good,It was fine some day but management do play favorites and some treated employee unfair. Employee are like family that you can rely on and they make your day easier. Benefits are great but not the hours.
good,"The job was very easy to me , The people were very nice and friendly. I would recommend anybody to the job because of the fast paced work that was there."
good,"The is a very busy job! But its also so worth it! You have many ""managers"" so its hard when management isn't all on the same page. Other than that, its an easy gauntreed job."
good,"The job was very easy I got moved up a lot, just sometimes drama but unfortunately that sometimes comes with the job itself, it’s a great opportunity if your just getting out of fast food"
good,"Good job "
good,"Provided excellent, fast, and friendly service as a cashier. Was hired as a temporary position, but was kept on due to my review. After a year, I was promoted to a pharmacy technician."
good,"The schedules were to inconsistent and the management did not try to fix the problem."
good,"The hardest part of the job was standing in one spot for a couple hours at a time, other than that everything about the job was enjoyable. The best part of the job was the conversations I had with customers that and building a relationship and having regulars. The idea that some customers looked for you and waited in line just to see how you are doing had to be the best part of the job."
good,"Walmart is a very easy going laid back job they pay well for the type of work you do . One of the biggest problems would be its almost impossible to get full time with out becoming a manager , I’ve been an associate for almost 2 years and they will not give me full time although my hourly wage is good it hard to make ends meet due to lack of hours. Work schedule is very inconsistent , but they are very open to working around your availability  . Other than that it’s a pretty decent place to work ."
good,Nice people big lunch or break areas each day I would start out zoning and find out what is out and fill them and order what we did not have then I would clean my whole work area.
good,it was very busy and very often short staffed. I had to know nearly everything about all of our products. i was responsible for thousands of dollars of merchandise.
good,"Really nice place to work. Very good training exercises. I dispense and pick groceries. Very informed from mangers. Clean, fast, and friendly. Great environment."
good,"Wal-Mart is a relaxed but fast paced job. Capable of teaching someone structure & great team working skills. Management is fair , understanding & helpful. Sadly the pay isn't quit worth it."
good,I really enjoyed my job I got to interact with customers constantly and had structure was very clean and enjoyed being able to do that had fun using g my skills
good,"need to be attentive to your surroundings other run a risk of bumping into customers, good managers but some bad attitude associates other wise good place to work at"
good,It's a great place to work for young men and women. Collaboration is a must while working here. Managers can be alittle out of line from time to time. But overall it's the best type of place to work when it comes to thrift stores or grocery stores.
good,Managers obey the orders from home office. Workers obey the orders from their managers. Be careful. Never rush to prevent accidents. Never ignore a Customer. Just do the best you can and leave on time.
good,I loved working at Walmart just because I got to put a smile on someone's face because I was printing a picture of a loved one or because I could make them a canvas of a loved one.
good,Walmart isn’t family oriented and over works you... management wants you to do you work us theirs sometimes and even with a family emergency your not excused.
good,Work was very steady. Coworkers trained as you go. The hardest part was getting a time to take breaks. Standing all day made it hard on my body. Most enjoyable part of the job was making the patients happy with the prices and time they had to wait.
good,fast paced environment with always a lot to do.being on-time is a must. Management there to answer any questions you may have. Employees do the best they can to help each other out.
good,"Duties and Responsibilities included; unloaded trucks, sorted products in the backroom, stocked products on shelves, ensured aisles were neat and area was clean, engaged vendors and drivers with a positive attitude, greeted customers and answered their questions. Performed other duties as assigned"
good,"Walmart is an excellent pay job. Offers a lot of options for srock, health, and other things. Fast paced, and hard working. Good managers and safe practice."
good,A great place to work with all the opportunities to succeed.  With benefits we all want and need. You become a part of a team which allows you to meet the goals set before you
good,A lot of drama and stress with this company. Felt like I was back in highschool again. Wasn't bad on the pay and benefits though. Management isn't very helpful there at all.
good,"Basically you're either in the back pulling items to put on carts, you're unloading the carts and putting them on the shelves, unloading trucks, or working a register. Sometimes you're doing all of it, and they'll get mad that whatever you are currently doing is keeping you from whatever they want you to be doing."
good,Working in retail in general is not the greatest.  The pay is good benifits are ok. They only care about the bottom line. The attendance policy is AWFUL. 1 time flu or if you have children very easy to get terminated.  Managment has the option to approve absences and they do for long term employees or people they really like.  Not flexible at all.  Great if you don't have kids
good,"Fun team members, fast paced, friendly work environment. DM takes time to trains you to find a right fit on the team they are in charge of. Most have great customer service."
good,"This was a great experience entering the adult world on my 1st job."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if you don't mind being micromanaged. They work you hard 364 days per year, and can be difficult with your time off, so always plan ahead."
good,I loved working nights which I did but the management was horrible. it was just like high school little groups to talk about you and they did have some perks like free food but that was all
good,Good customer service and lots of walking fast past always busy friendly fun lots of different experiences in every department and every shift I have enjoyed working for Walmart
good,Walmart was fun to work at although some management didn’t step up to do their jobs so they would expect you to do it for them. Expect to work every weekend
good,my day starts at 4am and continues until 1 pm. I receive and stock in 3 departments with my supervisor and 6 to 8 others on our crew. I have learned how to get along with different cultures which has been the hardest part of the job because some of the other associates do not speak English.
good,My coworkers became like a big family. We all cared for one another and our customers. I’m upset that they took away our door greeters. Some customers were very rude.
good,I enjoyed Walmart Vision Center if I have an opportunity to return I would.  I only worked part-time however I gain knowledge and experience in the optical center and about other opportunity at Walmart.
good,My typical day at work at Walmart would be trying to stay busy and enjoy giving great service to my customers learn to have a lot of patience management was always a call away hardest day at work will be when they customer was actually wrong but you would have to let them be right being fast-paced and stand steady working is mostly enjoyable
good,"Day to Day operations of the store but no time for my family. Associates are great and Management team is great. The big problem is as a manager you work long hours and Holiday""s and weekends."
good,Walmart was very fast pace job.  I loved working at customer service and helping people.  The management was wonderful and helpful.   The hardest part  of the job was getting the deposits done on a regular time.
good,".Wal-Mart was,a,great company to work for. Always working to provide associates with new cutting edge systems and procedures to to give associates and company the upper hand in a very tight market"
good,Good place to work. Managment could have been better. Pay was good. Schedule was nice and you were able to add more hours on over computer. Breaks could be a little longer
good,"Very good place to apply, they pay well and have many different tasks for u to do. You will always keep busy! Walmart is an awesome place to work whether it’s your first or tenth job."
good,"working at Walmart was great, you had many things to do especially overnight shift. There were times that it was very busy here and there, but learn to calm."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work, and I recommend it. there were times where you had bad days or thing always didn't work out, but its still a place to work, and they are willikng to work with your schedule"
good,Good benefits stock options bad management to many people trying to tell you what to do.  Kept busy all day everyday. Took care if customer and their needs  good and different work environment.
good,Great all associates come in check dates on all merchandise out of dates.Most enjoyable part of the day is helping customers through out the day. Making sure that production items are ready for customers as there needs.
good,The leadership and workers were excellent. Very understanding and willing to work with whoever for whatever reason. Great job oppertunity and work enviorment!
good,"very fast paced workplace constant lifting and carrying things over 50 pounds. Very great people to work with, and very many people to communicate with."
good,"A typical workday migh involve filling prescriptions and stocking aisles as well as managing the register. Inputting prescriptions (when a patient brings a prescription) was probably the most difficult task of the technician/trainees as there is a learning curve associated with learning the SIG codes, understanding how to use the computer system and managing patients and phone calls at the same time. I felt that this experience was valuable as a first job as it taught me how to work efficiently, ask for help and communicate effectively with co-workers and customers."
good,"Excellent opportunity with much room for advancement must be detail oriented. Must be willing to take on many areas at once, overall a great atmosphere with great people."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is the workplace culture.... very relaxed and stress free to work. easy to get along with anyone and flexibility of work schedule.
good,typical days were not to bad depending how much was need to be done for that evening . the hardest part of that job was being under staffed some times.
good,"This can be a fast paced job. It does have it's down time when the store is slow, such as early in the morning when most people are at work. It can be fast paced too, such as when most people are getting off work, or during the holiday season (Thanksgiving and Christmas)."
good,They care about their workers and have become more relaxed with their dress code. I enjoyed working here. There is always room for growth within the company.
good,"The wages aren't bad, but however if they do not like you they will retaliate against you or cut your hours so that you will quit. They overwork the good employees and the employees that do the minimal get away with so much less."
good,I learned a lot of job skills working at Walmart and they believe in second chances and if they paid more I would still be working there. They also have pretty decent benefits and will give you the opportunity to grow in your position.
good,Loved greeting customers and interacting with them. Enjoyed seeing my regular customers. The hardest part was the cleaning process at the end of the night.
good,Aside from lack of hours Walmart is one of the best companies to start at looking back. They have a variety of different positions to choose from with a wage that is sufficient in most cases for what you're doing. They have decent benefits and a matched 401k. Management in some cases can be poor but overall it was a decent experience.
good,"Walmart is demanding place to work. Hours were long and work was abundant, but you were also being timed. You were expected to complete a stocking pallet within a amount of time that was not con"
good,I like my position I’m in not to stressful would keep as a secondary job. We all need more money doesn’t pay that well but not that bad either would recommend it to everyone it’s a job like I said.
good,"I enjoyed the job and my position. The employees were great to work with, some management, however, made things harder than they had to be. I enjoyed the pay."
good,My opinion for a typical day at work consists of amazing work ethic and a motivated approach to any type of work you do. You have to be goal oriented and as well being very professional and friendly.
good,"Great environment, an active job with supportive managers along with co-workers. Many learning opportunities throughout the company. I learned not everyone will be nice but you can always try your absolute best."
good,"I Love working here , it’s a good place to work . The wages are great they have flexible work hours and management makes you feel comfortable and that’s important to me ."
good,I liked working at Walmart it was just the management team that didn't care about the employees only the ones they liked as for everything else I really loved my job until my daughter had to be rushed to the hospital and my manager got mad because I called in to care for my child. Even with an doctor's excuse they would not excuse my absence and told me I pointed out and they had to let me go.
good,"this was my first job and overnight shift helped me go to work and go to school at the same time, worked 8 hour shifts and the job was somewhat fast paced."
good,walmart isnt a bad job to start as long as you are able to move up the ladder to managment if you stay as a sales floor associate and have no ambition to go anywhere dont expeedt it to be a good well paying job
good,"Working here provided a nice, busy environment and the rest of the staff were very easy to communicate with. I never had any problems with needing time off and was always allowed a smoke break."
good,"Good place. Great benefits, management helps associates when needed. Customer service should always be top priority. I learned alot of things while I was there. The hardest part of the job is never having enough coverage for departments."
good,Walmart provides training via computer based learning. There are quarterly bonuses when store achieves certain criteria and associates receive part of this based upon various data concerning employment. There are opportunities for promotion in the company.
good,"Walmart is an excellent place to work for the part-time employee. Managers are fair and friendly, as are other employees. The company also offers benefits that are difficult to find in other part-time situations."
good,walmart is a great company to work for. They train you for the position that you are hired for and have opportunity to move up within the company. they also have great benefits
good,Every Walmart is going to be different to work for.  While I worked for this company I worked at three different stores and they all had good and bad things about them.
good,"Was wonderful when I first started for them but after changing manager, positions, and locations the company as a whole has gone way down hill. It’s a fine job when you need a job and are willing to lick everyone’s boots, but don’t make it permanent."
good,"Work experience at Walmart is highly dependent on store managers.  I worked in two stores.  The first one was fantastic and I had no problems while I worked nights.  The second store, however, was a different story.  While not a terrible experience, I had to quit since the manager refused to work out a schedule that worked while I was on break from college and expected me to live in my car for two weeks since the dorms were not open.  "
good,This job was good days went by fast if you are not a people person this is not the job for you. You learn different things but they can pay better the pay not so great.
good,Great job if management is willing to work with you. I worked at the Topeka Wanamaker store under awesome management but transferred to the North store where I was written up for asking if my manager was having a good day.
good,Hardest part was seeing other employees slacking of and we had to pick up there slack due to lack of work ethics  but other than that it was a decent place to work .
good,"the Walmart dc in Hermiston Oregon is fast paced and challenging, the pay and benefits are good. you must be willing to work hard and put in 10+ hours a day of physical labor"
good,"If you're looking for a company to help fill out your resume a bit and gain some experience while you're at it, I would greatly recommend working at Walmart at least once in your life. Retail teaches you a lot of valuable life skills; communication, time management, multitasking and customer service, just to name a few. All in all I have a great time working at my location and would definitely recommend working at your local Walmart!"
good,"I loved the work environment that I was surrounded in. The employees were very friendly and helpful. I loved the consistent hours I was receiving while in high school. I also loved that over my four months of being there that I received the opportunity to switch to 3 departments. I've learned: how to stock items correctly at a steady pace, how to work the cashier, how to unload trucks. When it came to working around my high school basketball schedule, they weren't cooperative."
good,"I worked in the fitting room and the managers barely respond when help is needed from a customer. The management team treats you as if you're easily replaceable, and don't care much about your life. They used to let you miss 8 days in 6 months without asking ahead of time in case of emergencies, they recently changed that to 5 days. If you're sick enough to not work, but not sick enough to visit a doctor, then good luck keeping your job here."
good,A friendly place to work fast paced  you are held accountable for your work you are given jib training for your position decent pay for your position.
good,i had a great time working at Walmart. lots of girls always. its a crazy environment you see so many weird things. overall i loved it it was a great place to work.
good,Working for Walmart automotive was a great place to work. I was able to help customers and the mechanics in the shop. Which not all women will like it. If you are not into automotive work and looking at parts and cleaning supplies for automobiles then this might not been the job for you.
good,"Overall a decent place to work, but has poor management and the schedule drops from a system and does not make a decent schedule! Most managers are wonderful, but there’s a few not so great."
good,I enjoyed my job at Walmart. I learned how to perform all financial services and was quickly promoted to Management. The hardest part of my job was getting support from my manager when needed. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and building a great rapport with them. The culture at work was nice. We helped each other and were exited for others growth within the company. We were like family.
good,"Great leadership, family atmosphere, long hours, fast paced. Always looking to improve instock, online shopping, and creating a better work environment for it' s employees"
good,"In the Apparel department you are responsible for how the department looks, making sure everything stay nice and neat for the customers. The most important thing while having a job like this is, to have good customer service qualities. Help the customers in any way possible, always smile and have a positive attitude."
good,All good. Demanding work load but satisfying. High turnover of store management made for constant adjustments. The hardest part of the job was physical inventory. The most enjoyable was creating fine photo products for customers
good,"Working at Walmart is on the whole very good. As long as there are plenty of other associates, it doesn't get too bad. There were times that I was left alone to handle 4 busy departments, and things would become hectic and stressful. Especially since so many people come to the back stations to checkout. They don't understand that the people working on the floor have other jobs to do,and that we can get in trouble for not getting our other work done."
good,"Walmart is an organization that provides unlimited opportunities for individuals that are willing to work hard.  The culture is one that promotes inclusion, diversity, and equal opportunity."
good,"I loved worker for Walmart , they showed me i couldn't be slow paced , and i had to really do my job .its a great experience i would recommend everybody to work there ."
good,"Good place to work for students. They are very courteous of  availability and willing to work around the busy schedule of a student. There wasn't a lot of room for advancement and the hiring credentials of certain people in various areas of employment were questionable, but it didn't cause too many issues. Overall, a decent place to work."
good,"Walmart use to be a very enjoyable job. I could see myself with a career there until it just straight up became corrupted with nonsense. HIGHLY unneeded safety protocols, unfair work loads, understaffed, and unfair judgements ruined the business."
good,"Good co-workers , good work environment, annoying managers , fast pasted work at times , but can also be slow pasted work , overall can be a good temporary job but nothing permanent."
good,in 2007 due to the economy it was very rough. once all the old time leaders left (Glass and many others) the company went corporate and was never the same around 2005 or so.
good,typical day on the job is mostly getting task done before our day is over and customer service making sure they find what they need before checking out
good,depends how the store is managed. the point system for attendance is a bit complicated but what i do like is the ability to request your needed days off.
good,"The environment was nice. Co-workers help the time and job go by. Customers can be a handful to deal with, you just gotta kno policy and follow thru with your managers. Managers are sometimes understanding with situations. Attendance policy is a little off and PPTO and PTO is a little confusing. Just ask alot of questions to keep up with all the info, and you will be fine."
good,"As an assistant manager at wal mart your day can vary greatly. There are always different things thrown your way so adaptability is a must. You need to prioritize and execute and learn when to put things to the side and when to put your full attention on them. I learned allot about inter personal skills and communications. Dealing with hiring and performance reviews and implementing new directives from home office. It was fun at times, stressful but always interesting. If family obligations did not prevent me from working this position I would still be there learning and getting better."
good,I miss the job. I do plan on coming back. The work environment was great. Made lots of friends during my time there. The closeness with employees and management was great
good,"Walmart is a fast pace environment with room to ascend. Management evaluate your work ethics the first couple of days and if they see potential in you they will approach you to learn a new area. They have an open door policy, in which if you don't feel right in the position that you are hired you can always change departments. Also, if you enjoy your position you can put your name in for a supervisor position and they will work with you to determine if you are fit for the position.  Walmart can be challenging at times specially the customer service area, but as long as you are knowledgeable about the policies and follow the rules and in most cases your gut, you will be just fine. The management team is willing to work with you as long as you are direct and confident with what you are asking of them."
good,"I would have to say always be time like any job you work."
good,"They are a good company to work for with various options to advance your career and pay based on experience. They try to be fair with their procedures, and offer training for each job."
good,I feel that working with Walmart's was definitely one of the best  jobs I ever held for many reasons.  To start with the were very understanding that I couldn't  work more than a certain amount of hours per weeek and day. .A regular scedual most  the time made holding down a job much easier for  me to do my job well and even be  felxible in doing my jobs.
good,No falta algun compañero que te arruina el ambiente laboral
good,Walmart itself is not a bad company. But the compensation doesn't cover the amount of verbal abuse that you receive from customers and management. Some managers know how to speak to people and some don't.
good,I actually enjoyed my time as a cashier and would go back if I ever had to. The hardest part to deal with is customers. However the most enjoyable part of the job was also the customers.
good,"They are a great company to work for. Very flexible on days off the pay is great and you get so many benefits. You get to meet so many different people, and there is room for advancement."
good,The workplace was acceptable and always kept clean. Associants were friendly and helpful not only to customers but also to other associates. Overall a nice place for employment.
good,"Started working there in 2017, didn't like it too much, only kept it as a school job, management is not too well, sometimes they pull people for other jobs."
good,Would be a great company for someone young wanting to start a career. The managers can make or break you as I had 1 great manager and another who chose favorites instead of giving everyone a chance to learn how to do everything in the job
good,"Buen lugar de trabajo,me dio la oportunidad de aprender mucho"
good,"working  as a cashier was easy, managers are pretty laid back but also enforces rules and ethics. working as a overnight stocker was a bit stressful as sometimes the work load that is assigned would be far too much for one person in that department to complete. but it didnt always happen every night. management was very fun and laid back for both jobs, however some assistant managers were too rude and had a slight abuse of power. the hardest part of the job working as a cashier was dealing with rude customers and the hardest part of  being an overnight stocker was the work load that was expected to be completed every night. the most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck, lets be real, not going to lie some coworkers made the work place a little less boring."
good,"Working at nights, my experience was a little different, but for the most part I enjoyed the work.  The first batch of managers who worked overnights were good, but after they left their replacements didn't do a very good job at actually managing and keeping things in order."
good,Most days I would get to work and it would already be busy. A couple hours have gone by and I wasn't given my break. Some days I didn't get a break. Some customers and employees were difficult to work with.
good,Fast paced working environment with short staffing and low pay working overtime. Rude or unfriendly management. Working in too cold or hot conditions.
good,"Walmart has its ups and downs. They have an okay pay, but constant labor. Good management but very strict. Tons of benefits if you choose this company."
good,"It is your average part time job, fast work environment means day goes by fast."
good,With Walmart you can advance you just have to work hard. The hours are not consistent so you have to move up in order to be full time. I would work for them again
good,No Comment at this time. What it seems like to me is that if you are very sick and can't make and call out to many times you are fired even if you have a doctors note.
good,I was a Cart Pusher thoughout my time at Wal-Mart. in the desert through the summer was physically stressful and the people that managed us at this location commonly came out to tell us to do more even while showing signs of heat exhaustion.
good,Assistant managers only looked out for the company and not their employees. You don't get much help when u first start and you basically have to figure it out on your own.
good,Good entry job. Personally train you for your department. Management was very kind and approachable. Worked for a year there. Slow paced and stress free when I worked The graveyard shift.
good,"typical day at walmart , cashing checks, returns, pay utilities bills for customer, wire money local & International and loading gift cards."
good,Wal-mart provides a variety of job opportunities and with it a multitude of  benefits.  They try to help all associates in times of need.  They have several discounts and after an  initial period contribute to 401K and stock purchases.  I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart.
good,"this is a nice place to work . bust i s most for yuong people who don,t really have responsibility. because  they dont have enough hour/week for for the associate."
good,Working at Walmart I encountered a lot of people. It's a great job if you like talking to people and working with others. It's nice on slow times where you can just people watch and help other co-workers.
good,"Over night stocking was pretty nice, worked with cool people & the customers were nice & wasnt over crowded. We all worked together & got jobs done quickly. It was easily maneuvered to restock."
good,Overall it is a good company.it just depend on the manager.The hours are not schedule for the 40 hrs .The team is not working to take care of customers anymore.Supplies are not available at times when you need them .no overtime.If you work over you have to take it off by coming in late or an extended lunch
good,"It was a good experience working at walmart, I enjoyed most of the people I worked with and I would recommend anyone looking for a good starter job to apply at Wal-Mart."
good,"At first I truly enjoyed working at this location, however as time progressed I learned that it had poor management. One manager went as far as being manipulative in order to get what they wanted. My coworkers were very nice and what kept me working here for so long."
good,"I worked there for roughly six months. The other employees were friendly and nice and most of the managers were. Personally, as a cashier, after a while, I just got insanely bored with it. It's easy though."
good,Working for Walmart is a nice place. It's kind of hard to move up the command chain for management. Its a business like other jobs that have tasks and duties to be completed in an timely manner.
good,"Good starter job but a lot of work. I really enjoy working in dairy we make sure items are stocked in our department, stocking milk and eggs, unload trucks, help other departments like produce, frozen, and meats we also take care of claims and returns. Sometimes I feel like we do everything. All my coworkers and department manager are great people and are always happy to help with questions or anything I may need help with. I work very hard and I respect all the managers, they are all very nice but sometimes do a poor job at managing (not telling people what they should be doing). You will see many people not doing a good job and slacking off, in the end the hard working people will need to make sure the job is done right and that what needs to be done is done correctly. I havent had any experiences with bad costumers I try to always say hello and ask what I can help them find, if I don't know the answer I always ask another associate and never leave the costumer with the question unanswered. My best tip is to find an experienced associate and watch and learn from them, they will teach you a lot. I learned how to correctly read labels, not to overstock shelves, rotate milk, work the baler, zone correctly, cap bins, print labels, and overall help you when you have a question or need help. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with others not doing there work. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with some great people and the satisfaction of helping costumers find what they are looking for and answer questions."
good,"Before I went to management, the job was great. I really enjoyed it a lot, but wanted more money and accepted a position for management in another part of the store and that's when I began to not like the job. Following the wal mart rules ment going against the store managers rules and nomatter what I did, I found myself in a bad spot."
good,My time at Walmart was pretty good I worked it with a good night crew Everybody pretty cool the overnight stocking manager was reasonable he allow his workers to actually have a full break
good,Been there for many years. Treated me well. Others not so well. Cut hours. And not enough to get all you need some. Management is not so great. But I would recommend to work there if you absolutely need a job.
good,It was a nice place to work at. I would recommend this place to a friend to work at and start a career. It just wasn't the place for me I rather work more outside and hands on
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart it has a fun and productive working environment. The managers are friendly and easy to talk to. The hours are good and the pay is not bad
good,I unloaded trucks for wal mart pretty laid back job wouldn't mind going back if they would offer more but the micro management is what made me leave ....and no I cant submit this because everytime I try to it keeps telling me that my paragraph here isn't long enough so now hopefully this works and I can submit this now
good,"As a Customer Service Manager my daily routine is usually the same, with occurences of daily activities and customers varying. Taking care of cashiers, other front end associates and customers is the main goal. Helping managers with certain issues, maintaining parking lot as well as all restrooms and cash registers up to standards."
good,"Overall, the job was easy-going and there were not any tasks that I could not accomplish on my own. The hardest part about the job may have been lifting large packages like canoes or playground sets."
good,Great place to work and grow. Team based company. Very attentive management. Focus on customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job is ensuring and experiencing customer satisfaction. Quality customer service is expected and necessary to accomplish the goals associated with the company. Employees are very friendly and eager to help each other  when in need.
good,"Very busy, fast moving. I learned that you can only deal with one customer at a time. I learn about different people and their culture I enjoyed most talking with customers and ensuring they had a pleasant experience."
good,Great place to work and learn new things. Employees are nice and most of helpful. Management is great to talk to plus they’ll work with you on any situation.
good,it was really to along ago to remember everything but it was pretty much ok I was younger so salary didn't really matter but now im older with a daughter so it matters more on how much I make witch adds to my mortgage and expenses.
good,"Walmart is a great company to come in and learn from the ground up.  The management approach is very hands on, with limited classroom time and training. Work life balance is not good, but typical of any retail environment.  The pay is decent and benefits are decent as well.  It can get very political, best to stay focused on being best manger you can be, and always push toward self improvement and taking the next step."
good,Employees are mainly unrecognized. There are so many great workers who are underappreciated and not noticed by management. An employee can work very hard and sometimes still get put down.
good,"This job was not for me.  I stocked freezer section with the manager overlooking every step.  Your work is timed on a routine basis.  "
good,It's a good job for someone who doesn't need a whole lot of money but recomend for students and elderly. Basic beginners job or side job. Basically anyone can do it.
good,Walmart was one of the best companys i have worked for. They helped you when you needed help and everyone was friendly. Very cleaned and well orriantated work inviroment.
good,Relaxing place of work people get along very well good pay you can get help anytime you ask for it good lunch break a whole a hour to two 15 minute breaks
good,Cleaned the bathrooms and return bottle room. Occasionally pushed in carts when needed and everyone was nice including the customers. Was consistently cleaning to make sure things looked nice for the customers.
good,"Working at walmart gave me an experience that has lasted me a lifetime. With teamwork, good managment and encouraged workers everything went so smoothly. The most stressful day that I worked was black Friday..."
good,Walmart Is okay but there isn't enough help or advancement oppurtunities. I would recommend it to a friend because their experience their could be different.
good,"Buen empleo, sin embargo exigen mucho a ciertos asociados"
good,"dealing with customers cash handling covering cashiers breaks/ lunches, working overnight, dealing with organizing the Front-End and helping others and making sure the company is ran correctly."
good,It's a fun place to work at you're always busy and you get to meet new people and if you're a people person you will most likely enjoy this job you sometimes have to deal with rude people but that comes with every retailer type job
good,Working for Walmart is a great start up for a career. Great place to learning business and independent job skills. Great place to learning people person skills.
good,It was an enjoyable place for me to work and I would like to be able to be re-hired. I had some leaves of absence for medical reasons and they worked with me and kept my job available for me.
good,"when I was an asst  Manage  would  with are store manage in the morning . taking notes on likes and dilkes"
good,Always on the job and never a dull moment always moving on from one task to the other and always fast paced as there was always something needed to be done
good,"Working the service desk really can be a hit or miss, some times you have the nicest people and other times no matter what you do for them they aren't satisfied. Everyone is like a big family in Walmart and everyone is pretty easy to get along with for the most part."
good,"Its a great place to work if it's a first job. To each their own if someone wants to make a career out of it. Personally, I'd rather find somewhere else after a little over a year."
good,great experience. I've learned to help people the proper way. the management was excellent. the hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers
good,The most I learned from this job is how to operate a cash register and how to deal with some costumers. Not much else to note as I wasn't there for long.
good,"Not gonna lie, you will need to work your butt off if you want a career as a manager. 12 - 16 hour shifts are not unheard of they are quite common. The employees can become second family depending on you. The store is always made or broken by senior management, so take notice of who is interviewing you. Make sure you ask a lot of questions. I would recommend working here."
good,Walmart gave me experience in a field I had never been in (accounting) and taught me everything I needed to do the Job. Management was helpful and kind. I do appreciate all that they did for me and the trust they had in bringing me in with me having absolutely no knowledge on anything about accounting.
good,"you don't get enough hours people dress for work however they want, managers don't do their jobs correctly. you get paid less and the customers just overall dont like you for no reason"
good,It's easy to move around and advance up. They train you in every position. They ensure you take your breaks. You can not do anything off the clock work related.
good,"Good with costumers"
good,"ok.  To much time on your feet, Things are changing and not for the best. Seeing a lot of tenured mgrs. leaving the company for greener pastures.Good luck."
good,"Came in and found out what areas we would concentrate on and who called out. Then based on that, I would either stock shelves or pull trash or cleaned windows."
good,Empresa grande de estabilidad laboral pero sueldos bajos
good,Management doesn't really care about their employees or their opinions but my co-workers are always really friendly. I've learned a lot through Walmart such as sales and communication skills. The most enjoyable part of my job is working on vehicles and making customers Happy.
good,"Decent starter job to work. I would not suggest staying because of the low wages, and it seem like once you get a position it's hard to move up or switch positions."
good,Overall good place to work at.. Managers sometimes didnt know which way is up.. The training process can be a bit better.. The pay also can be a bit better as well
good,It was a fun place to work.  Wished for set hours.  Customer service fun place to be. Cashier status was good.  Balanced cash drawers. Did moneygram and bill pay.  Had to put back products from customers.
good,It’s really slowed paced. You stand in one spot. You learn to be more patient with others. It’s very diverse here and friendly environment. The people here are great!
good,The worst part was the apathy that most employees bring to work with them. That coupled with several shake ups in management led to a lot of confusion and inefficiency.
good,"When arriving at work, I plan out the evening on who will be working in each location of the store and their time frame to complete the task."
good,"Working here had opened a lot of doors for me and experience, My work load was always manageable and my bosses were understanding. I loved working here."
good,"If one decides to work at Wal Mart, be prepared for days that are extremely busy. It can be fun yet challenging. They offer career advancement opportunities. Many different types of jobs there to choose from."
good,"Walmart is a company that has great core beliefs, and good opportunity for advancement, but doesn't always follow its core beliefs when it comes to upper management."
good,"Good job for if you are currently going to school and need a stable source of income. Friendly and reliable coworkers and managers. Fast-paced and busy, but rewarding. Be ready for a few impatient and/or confused customers."
good,"While the job was easy and working w a team was cool the management had to high of expectations w the pay not being equal to that job. Truck Unloader would have to unload the truck in a fast pace and then stock freight. I don't think every store would be like this but mine was pretty messed up. Every week had a new itinerary where they would dump someone else's job onto the Cap Team. My direct supervisor would not speak up for us even when he knew wrong was happening. Job security was low at this location,  seemed like they couldn't wait to find a reason to fire unless you did anything without question. I would work there again just at a better location."
good,I had fun organizing products and using the creativity to sort and place products to look more attractive to customers. Had an overall enjoyable time at walmart
good,Just not enough hours. Very busy work place. Most employees are helpful if you dont know something but opportunities for promotion vary and are slim to none
good,I was able to use my technique experience during seasonal hoildays. I found very challenging under syress. I was able to work on the floor to arranging store items.
good,Very Fast Paced & The Hours Are All Over The Place But Overall I Liked Working There. The Staff Were Friendly & Everyone Got Their Job Done. The Overnight Shift Was Very Quiet So It Wasn’t Hard To Complete Your Work Without Any Distractions
good,"After your morning meeting, your assigned an area to go throw freight. You have goal times to open a box, check the home of the product, put it out, and if you cant put it out label as over stock and place back on a pallet. Good break times, 1 hour lunch, taking care of cardboard. clean up. Zoning for 1 hour which means being assigned an isle to bring products forward, look neat and presentable. "
good,"As I started working at Walmart I had to adapt quickly or get left in the dust. Working there you have to make concise decisions and help the customer with whatever they need. They had me working everywhere there and most of the time I would be in my position by myself. I like working on a team. But they did accomodate me as I asked to go from a highly responsible position to a less responsible one. The pay was okay, the bonuses were marginal. The management did their best to the best of themselves and I never had a problem with them. The schedule was not flexible, the breaks were good 2 15 mins and an hour lunch for a 8hour shift. "
good,"awesome environment. some of the shoobies are ignorant but some days it’s worth it. just like any place you work, you have your good managers, and your bad ones."
good,It was a great place to start I learned a lot. There was a lot of room for advancement. Work life balance got a little rough after getting promoted to salaried but the pay was decent.
good,It was ok it's not a bad job once you know what you are doing. Helping costumers & making sure you do your job the right way will make everything about working there much better.
good,",Everyone was very nice, I learn how to deal with customers, there was really nothing very hard that I could not deal with, I enjoyed working there, i just did not get enough hours"
good,Fast paced environment. Training for position was extensive. Felt comfortable starting job on own. Was not given days off that had requested in all their guidelines multiple times. Manager was not pleasant in handling my exit.
good,"Ambiente agradable, tranquilo, pagos puntuales. Lo recomiendo"
good,"I liked it there until I was told I was doing my job wrong. Had to cut my hours down, because of my child and might not work enough to live. Management had change many times in a few months that made things hard on the workers."
good,"I was very happy and felt very welcome"
good,Management poor but it’s Walmart not much is expected but overall wasn’t a bad place to work and if you have good management then the work is easy. Doesn’t pay well but like I said it’s a place to start.
good,Great job if you love working with people. Fast-paced and always busy which makes the shift go by fast.  Management doesn't work with each other which makes it difficult to know who to follow orders from.
good,"In my experience with Wal-Mart, working for them was overall good. They work with you and your schedule but sometime it might cost you hours on your paycheck. In my specific position (Asset protection) I found it difficult to move up the ladder because of lack of availability for the position above me. My advice is to start your employment as a sales associate on the floor. There is a lot more room to move on the sales side of Wal-Mart than it is on the Asset Protection side. I felt like the benefits lacked a little and If you’re expecting holidays off then I would find somewhere else to work as they only give you Christmas Day off and even on that day it’s not paid. They cover Christmas Day with your own paid time off. They don’t offer holiday pay either. I think on holidays they give 4 hours of extra PTO but I could be mistaken."
good,"It can be fun but at many times can be stressful. Certain times of the week or day can make it the most stressful; pay days/check cashing, mostly Thursday and Friday; or Holidays. But the front end associates try to have much fun S possible"
good,Very stressful environment and it seems you have to be someone’s favorite in order to be promoted for anything. Seems good for barely making ends meet.
good,"Its overall a good company with benifits."
good,I worked overnight for the extra $1.00 per hour and i liked it for the most part. I was only there for two months but for the time I was there I enjoyed it enough to stay there until I had a better opportunity present itself.
good,"Saludar a los compañeros,checar hora de entrada, recibir turno,( pendientes) desayunar (cafe) . preparar area de trabajo (limpiar, leer correos,captura de tarjetas de entrada y enviar correo a RH)"
good,I work for Wal-Mart remod crew Love it was fast pasted and the best Managers on the the remodeling crew! I enjoyed my whole day.The hardest part of the job is having change your crew after the job is done.
good,great place to work had good benefits fast pace very busy lots of help to do the job very busy the hardest part of the day was unloading trucks and getting them to the floor
good,"In order to work here, you must be quick and have patience. There are multiple codes you must know and be aware of the rules for the beer. You're always up and around on your feet."
good,"Great environment. Good place for a starter job or career, benefits are great, coworkers are very nice open door policy I loved it overall awesome!!!!"
good,"I haven't worked at Walmart in two years.  My job was to make sure that the front end (cash registers), as well as the service desk ran smoothly.  If it wasn't going like it should, it was my job to jump in there and make sure it got fixed really quickly."
good,At walmart every body respect est other.  You could  get fire if you have no respect. It's a safe place to work at. Everybody is responsible  for the safety of the customers and each other. It's a family oriented  work environment.
good,"Great beginners job for Auto Motive. Great way to make friends, because the have the same interests as you would. Walmart also has exceptionally benefits."
good,"Great for someone retired or a student. Flexible schedules. Very supportive and lots of growth opportunity. Some management is no good but for the most part, they are all very pleasant and encouraging."
good,Higher pay needed with that type of company especially for how much the company tends to bring in annually.  There should be no thoughts about it.  Recommend an increase.
good,I worked in the early years of Wal-mart.  This will a job you will either love or hate. I have many friends who have made this their career. Wal-mart has taken care of them. I was at the top of my pay scale with no chance for advancement with a pay rate increase.
good,"Aprendie os processos logísticos"
good,Working at Walmart has taught me how to work in retail and also be a source to customers whenever they needed to find a certain item. The most enjoyable time was when I got to work self check out and helped multiple customers at a time.
good,I enjoyed working here because I was allowed a break every 2 hours if you work a 9 hour day. It makes it so that you’re not working forever before you get a break.
good,Walmart afforded me an opportunity to work and grow in many areas. I worked in various roles to support the store's operations and service to the customer.
good,I feel working here is nice except they don’t like hiring associates in full time which it is what I need and I am wanting soon . They never have enough cashiers available and you never get any weekends off
good,"It was a good experience, management is a mess, and that was the main reason why I left. "
good,Not enough people to get the job done. You're timed for each department that you work in. departments rarely are finished in allotted time. Fellow employees are friendly and helpful.
good,startoff job for any i would recommend steady workplace and multiple associates to help you through anything you cant grasp or understand it a solid job
good,"pay was fine. depending on who i worked with, it was a good day. a lot of people outside your department telling you howe to do your own job. entry level people have a lot of tasks put on you that other people dont want to do."
good,I loved what I did and loved the people that I worked with. Plenty of chances for career advanments. I was an assistant manager for about a year. The health care benefits could have been better.
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for. They provide many different benefits and opportunities. There is opportunity for advancement, if you want to educate yourself or get a degree, or purchase home or auto. With a discount on various items in the store, paid time off accrued daily for full time employees, and three different break periods during the workday, Walmart takes care of its employees. At my particular store, there was an environment that made it feel like everyone was a friend, or at least someone you could talk to."
good,"I would greet customers as they came in the store."
good,As i stated there is good and bad in every company.  I have had the opportunity in Wal-Mart to gain a lot of knowledge and grow in every position I have been in and excelled in those positions. I love that about this company you always have the chance to learn more things and excel in you position.
good,"They allowed me to move around to different departments and this allowed me to learn about a lot of different products, also how to use bar code systems."
good,"There was never a dull moments and they don't really want you to take your 15min breaks even though you have them to take, above all though it was good pay, hard work but many a-time worth it, the customers often times than not made it worth it."
good,Empresa multinacional que proporciona o desenvolvimento e crescimento de seus colaboradores.
good,"I would work on a register and at customer service. While working here I learned how to deal with money quickly, how to handle hostile customers, and how work with others."
good,"Learned better time management, how to read upc labels, better communication skills, and many more helpful things while working there. The hardest part for me was the graveyard shift, but I figure working during the day would be better. Overall it's a pretty decent place to work in."
good,Really long hours with no set finish time. Order filling in really cold environment as fast as you can. Really fast paced work environment. Really Good pay incentive as well
good,Management is faced paced and on going. Great aspects is receiving and bonus that runs quarterly. Sometimes people can be unfriendly mostly the customer aspect.
good,"Great place to work. The work itself was great, always fun. Interaction with customers is wonderful. Gained great experience managing so many different personalities."
good,I would work at Walmart again if I had to maybe not in the front it gets to busy for me I would do electronics or something or maybe even customer service
good,I wouldn't say it was amazing but also i don't have anything bad to say about working at walmart. pretty much get what you see. I think some management could use some better training from time to time though.
good,"I worked nights so there were very few customers to deal with, mostly I worked by myself unloading and stocking boxes onto shelves, except the past few hours where everyone went back through and organized the shelves in their work area and we all helped anyone who had lagged behind"
good,"The management when I worked at Walmart was really great. There would be the days where they would put their foot down and take control but, other days they are fairly laid back and they have some fun with you as long as you do not take advantage of the situation."
good,Walmart is a nice place to work it’s not a career but it’s a job until I can get a job back in my career field. I enjoy meeting the different people that come through and the employees I work with.
good,Walmart is a very stressful place to work depending on position. Management do not consistently put out the fires that arise. Overall the place isnt the worst to work at. It's better than a factory
good,"A typical day at Walmart is normal speed. I learned a lot about the departments and CEO. Also the customer's will bright your day up anytime of the day and night. "
good,Mostly easygoing workplace with a lot of bureaucracy. As long as the work gets done everything is fine. Good culture with easygoing coworkers and management
good,Customers were the real variety in the workplace and the only difficulties came up during the lunch hours. Only problems were that annual raises could be nullified if the minimum wage increased.
good,It was a great job. I enjoyed the fast paced environment; it was the best time for me to shine and show my capabilities. Enjoyed working with like minded people.
good,"Working here can be overwhelming at times, it is best to clear your mind regularly. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone with low patience and/or anger issues."
good,Newcastle Walmart was a great work place. They make you really feel at home and like a big family. They did a great job with training and helping with any question. I really miss working there!
good,I would go back to Wal-Mart you come in contact with people from all over was able to learn as I worked have the option/opportunity to further my learning and walmart helps with that. I feel that walmart can help you be a better you in this work world
good,"Always have a friendly face, even if you dont feel like it. Put out what you want to receive. Be a team player. But always remember that you are dispensable, so make yourself stand out if you want to promote."
good,"Fast paced environment, asked to do multiple tasks in areas your not assigned in. Too many things going on to help customers questions or not enough associates in areas to help customers and mgmt is forced to help"
good,I liked the working environment for the most part. But you have to be in the lingo to get a promotion. And hour are always going up and down. But you do get a discount card after 90 days.
good,"difficult to convince customers to buy phones"
good,A full day work is quite tiring. The management is not friendly. Poor Management. There are no benefits for the students who work there. Co-workers are quite good to work with.
good,"I’ve worked at Walmart for some time and while it it a good place to work for someone just out of high school, I would not recommend it long term (5+years).  Management changes can lead to complete revamping of department operations and rule changes that may interfere with getting things done.  Many stores are understaffed as well leading to associates getting stuck at the cash register and not getting things done in their departments during busy shopping days (ex: weekends). While this doesn’t affect my position (cart associate) as much, other departments have complained.  It all depends on where you work."
good,I think the customer are friendly I like the hours the break ok I jus don’t like getting carts and the winter but Walmart a great place to start yo career somewhere
good,Poor upper management.. When your team is supposed to be four people and they all call in management tells you that your responsible for everything and you get no help.  They treat there employees very poorly and have no respect for employees.
good,Buen trabajo para aprender a trabajar bajo presión.
good,A typical day at work was cleaning up the office and counting down my drawer and when I was done I would take customers who needed everything from cashing a check to sending money.
good,Wal Mart was very much a results driven company which offered both personal and career objectives based on an associates ambitions. It did allow individual expression within the parameters of company guidelines.
good,if your great at customer service then this is a great place. advancements are available but must be earned by competency test and proof of dependability. it seems that some show favoritism
good,Walmart was a great job while i was in school. It was super flexible and gave me the hours necessary to make the amount of funds i needed for the time. Got to work in different positions and learned a lot in my experience there.I matured a lot as a worker there and only made me want to strive to reach new heights.
good,I think it's an ok place to work. At times it seemed under staff. They tend to over work their good employees while overlooking the employees that are constantly slacking.
good,A typical day at work for me would be coming in with the right attire on as far a job id and the right uniform. I would clock in and go to a leader and ask what register they want me at today or what would they like for me to do today. i would work form 7am to 5pm with 2 ten minute break and a 1 hour lunch break. Working and checking the customers out until its time for me to clock out.
good,While at Wal-Mart I became a Department Manager rather quickly.  I had 3 different departments to Manage.  There were good staff that I would assign tasks to each day.  The Healthcare and Employee Benefits were least than you would think for a company that size.  I enjoyed putting together displays and making sure customers had what they needed.
good,Grateful for the opportunity to work there happy with the things I learned. If you work hard and show up everyday you can move up and make a career of Walmart.
good,"Walmart is a multicultural place, you get to meet a lot of people from different countries, age groups and ideas. Not only are your associates different in such a manner, the customers also bring associates to new products, let's say new food, new books."
good,"N/A To explain through texts a lot easier to explain over the phone, there's a lot of good benefits to work there, but bad parts of the work place. May Call if you want more information."
good,"Overall, working as a cart pusher was fulfilling in terms of a part-time job.  A typical day included collecting carts for most of the day while aiding customers whenever possible and keeping the parking lot clean.  I learned effective time management skills and perseverance in a fast-paced environment.  In conclusion, a good job to have for part-time position."
good,"I do my assigned work."
good,"I learned something changes everyday due to customer needs, the hardest part of my job is listening to coworkers complain about how much they have to do. I really enjoy working with the general public"
good,"Working as a pharmacy technician at Wal-Mart pharmacy required constant standing, lifting, and moving.  The environment is fast-pace and of high demand after 5 on the weekdays.  Excellent customer service and accuracy are two qualities needed for this job."
good,It was generally okay. but lack of management support and supervision has lead the place to fall short of custmers and eventually die down. needs better managers.
good,"We had fun working at Walmart, most customers where very nice to talk to and get to know. We had contests between the cashiers to see   who was faster or how many customers we received in a day. Walmart on holidays would treat us with food, games and giveaways."
good,Empresa multinacional que ocupa a primeira posição no mercado gaúcho.
good,I loved the job except for how management speaks to employees like they had no respect wasn’t human and were beneath them. I had a horrible experience with management at #605 I had never abandoned a job before this but the lack of respect I was getting there was beneath me no job is worth you feeling like they made me feel and to think respect for others is what Walmart is supposedly built on.
good,"I get there I had to work sometimes alone to make sure everything got done, never get back up from management when something comes up. Work place culture is lacks if you don’t know anybody they don’t talk to you. The hard part getting yelled at for doing your job. Nothing enjoyable."
good,"There is Room for advancement if you are a go getter. Many different areas of work, lots of customers thtat need help finding products can be a rewarding job."
good,"Flexible with hours, lots of employees, friendly environment.  Work is moderately acceptable.  May make you work around different departments if not busy."
good,"Muitas pessoas gostam de se sentir superior aos outros que acabam de entrar na empresa, e começam a humilhar"
good,A day at work was very exciting not knowing what was gonna happen that day. And managers made it better. Knowing i had someone to turn to to ask questions.  The worst part of the job was the people in the environment very competitive.
good,It was cool working at Walmart. Wasn't really stressful until the holidays. I loved that we had hour lunches and two 15 minute breaks. My days went by fast with this system
good,The job was laidback easy they just didn’t have enough worker so they worked the overnight crew hard  for that lil money and my body started to ache me bad
good,left because had to relocate but it was a job. was a long drive for me since i lived in rancho cordova and drove all the way to citrus heights. a job is a job
good,"As a personal shopper, you have to pick people's order and make sure the items are in good condition and making sure you would buy it yourself. You are required to lift at least 10-15 pounds as you do have the chance of getting dog food or cat liter. But is overall a good job."
good,"Walmart is known for having mostly hospitable workers and a friendly shopping environment, The same can be said when working for them, they maintain a friendly and fun working environment."
good,"I started walmart in 2009 on the remodel crew in 2009 after getting fired from raleys in 2008 of december so I went on unemployment for a a few months then started working at walmart i first started on graveyard shift working with alot of temps they kept about 30 to 40 percent of us because of our work ethic I then got hired on as maintenance  did that for a few yrs then was a cashier part time because I Went to college of the siskiyous for my computer hardware and software certs which I took to long to get because I was always working and paying the bills instead of focusing on new things and my future goals but now I can say after working in retail a total of 11 yrs im ready for a change "
good,"I was a cashier at Walmart and I enjoyed it very much. I got to meet a ton of people and got to where I was quick at checking people out, which helps at my new job at dollar general."
good,"its hard work and much lifting, there is frustration when other associates don't do their job properly, and customers make a mess and don't care to say anything or clean it up, management is good when they want to be. i learned that i am very particular on how things should be in my mind. i have become a perfectionist in some ways, most enjoyable would be, being able to bring out from the back exactly what a customer is looking for and seeing the excitement on their face that we actually had what they were looking for."
good,It scary not feeling like your not job is secure. Not always being able to come to your supervisor with questions. The workers are not always helpful in the large stores.
good,very family oriented place to work at. very clean and one of the nicest stores i have had the opportunity to work at! management was well run and coworkers definitely were team oriented.
good,Walmart is a great place to work if you enjoy dealing with people     It’s also great if you need a flexible schedule.  Team work is important.    Management is highly approachable
good,"a typical day is usually you standing on your feet for hours. the workplace culture is diverse, the most enjoyable part about the job is meeting so many different characters coming in to purchase products."
good,Walmart offer a lot of benefit for there employees. Understaffed and stressful environment. Great bonuses and pay for your license education. Poor management
good,I loved interacting and meeting new customers. Job wasn't super hard. Mangers were good. Had reasonal breaks. Had okay pay. Never had overtime. Most holidays you work
good,When stocking inventory it can be very satisfying to know that I put everything in its place and that everything is where it needs to be. Very productive work environment.
good,I loved working at Walmart it was a fun fast paced job that i learned a lot at my coworkers were fun people i made a lot of good connections  and friends
good,I loved working for walmart it was fun.I love the customers and peoplei worked with. The breaks were very fair. The discount was ok. I still think they could have given 5 more %. So it would have been 15%.
good,Overall good company but some management don’t know how to manage properly. I enjoy the fast paced environment always keeps me busy with a lot to do throughout the day!
good,Our night manger kept us over worked and hard at times to get all done. Was to many things to do in 8 hours. If was over  your hours to get all done you was told to stay until done and cut your hours if went pure. But really enjoyed my job there some managers was good just had one that over pushed her workers.
good,"I work at the Littleton Walmart store. I love the crew I work with, and the associates who fall under me are mostly pretty agreeable. however, the management team the store has in place is mediocre at best. "
good,No work life balance. Not an environment that is good for your family. Walmart has been a good company to work for but has changed over the years with the changes of the customer needs
good,First we cap the bins when we come in at 4am. Than we worked our pics. Sometimes we would have to work live fraight if overnights didn't finish. Than work top stock
good,The work is very simple but the management try to over complicate everything. The hardest part of the job is when you finish your task too fast you got to take over someone else's work and in turn make you day harder while someone gets an easier day
good,Wal-Mart can be a stressful place but was my first job so I learned a lot about customer service and working with people and learned how to cashier taught me responsibility.
good,I would call working at Walmart a learning experience. Walmart has taught me how to properly stock shelves and provide customer service to shoppers around me.
good,free food every so often. but small storage very crowded. Customers are nice. managers do not communicate well with one another. it took 2 months to fix my schedule
good,Walmart is an alright place to work. They usually are pretty good and figuring out what the people need but they have slipped up from time to time. They usually have you work for a year before you can earn your benifits
good,If you were a part of the right group you will go far if they see is an asset most likely they're going to work you into the ground and if you came in barely above par you could Coast so much further without getting in trouble not a very good model to follow in my opinion
good,I really enjoyed my job art Wal-Mart. I was just out of college andit was something that I looked forward to walking into every day. Very great management and made you feel like you were part of their team right away.
good,"Its a good first job, its not a job to stay at forever. The pay is decent not a lot to take care of all your monthly bills if you ask me . The people were great to be around , great experience."
good,"I started at Walmart after graduating high school to help pay for college. It was perfectly fine for a part-time gig to pay for gas and books. I've worked through two different store managers and several direct managers and all were not only great to work with, but willing to work with people's schedules especially for students. The job itself is great to get a foot in the door for experience in retail, customer service, with chances for upward mobility in management."
good,enjoyed working here .. only left because i broke my ankle and couldn’t stand the shifts .. but i worked over my two week notice and will hopefully be returning
good,I have enjoyed my time with Walmart. It has been a great company to work for. There are always new ideas and new processes to learn at every level. There is a lot of career growth within the company.
good,Very good entry level job for students. Management is very good about being fair to all associates. great benefits all around and a lot of great teamwork
good,It is a starter job to build experience but won't pay the cost of living and didnt have advancement opportunities. Work was easy and no prior experience or skills needed.
good,Many opportunities everyone has their own Walmart story/experience. I was afforded a incredible opportunity that I may not have been offered anywhere else.
good,"Fast paced job in which management is very hard to break through. Was offered many jobs but sadly fell through the cracks of Walmart. I was always a very hard worker in which I was told, it was because of my hard work that my position would never move higher..."
good,"It was a good place to work at the time. Not sure about now as this was a long time ago. The offered flexible hours, competitive pay and benefits. People were very friendly."
good,"Great place to make better than average salary, almost immediately."
good,I had fun working at Walmart and always looking to advance my career I would advise not to do it in Walmart. There are some managers out to make it hard for you but there is a nice one also.
good,"Work experience was great, associate were manageable. Some supervisor were respectful and pleasant to work for. What I didn't like is favoritism that the upper management displayed according to race."
good,You have to have great customer service to work for them. Help your customer the best way you know how. Work hard on satisfying the customer get them taking care of.
good,"En líneas generales, es un gran lugar para trabajar. El problema es que a veces las jornadas de trabajo son extensas y los descansos para el personal son muy breves."
good,It's a fast paced during certain times of the day most days.. you got to make sure you have comfy shoes for the standing you'll do.. It was fun and awesome because there was always new people along with the regulars that come in daily to have conversations with..
good,handled several responsibilities at one time. learned how to work with a diverse work force and how to work best to get all tasks done in a timely manner.
good,"a typical day at work was waiting on customers, I learned customer service desk door greeting layaway during the holiday seasons facing and stocking, Management changed rapidity from one manager to another. the hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers that felt that the customer is always right.the most enjoyable part of the job was assisting great caring outstanding customers."
good,"A typicall day at work was a busy day"
good,"Overall a good place to work, sometimes gets packed but it keeps the day going fast. From time to time the customers get rude but great customer service comes in roll there"
good,A typical day working at Wal-Mart is a busy one. What i learned there is how to keep the produce products in rotation. Rotating the damaged or expire produce.
good,Easiest way to learn where everything is just to walk around the store putting things back where they belong. Also even old people in wheel chairs steal .
good,"I enjoy meeting new people and I also  like the fast paced environment, the busier the better. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers but just knowing how to deal with them is kinda easy."
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for, but their pay is inadequate for the other retail stores around. Management is usually very helpful, and associates as well but there are bad just like there would be anywhere"
good,There are many advancements working at Walmart.  There is vacation days.  The management works with employees to fit their needs.  It's a job that keeps you busy and guaranteed hours
good,Cleaning up Walmart bathroom and sweeping floors was my typical day. I liked doing it the most part I got to meet new people and made friends the hardest part of the job was picking up someone else's work so it wouldn't fall on others or me
good,"At Windsor Walmart, the environment was pretty relaxed. Management keeps it clean, better than the competing Walmarts around. I'd say working at this one wasn't too bad, but not great pay but what can you expect in this type of career field."
good,"Walmart does not pay very well but they are flexible with schedules. It's possible to have a family life while retaining a job with Walmart. Managers are inconsistent and nobody follows policy. Health insurance sucks, dental and vision are good."
good,It was a long time ago l worked there I was younger and needed a job to pay rent and Wal Mart was the place to go. The work wasn’t very hard just repetitive
good,"As a fresh cap employee, I undergo steps every day to ensure everything is done correctly. We are team based so everyone is assigned a section. The sections include meat, produce, and bakery-deli. We are to do the daily task according to whatever section we are assigned. We do lift some heavy crates and have to keep inventory correct daily. We make sure the floor is stocked and rooms are being kept up with throughout the day."
good,in the beginning it was a bit bumpy. it got better when they changed the store mangers. from there everything went more smother and well. i cant complain
good,the good part is typical day at what you learned management workplace culture the hardest part of the job the most enjoyable part of the job do not include company information
good,Walmart has a bad rap for being a low tier job but it is reliable stable work as long as you do your part. If you're looking for work there isn't a problem.
good,Long hours and when work there low pay pretty good benefits. And very busy with customers. What I learned stocking clothes and zoning. To many managers.
good,sometimes walmart will put people in the manager position that really do NOT belong there... my last manager had a bad habit of talking about people behind there backs about information that was supposed to be confidential.
good,"cashiering was stressful and management at my location could've worked together better. a typical day at work could be either a great day or the worse day ever, depending on who worked that day & how busy the store was. the hardest part of the job was putting up with their ever changing system and dealing with rude customers from time to time. the most enjoyable part of the job was the good customers, the learning aspects of the job, happy/friendly coworkers, etc. what i learned was that it takes a lot of patience to work in a big retail company but you really meet some good people."
good,"Walmart was a good place to work at but there was times I wish I could have gotten a raise for the hard work i did. Other than that, my coworkers where very friendly & the staff was awesome and they halped me when needed."
good,they was a supporting management team that tried to work around my school schedule they provided a supporting work environment that showed many opportunities for promotion
good,Working at Walmart is a cool job but when you don't have a goal or task for the day it can become tedious. I learned how to put together different aisles and make it look neat. I enjoyed the people I met while working there.
good,"Covient grocery store.Always busy.When busy is slow,managers always had other jobs to be done. Diversity with co workers and management.Able to grow but not in a career oriention only as experienceand stepping stone company.Training and recertification yearly is always available."
good,"Little to no recognition. "
good,The main complaint I have for working at my specific walmart is the inconsistent hours. All I wanted was to have a fixed schedule. When your schedule is up and down it becomes difficult to balance your personal life with your work life. Especially if you have children.
good,Management was bad. You won't be noticed until management needs your help. My first month i had 2 managers and each manager had assigned me on different department tasks.
good,The job wasn’t bad as a cap 2 team associate but the management needs to learn how to communicate better nobody knew of anything that another member of management had done like changes or policies so everyone just kind of did their own thing.
good,"Wanted to stay on as full time, liked the night work, but job was temporary.  I liked keeping aisles clean, and products tidy and the cardboard baled for pickup."
good,Extremely fast paced great experience overall I would recommend to anyone salary is a plus must be flexible amd the ability to multitask is a plus.....
good,It was a nice job. I wish I didn't lose it due to sick days. sadly it wasn't enough to properly live on by myself in the area I live in and I am wanting a job that I can live off of.
good,"High stress "
good,At Walmart it was okay I don’t think they treat there employees right.... and also I think that it should be a little fun while working and not so much being mean
good,I enjoyed working with certain employees. it was very calm and slow at sometimes but when there was work to be done I had a blast working in the photo lab. My favorite thing to do by far was making canvases. I didn't like some of the managers but you won't always like who you work with so I ended up dealing with it.
good,The staff are very helpful if there's something you can't figure out. Most of the customer service reps are the bomb.  Good teamwork makes the dream work! Just wish they had set shifts.
good,"Very fast paced job.  Not much wiggle room for management jobs, and not much work-home life balance.  Good job for a young and single person with drive."
good,I worked there for four years in the jewelry dept. It was fun at the time. It was before they became a super store. We would close the store at 9 pm .The hourly pay was low at the time.
good,"Helps with customer service skills! Great way to interact with customer and meet new people! Great opportunity to move up in the company, and learn more on customer service!"
good,"Working at Walmart was a great learning experience, I definitely learned my working edge at Walmart, although management could have been better on communication with all associates."
good,Enjoyed teaching & training associates. Getting every one involved in learning the company’s standards in a fun developing way.  Embracing the Sams club culture for myself learning new things to help me along my career path
good,"The work may be monotonous, but it pays well starting at $11 an hour and going up from there. Three months in gets you a discount card and a year you get more benefits like insurance. They also have programs to help with furthering your education, learning new languages and helping out-of-work conflicts. The training was alright and the managers are willing to help new hires with whatever they ask about. Only real downside is they're super strict with clock in times, the discounts don't cover as much of the store as you'd hope and the wait for insurance is a little long."
good,"great place if you're young"
good,"I would say overall a good place to work. The employees do the best they can, though the vibe tended to be poor, since customers weren't always nice, so it's a spiral of store depression."
good,Started as great company to work for. But overtime true colors showed and become overstressed and ended up getting hurt on the job which lead to workers compensation
good,"I worked as a cap team associate. I enjoyed my work and the people I worked with. I had a hard job to do with customers and coworkers rustling about, but we always got our work done on time and efficiently."
good,"Sales associate, greeting customers and stocking.  Management is great and the most enjoyable part is the customers and co-workers.  Operating the cash register and following all guidelines when using coupons."
good,Walmart has served me fairly for almost 7 years. The hours have been beneficial for my provision as a single mom up until recently.  I have good experiences that I will take with me into my next journey.
good,I think it has the potential to be a great Job. It just doesn't offer much room for advancement. I would recommend wal Mart as a starting job. It did teach me how to take more time with customers. To be more efficient with warehouse managing.
good,Walmart is a good job but I just don’t think the pay is good. The mangers  don’t have good communication skills and they are unorganized many of times.
good,Starting part time you won't get much hours . Every year you get a raise .  Customer service is of the upmost importance . once you get full-time you can get comfortable.
good,walmart is a good first job. there is room to move up to become a manager. you can learn a lot  from working here. the management is alright.. you have your good managers and your bad managers
good,I have worked at 2 different Walmart locations in different cities. There is a huge difference between the both of them. Doesn't matter which Walmart you work at. Customers will complain about not having enough lines opened and prices being wrong regardless if you are at a good Walmart or a bad Walmart store. You can't please everyone. I learned to do what you are told to do. Not everyone is your friend. Focus on getting that paycheck.
good,When I began working at WalMart I was just a cake decorator. In just a few years I was promoted to the department manager of both the bakery and produce departments. The associates that I oversaw were team players. We were like a family.
good,Love the customer service and cashier position the employees were great and the manager that hired me was very respectful and kind i loved working there
good,"En lo personal no me gusto trabajar ahi. Hay muchas personas que piensan que pueden hacer contigo lo que quieran, aunque no sea tu responsabilidad."
good,In the 7 months of me working at Walmart I learned more about how company’s work which informed me on customer service and people skills. Working in an office also gave me more skills of office work in the near future.
good,"Constantly lift 5-60 pounds, production paced, management is fairly nice and supportive, hardest part is lifting boxes, easiest is lifting boxes, A great place for career advancement."
good,"A typical work day work be very busy, handling returns. Ensuring customer satisfaction. ordering merchandised. refilling shelves, keeping walks free of debris, attending performance summary meetings. and helping customers."
good,"The only real issue is the management. Shifts are workable, people aren't hard to deal with, fast-paced so time flies. Breaks and lunches are reasonable."
good,"I actually loved working at Walmart, especially during Black Friday and the busy times, it was upbeat, kept me busy, and the time generally went by quickly. I generally got good hours and the pay was okay. Only issues I had were, I was employed as a cashier and was more often than not put on the service desk which is a higher paying job, and while I was often on the service desk I was never moved to a service desk position so I was doing the job but not being compensated for it. Also the management at Walmart doesn't seem to care about their employees in the least. I witnessed them make an employee sit by the office with a deep slice in her forearm for around 30 minutes while they got their paperwork together before she was allowed to go to the hospital. I worked in lawn and garden and watched a manager tell an employee who was injured, and had doctor's orders that she wasn't to be on her injured foot, that she couldn't sit on a stool at the cash register and she had to get up and help move plants and such or she had to go home, and if her missing work caused her to be terminated that it didn't matter because their were plenty of people looking for jobs. I also heard of them getting upset at a pregnant employee for not painting while they were remodeling their store. While it's a good job, management doesn't care about their employees in the least. The only time I saw them show concern to an employee was when a female employee slipped in water in their restroom where there was no wet floor sign and hit her head. She was allowed to sit on a chair by the sitting room and answer"
good,"You start off small for years...Pay sucks and their benefits are the same. The only good thing about working here was the people I met (associates and managers). I loved the people I met as they were always helpful and friendly. They have really great benefits, if you work there for a few years."
good,I had a horrible experice and still curretly employed at walmart in the tle garage. Our management is mediocre and with home office making our scheduleds we are almost gaurenteed to be understaffed. Not good for bussiness
good,Great company to work for with a lot of growth opportunities. Very diverse environment. Always teaching and training associates about new changes to the company
good,"A Great place to work. Awesome coworkers, Good Management team. Absolutely loved interacting with the customer base. Very user friendly cyber learning."
good,If you are people person this is good job to work at. Also its fast pace and if know how to multitask. Have a great customer service this will be the perfect job
good,"It was challenging, productive, constructive, fast paced, what I loved in a job.  Making more money wasn’t really a big issue because I worked because I loved to and people are the world to me."
good,"The management was the main reason I left other than transportation issues. Management was not friendly or understanding or comforting to their employees. It was an enjoyable environment considering the work and I did meet some good people there. I enjoyed some of the work and the people I met the most, and if it weren't for the management, I would go back."
good,"If you like the fast paced and never in your department lifestyle than this is the life for you. Not too bad of a place to work, just wasn't my cup of tea."
good,"Excellent picker on time never called off rarely pleasant to be around other people"
good,The job was fine I had no problems with it. Was a job that I used to get through college and help pay for part of college. It was a fine company to work for.
good,Es buen trabajo no alcanza el salario por cuestiones personales termine mi relación con la empresa
good,Great work place for someone single or someone’s first time job.  Paid time off and 401k offered. Not enough holidays though. Didn’t like working every weekend
good,"Management needs to improve. They are not very compassionate about their employees. They need to hire more people at the one I'm at, expecting one person to do a 3 man job. Other then that it's a good place to work"
good,"Fast paced, hard job for the money and the employee where not friendly and management was trash and did I say the pay was garbage................,,,,,,"
good,"Walmart is a fun place to work once you get the hang of things, but it can also be very hectic because of the random spurts of customers from time to time."
good,Not a bad place to work. Just need more hours available and less self check outs. Room to grow but not as much as one may like. It’s a start to help pay your bills
good,There is both ups and downs working here it hard to advance unless you push yourself. They have a bad habit of cutting hours even though they might be short if you drop below 30 hours forced to move to part-time can lose benefits cause of hours.
good,"Depending on who you have as your manager you could have either a secure and efficient job, or a tiring and slow work day. The hardest part is making sure you stock everything as fast and clean as possible. The benefits outweigh the specifications, however it just depends on how your team and management are."
good,"I enjoyed my 11 years at Walmart. I was truly sad to leave my position.Depending on the Store Manager, depends on if you promote or not. Not all store managers are like that."
good,This position requires the associate to be on their feet for almost the whole shift. There is always something to do within the store once the picks are done.
good,This job was an ok job...its a great 1st job for someone trying to get experience as a cashier...although everyday cashiering wasnt bad...around the holidays it was stressful and very overwhelming...i hated having to work threw the holidays specially having to deal with all the crazy customers
good,Not hard work but had a few issues finishing my amount of work by myself by the end of my shift sometimes. failing to finish your work on times leads to an occurrence.
good,You have your highs and lows with any job. Good money if they give you good hours. Don’t sign up for core hours unless you are absolutely okay with what they’re giving you.
good,Walmart was a tough company to work with but I’ve always given it my all. I help in multiple aspects of the company completing multiple tasks throughout the day. I helped many other managers and loss prevention associates with their jobs as well while still doing my own.
good,Really good place to work with great people and good environment is fantastic place. This place should be visited by everyone because they have great things
good,I loved working around the nice employees and helping customers whenever I could. I learned very many skills from being more social and more active to reacting at situations faster because of it.
good,They helped me out a lot in showing me how to do the things that were needed for the job. Most of the managers were kind and helpful but they did not care much about medical emergencies they still count them against you.
good,In the short time that I have worked here I have realized some things that just don't really add up. For 1 no matter the emergency or reason there is a point system when you start and continue but that can determine if you stay or go not your work ethic. No matter if you have doctor's note or anything a point is a point and if you is all of your points you are terminated no questions asked.
good,"My experience at Walmart was many years ago, so I am unsure if any of this still applies. I hear many bad things about Walmart, but I'd have to say that my experience there was overall quite good. They offered assistance to achieve your GED or High School diploma, I got a full 40 hours per week, Paid vacation after your first year."
good,You will come in and if your a cashier stand on a register all day if u stock shelves u will do your pics and empty bins all day you get a 15 min break every 2 hrs and u take a lunch at your 4 hour working mark
good,el sueldo es poco y la posibilidad de ascenso es poca
good,A typical day at work can become stressful but nothing I couldn't overcome. The years I have worked at Walmart I have learned patience and how to communicate with my customers. The hardest part of this job is the management team not recognizing some of the hard workers and how much we put into our job. Me personally I love every job I have simply because I enjoy working and being around different people.
good,I liked working there if I didn't have medical issues I'd probably still be there great co-workers and supervisiors. I would recommend working at Walmart to anyone who is interested.
good,Working there was the plan and not being a Cart Pusher for long . Yet I was let go due to Walmarts point system it's definitely the biggest problem they have .
good,I Really Liked to work With WAL-MART CANADA because it was a good experience to have and nice people to work with. It was the best workplace  I ever have seen.
good,"Lugar bom para quem procura o primeiro emprego, que fornece estabilidade e trabalho em equipe , sempre visando melhoria do seu caráter e obrigações para que vc saia de lá com o carimbo do Walmart"
good,"Stressful at times, busy, friendly, fun. Management were flexible and understanding about the work and personal issues. They would help us out and push us to do better"
good,Walmart was an excellent place to be employed it contains great benefits and opportunity to grow in the company with a chance to receive full benefits
good,Buen lugar para aprender a trabajar en equipo y ser responsable.
good,I learned a lot working there Smiling Faces a good place to work not always easy everyone have them days there you have manager that have favoritism and some them don't
good,"Overall, my time at Walmart was alright. I think it providing good pay for the tasks that were asked of me. Given that I was in a college town, most of my coworkers were students as well, which was nice."
good,"On the CAP 2 team, which is the swing shift for stocking and unloading trucks, there is a lot of pressure. We were understaffed and that made it difficult to finish our tasks on time. The ""One Best Way"" got in our way more than anything. Our assistant managers helped us and were very friendly and overall decent to work with, however the store manager was rude and manipulative. If we had even a minute of overtime we had to take a long lunch or leave early in order to have the perfect amount of hours unless otherwise approved. They would give the associates at the store food and dicounts, however it always seemed like the CAP 2 team did most of the work, but was rewarded very little and punslished more than any other."
good,I like working for Walmart. My coworkers are fun for the most part. My manager works with me. They are just cutting hours. One to two days a week is not enough for me.
good,Working at Walmart I enjoyed working with the public but management needs improvement. Managers are rude and have very little respect for those under them but demands respect. uncaring
good,"Terribly understaffed on day shift. Expected way to much of 1 person for 3 departments.Plus having to get on registers when lines would back up. Enjoyed the job. Loved the challenge. This is another place who does not appreciate good, hard working, loyal workers. For some reason after time they become a threat in management eyes because they know their performance is lacking. They were doing everything in their power to eliminate all full time employees to save on benefits. Tough to move up in the company. Another place that does not feel they have to follow the rules they preach. It is a do as we say not as we do atmosphere."
good,"I had no plans of leaving but my health was in bad shape I was a forklift operator and the daily use of the lift was taking its toll on my lower back which occurred in the Army, the ability to bend and lift materials in the warehouse hindered my ability to meet production requirements."
good,"I enjoyed doing and completing all my tasks, taking care of customers, working as a team with my co workers, etc. It was a very good atmosphere and company to work for."
good,"I worked 14 months at customer services of Plano store that provided fast and friendly customer services I learned many new things like money orders , cashing checks , money transfers , I had good relationships with my supervisors and other coworkers but I had issue about schadule they don care that much , and I apply for superviser postions  and I wait 6 months they did not give me any chance to try..."
good,"The management is pretty good. Learned how to deal with customers, and that was the most enjoyable part of the job. Company cares about workers but aren't flexible enough with availability in certain departments."
good,I loved my job and the people I worked with. I would go back to Walmart under different management. It was always fast paced and you had to multi task constantly.
good,"While working at Walmart there are many different types of people there. Some are quiet and some are loud. Others are willing to help you and some make you figure it out on your own. Overall it was a fun experience and if giving the opportunity, I would go back to work there."
good,"During my latest history of working at Walmart in Waco TX I experienced an extremely poor environment. My peers were great, just the management led with anger instead of prais and appreciation which lead to low moral."
good,Work for Walmart for two years never had a problem with anyone usually managers would give me fair hours throughout the week. My co-workers where all pretty chilled people full time or part time would enjoy working just because in what department you choice to work for.
good,Always work hard and keeping busy. Supervisor is always fair with treAting to their employees. Holidays usually have free meals. pay is decent starting wage.
good,I enjoyed working with Walmart. I learned to work with cross functional teams and multi ethnic groups. Management collaboration was nice. Workplace culture was appreciable and tolarable.
good,"Amei o período que trabalhei, sempre em equipe, me superei ganhei minha promoção para conferente."
good,"The job itself was honestly really enjoyable, but managment was always very rude with their workers. If we stood up for ourselves in any sort of way, we were told that we were being disrespectful."
good,"Recruited as an external candidate to develop, implement and promote functioning field HR role.  Exciting opportunity with plenty of opportunities to both mentor, implement new HR strategies.  A great opportunity,"
good,It was a good environment and great place to work. Good management and staff. Hours were great for people in school or with a second job. Overall good place.
good,Not a very enjoyable place to work. Compensation does not necessarily meet activities requested. Management can be very poor and not very mindful of the staff depending on department.
good,"Greeting customers, responding to questions, operating cash registers, improving engagement with merchandise and providing outstanding customer service. I learned flexibility by helping out in each department. My manager was awesome."
good,Working at Walmart has its perks and cons. A perk would be certain positions have constant hours if you advance. A con would be that management tends to not know what its like to be on the floor  at times.
good,start with a morning meeting to be assigned designated work area. maintain a clean work area and to work safely.  make sure lables are correct and on the belt correctly.
good,"Everything tended to be hit or miss. Depending on the how management was feeling that day it could be great or terrible. Traffic through the store was also an important factor. Management couldn't handle busy days and being that we were one of the most successful stores in the area that was often. Overall they tried their best, and while some workers did not contribute with hard work of their own it made working hard even more admirable to them."
good,great place to work but you have to be there a long time to get on full time. Schedule is sometimes crazy. Management is easy to get along with. The hardest part of job is working in hot and cold climates. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people.
good,Employees are allowed too much freedom to disrupt customer service. Allowed to call off anytime based on a point system. It's hard to have the coverage you need to provide good customer service.
good,recieved minimum of 40hrs per week...had set schedule with two days off back to back. worked every single thanksgiving. store was 24hrs so at times was hard 2 complete job in timely manner because of customer traffic
good,I do not recommend Walmart for someone looking to move up the ladder or for walmart to be a career. Walmart like many other places should be someones first job or a job for someone that can not do anything else.
good,My typical day at work starts out when I clock in and I go to the screens to see if there is any cars to work on. I have learned how to be very task-oriented. The management team is more focused on themselves than there associates. The workplace culture changes on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is the weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the satisfaction of being able to help customers day in and day out.
good,"Walmart has way to much drama within their management and their focus is only on the preferred click versus those really qualified to hire for many position because they are afraid of change and those who have degrees versus those who have no skills just coasting through the ranks because they have friends in the right places,"
good,"this walmart was a more high paced place to work. as a cashier we checked our scans per hour. it was a very busy store, mostly on weekends and around holidays. it was a high theft store so we paid close attention to everything. overall it was a fun place to work and made good friends."
good,I was a cashier overnight so it really wasn’t much to do sometimes I even stocked depending on how slow it was . I wouldn’t mind working back there if I had a choice
good,Walmart was a little fun working there. I met some really nice people and I got alone with a few of the employees. Walmart made sure that you stayed busy there was no time to goof off.
good,It’s not a bad place to work as long as you don’t mind working. It was very demanding and you had to have  specific task done by a specific time. Clocking in and out before and after every task.
good,"On the positive, the compensation and benefits were good especially for the area and the work. There was a lot the company does for charity and to try to make the work place fun and safe. On the the negative side, the culture is going down hill. More and more rules are being made constantly lowering employee morale and making it difficult to keep the associates properly motivated."
good,"Walmart is a great place, steady job. Sometimes other departments needed a hand which was frustrating to go help, but never too much of a challenge. Over all I liked Walmart."
good,"While I loved the job atmosphere and working with new people an customers everyday; you can not have a full time position at their company unless you are a manager or work third shift unloading trucks. Sales associate positions are only part time. That being said, there was no room for advancement because the manager positions were already held by individual who have worked there 5 or more years."
good,"I really enjoyed working in the production team, being able to learn both the bakery and the deli really prepared me for a career in future food production jobs."
good,often Walmart has a more flexible schedule because of it being open 24 hours which is great for college students and moms. There is also advancement opportunities for within the company
good,I like Wal-Mart but things can change. I like it bcuz I'm a people person and i like helping people. Wal-Mart can treat their employers better. They look at us as expendables and I don't think that's fair.
good,the staff is one big family that strives on making its employees great. through computer programs and hands on supervisors you'll learn everything you need to excel .
good,Easy job. Fast paced. Good environment. Not a bad place to work overall. The pay was very nice and I never felt like I didn't make enough to provide for my family.
good,"Unfortunately, it's hard to grow in your career due to bureaucracy, even if you work hard and provide clear results."
good,"Walmart is located in Harriville, Utah. The employees there are friendly and relaxed. They always have a smile on their faces. I've enjoyed my time there."
good,"There is a saying that people leave managers not organization. This is very true at Walmart and most organizations. Walmart is a great company with good benefits, but like other companies, they also have some bad managers."
good,Walmart is a great place to work. since leaving things have changed but i would return under better circumstances. The stores look a lot better since my departure.
good,"I worked as a CAP 1 team member from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m.I would pick stock for the day, and carry it out to the floor. I would pull down any stock from the top shelf, and place all remaining stock items on the top stock."
good,this place was a decent place to work for right out of high school. Being a graduate it was nice to have a job that gave me consistent hours. what I didn't like was how management bent the rules for themselves
good,"working their is what you make it"
good,Work place is friendly and very easy to work with others. Also the work is hard at time but their is always a helping hand if needed. Also the work enviorment is safe and we'll keeper clean.
good,"A nice working environment. Great if your a people person."
good,"I was a cashier at Walmart. Most managers were good but sometimes you'd get the bad apple one. This Walmart let the Store Manager decide if we worked on holidays or not. If you worked 6 hours or more, you would get an hour-long lunch but anything under 6 hours then you'd only get 30 minutes."
good,Its a good place to work but. The be wanting you to do so much at one time. If a truck come in they want you to down stack it . your probation is 91 day after your 91 days you should get a discount card.
good,Every employee was kind and helpful to each other. The manager was understanding and always had a positive attitude. Enjoyed helping customers and felt satisfied when able to solve a issue or misunderstanding
good,Walmart is a fast paced work environment. It offers challenges good and bad. I've meet lots of amazing associates and enjoyed the work experience. With the right team it is a great work experience.
good,"Well I get there clock in."
good,"Pickup procedures, making sure to ask what is needed in order to pick up your prescription. Drop off window, making each customers know their wait time and input the prescriptions as they come in the queue. Fill and bag prescriptions, work on orders, stock selves and  help the customer to my best ability."
good,"As long as you ask and are persistent, your career at Walmart will excel fast along with your knowledge of the place. Everyone is always willing to help out one another. Just be respectful at all times."
good,employees were easy going with some managerial exceptions. the job itself was straight forward and easy but expectations were high. liked the friendliness of the staff and the camaraderie.
good,Restocking and cleaning was not a big deal just the attitude of management. Other then that friendly workers and nice people. Customer are very understanding and nice.
good,Work day processing worker's comp claims for injured associates.  learned a lot of medical terminology with treatment for the associates.  Company good to work for
good,I enjoyed my times at walmart it was great to meet new people and be able to help customers have a good time in order for them to always come back. My coworkers were easy to get along with as well.
good,"Very stressful"
good,"Depending on the season and location you will barely see any hours. Its a fun place to work, I enjoyed working there but because of the lack of hours I had to find a new job."
good,"A great place for a person whom love people. The pay isn't bad but for the work performed, could pay a little more.  WalMart overall is a great place to start a career."
good,"pull stock and then replace unused stock to warehouse. overnight management change brought a new young manager who ws demanding yet very unorganized. I walked on her asleep in the office twice and then she had another manager talk to me about speeding up my pace. When I was hired I requested Saturdays off and was granted this. The same manager asked me to work a Saturday and I explained that I could not. I volunteered to work Sunday when I was not scheduled. She agreed and when I showed up Sunday she sent me home stating that I was not needed. I called in sick two weeks later and she spoke down to me asking how many absences I had. I had not missed a day in the 6 months and told her so. She replied ""I have to check on that."" Very fast paced which I could not keep upto this managers expectations but the team leader seemed satisfied as he showed me how to operate the fork lift, trash compactor and spoke to me in a very team oriented manner. Some of the co-workers were very smart and very helpful. Others seemed to try to put me in no win situations. One example was they placed me to pull cosmetics that involved small make up bottles with very small bar codes in dark areas that were rather hard for me to read and handle. Remember I come from a construction background where the handling of these small bottles was rather difficult. Yet I would allows pull the heavy items readily and eagerly."
good,"It's an ok place to work. They do like to ask you to do the work of about six people. Everything else is alright. It's not a bad place to work. There is always something to do, that's for sure."
good,"Hard work, long hours and difficult to maintain family life for managers.  pay is decent and benefits are good and reduced for salaried employees.  Company dictates most actions, depending on your upper management decisions determines amount of flexibility in merchandising"
good,"Average enviornment, Place is unhealthy for 12 hours days air and dust is too strong for most. Hours dont justify the product . Management is Hit and miss depending on shift some are capable others lack skills to retain the title."
good,I had a really good time working for Walmart although I wish I wouldn’t have left because I really enjoyed the people I was working with and helping customers
good,"It was an okay experience working there. I was working in produce , so its was mainly putting friuts and vegetables out on the floor. Walmart we got paid hi weekly."
good,Walmart was a good place to work. But I was looking for a more challenging position with career advancements. Needed more hands on challenges. Preferred something more fast paced.
good,Most people are great to work with and for. Customers can be difficult at times but it teaches you to become adaptable in all circumstances. Great place to work when stepping into the work field.
good,"I work indirectly for walmart, thus I do not know Walmart's culture."
good,"Really depends on your position and managers weather the are willing to work with you or not"
good,Not a horrible place to work. Also not an amazing place to work. They pay great but it all depends on the location. Management is different everywhere and changes often. It’s a hit or miss. Their points system is also screwed. No doctors excuses accepted. They enjoy recycling their employees.
good,"Was a great job, easy going. "
good,"This job is the reason I fell in love with the pharmacy environment, I enjoyed filling prescriptions, I enjoyed receiving and stocking. I learned a lot."
good,Walmart is a great place of employment. Management and staff are understanding and willing to make accommodations. the job consisted of stocking shelves.
good,"In my opinion, the work place is alright. The management was almost perfect, and the employees were amazing to me. Everyone made sure i was comfortable when i first started and helped out a lot."
good,Walmart as a whole is good to work for. But also depends on the management team. Also working there can be like working on a team. All of us worked together.
good,The work was hard sometimes and the days could get long if we were short on employees. Working here was definitely an interesting experience. If you are looking to do this position be sure that you are up to the physical requirements for it.
good,"The ambiance of Walmart is pretty conducive to growth of an employee, as company's no.1 priority is ""Customer Satisfaction"", and inevitably the values of civility and customer honor get entrenched within a Walmart associate.Moreover, there are different teams which represents different departments. Despite such Distinction, all the departments act as a cohesive unit when it comes to delivery of customer services."
good,I really have nothing say in a review for this job about my job at Walmart other than I enjoyed the people I worked with as a People Greeter and enjoyed meeting all the fine people who came to shop at Walmart.
good,"Great company to work for , Fun place to work out at times  attitude reflect management ..too much favoritism with management.. No advancement opportunity."
good,A typical day at work for me includes usually doing the same thing. The management team can be stressful but sometimes they are very helpful. I enjoy my co-workers and my team I work with everyday.
good,"Work un multiple departments and fo many things outside of your job description. For the most part,  if you do your job with help,  you won't have to worry about working so fast"
good,"It is a fun place to work in, friendly people, management always got your back, they listen to you and help you if you needed, they act like leaders not like boss."
good,"Walmart isn't as bad as many people make it out to be. The worst part about working there is the customers. They are selfish, manipulative liars. Most of the customers that come in are EXTREMELY rude and are only looking to cause trouble. Retail work is always draining, regardless of the store or company you work for. You put in time, effort, blood, sweat, tears, etc. and most of the time you don't even get a 'thank you.' Walmart is at least trying to improve on the life of their employees, rather than demanding everything with almost nothing in return"
good,"Pros: Great atmosphere and team work."
good,Met very nice people stuck in a position due to education and really had no where to go. Management was kind but had to full fill their responsibilities as well.
good,N/a I really like my job I just really wish I still had it  I enjoyed all the nice people I enjoy the outside weather it was a lot of work to do always busy
good,I would still be working there if he had worked with me on the shift I wanted I would go back I loved working there managers should worrie about keeping there department stocked up and other department business.
good,Found the customers to be rude and fellow associates did as little as possible and seemed to get advancements for it.  I feel if I had worked in another area I would have been happier.
good,"I am a part-time Optician with one provider. I work 25-30 hours per week. I have worked for Wal-Mart for six months. We may have seven patients per day with 3-4 Opticians working. Work pace is slow, looking for something more rewarding."
good,I worked in multiple departments while i was a Wal Mart associate. First i was in th;e meat department where i did varius things like stocking the shelves and keeping the backroom in order. Then i also was a gm unloader and unloaded big trucks in the back when they would come in.
good,"Great customers anywhere in the store. Ask if they need help or found every okay. Answer questions and provide guidance if you're not sure. When you're checking people out be quick and steady, always make sure items are bagged if customer asks, example milk. Durring slow times go check your lane, called redlining. While redlining you look for left behind, organize stocking, and great every customer who walks by. Sometimes if really slow management will let you take a cart. Carts are full of items from customer service we go put back in the shelves. We can also be asked to do carry outs or help stockman. Job always keeps you active. Feet all day."
good,Walmart is a great place to work everyone is friendly and very professional . Working at Walmart or any retail job you learn to but customers first . The management team is good they actually work with you . Hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers . Most enjoyable part of the job was joining the Walmart family
good,"This position you always had to do something, manage your department and handling multiple people who needed assistance. The management was not great though"
good,"Walmart as a workplace has many ups and downs. On average, most day of work are nothing to right home about. Easy work, with exceptional minimum wage. (11/hr) Management seems to approve working harder and not smarter. I didn't see myself moving up as fast I would've liked. I had learned almost everything in the entire store over the course of 6 months, worked in multiple departments; OGP, Site To Store, Toys, Automotive, Sporting Goods, Fabrics, Electronics and never fully moved up into the department I wanted."
good,Overall I just needed a morning job that gives all of the hours. Great place to work but part time was all that was offered. I learned how to work in a fast past organized area with a community. Hardest part was the freezer I hate cold but work was done when needed. Enjoyable  part that made my day was the everyday community people that came in to get the regular things that I put out for them.
good,Le personnel et les gérants sont très sympathique.
good,It was good place to work. The work I did was fast paced but it made the time go by faster. Everybody I worked with was easy to get along with for the most part.
good,"Even though the hardest part of the job was pulling heavy carts but was also the most enjoyable part, as hard work passes time very quickly. The people were very friendly and helpful also."
good,"excelente empresa para trabalhar, uma escola de varejo, desenvolvedora de profissionais e pessoas"
good,it’s good place to work. They have opportunities to advance. They are willing to train you so that you can adavance. I liked working for the company. You don’t have to work there long to advance either depending on the department you worked in most of them was within six months you could take the training to advance.
good,"* A Typical day at Work was smooth."
good,"una empresa internacional que se basa en normas y en calidad , aunque las jornadas son pesadas"
good,I would recommend looking into walmart before some other things but the company is changing a lot and is becoming more e-commerce and there are less and less job advancement opportunities.
good,"Very loud, crazy people running everywhere, fighting, shooting but mainly great deals on very high merchandise. You get extra pay for working holidays especially on this day."
good,"Walmart was a great place to interact with the customers and build relationships. There were moments when the store was really busy, but everyone was able to service the customers in a timely manner."
good,Working at Walmart Is great experience you just have to be fast and a quick learner and always stay focus and work your hardest at all times and finish your task In efficient time
good,Busy but fun atmosphere to work in right out of school. The pay was good and the managers were good to work with. Would have continued to work there but got a opportunity to work in Banff.
good,It's really nice place to work the management is kind of off blance. You have too many people telling what assignment to do. and they have a lot of favoritism on the job site. when you start your job in the morning you have a great spirit when the management comes around your hold attitude changes.Management lack of accountability . I enjoy working with my team members. Benfits could be much better foe exmaple paided holidays. When it comes to holidays associate calls out which makes it bad fo the other associates that has to do their job and the next person job as well.
good,"I worked in the OGP department. Overall, I really enjoy my job, they days go by vary quick and I do enjoy my management team. The biggest down fall however; is the low pay rate."
good,"Working at Walmart is very fast pace, the managers want you to go as quickly as you can while still working accurately. This can cause some stress but once you get used to it you can work effectively"
good,Bom salário baixo muitas horas de trabalho refeições
good,There is no longer a work place culture.  Management is poor at communication. The hardest part of the job is being held accountable for direction that was not communicated to me.  The most enjoyable part of the job is help people see better while offering them a quality product.
good,"I did not like working here, i got bad hours and very bad role models and management wasn't good. nothing was taken care of and was told to stop asking for help and not to ask too many questions when i was new."
good,A typical day of work was great. Everyone knew their role and performed them exceptionally. The management was fair and easy going if tasks were performed as they should be.
good,"Great company that really invests in its people! I am responsible for teaching and training managers (hourly and salary). They realize the success of the company depends upon the success of its associates, and they put their money where their mouth is."
good,i loved workin at Walmart it was a great experience. The employees were great the environment was outstanding. i would highly  reccommend to other people for the great opportunity.
good,"It is very hard to promote no matter what kind of experience you have.  The dress code is more relaxed.  They do care about their employees, but they are fond of lots of changes."
good,"A typical day at work means being on your feet constantly, dealing with a million angry customers, and generally being insanely exhausted. Management is extremely disorganized as well. The only good part of the job is working Black Friday, because they provide a free Thanksgiving meal."
good,"Walmart is great for highschool graduates who are starting college. They are very flexible with hours, gives you a reasonable amout of hours, pay rate is reasonable, offers different career options within Walmart, and Flexibility when it comes to school which is perfect!"
good,"While I had a bad experience at Wal Mart, I would recommend this job to anyone.  I think that overall, Wal Mart is a great place to work as long as you are a people person and work well with others.  A typical day at work for me was running a cash register and assisting customers with purchases and returns."
good,Probably one of my better work experiences. When you worked hard it was recognized and you are given a fair opportunity to grow and be promoted with in the company.
good,"checking customer receipts on large or unbagged items is a typical day as an APCH Asset Protection Customer Host,receiving nice compliments from customers"
good,"a typical day was helping customers learn and use the scan and go registers, maintaining the cleanliness of the registers & conveyor belts as needed. Keep order on shelves, pick up returns or things not in their place."
good,Loved my job till I transfered to the new saint John's store #928 management is one track minded and think associates should be robots! They are not objective training isnt of importance and walmart ethics are upheld
good,"I liked working here. But it's not for everyone. Back then I didn't have a husband or kids so it wouldn't work for us now, but it was great back then. You pretty much just go about your own business without the interference of coworkers or customers too often, and just regular updates for managers..."
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart and it is a great workplace for anyone. I leaned many skills while working there and the managers always took time to show me anything i needed/wanted to learn.
good,For being my first job in college it was decent. I continued to work there until I was able to find other employment that was more adaptable to my home life.
good,"Overall enjoyable job. Great coworkers, good customer base, good pay. I never had any major issues while working for this company, but their attendance policy is unforgiving. A coworker of mine was fired for missing too many days even though she was in hospital"
good,Working for Walmart was a good experience. Great way to learn the customer service skills needed to move on with my career and great advancements options.
good,"My fellow cashiers, CSMs were nice and helped each other out most of the time. Downtime was a chance to connect with coworkers and share a few laughs which was nice."
good,"Stressful, fast pace work environment. Requires dedication and a willingness to work hard for little acknowledgement. Self management a must to succeed."
good,It was a ok experience it got to the point it was not for me. Lack of communication. People never showed up to work. There where clean but a lot of things was not for show
good,A typical day for me at walmart starts with unloading a truck and then pulling the pallets and carts to their departments. This job is not an easy job and can become very stressful at times. Working at walmart is not all that bad except when you have managers who are more out for their own pockets by keeping down hours and lack of employees. also the lack of communication and lack of training. I want to work for a company who appriciates my work. Management also can tend to run in clicks and if your not a part of it then dont look for much as far as advancement well maybe some but just enough to keep you. They will tell you one thing then lie to you.
good,Walmart had both good and bad sides as does any job. It was good because of the great people you get to work with as well as the experience and training you receive and the opportunities to advance while there. The down side is that no one is indispensable at walmart and they have no problem treating you like so.
good,"Was a great job but I had to relocate, which is the reason I had to quit. Everybody worked well together , management wasn’t great but doable, and they worked well with schedules."
good,Walmart was a great place to work for  me the Csms were great the co workers was great it was no drama between anybody the only problem was that they don't look at your doctors notes when you are out for a few days
good,Plenty of opportunity for advancment. Alot of training goes into preperatiin for managment rolls. Not so flexible on hours. Paid vacations. Good pay as you promote.
good,meet new people and made a work family and got discount on getting new clothes at my favorite store and my family's favorite store . also everyone is get at communicating
good,The hardest part of the job was trying to help multiple customers at a time. I learned how to quickly remember where everything is to help them find it faster. The management needed some work done because they don't train you well or help you when needed.
good,A day at work starts with unloading the truck and sorting goods by department and aisles location.Usually we receive help from our management team.After that we head  to the sales floor to stock items and sometimes to zone .
good,Work at Walmart is not challenging unless one makes it challenging on his/her self. Management is vary helpful to everyone an will work schedules out with any associate.
good,Buen compañerismo y muy buen ambiente de trabajo..
good,"I worked at the Service Desk at Walmart as a Service Desk Representative performing returns and exchanges, I like it. I did not like how the computer generated the schedules."
good,I was responsible for conducting sales transactions with excellent customer service. I was also responsible for unloading merchandise and stocking them on store shelves.
good,Personal shopping with customer assistant and picking there order and problem solving when something goes wrong. Well organized and accomplishment on a timely manner.
good,"I have worked at two Walmart locations. My first location was much better then my current one. The only problem that I really have is as a department manager you DO NOT get paid enough for the work load they put on you. Be prepared to not have enough help, clean up after everyone, and even after you do 4 peoples jobs you'll be told it's not enough. The pay is better then some but it's not where it needs to be. Also you will work every holiday (with NO holiday pay) except Christmas day (which is ALSO NOT paid) and if you ask for a specific day off after October 1 - January 15 they will act like you asked them for $5,000,000. Other then those two things I have enjoyed my time at Walmart. I have made life long friendships and have learned many useful skills that will help me in future career paths."
good,"I enjoyed working at walmart, the only downside was the lack of staff in the departments so I had to constantly do more than what was required of my role on the job. I learned quite a bit, and that was a benefit. It put me out of my comfort zone in regards to customer service, and that was very good for me. The best thing about working here was that stocking, and organizing the things in the freezer and refrigerator as well as sorting through the expiration dates on the dairy side of things. The hardest part was the managers giving me unrealistic tasks that I had to finish within a work day on top of the lack of staffing. Outside of that I will have fantastic memories of working there as my first job."
good,"When looking for a job or second job this is a pretty easy one. When you step into a manager role it can become stressful, but manageable. Your hours can be flexible depending on your store manager."
good,"Being a cashier at Walmart was rough. I dealt with a lot of opinionated customers who didn't consider others very much, but that was part of the job, and you need to be able to deal with situations that might make you uncomfortable quickly as to avoid problems and to move on with your day."
good,I enjoy working at Walmart its a fast pace environment it keep you moving around dealing with customers keep you motivated keeping a smile on your face showing the customers you there to help them
good,Being able to help customers find things they need and stocking the shelves so that they have what they need and being around the public and meeting new people.
good,"Flexible time off. Really depends on the team and manager but there’s no restrictions to taking pto."
good,"Management loves to correct you or push you, but it is rewarding at the end of your shift to see what you have accomplished or to be able to help the customer find what they are looking for."
good,"Lots of busy days and a never ending work load. The people I worked with were fantastic, but that doesn't go building wide. I feel as though there was a lot of pressure to work as a robot and expectations were set extremely high, and I set my personal goals and standards high as it is. Other than that not a terrible place to work. Could pay better."
good,"Some days in Electronics are very busy and some are extremely slow. I like to stay busy 24/7 so this was an issue for me. I would prepare and file photo orders and call customers about their orders. Also, backup cashier and help whenever I could wherever I could."
good,"Overall, looking back for the money and work walmart isn't as bad as people make it sound. They don't make you hardcore sell or pressure you for anything and you make a decent hourly pay."
good,Walmart was a really fun place to work and I had a great time working there. The wages never go above minimum if you're a part time worker but the management is extremely passionate towards helping full time students get the hours they need when they need it.
good,"I loved working at Walmart. The amount of hours available to work was about the only downside of the job. Other than that, I loved everything about it."
good,"I stock things back on the shelves."
good,"Walmart is a very exciting job, you have the opportunity to meet all type of people. The job is fast and quick pace. It causes you to be friendly and nice."
good,"It's good if you need a job, but dont stay forever. There used to be a lot of advancement with Walmart but due to the new schedules and how management is. It's becoming a place where it's hard to work there and have enough money to provide for you."
good,Good company to work for to learn basic retail knowledge. Everyone's willing to teach and help each other when needed. I have been able to learn many things over the years but am feeling like I'm not able to move much further and I would like to.
good,"As an hourly associate your time is much more respected, your rights to breaks, and the overall sense of community is much better. As a salaried manager the stakes are much higher and no one lets you forget that. You are not told you can’t take breaks although you can’t get the amount of work done that they want with breaks many times. Don’t expect to create any honest bonds with people it is every man for themselves. I am looking to leave the company for somewhere that my skills can be better utilized and I won’t be made to feel like a number. If I can’t I will stay on because that’s the responsible thing to do."
good,"Everyday was usually different due to customers. I would arrive and immediately start working, I would be busy the whole shift. If I needed help it was there for the asking. I learned to rely on my coworkers, how to stock shelves, different procedures on the register. The department managers were great to work with. I  always put customers first. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet all day. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers."
good,It was a good place to work when you just move to lethbridge and they are good to their employees and they treat everyone fair. They listen to feed back and they are fair.
good,"Great company to work for if young and in good shape, hours are long and you can not ever sit down unless you are on lunch or break.  Job can be draining on your body and mind"
