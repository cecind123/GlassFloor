rating,review
bad,Very un-professional place to work for.  Training was a joke and trying to find something in a SOP was a serious problem.  They were not updated correctly and old information was it them
bad,"Granite Construction was a very stressful work environment, unqualified HR rep.  I do not recommend it to anyone. Not a good work culture. sometimes unfair."
bad,"Granite is a terrible company to work for in the Bakersfield area. They have very poor management who lack needed job skills. The pay is far too low for what they ask of their employees. The turnover rate is through the roof and they do not care about individuals. It is a cut throat company, and everyone I know who has worked there and moved on agrees."
bad,"lays to many good employees off, they have their own groups of guys that they keep busy. Most apprentices don't stay busy after they become journeyman status."
bad,busy work schedule and long hours when there is work. Company is local which good for the local economy. Mostly residential not much infrastructure.
bad,while working there i was promised certifications on different things but was never certified.
bad,Trying to oversee a construction project that is behind schedule is difficult.  Limited resources in the area and working remotely has its challenges too.
bad,Good old boys network with poor upper management. Voted most ethical company this year must have payed somebody for that award. The hours you work based on your salary have you making minimum wage. Wouldn’t recommend this company to my worst enemy.
bad,"Granite preaches worklife balance but they load you down with so much work they make it impossible to have a life or hobbies. Personalities were tough and the safety culture wasn't one that incentivised employees to get involved, only do enough to not get fired."
bad,The all in all in picture was a learning curve to sharpen my skills. The job was only to take a year but we were done with most of it fairly quickly. At the end of the job there was no promise or garuntee for more work.  There is alot of talk about saftey but alot of corners got cut. Honestly I feel chewed up and spit out.
bad,"Change is slow and the culture makes it hard to get anything meaningful accomplished. Business units are disjointed.   There are many good people there, but overall the culture is negative."
bad,"they will want you to give your whole life to the company then complain because you didn't give enough. They do not care about your safety they will make you work a 12 shift then drive for 4 hrs and still work a minimum 10 hr day the next day. "
bad,okay  company to work for poor management in some areas that cause the job to get delayed and behind schedule. Management do not listen to employees opinions.
bad,they don't really communicate or give you any type of training. I'm here for one year or so that's what i was told but never know might not have a job the following week.
bad,"The people on the ground are great to work with, however the local management and corporate personnel have their own agendas. The good ole boy network is in full force and if you do not toe the line your out. Favoritism is rampant and the work-life balance is almost non-existent unless you are middle management or above."
bad,Great place to work if you're in management.  You'll have the respect of the crew and foreman but management will look down on you like they're better than you everybody is equal there but some are more equal than others.
bad,"Enjoyable part of the job was working with the locations out in the field."
bad,"I went to Granite from a very family oriented place. Where everyone cared about everyone. Granite management and non union employees are so incredibly self centered, to each is own, where everyone is replaceable. If managment makes an error where their superiors are questioning them, theyll be quit to pass the buck. Speak up, listen up...I spoke up, you listened, but then when it was time for them to get my back, they threw me to the wolves. I worked there for several years, obtained several positive evaluations, never a complaint from anyone, but was laid off because, I was ""the wrong person for the position"". This happening not even a week after yet, another positive eval. With all that said, benifits and pay were great, the main reason I stayed as long as I did. Corporate, and the man with the amazing mustache seem to be great people as well. If you want to give them a go, watch your back because no one else will. Just smile and nod, do your job and go home."
bad,"Granite  was a great company to work for when I started out. Good people,management, benefits and room for advancement. For the last 3 years it has been very very different. Good people were replaced with corporate goons.....many did not know the job they were doing. Benefits have went down hill. There is no job security let alone advancement. Management seems to do the exact opposite of what they should do. Many jobs lose a lot of money due to lack of detail. Job culture is ok because there is still some good people there. I have hope they may change back to a good company to work for. Let just say for now there has been many good people that worked for granite."
bad,"As Land Surveyor with 15 years experience in the Civil & Construction Industry, Oil & gas Field, Petro Chemical Plants, Commercial Building Constructions, Sub Station,Roads & Indian Southern Railway Projects having Thorough knowledge of principles, practices and procedures of topographic surveys, problem solving skills related to land surveying activities, Excellent communications skills in working with other disciplines, clients & Highly mindful of safety and security procedures; Uses equipment and materials properly."
bad,i done work with team work by producing more results having high quality of work
bad,Too much tension and rules.Rude and grouchy management.A very rush rush work environment that caused safety issues.Also too much paperwork and reports
bad,"I took the promotion to this position against my better judgment.  The company was trying to go from a very decentralized IT environment, to one controlled more tightly by corporate headquarters.  I was supposed to mostly be a hands-off manager, but they did not give me the resources to manage.  Additionally, they would not give me authority over several individuals who were making changes to the network infrastructure which I was supposed to be responsible for.  The only good part of this position was when I got to go out to branches, new M&As, and new jobsites to setup the networks."
good,"Learned my trade.worked on a paving crew for 10 years,running a compaction roller,the hardest part of my job was the changing weather,the best part of my job was that i was able to meet strick federal and state requirements."
good,"Inspect equipment,try to get the required amount of loads,i learned how to operate 3 differant typs of trucks,"
good,"Office environment, professional staff. Aggregate plant local to the area. I learned different types of aggregate materials and how to calculate how many yards of material would be needed for a specific area."
good,Good workplace and environment and good team work is the most that was realized their . The management was helpful and overall Good atmosphere and working environment
good,"Am really enjoying my day to day work activities"
good,Has good name in the oil & gas sector.Almost 35 years in the industry.Good facilities.Has spaces for improvement in some fields.
good,"Hired through 605 carpenters . They talk safety but are far from putting it first. I actually had a Z Beam dropped on my head due to Formans irresponsibility. Many near misses,  mistakes due to poor judgment of workers and Forman. I personally was responsible for installing and removing Z beam false work system."
good,"It's not what you know!!! It's who you bl#w !!! Right???"
good,Good group of coworkers; Management wants to revert back to the old way of doing  business
good,I was at granite for over a year and was never trained on the products that I was suppose to sell. My manager was always to busy to train me and never had any training setup. What I learned was from my co-workers.
good,"work hard, get laid off when job is done. Working is fast paced pressure filled. Depends on the Manager, I have had good and not so good. Upper management doesn't care about the little guys."
good,"lots of work. looking for a full-time job. not seasonal. responsible for 15-20 employees. lane closures. Road closures. general laborer. worked in town and lots of traveling. responsible for silt fence, waddels and all sewer prevention plans. storm waters"
good,Managers don't know how to treat employees and appreciate their good workers.... they don't give good training but expect that u complete the work in time. Also when your reviews are due they never on time 3 to 6 month late and if u get an increase is like .20 cents. Not worth it for all the work you have.
good,"i worked out in the scale house it has it's busy day's and it's slow day's. the program i worked with most of the time is APEX, apex is a software that the company uses for the scales to weigh in and weigh out trucks, i work alone in the scale house."
good,"Kitchen and Bathroom remodels."
good,"While working at the corporate campus, I did not know or meet many people outside of my department. I rarely saw or interacted with higher management."
good,The company is a great starting company with a lot of potential for first time engineers. The technology they used was out dated and the equipment they tried using was old.
good,the work was unfit for what they was paying they dont care about there workers its not a great place this should not be a place to work the only good thing is that you get paid every friday
good,"Have worked here for several different seasons, as a company that has grown, it has lost its eyes on how to treat its employees in the field. where you were known by name, you are now treated as a number"
good,"Even though the company had limited understanding of how to pursue and win large project business, and knowledgeable professionals were hired to help with this, the company's executives and managers rarely took the advice offered by the experts they hired (too old school and too many 'good ole boys' in positions of management that would not change), and so it became a very frustrating place to work. Only the executives were empowered, even though their efforts at marketing the company were misguided. I would recommend this company to employees in construction only."
good,"Long hard days, but they treated their men fairly. We did everything from demo on backhoes, skid loaders, fed concrete plants with front end loaders. Also ran tiner for finished product, ran water truck and set up traffic control and various parts of labor in construction. and read grade stakes and set up guidelines for machines."
good,Heavy Highway Work.  Intense and competitive.  Large Projects Group has few positions with specific/narrow advancement.  Most projects are joint ventures.  Very little training available.
good,"an okay company. favoritism is shown towards family memebers, long hot hours in florida and you often have to drive far to job sites not close to home. no travel pay."
good,"Routine correspondence as well as covering the front desk at times. Scheduling travel and reservations for management team. Transcribed meeting notes and distributed to management team."
good,Management interact with staff. This branch of Granite doesn't do community programs together.
good,"Just like the title says, FBI, or Friends, Brothers, and Inlaws.  If you don't fit into any of these categories, you won't have a good time working here."
good,"I enjoyed working here as an intern in college"
good,"It was part of the job of almost getting run over, Otherwise I got to be outside."
good,"Punctuality, learning new things, team work this things are i was learned in my current company and i was learned from my co-workers motivating juniors,leadership,hard work,solving the problems in work related. Always i am learning new things when i order specific material and received that kind of materials."
good,"From last 3 years I working here in this company, this is very good company but there salaries is fail as to duty and work, here some of employers working from minimum 20 years or more than 20 years but still they have same salaries same like before(20 years ago).I am trying from last 15 months to change my visa from here to another company but no company given me positive response of my cv and documents."
good,"The culture of the company relied on the individual rather group efforts. The environment of the company doesn't highlight the benefits of working as a team. During my internship with the company, I learned a variety of important skills set that will help guide me in my future endeavors. This includes,  "
good,"its a oil and gas firm,timings are flexible but when work is more we should accordingly and benefits will be provided at the end of the completion of work."
good,To prepare a request for inspection in advance for the works which are going in site and get inspected by consultant. Nice colleagues they all are very co-operative and friendly in the work site. Daily site meetings can be conducted in the office between site team and project team. Weekly quality meeting conducted with consultant and sub-contractor. Report to the project head if any issues arise in a site.
good,"This is no Silicon Valley hot-shot place to work.  But, if you miss working in a place with old-fashioned and honest-to-goodness ethics and strong values, then you will love this place.  They can be antiquated at times.  Sometimes it's charming, but otherwise it can be frustrating.  If you are an operations-type professional, like an engineer or project manager, you will find an environment that will be fun to work at.  Administrative types may struggle with the environment and lack of appreciation in some areas, but not all.  The management has changed a lot over the last 5-ish years.  Some say it's good and others aren't so sure."
good,"Started a few years ago.  Company was great.  Sponsored events, bbqs, Dodgers games.  Then management got to big too quick.  Starting losing employees left and right.  Hope someone rights the ship."
good,"Good Benefits, Long Hours, Good People. I would work there again. Interesting Construction Projects for good clients. Fun to watch things being constructed."
good,Fast paced work place. I was given free reign in decision making an support from upper management as project progressed. Enjoyed working with my co workers again.....
good,Companies had strong safety cultures. Company value and visions are also good. Only left for new opportunities and economy decrease of demand for oil.
good,"They have an excellent Management system."
good,During the summer the work picks up to massive amounts of hours 70 plus depending on the positions. They expect you to work 70 hour plus weeks all summer long which is good on the paycheck but stressful at times.
good,I really enjoyed this company the people that I met and worked beside on a daily basis was awesome. I learned a lot from while at this company but it's also a tough job working on a highway with traffic flying by you at all times of day or night
good,"Long days, very productive, hard work, moving at all times. Moving forward constantly."
good,It was a very chanegelling work inveroment which I learned to work with other well and focus in my job and what I was doing and learning many different things about the company I was working for

good,Very gud company..but job is not safe for a long time ..if company don't have work suddenly they are giving termination letters ..and never giving performance base salary benfits
good,"This is one of the finest and good companies in abudhabi,uae. No more job security. No more perfect answers from hr department. Salery fixing its too low...but on time salary.food and accommodation was too good.transportation was perfect. Room maintaines was good. Perfect quality works.."
good,"Good company with a family-oriented culture. Fortune 500 company, nation wide, but has a small community feel."
good,"Granite, like many heavy civil construction companies, has experienced an increasingly tough marketplace and has yet to fully find its identity in the changing landscape. Shifting organizational structures and increased turnover has resulted in the company being quick to react but not always with the right information. I enjoyed my time at Granite and wish them the best in future."
good,This was one of the first companies to start doing daily safety meetings. I feel as though this helped keep the number of injuries way down when compared with job sites of others. I enjoyed my coworkers but the job itself was hard.
good,Granite is a good company to work for they make sure they provide the proper ppe they try to make everything as safe as possible team work is very important

good,was a good relaxed work place to work at. always got paid on time and always guaranteed work hours. worked in the oil field laying down geo web for the rig pads
good,"I enjoyed my job with Granite even as stressful as it could be until I got laid off twice. The first time was due to weather conditions in Colorado which is understandable, however they kept saying they were going to find work for everyone which didn't happen. I found a location in Arizona which had an opening so I packed up and moved down here to only a month and a half later be laid off again."
good,Great management team.  Works well as a team as long as you play along  pay is ok.  Vacation is a little week needs to offer more.  Personal time off is ok.   Basically a good group of people it’s just there so big your just a number to them and you can leave when you want

I started at 6 am a bunch of us took a van to get there and we would badge in to the mine and then go to our machines it was very fast pace all day long and safety is key. We would work until between 4 and 6 pm but the days went by fast. We would badge out and take the van an hour into town and drop everyone off.
good,Great place to work. Great company culture. Plenty of opportunities if willing to relocate anywhere in the country. I've learned a lot in my relatively short time being employed by Granite.
good,"During this year I have the opportunity to work in different disciplines (MSE Walls, drainage, barrier walls, flatwork, drilled shafts and signals.  In addition coordinate with sub-contractors.  This have been the more enriching experience.  Also working at United States I have been expose and improve my english."
good,Fast paced project management role. You can learn as much as you want as long as you're willing to take on the work. No work/life balance. The construction industry is a lifestyle if you want to be successful.

good,"Granite is a fast passed company with multiple projects going at the same time. Job requirements always change and the need for testers was at a high need. I have learned most everything of my testing skills for materials while I was at Granite. Long hours and long weeks of working during the summer was a normal. Usually the hours in the summer were in the 60 hrs a week range, sometimes to 70 hrs. Hours in the winter was a constant 40, so home life was not impeded. Management was good, and sometimes overwhelmed with all the different projects they were overseeing. Unfortunately there is not a lot of advancements offered."
good,"This is a great place to start your working career. They may not pay as well as others; however, the opportunity to gain experience is there."
good,Good place to advance and move up the latter very quickly. Boss was hard driven and it was fastpaced for what I learned about what I did it was educational.

You will have to work with the occasional annoyance of drivers on the road and annoying co workers, but that's everywhere. I was paid $13/hr starting off and i made $1200 before taxes one week, it was amazing (especially since im only 20). They are strict about being safe and will take care of you, but like i said, LOTS of hours."
good,"This job included lots of travel, everything was paid for and while traveling to different states to either give presentations or for meetings i was able to experience different parts of the US and Canada. My typical day was either meeting with current or potential customers and setting meetings with current or potential customers to maintain my companies market share and increase it. A lot of my time was directed in the area of marketing as this company really had no marketing material when i started. When i was finished they had up to date pamphlets, presentation folders, trade show booths, a web site and powerpoint presentations of their products."

All information had to be entered into a new data system on the computer.  Once the information was entered, the files were moved back to the storage room.  I learned how to break down legal files, and how nice construction companies could be.  My manager was amazing.  She was very considerate and always willing to answer any questions that I had.  I did not have very many co-workers in the office because they all worked out on sites.  The ones I did see were always very nice.  The hardest part of my job was leaving, although it was only a temporary position.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the people.  The people were great, the atmosphere was wonderful.  It was all in all a great job."

good,Granite is a great company to work for. I was a laborer out of 341 and took a dispatch to work for them. The only downside is that I had a short season this year and didnt get a chance to work with them longer.
good,"This job was the one I enjoyed the most.  I made a mistake by going against my better judgment and accepting a promotion to network manager for the entire company.  In the Utah branch network administrator position, I had a wide range of job responsibilities, with multiple locations to support, and I enjoyed great respect from the management."
good,I learned a lot and had a fulfilling expierence. Met and made some good friends and felt like i was apart of a team. Long hours but the money was good.
good,Other then my aortic valve rupturing and me leaving for that reason I would have never left this job. My supervisor was cool and very understand of and situation that came about he hated to lose me as a driver.
good,"Overall, a great place to work. People are great, some of the best friends I have are from working there. It is really a family environment that I would recommend."
good,When I was there the entire IT organization had just been replaced. I was part of a new group of people who had to come in and basically take over. The company treats you very fairly and is more like a family than a workplace.
good,Granite knows their business and as an employee you know what's expected. They let you do your job and don't micromanage.  Safety is strongly enforced and the equipment and people are great.
good,Great experience working for Granite. I typically spent my days performing site inspections and conducting training. The company has a family feel to it and everyone gets along well.

good,running a haul truck for granite as apart of a contract for rio tinto in there trucks co workers were great management was good at saftey and keeping us informed on whats going on
good,"A typical work day/night as traffic control for Granite consisted of a minimum 12 hour shift with never ending suspense. You never know what traffic will do! The workers were very easy to communicate with which made work more exciting and safe. I learned many things working for Granite Construction. To name a few: how to successfully communicate with the public and maneuver them through a construction zone, how to work safely around big equipment, how to effectively set up traffic devices, and how to properly communicate with other workers to get the job done. My co-workers always had my back and helped me whenever help was needed. I trusted them and established a strong relationship. The hardest part of my job was dealing with inebriates who entered the construction zone. It became clear that controlling those individuals was not in my power. However, that is why our job sites had police officers standing by. The most enjoyable part of the job was every other moment not dealing with inebriates. I truly loved the job because I knew I was helping get something done. I was a necessary part of the system and other workers trusted me with their lives."
good,I was a bit nervous to start. My thoughts were that I would be treated differently cause I’m a female or that they’d work me harder but no it was a very friendly environment the workers look led out for each other making one another feel comfortable of course including myself.
good,"A typical day at work was not out of the ordinary. Even on days where there was a problem, it was handled well by the staff and crew. The employees strived for quality work and acted as a productive community. The most encouraging experience was having Granite employees that had been with the company for years share their positive experiences and feedback quite often. I had a manager that was tough when he needed to be but flexible and understanding. He was knowledgable and effective while teaching and guiding his employees."
good,"I loved every person in management! Not only did they care about you, they actually conveyed that in their actions. They DO NOT take safety lightly here, which made it all more clear that they wanted you to go home to your loved ones unscathed at the end of your shift. There wasn't one employee I ran it to that wasn't willing to help you. Overall, I loved working there."
good,Various construction related tasks including setting of precast retaining walls and concrete form work. Installation of trench drains
good,"My typical day started with reconciling plant sales from prior day for 5 locations.  I processed invoices for those sales, that were on account.  I also reconciled cash sales making sure that monies received total sales for prior day.  I assisted in processing incoming mail/payments for accounts.  Processed deposits for plant sales and assisted in AR deposit.  Answered incoming AR calls, helping customers with questions of their accounts."

good,"I have worked for Granite all total for 16 years. I started as a receptionist and have held multiple positions throughout my time here. Granite even helped pay for my higher education by offering tuition reimbursement. The benefit package with Granite is great. I do wish the medical was better but unfortunately with ""Obama"" care it changed the entire insurance structure. After 5 years you receive 3 weeks of vacation. They also offer 6 days of sick time. Other perks are employee discounts at entertainment parks, Ford company, 401K, credit union, pet insurance (yes, they even care about our furry friends) and so much more. If you are looking for a company that cares, this is it. Yes, some positions require more travel and yes, some department managers are more ""difficult"" but overall amazing company. Finally, Granite has been recognized as a World's Most Ethical Company for 8 years in a row (as of 2017). You don't achieve that recognition if it wasn't true."
