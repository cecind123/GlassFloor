rating,review
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Lower stress than working for other banks, also lower compensation. Company has a strong focus on good customer experience rather than sales. Technology is OK, benefits are good"
good,"A typical day of work included auditing documents and sending out e-mails. Also, making calls to the bankers and help them with clearing document issues."
good,"Morning huddles were fun full of energy to get your day started, but quickly depressed everyone when making daily sales goals. Most days had a lot of space between work and doing nothing but has to be constantly busy. trying to reach out to new customers thank don't bank with us was hard. Either a language barrier, faithful to the bank that they have or wanting to stay away from a big corporate bank. but  you have to try. one sale counts as a point and so many points gets you commission."
good,"Job is pretty straight forward. The only downside is sometimes the managers show favoritism and you don't really get a chance to leave your desk. However, the compensation is good and the overall culture is phenomenal."
good,"No where is perfect but Wells Fargo has a professional atmosphere and a way to handle things professionally when an employee does have a problem. They do typical office parties, potlucks, diversity teams, etc. At least, the department I worked in did. We were a group of 40+ that worked together for nearly 6 years. If you are fortunate to find a department you can work with that long, it can create a very nice place to work."
good,I loved working for Wells Fargo. They provided me with every tool and training I needed to succeed within the organization. I was rewarded my initiative and felt appreciated.
good,"Loved working with my direct manager, but upper management was out of touch with our needs. Great benefits! Nice new location in Chandler was convenient to most parts of the valley"
good,Decent first job for anyone. Customers can be super rude at times. Others were nice. Obviously just depends. Very busy on Fridays and before the bank closed. Job itself is very easy.
good,"When I worked at Wells Fargo, we were in a remote office carrying to a new function.  Given this, it is hard for me to make a real assessment; however it was an enjoyable experience."
good,"Always a team player environment, providing daily support and engagement. Management always does their best to reinforce and uplift daily experience. Main focus is their employees and its customers."
good,People are friendly. Everybody speak to each other.The one issue that is the biggest problem is that you always have to know someone to advance. You can have the credential to apply for a position and still will not get a phone interview.
good,"Wells Fargo is a decent company to work for, but corporate is definitely much better than retail. Sales goals have been done away with which is something Wells Fargo proudly boasts, but there are still referrals to bankers which are tracked and encouraged and the dispositions for conversations and referrals too. Pay is decently competitive, good benefits, and deeding on who you work with, good people too."
good,Worst part of the job was having to juggle finicky rules and screaming customers. Best was good co-workers and helpful management. Would recommend to others a good job.
good,"This is a good company where you can get good training, and also can get culture of big company, where you will know how to collaborate with other engineers remotely, and you can also balance your life and work"
good,"A typical work day at Wells Fargo, was once I walk in and turn my computer on.  I was basically self efficient, meaning I would go right to my email or pipeline and start to work my emails.  I would sent the work I receive to the correct processor so it can finish being processed or worked.  When there is someone new to start they would come in to sit with me so I can train them on my system on how to send the work to the processor.  Management would email or come by from time to time to see if I needed anything or how the new hire was going. The culture was very diverse the hardest part about my job was when something strange came in that I did not handle and the manager could not help as well. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with people and learning different projects and task to stay busy."
good,Typical work day is reviewing performance from previous day and coaching staff if need be and resolving routine and escalated issue. The hardest part of the job would be adjusting when I have a schedule and then something else comes up and needs to be done also. The most enjoyable part of the job is watching my team performance change. What I learned is that I have a passion to help others become the best they can be.
good,"Lots of work and 15 minute break"
good,"Wells Fargo is a sales based company.  However, they force you to sell and meet quotas but do not compensate you for the amount of effort you put in. It should be commissioned based."
good,Wells Fargo has a good reputation for it's banking features and securities. The job is mostly face-paced and requires a lot of face-to-face interactions.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,As an Investigator I assisted with the mandatory investigation of commercial clients and businesses to ensure validity of people and business.  I as challenged to complete a specific amount of investigations daily.
good,The company is a good place to work with great management. The work environment is supportive. I worked in the software department of the company and the reason for leaving was that the career growth was not to my satisfaction
good,"Have been at Wells for 1.6 year and had a grat experience "

good,professional and good quality products offered to customers. nice work environment and steady work pace. friendly and helpful staff for all your banking needs.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo,  I like constant change and this environment has that. I would go back to Wells Fargo this is a lot of opportunity,  It was a team environment which I enjoyed"
good,"This is a great job, They offer flexible work schedules. However It is a bit competitive with metrics. I wouldn't consider working here unless you take constructive criticism well."
good,"Working at Wells was enlightening and informative."
good,"Though my rating is a bit low, I enjoyed my working for Wells Fargo.  I just couldn't stand the fact that it was so sales driven. The fact that you could lose your job because you weren't meeting the quota sucked. But my team was great and my manager was very nice. Im sure Wells Fargo has changed its job culture and if I had the chance to work with them again, I would."
good,"Very good company for startups, good work culture and very benefits."
good,"ok workplace job is demanding but with proper training you will exceed in working there. very fast-paced, but relaxed at times. will learn a lot about banking."
good,"I learned a lot and got paid well at Wells but some of the managers are supreme jerks who are protected by higher ups. Often there's a culture of abuse by the mgmt and the people in HR just look the other way or even protect the bad ones."
good,Wells Fargo was very good to work for. They had a very relaxed but professional approach to everything. I always felt safe and comfortable. I was always given the chance to grow with help and constant training.
good,A great company to work for!  Appreciates their workers and a nice atmosphere.  Have worked here many of times in a contract position and would do the same again.
good,"Work Life Balance"
good,"You have to be coachable. You must be flexible. You must sell. You have to get along with everyone, not just your branch. Raises are a joke but bonuses when you WORK for them are good."
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to work.  They are diversity inclusive. Community involvement is important. Extensive Learning Center for continued industry related education. Extensive benefits package.
good,"I liked working for wellsfargo, actually unless they see that you are ready, you never answer the phone, one of the best places for training I have ever been,  Very professional trainers, the phone bank was a great place to work.  I would not mind working for them again.  Great experience"
good,This role-- I had the evening shift-- from 1:30 to 10:00 the number on the back of your debit card-- that was me that answered the phone-- I had to let people know about there balance and why they go overdraft fees--- and then try to up sale them on either getting a mortgage with the bank or get a savings account or checking account
good,"followed every rule and regulation ion the best interest of the employees. any special needs wereaccomodated asap.No irrational expectation. Overall,I can work for Wachovia/ WellsFargo again"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Excellent training, and development tools to support staff and customers. Outstanding use of technology, and customer touch points to improve service delivery."
good,"contract job are only 18 mths. Then you have to wait six months before re-hire, even if you do exceptionally well the chances of you being hired full time are slim to none"
good,I went to home preservation from document imaging for a pay raise. It was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made. We had to take inbound and outbound calls so you never really got to work on you pipeline. Other people were playing phone tricks instead of answering client calls.
good,"Good Experience. I definitely learned a lot about customer service, being what the customer needs you to be, working in corporate environment. Working with different cultures, ethnic, & genders also teaches you a lot about working with others & managing 15-20 bankers."
good,"WF has treated me well for 8 years. Because of increased scrutiny of the company, management has been over-compensating on audits and self-regulation. The company is now cutting off their nose to spite their face."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo but I just did not fit in the finance industry. Overall, it was a good working environment and great work-life balance."
good,"You learn, but the sales can and will cause a lot of stress if you don't make the number at the end of the month, quarter. you can get in trouble. You have to push yourself beyond and far. Annoying people /customers on the phone and in person. Customer become sometimes angry and bother with your questions and offers."
good,I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo. It embraces diversity from all walks of life. The employees are treated with respect by the management team and peers.
good,Great company to work for however not very flexible with days off for emergencies or sick children. Management was not the best either the whole time I worked there we were missing one supervisor we were supposed to have two like all the other teams.
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to work. It is centrally located. I have a very cool boss. Wells Fargo provides many volunteer opportunities that you can take time off to do.
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for overall. growth within the company can be hard and it takes multiple tries to get in. Raise is annually. I enjoy working with my coworkers and working is most of the time fun or it may has to do with the people I work with
good,"Worked with high net worth clients and intelligent co-workers"
good,Great work life balance. Sometimes management won't trust the employees enough to do what is right for the customer which causes a strain with management and employees.
good,Wells has been a good company to work for.  The benefits are good and the managers I have worked with do a great job on making sure they pay attention to employee development.
good,"As far as job security, I have been there for 10 years and displaced by the company twice. We worked with very tight deadlines, a lot of government guidelines that change constantly. The hardest part of job is it can be a very stressful environment with short deadlines. I liked working with the customers and seeing them so excited and happy when loan was final approved and they were closing on their property."
good,"Wells has received a lot of negative press lately. However, let me tell you that all the banks have major issues and most are far less transparent about their issues than Wells. The type of things they've been experiencing are happening at every other bank, in far greater instances. The management is smart, driven, focused, and fair. You can't phone it in at Wells, you have to earn it. If you do earn it, then you will get the benefits. Also, there is a lot of diversity and opportunity to move within the system. I should have stayed there and not left, but I was wooed away by another big bank, which has all the issues Wells has, but they were much better at keeping them under wraps."
good,"Many years spent in learning and honing management skills.  Encountered a few good mentors/managers who showed concern, support and willingness to help one improve and advance.  The opportunity to advance and relocate were always encouraged."
good,"I worked for Wells Fargo for 5 years and don't have a lot of complaints. They tend to micro-manage but overall a good company. I retired from there and moved from Phoenix, Az to Smithville, Mo. Yes they did have a ping pong table and a pool table in the break room. My desire at this point is to work from home. I have a very nice office in my home with a computer and a dedicated land line. I can do any kind of customer service, sales, etc. A typical day at work was taking inbound calls in sales. handling new accounts, personal loans, auto loans, home equity loans, and providing excellent customer service. I learned a lot about all of these things. The management was good in general. The workplace culture tended to be friendly. The hardest part of the job was getting started working the phone after training, but it didn't take long to get it down. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and helping them in whatever way I could to reach their goals."
good,when I first started out this was a good job as well as the pay. as time went on I got promoted within a fair amount of time. they have really good benifients and good rate of pay with paid holidays.
good,"A very challenging job. Being responsible for all aspects of security for numerous clients. Taking charge of the hiring, training scheduling and payroll for 200 plus personnel. This was a very rewarding position."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This was only contract work for a short time but I found the people and culture great. For me, there was a lot to understand about the process being prototyped but the information needed for me to support my role was provided whenever needed."
good,"Loved the environment and people there.  They are fun, charismatic, hard working people.  Always had a good time at work helping everyone with what they needed.  My job was to make others job easier."
good,"No micro-managing.  High earning potential. Typical day at work is about 5 hours on phone, 3 hours followup/other general items.  Enjoyable team environment."
good,"I work with a great team and site manager. The site I work at is a critical site and is not open to the public. They allow time off for family and community service, plus added holidays and floaters days for the employees."
good,Definitely a good place to work but need to improve on upper management and career advancements for the future and current employees. Would recommend to a friend
good,"I enjoy working with the public and helping with their needs."
good,"work was very stressful."
good,One of my favorite places to work. The management was very helpful and not overbearing. I would still be there if they hadn't been bought by Wells. Enjoyable place to work.
good,"Working in corporate offices was ideal. There was extensive work available, but constant moves. A lot of lay-offs. Very flexible, able to come in early and leave early, or come in a little later and stay later."
good,"Learning how repossess cars are placed for auction, from repossession to sale.  Making sure the whole process went a smoothly as possible, sometimes this would include making necessary repairs so the auto is safe to sell.  This job was enjoyable."
good,Great place to work. Love my job . I do not intend on leaving unless I find something equal to it. However I would like more opportunity for advancement in the company.
good,Inclusive workplace environment. Career growth is promoted. Job work / life balance is management's priority. Performance incentives are fair. Benefits aligned to industry average.
good,"Love my job my boss co-worker are very supportive.sometimes management can be difficult with their expectation such as the survey. The survey sent to customers does not specify that the processor are being evaluated  however my annual review and compensation is base on the review, I don't think its fair"
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work. The people are fantastic the managers are supportive and there is plenty of opportunity to grow. I will and have recommend Wells Fargo as a place to work for family and friends.
good,I really enjoyed my stay at wells fargo. I liked the technology I worked on and most of the people are good and friendly to be with. I also had a friend who joined at the same day with me and that makes it more fun and interesting.
good,"It is great, friendly environment, and management it is okay for a call center.  there are great time, and the stressful time especially toward the end of the month. as a collector we needed to collect on balance or at least the last payment amount."
good,I worked as a teller in the drive thru which can be extremely busy on certain days of the week. Being a teller now is easier because Wells Fargo did away with tellers having to sell accounts.
good,"working for this company i learned the important of the respect for other people private information and different culture of co-workers,"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I worked for Wachovia bank and was merged into Wells Fargo.  The sales goals they had for staff were too aggressive, resulting in transfers to my department that were unnecessary and detrimental to the customer.  Due to recent changes, I believe that culture has changed."
good,"cash handling "
good,"Most stressful position I've ever been in but also the most highly compensated position, so I have no complaints.  Loved the $ but not the stress I brought home with me everyday."
good,"I have really enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo. However, due to recents hits on the reputation, the work environment has changed. There are little to no options for moving up in the workplace. Time for me to find somewhere I can grow."
good,"Nice Company to work. Work culture is good. Managemet side need to improve alot . There is very less opertuites to grow you needto stick to the project where you joined . IJP(Internal job postings are not effective)"
good,"Amazing workplace not including the poor management and lack of communication but that is very common in a call center environment. Paid training, with great customer interaction program that includes treats and fun activities for the learning experience."
good,Great for people who are looking to get a good start with an ok pay while looking for better opportunities. Difficult to move up within. The attendance policy is lenient compared to most jobs. Typical day is mostly sitting at your desk taking calls and submitting research tickets with some interaction with co-workers varying.
good,"They take care of their employees, far as benefits. Salary needs to improve 100%. In my department, it could be very stressful, but I do it for my customers everyday."
good,I spent twenty five years within the company. Slow advancement but benefits were excellent compared to some. I would have still been employed  if Wells Fargo did not take over and laid me off. I spent twenty five years on a job that changed employees as well as name of company several times and I have no regrets.
good,I was a contract employee for their Team Member Marketing unit (Employee Benefits) so some of the questions don't apply. I had a great manager and work team and I really liked the culture and atmosphere.
good,It was a good place to work and to start a career at Wells Fargo. Immediate management was great. Upper management could be out of touch at times. Their inflexible scheduling policy causes many long-time employees to have to quit.
good,"Great place to work love"
good,"A typical day began and ended with a team huddle. The team was close and depended on one another. Most of the customers were great. It was an excellent place to work that increasingly became less so due to higher and higher sales goals. In addition, the past couple of years, senior managers began micro-managing which increased the stress level of an already high stress job. Its my understanding much of that has changed after it was discovered 3.5 million bogus accounts had been opened by team members trying to meet unrealistic sales goals. I believe the culture at the bank is different now."
good,"sometimes there is miscommunication between departments. You may receive different responses to the same questions, sometimes other departments do not willingly provide information to other departments"
good,"The job and most co-workers are easy going, management needs some work. Overall a good job and its completely up to you wether you want to move up in the company or not, as long as you do your job to the key, promotions are only a matter of time."
good,"•	Perform daily tasks within the business of Default Service Claims"
good,"I am a professional banker / financial sales investment"
good,"Good training program when you start.  Managers and coworkers are responsive to questions after initial training.  "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This is an ok place to work, the salary isn't competitive to other jobs that provide the same service. Management is a little iffy  and the overall work experience for me lacks the professionalism that is needed for someone of my skill set."
good,I enjoyed the fixed schedule that was provided with full time employment. Work schedules were always posted for review within a good time frame. Lunches were also scheduled which made palnning easy.
good,A work day at a branch varies. It can be busy and fast paced or slower where one would have to be proactive and work on assigned tasks. The company has appointed new leadership and changes are being made to the daily processes for coaching and development of team members. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the and creating one on one relationships with the clients.
good,"Being part of the managerial staff, I was often one of the first people to arrive. Pulling overnight reports was a daily task. It set the tone for the morning huddle. "
good,"As a mortgage assistant, I was responsible for processing mortgage applications of various clients, which consisted of clarification of information and working directly with clients. Sometimes I attended new housing development's open house events. The most satisfying part of my job was seeing clients happy faces when they were approved for their home."
good,enjoyed the people I worked with sometimes stressful when dealing with upset customers but for the most part enjoyed helping the clients was easy to manage my time
good,"Reviewing corporate performance in the areas of lending, service and investments."
good,"Great place to for a career. There is room for advancement and an incredible Managment and HR department. Also, the benefits and work environment are wonderful."
good,"Good place to work except for contractors or temporary job holders.   "
good,I left Wells Fargo right before a major policy change took place. I think my experience of a heavy sales driven culture may be out of date now.I thought it was a great place to learn and develop my skills.
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work if you are in a full time position. Part time positions are pretty much expendable and the hours fluctuate. Benefits package is great and you also get PTO and Holiday time.
good,It was hard to a job when management isn't held accountable for their own actions and job requirements. I was able to create great customer relationships.
good,"I enjoyed my position at Wells Fargo, it was rumored when I was hired at Wells that my position will only last a few years, although I inquired about these rumors, Wells Fargo denied my position to be a temporary position. However the job position was in fact temporary. Somehow this is a reflection to this review, job security is so important to me."
good,"I really enjoyed working here.. It was a great place to work, incentives and wellness dollars, I also spent 13 years of my career working for this company"
good,"I have been with this company for almost 7 years and thoroughly enjoy the company.  As the home mortgage is constantly fluctuating, my current position was not secure.  Although I enjoy working for the company, I sometimes have concerns of the longevity"
good,"Great potential with a wonderful brand name at the time.  The timing for setting up the division was well planned and the market was ready for a small to medium size reinsurance intermediary."
good,"I worked mainly in the Ag division and also helped out in the Life & Health and P&C departments. "
good,"Day to day, I worked on problem tickets pertaining to provisioning access, hardware, software and AD groups. This was where I first learned about systems administration and information technology. Workplace culture was different depending on the department and team you're in. Best part of the job was the work/life balance and casual Friday wear everyday."
good,"Wells Fargo was a great place to work. It was kind of stressful during the lawsuit and with call with that. Overall it was great. I miss the people at Wells Fargo, but had to move back to Ohio."
good,"This was a great place to work. They provided a set schedule, with room to advance. Managers cared about their employees. Weekly meetings to go over updates."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Highly stressful /Can be counter productive. Management department can use a huge overhaul. Hardest part is adapting to the inconsistencies, changes weekly and or unreasonable demands at times.  The atmosphere was extremely family oriented witch I loved. I also adored the Processing MGR she truly cared!"
good,"Wells Fargo was an excellent company to work for. Very detailed training that prepared me for when i hit the floor. While i was primarily left on my own to work, management was always a quick IM away for assistance should i have needed it."
good,i really enjoyed working at this company. The training was amazing. Job recognition was awesome and it was always an overall very pleasant environment to work in everyday.
good,"I worked at Wells Fargo as a Temp for seven months and enjoyed the experience.  All the employees were excellent and motivated to do the best job possible.  It was a fast paced environment yet everyone was willing to help when possible.  Everyone on the floor was capable and intelligent, they cooperated well with each other in order to make sure the work was done well."
good,Consists of assisting customers with any personal or business financial needs they have. Must have customer experience in order to deal with difficult situations.
good,"Career advancement takes way too long. It takes at least a year before you can change roles, and this is not what I am looking for at this time frame."
good,I had the opportunity to grow within Wells Fargo and being a part of their Fast Track To Management Program.  This was an excellent opportunity to learn more about banking and dealing directly with customers.
good,"Loved interacting with customers on a daily basis but I hated having to sell products to regular customers;it was annoying and the customers would get visibly upset by it but other than that I loved the location,fellow employees and manager"
good,"Work was based off rewarding the parties that worked the hardest. "
good,"There is a great deal of ability to advance in this company.  It, however, is a better place for new to the workplace employees to start their career.  The salary offered is low and the medical insurance is awful."
good,Well Fargo was a learning process for me when learning how to do my job properly.My ability to learn more about my job duties and how to be a better employee to the company and to my clients.
good,"My tenure in Wells Fargo for some 7 years in processing, underwriting and closing management was fast paced, productive, sometimes very challenging with constant change as is normal in mortgage lending. Work life balance could be very challenging however my experience was that Wells Fargo has an abundance of support tools in place to help achieve that. The environment is mostly busy and as positive as a team member and management chose to make it. Integrity, quality and customer service expectations we high on the must have qualifications to be a part of the Wells Fargo Mortgage Leadership Team."
good,"Team focused. Learn a lot through hands-on deal exposures. Love the people I work with. Everyone is very willing to help you out, especially when you are just starting."
good,"The company overall is great for advancement, tuition assistance is available to all employees after meeting some basic requirements. With the right management team, a person can really advance themselves professionally and personally."
good,I like working at Wells Fargo but they are closing my department and I am looking for a new Job.  The department is closing by the end of the year. Hopping Indeed will help.
good,"Getting files done submitting files into processing."
good,"The environment was enjoyable, training was thorough and the culture was independent work but team focused, everyone was willing to help each other to get the job done."
good,Good company that takes care of it's workers and tries to maintain the best possible customer oriented philosophy.  Fast paced and has a great paid training program.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, but compensation was low and there was no room for advancement. I was in the correspondent part of the department and was asked to move to the home equity side of business. When home equity was shut down, I was told that I might not have a position on the correspondent side. I did not agree with this considering I was asked to take the home equity position, I did not apply for it."
good,"The work place is great and the people that I work with and interact with on a daily basis are great. I like the job, but the compensation is very low and there is no room for advancement."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Typical day varies .  Learned a great deal about the mortgage industry.  It is a great job for the most part but in just five years I have seen 3 mass layoffs in the department, which is why I would give it less than high marks on job security.  As far as advancement, they are working very hard to centralize their operations so if you do not live in the right city the advancement opportunities are slim.  However if you are willing to relocate this would not be an issue."
good,"Good Company to work for"
good,"Must be organized, able to communicate well and multi-task while demonstrating strong collaborative skills. Teamwork is encouraged but also much individual accountability. WF does promote career development and growth to new positions."
good,team is very helpful and throughout the day you have an opportunity to meet new customers and learn something new the hardest part of the job is to loose fear in been rejected by customer when you provide them with options to help them financially if you never ask you never learn
good,I enjoy working at Wells Fargo overall. Great people but its a little on who you know rather than are you employer that can be dependable long term. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you assist customer to successfully resolve delinquency.
good,Very professional and interested in team members.  Very fair employment practices if you do the work required.  Quality wages and benefits as well.  Easy to progress up the corporate ladder if you do the work required of your existing position.
good,"This job is an okay job, its quick paced and gave good benefits. The hours aren't had at all and the staff tends to be great people. They give you pto as soon as you start its great."
good,"Good place to work. A typical day is processing checks into a Lockbox account on a 7200 Opex machine or into a RIDS system."
good,I worked for Wells Fargo for 5 years as a Banker. I would work with Customers to handle their banking needs. I also did loans for customers. We had Sales goals to meet every quarter and I would meet them each time. I enjoyed the experience from working there.
good,"Its a great organization to work. I had a very good experience working with highly experienced professionals. Very excellent work culture. The regular work day is busy with meetings, communications and trying to resolve issues. Everyone is very quick in responding. "
good,A typical day in the life of a loan officer at Wells Fargo should be handled much differently than it is.  Loan Officers should be able to get out to work at getting more business but instead are mostly stuck in the office doing paperwork which should be done by processing.
good,"Good working balance"
good,"My review at wellsome fargo  is alway great ,I'm a people person I gets along with everyone I enjoy what I do .I'm a teen player ,ever task I'm  giving  I try very hard to get it done at a timely manner."
good,"Wachovia was a very busy bank, everyday brought about a different experience. I enjoyed talk and servicing the different customers who entered the bank."
good,Learned about IVR trading over the phone for the projects I managed.  Great supportive boss made my job easier.  Learned about banking industry which at times was challenging but something new to learn.  Hardest part of my job was getting a new boss that was very challenging..  I made life long friends there.
good,"A typical day in my position involved helping users get set up on their new machines, whether they be new hires or getting a replacement machine. If a user ended up missing any data on their new machine, I was the one in charge of recovering that for them from their backup, or from their data recovered from their old machine once it was sent back to the Wells Fargo Depot."
good,This job is all based on sales and providing customers financial solutions for all their needs they may have. Staff is usually friendly. Made a lot of friends that I still talk to
good,"Great Bank to work for with amazing employee benefits but, I do feel as if the upper management are thinly stretched. Though, with every massive company you are going to have disconnects at some of the base levels."
good,Very fast passed job for those who want to achieve.  Extremely well paid compared to other industries.  Can be stressful at times depending on position and line of business.
good,good company to work for I've been here for about 4 years and in management for about 3 years. once you get to management and you are trying to grow further it takes a while.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"great company , I had no knowledge of the loan industry but they were willing to train you. The shift was a great shift and it came with all major benefits."
good,"will work with amazing people , learn a lot of new trades and skills , systems and regulations for banking, great benefits and ability to move up with the company in most of the U.S."
good,This was a good job to start as but the economy crashed and they had to let a lot of people go. There could have been better management structure. I think it was very sad how many people had been there for years and were just let go.
good,Review mortgage loans to ensure accurate loan estimates are disclosed to the borrower. Learned how changes in loan variables and programs affect loans. Management is very knowledgeable and accessible for any needs you may have. Laid back workplace culture as long as you are completing your work. Great people to work with on a day to day basis.
good,A real solid company with excellent benefits. Training is quite long and covers a lot of information. A pretty casual and laid back setting with the expectation of professionalism always in the way the customers should be treated.
good,"Wells Fargo overall was a great company to work for. I began working there as a teller when it was Wachovia and was promoted several times throughout my career. A few years after Wells Fargo bought out Wachovia, the sales pressure was too much. I ended up transferring to Wells Fargo Dealer Services. It was much more relaxed however the opportunity for growth was not there unless I was able to work nights and weekends. They have a great PTO policy and I always had great managers. I was also able to take advantage of their Tuition Reimbursement Program which was a huge benefit. The most enjoyable part of my job was the colleagues I met and worked with along the way. They did have a significant amount of training so I was able to stay current on skills I need for my job."

good,"A typical day of work was following the company office procedures while servicing new & renewal commercial business. Our desks would be audited to make sure we were staying on top of how everything was documented. The hardest part was to make sure we stayed on track for all the companies requirements, while making sure the client had everything they needed. It may have been challenging at times, but we did it.

good,"A good place to work with good management, employee friendly organization. Good employee engagement policies. Safety of employees and women equality are few of the key policies."
good,the phone banker job is a good job I like it but I am needed something that pays more and has little bit better flexibility. And the once you have a shift your stuck with it.

good,Great company. Depends on what department you are in if there is a great working environment.  Has its pros and cons but there is options to move around or up in the company.

good,I like working here. Fantastic benefits and lots of vacation if you can take it. I telecommute which is awesome. Work load can be pretty heavy at times and fuzzy direction from upper management.
good,It was okay if management wanted it to be. The job was what you made it and tons of folks made money. i do not think its for some one starting new in the industry.
good,great people and good benefits.  Good mobility and training.  great experience working there and recommend to others looking for a solid company to work for.
good,I must admit things have gotten better since I left. They use to be very sales intensive and too pushy. Now they focus more on customer service and doing right. Good pay and benefits.

good,It was a pleasure working at Wells Fargo. Everyday was  challenging to meet my sales goals. I enjoyed interacting with the customers. the most enjoyable part of the job was the kindness and smiles from the customers.

good,Consulting with the client and the line of business.  providing hiring recommendations.  Sourcing internal and external talent.  negotiation of executive salaries.  Governance and OFCCP risk and compliance.
good,A typical day at Wells Fargo starts with morning huddle as we prepare for the day. Once we open customers come and go and often sit with bankers to be assisted with account issues or inquire about products we offer. We are required to add banker notes with a small recap of every customer we sit with throughout the day and send out same day emails.
good,There are many career opportunities at Wells Fargo depending on what you want to pursue. They have a wonderful benefit package and time off available for work/life balance.
good,"Always something new to learn, plenty of opportunity for advancement.  Management does a good job of listening to your input and will usually ask for your opinions.  This is all based on my experience with home mortgage so it may not be as I described in other departments/branches of Wells Fargo."
good,Very steep learning curve for someone new.The most difficult part of the job in addition to constant learning is the change associated with release over release.

good,"Wells Fargo financial is separate from wf bank. great place to work for compensation is amazing, or I should say was lol. the culture was amazing fun and competitive."
good,Management doesn't work much on development of employees I want to advance my career and no matter how many times I tell them that nothing is done to help me get there.
good,too much drama and chronyism. You are either liked or disliked upon appearance and popularity. similar to high school. Way too much gossip is allowed to go on.
good,"Phenomenal benefits like 401k matching, medical, dental, vision, generous PTO and LifeMart Discounts. The culture is increasingly more and more litigious although and they cannot allow freedoms that other modern office workers can have. (working remotely, flexible schedules, etc) there are a lot of things you cant do because somebody ruined it for the rest of us."
good,A nice play to work. Good team overall! Management can be a little hypocritical or too serious. Easy to promote but also easy to be demoted or terminated.

good,"Help Customers on the phone with online questions or concerns. I learned a lot with how the company worked, how to move around the computer fairly quickly. Management, and work place culture was a great experience. Management was always available when needed, the culture is what you would hope every job was. The hardest part of the job was getting negative scores from customers you've helped  when you've helped in the best way you could. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely making new friends with your coworkers."
good,"Unparalleled benefits, career advancement and learning opportunities to offset the daily grind of the job.  Unfortunately these perks do not completely offset the amount of stress."
good,This is where I learned how to behave in a professional environment.This experience was so important to my development and i learned so much from everyone I worked with.  Loved it.

good,"People are the best part of Wells Fargo.  The spirit of teamwork is very evident, and everyone knows we win together.  Certainly, there are outliers, but for the most part, my teammates are fantastic.

Taking credit applications to qualify them. Setting expectations for the process and helping them find the best product for them from FHA, VA, and Conventional mortgages."
good,"Working for Wells Fargo is fun. However, it was challenging to meet your sales quotes. Before all the scandal with the former CEO, the sales goals were impossible to meet at times and it seemed that they would make it impossible for employees to be eligible to receive a bonus. Every year they would make it harder and harder and the quota numbers would get higher and higher. "
good,I started my career as a teller at Wachovia bank. I loved the company and culture. I learned everything I know with Wachovia. I was always acknowledged for all my efforts by my leadership team and managers. The hardest part in the beginning was commuting for a very small salary but the benefits were great so I did it. I loved helping customers all day until I was promoted to service banker. I loved servicing accounts and doing more for my clients everyday. That got me a promotion for Personal Banker where I was able to cross sell and have goals to help my branch.

good,I have applied to the job I am currently doing as a temp and I was denied due to lack of experience. that does not make sense because I am currently doing the job I applied for.
good,"Great Team atmosphere,meetings with staff at least once a week, bonuses were given if sales goals were meant which was a motivate to do well and reach sales and services goals. Job would be very stressful at times if and when goals weren't met"
good,They are very flexible with their schedule. The pay when i worked there wasn't that great for the amount of work we did. Some of our leads were bad apples. You have to be willing to adapt to change at anytime.
good,This was one of the best jobs that I ever had. My opportunity for growth was never ending. They encouraged your growth and made sure to promote from within.
good,"If you are into Finance, dig in because WFDS is bigtime, I took this contract during the Wachovia Bank acquisition.

I've learned how to balance a cash drawer, set scheduling, handle many transactions in a timely manner, lots of things. The hardest part of the job was trying to find out what customers really needed when they don't know themselves. The best part of working here were my team members. They are like family. I was welcomed with open arms when I first transferred here. I absolutely loved my team."
good,It is a wonderful place to work. Has good facilities and provides value to its employees. Had nice time working here. Work environment is good and pay is good with consistent hike

good,"•	This multifaceted position allows me to interact with managers; analyst, technicians and administrators to discuss root casuals of customer complaints so all areas of issues are resolved. "
good,"The time that I spent at Wells Fargo was full of fun, learning and hard work.  Working in the mortgage side during the mortgage downturn was long hours but having the satisfaction of keeping borrowers in their homes was very rewarding.  It is important to know the regulations and work within guidelines, but that is why they call it a job.  I would recommend Wells Fargo any day of the week."

good,I enjoyed my job and management however I feel they did not handle leaves appropriately. Fast pace. Always room to movr up within the conpany.
good,I enjoyed my employment with Wells Fargo until we were displaced. The displacements happen a little too often for you to have job security. Once you begin to love what you do the job is sent away

good,"One of the best environments I've worked in."

good,"overall i had a good experience here."
good,"There are certain things you can learn in WF, business insights, general concepts of finance (if you are not in Business LoB, but operations in WF are slow, and if you want to learn fast, you better get maximum out of it, and consider to do something else somewhere else. Big turnover is influencing to quality of provided work and it's coming from upper management, so job security is for full time employees only"
good,Good but could not fire people that did not do there job. Left you short when people could get away with doing nothing for month after several write ups.

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I learned to be able to work with different people and to provide a satisfied work. The supervisor was professional and made the job enjoyable. The job was not hard because of the team work.
good,"I loved working at WF, I started as a phone banker 1 and once I hit my 6 month mark was promoted to a Premiere Phone Banker and also a riser star member , In wells fargo that's a very quick timing to get promoted considering you have to be in any position for 6 months before you can even promote. I loved WF the only thing I would change is it being so product and sales oriented. Its a pretty nice job and especially since I was a phone banker it was high stress but if you have thick skin and have a very ""get the job done"" mindset, it should be no problem to be successful at WF."
good,too sales oriented in an unethical way. they press you to sell to customers that cant afford services. sell on every call is there moto. very hard to do when you are empathetic for your customers
good,"Wells Fargo is constantly changing and evolving their brand for growth and for their customers. It is a fast paced environment that places emphasis on customer service and growing the business.

I very much enjoyed the group of people I worked with, everyone got along well."
good,"In the position I held a multitude of responsibilities: I was not only a teller, but a banker and help a supervisor position with the other managers were not in the branch.

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Mundane, I have told by colleagues that they are no pro-active in anticipating the needs of the clients.  Varied changes since the time I have worked for First Union and Wachovia mergers."
good,"A non-stressful production environment, minimal management, great team, wages aren't up to expectations but over all a good secure place of employment."
good,"As a lead teller I am there to coach my fellow team around providing excellence customer service. I make myself available to answer questions from customers and ensure them that we value their business and willing to do what we can to help them succeed financially. I work closely with my management team. Build relationships with my team and customers. I take the time to get to know our customers, and know a little about their life"
good,Management is really struggling to keep up with the pace of the project and are not very good at handling problems on spot. Very disorganized and many areas of improvement are open.
good,Wells Fargo Call Center was a family based department where you built relationship not only with the peers but with the management team.

good,"The company is a great company to work for as a permanent employee, however there are many levels of management that creates a problem in resolving the real issues at hand.  It takes far too long for things to move forward because of the number of levels of approvals needed."
good,"Every bank/financial institution has its ways of doing things, you need to find the one that works best for you and the way you like to work."
good,"Good place to work, sometimes over time is required, flexible hours,"
good,Wells Fargo has processes in place to promote within and development of team members to get them ready for next role is in core value. Quarterly reviews and development plans are part of process. Large company and has many areas to grow within company.
good,"Processed cash withdrawals and deposits, adhered to Wells Fargo security and audit procedures, examined checks for identification and endorsement, maintained confidentiality of bank records and client information and delivered prompt, accurate and excellent customer service. Most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I did what was right for the customer."
good,I enjoyed this position very much because I was able to support Wells Fargo in closing the gap with recruitment.  I represented a different and new set of eyes on the existing process.
good,"It is always busy at Wellsfargo. I love to interact with the clients, this way it is easier identify what is the clients needs and I can offer it to make my solutions goals. Love my co-workes."

good,"The work places is okay, sometimes I feel like Wells Fargo doesn't not treat you like a person and more like a number and they can just hire someone else in your place. Great benefits and can offer more to the employees who work there butt off for there customers."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,My experience with Wells Fargo has given me the ability to adapt to changes and opportunities to grow. I have been through two mergers. I first started with World Savings in the Record Department and then Quality Control. We then merged to Wachovia and I started to work in Customer Service. I grew my working experiences to the Collateral Department. After about 14 years in Loan Service I decided to take the challenge and switch to the Mortgage side and recently started working in the Home Preservation Department in Bankruptcy. My role was to assist customers in trying to get approved for a Loan Modification and gather documents to build a file for review. I closely worked with Underwriters who would be reviewing the file to determine a decision if the customer would qualify for a modification. Typically its about a 30 day process. What I love about this job is being able to help my customers keep their home with a new modified mortgage plan if they get approved. Of course the hardest part is if they are not approved having to give them a denial call. I never like to end my call with the customer feeling hopeless so we do try to discuss other opportunities to help the customer. I have awesome co workers that work together as a TEAM. If anyone is out for the day we come together to get their tasks and calls completed. Management is strong. Never had I felt helpless or unappreciated. I have learned that mortgaging is not easy and it is a challenge but our GOAL is to strive for our customers to be comfortable and VALUED.
good,Very comfortable work atmosphere. Friendly staff. Loved working there. Good team work. Encouraging team mates. Overall a very good place to work at.
good,Depending on what job you have with the company your days can be fast paced or slow and steady. Their training programs to get you ready for your position are very in depth. The management every on is different. Co-workers are your friends! The hardest part of the job can be to live up to all of the expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you learn so much and are challenged everyday.
good,I worked in a busy location so we always had something to do.  I learned a lot about banking and patience.  I was disappointed that managers were never at the same location for very long.  I worked in the same location for over 20 years and during that time I probably worked under 7-8 different managers.  I enjoyed all the people I ever worked with-but they came and went also. No one ever stayed long-some because of promotions (which was a good thing)  but most just left the company.  The hardest part of the job was having to say no to clients.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people and and knowing them for so long that they felt like family.
good,"Wells Fargo promotes P.A.C.A, which allows you more career advancement. They are very competitive an I learned a lot about professionalism while working there."
good,"This is very much stable for some people, but they have tenancy to layoff a lot. The company have great benefits and compensation for their employee."
good,"Good culture and most employees are good to work with on projects. Co-workers were good to work with on projects. Sometimes it is difficult to get teams to join risk compliance efforts, they attempt to avoid the issue."

good,"I did like working for wells fargo and was able to complete any given tasks."
good,my personal review is to improve the people skillsof the management team. The company itself is very stable and provides good benefits. The shift schedules are ok but I personally prefer day shift.
good,Everyone was really nice and caring as a whole team. Never has there been any drama in the workplace. Management was very understanding when I had 2 family members pass in a 3 month span. Sales goals are a thing for this company. The goals are reachable if worded the way they tell you to word it and if you are persistent.
good,Great company with lots of opportunity to succeed. Very helpful to employees and managers always are willing to answer questions.
good,"highly professional environment, competitive compensation, great facilities.  I had opportunity to come in late on a project so the challenge was not what I'm used to, would love to work there again on a more challenging project."
good,On a daily basis we are expected meet daily goals with excellent quality to abide by government guidelines.  The hardest part of the job is getting our customers to submit documents to be able to decision their loans.  Upper management is really friendly and always willing to hear employees opinion.  I enjoy working with my coworkers as they respect the different personalities amongst our group.
good,"Great place to work overall. After working there for 4 years I learned its not always how good of a worker you are but how much your manager likes you. Holidays are paid, 4 weeks of vacation. Dental care health care all that good stuff of course you have to pay for it came to about 40 a pay check for all included. Good 401K, they match 6% after the first year."
good,"•	Submitted service request adjusted dividends supplied quotes on a daily basis"
good,"Supervisors very impersonal, and not very helpful in training, good benefits, vacation and health benefits., not much room for advancement"
good,Good advancement in retail but must be a manager to move out. If you have a good manager stick with them. Very sales driven to move up.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Help customers with their financial needs, managers are nice just have to make sure you stay in balance throughout the day"
good,Made a lot of cold calls to potential customers. Sold an array of banking products with an emphasis on mortgage options. Things got tough when the housing market crashed.
good,"As many things are changing in the company focusing on quality, sales goals are still very much important and at the forefront of it all. Sales are not ""tracked"" but are still very much expected. The people are great to work with which makes the workday enjoyable."
good,"Typical day at work was time management and flexibility. Learned a lot about interest rates, various loan types, and policies. Co-workers were easy to work with."
good,Production and quality numbers continue to increase. Looking to expand my underwriting knowledge. I continue to learn something new everyday which is great. It is something new everyday.
good,"Wells Fargo Call Center is a great place to work with great benefits! Typical day at work wold be signing onto my work area, pulling up my systems, and getting ready to take at least 80+ calls before the end of my 8 hour schedule."
good,"Wonderful Benefits, great education tools within the company. The department I worked in really cared about the employees and the moral."
good,"This company has great benefits, and a high promotion rate. With that being said, they can be write-up happy, and very sales oriented."
good,Great place to work. lots of opportunities. The daily job can provide similar events or something totally different. The most enjoyable part of the job is solving customer issues.
good,"Great place to work, the hours are great and the company was very understanding. They support the growth within  the company if you have the education to back you up"
good,"Well Fargo is a financial company where you can make a difference in so many lives.  Ensuring the success of customers financially is something I take an enormous amount of pride in.  A typical day for me involves me coaching, leading and holding everyone accountable to the goals we have to achieve on a daily basis."
good,"I very much enjoyed working  for Wells  Fargo. I learned how to  do many different jobs, which all had to be done by the end of the day. Learned how to work with people over the phone, in person, and how to resolve complicated issues. Management was always helpful, and willing to work with you. Training and advancement was encouraged and advised. Co  workers were helpful and fun to work with. We were like one big happy family."
good,"If your looking for a company that is stable and growing, Wells Fargo would be a great place to find this. I enjoyed working in Wells Fargo however, I worked in the call center so the environment can be stressful at times. If your not use to working in a fast paced environment, then do not take a job in the call center."
good,Co-workers are great and always willing to lend a helping hand. Many tenured employees. Enjoy the family feel of the company.
good,"I like the variety of customers and co-workers.  WellsFargo has great benefits with 401k, PTO, medical, dental, and vision insurance."
good,"It's an extremely great place to work but I need to relocate to Atlanta to assist my daughter who is having my grandchild"
good,everyone was nice that i worked with and very helpful. co-workers and management help make it an easy transition into the position. although management was forced to reduce team size even as work flow was increasing. cafeteria had a great selection of foods to choose from if you forgot to make lunch for the day and was reasonably priced as well. over all a good place to work.
good,"Typical day was taking deposits, cashing checks and selling products. Greeting customers when they come toward your window and helping them with processing transactions and solving any of their banking issues. I learned great customer service and sales. The hardest part was letting people know they are overdrawn. The most enjoyable part was getting to know the customers and making them feel comfortable."
good,"I enjoyed my time while it lasted, but would not go back to Wells Fargo. I dislike the part of the job where customers rate their experience and you need to have 5/5 ratings - even if you're given a 4/5 that's an automatic non top box and you're looked down on by your workers for getting a ""bad"" score."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"it is a great place to work. Personally it can get redundant after a while having to see the same people all the time, but my coworkers made it a joy to work there"
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to work for but it's easy to get stagnant in your career and they don't seem to reward employees who are loyal and dedicated to the company as much as those that jump around to other companies.
good,"good job overall, great benefits and competitive pay working there was good i which it had better life balance every long hours ."
good,"Wells Fargo offers an excellent compensation/benefits package and overall, given the opportunity I would work for this company again."
good,Has the potential to be an awesome job. I was looking for advancement. I am an awesome team player so this I loved working with my team members and staff. They were exceptional. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to assist my customers and help them succeed financially everyday.
good,Shame about the managers- I had a great time it was a huge company and I loved it. Wish I could of stayed longer I really do.It was a cool time
good,"Wells Fargo was a great company to work for the following reasons: "
good,Wells Fargo overall is a great company if you want to pursue a career in the Financial industry. MY co-workers really nice. Security is a big thing when working with a bank and Wells Fargo goes above and beyond making sure their customers are safe and secure.
good,"From day one sales and competition are encouraged. If you can avoid third shift and keep your numbers up there are opportunities to advance, but if you are looking for a position that is purely customer service you will do best to avoid this because it is a SALES position, no matter how they try to spin it. The benefits are awesome, but you definitely earn everything you make, especially in the entry level position."
good,"Acquired through a buyout, cannot tell how the company is yet, so far so good. Only disadvantage their benefits package is less than previous companies and forced to take their plan."
good,"Great resources and benefits."
good,"Very competitive, fast paced environment.  Lots of ups and downs..but that is to be expected.  I feel fortunate to have worked here as long as I have."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. I feel valued as a team member. Wells Fargo offers great advancement opportunities, I have now served in 3 different positions."
good,"I enjoyed my job very much and felt I learned a lot about stocks and the operations of the area i which I worked.  The people were great to work with. The first few years I was there the Presidents of our division were awesome to work for.  Changes were good and easy to adapt to.  One thing that was not good and never got better was training.  Job training was minimal. You were told shown what to to do once and were on your own to figure it out.  "
good,"A typical day at work for me would be creating offer letters, posting positions internally and externally, along with auditing job folders. Working with recruiters and managers is an everyday part of my work life. Teamwork is a major key to my success in my role."
good,"I come to work looking forward to seeing the audit report without any of my team members being on it."
good,"I Love this company and I get alone with all my co-workers and managers, very professional place to work with a lots of opportunities to grow."
good,"Its very good place to work here ,we can learn many new things here.flexibility at work .Management  is very good.good team support."
good,"receiving and making calls to clients through out the day, i learn a lot about how the financial side works, the co worker was great, the hardest part of the day was not all calls receive was pleasant calls the most enjoyable part of the day when a client was through with there account"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The environment at Wells Fargo is great, very supportive and easy-going people. The real annoyance with Wells Fargo is the skill practices every day. We are required to show up anywhere from 30 min to 90 minutes before the branch opens in order to practice. Even that isn't terrible though. The real problem I have with this job, and I didn't expect this for some reason, is that the job is entirely talking. Your position is to talk to customers all day, zero hands on work."
good,When I worked there we had an awesome staff of workers. It was hectic and busy but it was worth it in the end. The production process could've been better then but we made it work. Management was of great help every event. We all worked as a team to make our shift go by smoother and keep our guests happy. As I always have said; positive energy gives positive results.
good,"Wonderful office to work in management is there to listen and give good feedback. Work load is manageable on most days, getting busier as it hit the end of the month for numbers. Hardest part about the job is not being rightly compensated on wage or on bonus. Otherwise great place to have a long term job."
good,"very caring management and family / friendly atmosphere.  Learned a great deal from my colleagues, would recommend this employer to anyone."
good,"I usually help customers with their transactions,go out of my to please the customers needs. Managment and co workers are fun. I enjoy most customers because their nice."
good,"Everyday full of rewarding and fun:  Sales, Customer Service, and Public Relations.  Every level of Management is very supportive and all co-workers are provided equal opportunities.  Most co-workers reciprocate by doing a good job and appreciating one another."
good,"At this job there was never a typical day, the work is the same, but the stories are different.  "
good,"The people you are surrounded with every day is the strength of the Company great team."
good,"Wells Fargo was a wonderful company to work for. My intentions were to never leave the company, and were to continue to grow within this thriving company. Collections was a very demanding, fast past, every changing department. It had its pros and cons. Dealing with high risk, high value customers could be very stressful, but you always had a team of veteran reps, team leads and supervisors at your back to help you through any tough situation. Unfortunately after being in Collections for almost 4 years, there was no longer room for growth and it was time to move to another department. "
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. The only thing I dislike about the company is the job security factor regarding layoffs.
good,Overall Wells Fargo is a wonderful place to work. Wells Fargo is an industry leader when it comes to diversity. The culture is very professional and friendly. I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo my co-workers were all like a second family. Management is approachable and encourage growth and developement. on a down side I was employed at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage for 14 years and 7 months. I was laid off along with my co-workers due to site closure.
good,"Learned a lot of different skills.  Great benefits and paid time off, including holidays.  Co-workers were great to work with.  Team building activities were enjoyable.  Free luncheons from time to time.  Healthcare pretty decent compared to most."
good,Sometimes management push for greater productivity affected the level of quality work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of producing high volume and high quality work.
good,"Wells Fargo is two jobs. First being a banking customer service specialist and second a sales person/Producer. Wells Fargo has toned it down but producing results is still the name of the game and one of the better benefits in the form of a solid compensation. As a banker you assist customers all day with any array of banking need, which you will has to continually call into your support lines to learn new things. In between and during that you have to focus on looking for any banking services you feel would benefit you customer."
good,"I work as  contractor but the over work experiance has been great, I have no issues with my Management or company."
good,"An overall good company to work for, good culture. Decent benefits as well as a good 401k match. Nice co-workers, a good manager."
good,"This is really a good company to work with but the management is not that much good."
good,Fun work place with supportive management. There is lot of opportunities to learn and contribute in the firm. Growth opportunities are good.
good,"Great place to work, and wonderful environment the management is great, the program is amazing, short hours but working later than office hours sometimes."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Company has a great reputation for being conservative and making smart financial decisions. However, the training program given to new bankers and managers does not align with how the company chooses to do business. Upper management pressures lower management and staff to meet overly-aggressive sales goals without regard to clients' real needs.  The numbers are definitely the most important thing to Wells Fargo and work/life balance and promoting an ethical culture is secondary."
good,"a typical day consists checking emails and bulletins that tell you of any updates, checking daily schedule to see if there are meetings or trainings. Then the back to back call flow begins during a call you must answer customers questions I learned that there isn't a solution to every problem that comes in and I learned how to be quick on my feet with keeping the call flow going. The management is very helpful but also expects a lot out of co-workers. I love the environment of my coworkers and the support I get from them and being on a team is great. The hardest part of the job is when you have an upset customer and you still have to offer a product that may be beneficial to them because a lot of times customers do not want to hear it and just hang up. Which this can make making goals a challenge. The most enjoyable part to my job is helping people. I love to do customer service I enjoy more face to face interaction but hearing when someone is grateful for helping them also puts a smile on my face."
good,"Enjoyed having coworkers who were eager to help one another. Really enjoyed knowing what was required of me and how to get the job done. Unfortunately, advancement was not easy in this company."
good,"Typical day is opening and closing store,  working with team of tellers and bankers to assist customers achieve their financial goals and do basic transactions.   Making sure at all times the store maintains its compliance based on government and bank policies."
good,Lots of opportunity to grow. Don't limit yourself. Work hard and you can advance. Coworkers are cool for the most part. Keep it professional!
good,It was a pretty good job the work was hard but it was all worth it in the long run.I met some great people and I enjoyed it while I worked there
good,"I have worked in Wells Fargo Document Custody for 3 years.  Through my time here, I have been promoted from an Operations Processor to a Work Director. Through this promotion, I have gained valuable skills with managing team members, training team members and monitoring their growth and development through completing quality control on the work they complete and aiding in the minimization of errors being made.  Wells Fargo Document Custody is a great environment to learn new skills and to develop your career goals as they strongly support career development."
good,great leadership and platform to build relationships with clients. so many wonderful interactions outweighed the everyday mundane routines and pressures to meet expectations.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with. They are compassionate and hard working. A typical day involves gathering and analyzing data, reporting findings to senior management, and providing feedback to tech team to mitigate certain risks."
good,"I really enjoyed working side by side with my coworkers. It is defiantly the boot camp of banks and sales are pushed and required for the whole branch to receive their bonus. I felt the pay should have went up over time with the amount of production required. I will say, if you work at wells you can work anywhere or excel in any other financial institute.  The hardest part of the job I would say is just the sales part. Personally interacting with customers is great and the branches have a standard of excellence that I can appreciate."
good,"Good work environment where fellow members bond and collaborate on providing expert advice to our customers.  Management does expect their employees to deliver on targets, however that is expected of any work environment."
good,"Wells offers great benefits. Management isn't always the best. My roll consists of daily sales goals, which becomes very over whelming at times."
good,"Working at the front desk checking in members, taking cash/card payments for the memberships, making sure that the members are scheduled for appointments with the trainers in the future."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management who will motivate you to get better at what you are doing and, try to encourage you to learn new stuff for better position(s)."
good,"production based environment, requiring focus on customers and resolution of any issues.  Quantifiable amount of politics.  Team members are nice and fun to work with and assist whenever they can.  Admirable for contributions to the community.  Although, insight of increasing work during upcoming busy times could be more effectively handled, such as staffing for busy months prior to its arrival to minimize the urgency of rushing training."
good,wachovia gave you the oppotunity to make as much money as you want. the overall company was great partys during the holidays with a laid back wor enviroment as long as your numbers where good
good,"Worked in several area's of the bank.  Went through some mergers.  I reconciled multible account daily, Researched and resolved account discrepancies in a timely maner,prepared reports daily and gave great customer service when needed.  Good place to work.  Decent benifits. Managers and co-worker were good.  We worked great as a team."
good,very fun to handle transactions and build relationships with customers but management team needs improvement. I worked here for a couple years and enjoyed my time. the training i received can be used in any job that includes customer service or management.
good,"It was a great working experience working here. Friendly, cooperative and fun environment. If given a chance once again I'll be glad to work."
good,Fun work place and very supportive management. Balanced work and personal life. Co workers are the best. Makes your work everyday easy. Company is really investing on its People which they call Team Members. Hardest part is the transport going to and from work. Most enjoyable part would be Team Buildings.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I have gained a good amount of skills and experiences."
good,It was a good experience learned a lot about the banking industry. The people I work with is why I still work there. I am looking for new employment because of the lack of opportunity here.
good,Very busy and productive. I learned a lot of cash handling and balancing skills. Cool co-workers. Dealing with hard customers and be forced to cross-sell while its long lines. Get to know people by name and building rapport was cool.
good,Wachovia was an excellent company to work for. I thoroughly enjoyed face to face customer interaction and the hustle and bustle of working in the city.
good,"During my short-term assignment at Wells Fargo downtown Denver, CO I tremendously enjoyed the team in which I worked around.  However, the company has it's ups and downs- as with all Banking Institutions- I suppose."
good,"Hard work and dedication required but a nice balance of fun and activity. Management can be tough at times, but that is their job."
good,My day starts with checking e-mails.Solving issues and documenting the work at the end of the day.I have learnt many new tools with co-workers and educated myself a lot on new technologies.Hardest part of the job was to work in shifts and most enjoyable part was to work with wells.
good,"Enjoyed working there with such professional co-workers. It was not challenging, but it gave me experience within the banking field and an opportunity to work with various business units within the bank; which allowed me to be creative."
good,"* Wells is real Customer Service based"
good,"This was a good job, I like the people I worked with but it was a Lg company so it's not personal but still great place to work."
good,"Great place to work with great compensation and leaders.  Stayed there for 20 years until 115 of us were displaced.  It was a very sad day because we were like family.  I loved my job, co-workers and leaders."
good,"Like any corporate job, overall job satisfaction is a result of the department's management group. I've loved some of the positions I've held within WF and been miserable in others."
good,Good working environment and friendly co workers and Managers.  I got to learn more about risk management.  There are opportunity to grow and advance in career..
good,"Great management. great place to work. great enviroment. flexible schedule. short lunches. lots of turnover, very busy and sales driven"
good,Looks out for you.  Tries to retain employees and map them over to new positions if one goes away.  Great friendly culture.
good,The Wells Fargo Culture can differ depending on your line of business and your manager. The retail bank is constantly changing so be ready to adapt to new things. The only two constants are sales and customer service.
good,"Great Benefits, plenty of opportunities, very busy days,"
good,"work and fun a mix of both, with a great culture and job security, lot of extra curricular activities. you would feel not to leave this place"
good,"I really enjoy the changing environment, it keeps things and people fresh. I love the work environment, everyone gets a long and knows each other. I have learned a wide range of insurance knowledge that will help me in my personal life as well as career."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I loved this job, the hours, the fellow employees and the pay, I just needed a little help in the sales department to succeed."
good,"Leader and can be a Team Player, Quick and Fast Learner"
good,I love the flexibility of my LOB. My past experience is well respected as well as my recommendations to the team that I work with.
good,"I was able to grow as quickly as I wanted at Wells Fargo. I learned a lot and enjoyed all the people I worked with. I was very successful at what I did, so I was never hesitant to learn new things. Working in banking overall, gave me a lot of financial literacy I may not have had."
good,"Reviewed mortgage and home equity loan portfolio as a contractor through USAA to determine if Loan Application Register (LAR) attributes were correctly reported and compliant with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). Work conducted was completed timely with minimal errors in a dynamic environment where client priorities and deadlines shifted often and with little notice. Responsibilities included reviewing mortgage documentation for specific loan attributes to compare against and analyzing mortgage processor notes to determine if loan information was previously correctly captured. Utilized Salesforce,  and UniFI online documentation repositories, and loan origination systems daily to execute work responsibilities."
good,I would say a day at work is really good i wait for customers come in deposit or cash a check. Also i look for a solution to try and help the customer in the long run. The hardest thing i would say is when i dont see a customer happy. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers and going out my way to help them.
good,"I personally have no complaints about my time working at Wells Fargo. The hours are comfortable, the work is not particularly hard, you get holidays and vacation time, and the compensation is fair. The one thing that some people have a hard time with, is the constant push for sales. If you don't have a problem with goal-oriented sales, then Wells Fargo will be great."
good,Working for Wells Fargo taught me alot in many different business aspects. Being able to organize and prioritize projects and other important tasks delegated from upper management was a typical day at work.  Co workers were often eager to assist with testing or training as well.
good,"They are very flexible, great management, company spends a lot of money to send you to training, great environment, and a good place to advance in your career. The work is hard, but you learn a lot and are rewarded for your hard work."
good,my days are pretty routine but can become busy in no time. i do multiple cash transactions adding up to and sometimes over hundreds of thousands a day
good,Greeting customers and helping them with withdrawls and deposits using customer service skills. Great co workers and the managers were always there to help.
good,"Active learning and training environment with minimal supervision. Team members are helpful, with a culture of sharing information."
good,A typical day at work was non stressful because management was great. Worked with  awesome team mates . All day was enjoyable because all co-workers were wonderful team players
good,I have loved what I did there it has been a great opportunity however I wish my team was more diverse culturally speaking. I must admit one of the hardest part of my job has been dealing with some of the members of the time that hired me however I was sent to work with an specific application and I loved it there and it was there where I learned everything and got to love it. Working for that application was a huge opportunity and I got to work with many people from many other teams from which I have learned many things that have helped me to grow professionally speaking
good,Management was very involved everyone wanted you to succeed and go further within the company.Training was provided weekly meeting were monthly and you were rewarded for reaching goals.
good,"Very employee friendly.  Good work life balance. Great company. Benefits are good, but feel compensation is a bit below market. Good trade for work life if that is your goal."
good,"typical day was to review document and make sure all paper work was signed and dated, and all funding figures were in place."
good,"My work hours are from 6-2:30: "
good,Really enjoyed my years with the company. They are more steering towards sales and not customer service. I just didn't like that employees are held to the same expectations no matter location (busy/slow).
good,"Help customer with transactions and general banking needs while providing excellent customer service. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Got training on a lot of applications,programs and typical troubleshooting and phone usage."
good,Great training provided at wells fargo to learn about banking. Everyday I service customer on banking needs and cross sell products and services.
good,Took in deposits and processed withdrawls both at drive up and in lobby. Balanced cash drawer 4 times daily.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with clients and helping them with their needs.  My coworkers were always helpful and we worked together as a team.  Stood most of the day and handled coin counting and safe deposit box entry and closure along with clients with our key and theirs.  Logged into record books all reports and closed store with required closing procedures.
good,"There are so many different departments at the West Des Moines location of Wells Fargo, you can always learn something new. There are programs in place for full time employees to take advantage of moving into a leadership role quickly."
good,Great Company to work for! The company allows for growth and career development. Wells Fargo fosters a culture of diversity and professionalism.
good,"As I was there for a very short-time, I feel it is the best place to work. The best part of the job was that I was into which I always fancied i.e. Finance."
good,"I actually love working for Wells Fargo, I have been with the company for over a year and have been promoted once and been up for other promotions. Their vision and values are excellent and they hire excellent people to take care of their clients. Every company has bad apples though. "
good,A typical day at work will range from developing one on one relationships with individuals and companies to monitoring for suspicious activity through our systems. I've gained an enormous amount of knowledge in financing and accounting to aid in helping clients. Management pushes and coaches for us to meet goals and deadlines day by day and it's through the team work and relationship building with my co workers I am able to meet and exceed day to day goals. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to take clients step by step to help them succeed in their personal and business finances and making sure they leave with nothing less than exceptional customer service.
good,"I can suggest people to work at WellsFargo, as it's well versed with the process implementation and work culture is very good."
good,Wells Fargo was a great company to work for.  Offering competitive wages and great bonuses when sales goals were reached.  A work environment that was always changing for the betterment of the overall company.
good,"Great company to work for with high sales goals but they reward you well for the hard work. Overly zealous about obtaining checking accounts, but that's what you sign up for with this company. Management is overly annoying and could use a class in people skills. Wells Fargo is very interested in the customer and most workers are willing to help make sure there experience is great."
good,Wells Fargo is a well run and forward thinking company. They continually provide support services to their employees and encourage engagement. Wells Fargo is driven towards results and expects that out of employees. Monthly and yearly reviews push employees above the normal standard as an expectation. Management continually reinforces the mission statement and is proactive on displaying concern for the customer.
good,"A typical day in Wells Fargo was always based around the customer. Our target audience changed per interaction. Being flexible and approachable is key to success within the company. In my management positions I learned to discover what really drove each individual team member to success. Motivating the team and keeping the daily excitement going kept our team from hitting road blocks in their appreciation and dedication to their position. The company really focuses on ""team members"" vs. ""employees"". This really does describe the culture of Wells Fargo. Everything was focused on working together. The hardest part of the job was certainly the customer service aspect, which everyone really did embrace. As difficult as customer service can be, it could also be the most rewarding part of the job. The aspect I most appreciate and respect about Wells Fargo is their constant dedication to making team members feel appreciated and being so involved in the individual development."
good,Great Training and Management. Its also a very stable career but the compensation is lacking although the  benefits are very good. I would recommend working there.
good,"Good work life balance. Management encourages balance and career development. Diverse place to work in, great resources for self development and to move within the organization."
good,"You'd speak to 30 to 50 customers a day and ask questions about cases they had submitted. Getting the details of the case and making a decision about if it should be paid. "
good,Enjoyed the work and the atmosphere.  Company has been bought out but the corporate structure still remains.  Enjoyed the work and the company benefits that were offered.
good,"I was excellent at building rapport with customers and handling their money suggesting new products as they came out."
good,"I learned a lot working for this company.  I was allowed the opportunity to work from home, which greatly impacted my work/home life balance. The entire team that I worked with was great.     Management style did not always gel with everyone."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I like the culture here.  People are knowledgeable and helpful. A lot of people have been with the firm for over 5 years (including myself).
good,"Worked in redemption department, put people back in there automobiles after repossession."
good,"A typical day involved dealing with client contact. Product sales and consulting. "
good,"its good place to work , with work/life balance. with not so much work pressure . but you have stock with established procedures"
good,As far as treating employees this is the best bank I've worked for.  But they don't encourage searching outside of your department for other positions.
good,"Wells Fargo does take care of their valued employees.  Considering my day to day responsibilities with federal consent orders, which my job title doesn't fit the responsibilities, has been fun to work and  the projects have been interesting because each one is different.  My current position has offered great team work projects along with independent review / testing projects.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the challenge."
good,"I have a great manager , thus a great work environment with little micromanagement."

good,"Working in Bankers Connection at Wells Fargo is a very fast paced, high tolerance job. The calls received on a daily basis can be steady and constant and the immediately switch to progressive and non stop. The job is vigorous, as there is substantial information to retain in order to efficiently excel, but there is adequate training provided to balance the inexperience and fast past learning methods. The work environment is very positive, the co workers are all warm and welcoming. The hardest part of the job is meeting all your numbers for each month, by providing fast and one hundred percent accurate information. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the recognition and regards that one receives when they do well, and exceed expectations."
good,"Great display of Diveristy. Awesome co-workers. Wells Fargo is a company that cares a great deal for ALL emplyees (Team members), as well as its custimers. We are always accessing potential negative impacts to the customer is all projects."
good,"I loved my position at Wells, the office I was fortunate enough to work out of was great, my processing team only consisted of 6 people myself included however we were all great at what we did, and we all got along great. The brach we processed out of was amazing, all of the sales consultants were super knowledgeable and didn't hesitate to hop in and help anyway that they could. The only complaint that I have is management did not seem to be on the same page as the rest of the employee's. I understand that the company is about bottom dollar or in this case profit share for chair holders however at some point you are going to have to listen to your employee's before your employees are all gone. "
good,"Meeting your goals every quarter push me to go the extra mile to make sure i help me clients succeed financially. I enjoyed working and meeting new people. With my personality it wasn't a problem with my manager. I have improved in a lot of ways, my communication skills, building that long term relationship and knowing how to talk to my clients."
good,"Basic cubicle office job. Atmosphere was pretty fun, especially for the fact that it was a call center. Only downside was that was the same routine month in and month out. unfortunately management changed a lot towards the end of the time i was there.

I had to deal with time lines, special projects and a constantly changing environment.  We worked in a group of very helpful and teamwork attitude all the way through management levels.   The organization was very conducive to career development and an ever changing environment in banking industry.  I became a subject matter specialist and was able to assist my peers in their development and knowledge."
good,"The day consists of greeting customers and making them feel welcomed while assisting them with their monetary needs. With this job one learns to work under pressure and have excellent outcomes. The hardest part of the job would probably be, being a part time employee that attends full time at school. This is because sales are a big deal and with less hours there is more pressure and competition in meeting the quotas"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company to work for especially if you are looking to get involved in the banking industry. They set you up with great training and support for success. They set high expectations of their employees to meet their goals, which drives you to work harder everyday. Sometimes it can be frustrating during slower periods because meeting goals are difficult and management isn't very understanding at times. Overall though, Wells Fargo is a great company that loves to promote from within and develop their employees."

good,"A typical day at work consisted of coming in sitting at my cubicle and logging in to all applications that I need to assist me in daily tasks that come with the job. After logging in, i would immediately start to take incoming calls from customers.  While on the job I learned the fundamentals of paying or denying either fraud or nonfraud claims or ATM pin based claims after completing my extensive research.  My co workers were very friendly and helpful towards any questions that I had regarding intricate claims, since claims are on a case by case basis. I would have to say that the most difficult part of the job for me was being on the autodailer for incoming calls. My most enjoyable part of my job would have to be working with my co-workers at wells fargo. It was a very amicable environment."

good,"Stable place to work.  Good benefits.  Gained lots of knowledge in 21 years I worked for the company.  Some of the co-workers I am still in contact with.  Some of the challenges working at a call center is the turn over rate-coaching bankers to better understand goals, then they quit."

good,"I managed the Tacoma office for 9 years.  My hours were 8-5 Monday through Friday.  I learned how to manage my time better, along with managing my team members.  I closed all types of Real Estate Transactions, so my typical day varied from day to day.  The hardest part of my job was having to  lay off a team member.  "

good,"Wells Fargo has a great culture and work environment. They are heavily sales driven so even lenders are required to sell all aspects of the bank. The great part is that it allows bankers to work very closely with their clients providing full solutions to their financial needs. The con is that the required goals pose challenges in spending quality time with clients on an ongoing basis. "
good,"I have worked for WFB for a few months and it was just way too stressful, between the stupid customers to service manager and lead teller not being able to work together and the pressure to sell accounts  was just getting annoying. Everyone who I have worked with are very nice to deal with."
good,As an Employee at Wells Fargo I learned a lot more about customer service than I thought I already knew. We deal with people that trust us with their money so going above and beyond to make sure every customer feels welcomed and confident in where they put their money is extremely important. I deal with many of the same customers almost every day and I love it because I get to build a relationship with most of them. I have to say the hardest part of my job is trying my best to meet the sales requirements each quarter. Its more of a challenge with this company then it was being in retail. Some customers are already satisfied with the products they already have so trying to find new potential customers can get challenging. The most enjoyable part of my job has to be my team. I love my team and this company has many opportunities for their employees.

good,"Inbound and outbound calls to customers regarding payments due or services to help customer needs in financial difficulties. Learned how to negotiate payments and deescalate phone calls. Management was a little micromanaging, but only because of strict government guidelines. Hardest part of the job was probably trying negotiate a payment with a diffficult customer while trying to maintain a professional and customer service appeal. The most enjoyable part was when we were actually able to get a customer on a more friendly note after a call starts out bad by deescalating the call and helping them out."

good,"I enjoy working for Wells Fargo, I've been apart of two sides of the mortgage industary and have enjoyed learning so much; the home buying process, accessing equity, and looking at cilents profolios to get an idea of how I could go about my own finances. The people I got to work with I enjoyed even more, it's a fun, mixed age, and diverse group of friends that keep a light hearted feel but get our work done to highest standard. The only downside to this role is the recent changes to our compensation plan, anyone just starting may think it's a good deal but having been and seeing how much we've lost in the new setup it's a bit disheartening. Overall though I do enjoy my position here within Wells and look forward to continuing to work for this company."

I would follow strict federal rules and regulations while helping numerous people with monetary transactions and assist with any financial needs. managers would follow up with me throughout the day to go over my personal goals and observations on random transactions. I would interact with coworkers throughout the day. I loved the team I worked with and we all helped each other meet goals and give advice. the hardest part of my job was only being able to do a minimal amount to help my customers and then turning over to someone else to try and get them to help them. the most enjoyable part of my job was getting to interact and help so many people each day and make their lives that much better."

good,"The site that I worked at was part of a mass hiring and started off as an Underwriter. But because it was a new site with new management the start up was a bit slow. The mortgage business is always up and down and we immediately had layoffs about 6 months into it. Luckily I proved myself through 2 layoffs with hard work and being a top producer. The employees are great but management and leadership is lacking. Everyone is a yes man and no real answers to real questions are given, but I guess that can be true in the corporate world. I do have to commend the site leader as through the tough times he was able to keep the site open by asking other departments  if they needed our assistance when times were slow."

The management provides helpful feedback, resources and resolutions to make sure you are performing your job to the best of your ability; they are very supportive and encouraging.

good,"They offered overtime when needed and the pay was acceptable.  The department that I worked for was a new department set up.  Many of the dept. heads set things up backwards and it created downfalls along the way.  We were continuously changing the ways things were done or the procedures.  It was stressful at times and made customer service difficult at times as well.  We made many customers upset at points in our task to perfect our job duties and procedures.  I worked with a wonderful group of people though which made going to work each day more delightful.  That and the satisfaction of helping customers refinance their homes.

good,"As a Wells Fargo employee, my job is to have every single one of my clients leave Wells Fargo with a smile on their face, despite how they entered. There was a customer who came in the branch to cash a check. I introduced myself to the customer and his reply was not so pleasant. He was very upset regarding the fees he was charged to his Chase bank account. He also explained how he did not have direct deposit with his job. I then asked him how frequently did he use his debit card, and he replied that he uses his card about 100 times a month. I quickly introduced him to our Way 2Save checking account, which could benefit him since the account automatically becomes free when the debit card linked, is used at least 10 times a month. I invited him to my office and explained to him more in detail in how the account worked. After we spoke, he agreed to switch, as long as it saved him money. While I was going through the customer’s financial review with him, I also discovered he had a business accounts with Chase. These accounts were being charged fees due to the minimum balance not being met, so I asked him a few questions regarding his business and came to a conclusion that the Gold Business Package would work for this client. The requirement for this account would be for him to transfer a certain amount of money from his checking to his savings account once a month. He seemed relieved and willing to start this new account. A couple of days later, I made an appointment with the customer and opened up his business account. I love helping customers to succeed financially on a day-to-day"

From management down to my co workers I wouldn't change a thing. I work with an awesome group of people. The part I like most about my job is I have the ability to help people stay in thier homes and the hardest part of work is having to deny a customer for any type of modification in times such as this where a lot of people are loosing thier homes."

good,As a recent Graduate it is very wonderful starting a career with such a prestigious company! They really value their employees and are flexible.
good,I loved working as a teller. I was able to meet many different people and form bonds with my customers. The management style was unlike any that I have worked with. The culture was all about sales and employees were constantly harped about meeting sales goals. I found that this was not a healthy work environment for myself.
good,"It was a high-paced environment and seldom took lunch. I enjoyed my co-workers, however I was on a team, with all new processors an once they were trained these processors were moved to another team. I was constantly training new processors and this could make the job quite challenging. I enjoyed the outdoor Underwriting meetings and all my team mates."

I think that Wells did a great job of celebrating individuality within the work place.
good,The company always provided an excellant training program for any new position.
good,Great place to work unfortunately Im relocation to tyrone pa
good,"A typical day at work consists of taking 80-100 phone calls. You are expected to refer to at least one out of every four people you speak with. With the way banking has changed over the past few years, the job has become very difficult. It's a fun place to interact with co-workers and speak with diverse customers, but it's hard seeing people in a financial struggle."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "

The most enjoyable part of the job was I never knew what was in store for me, and I worked 4 10hour shifts."
good,"I enjoyed the busy and challenging work environment. I learned how to be more efficient and how to better multi-task.

I also enjoyed helping out with special projects using Microsoft Word and Excel."

In dealing with multiple states one thing was clear as to how each office handles things so differently and being able to adapt or help them understand a correct procedure.

The atmosphere was laid back but the management knew how to do their job and train well. They were flexible with my schedule if I needed to go to an appointment or if something came up. They give you a pool of days called PTO instead of separate vacation and sick days. You just use your PTO hours instead however you need them. It worked out well for me and made me less stressed about using a sick day. The only reason I left the company was because I moved to a state that Wells Fargo wasn't located. I would go back in a second if I could!"

good,"Before the recession hit we had a game room and food catered in all the time. Typical work day always learning something different on procedure or policy. Management was different all the time depending on who your manager was. The hardest part of the job was the changing of team managers, what one manager wanted done the next may not but one could get dinged on review for something you had been trained to do for some time. It could be something of a personal request and not anything to do with procedure or policy. Most enjoyable part of the job was the customers helping them and getting praise for a job well done."
good,"A typical day of work would consist of a huge work load of work to do which i enjoyed. I also learned how to transfer funds,help customers with their delinquent accounts, and assisted customers with any other questions that was helpful to them. My co-workers was okay at times, but when it came to doing my job, it was a time for everything.The hardest part of my job was not being able to help everyone. It was only a 8 hour shift so when i went home customers was still calling in. The most enjoyable part was helping customers,the incentives, being able to transfer funds from one account to another and helping with their mortgages. The banking industry was very fun and knowledgeable."

good,"Wells Fargo micromanages EVERYTHING. It is a very rigorous and ridgedly regimented and regulated environment. Schedules and promotions are based on adherence and something as simple as an unscheduled bathroom break will prevent advancement. Also, you are expected to be a leader even if you don't want to. They push leadership even when you don't want to."
good,"PTO days are good here and the 401k match here is also good."
good,"It was great but difficult to grow to higher paying roles, I am female and had male supervisors and I noticed I was passed over multiple times for promotions despite having better metrics than those men.

good,"Awesome environment with the right people and everything else flows. Job is not difficult at all, only thing that may become of concern is watching out for those fraudsters!"
good,"the systems in place in wells fargo are designed to protect both employee and customer from legal issues. Where the desired effect has produced the safe environment the company seeks, it has also trained people to rely exclusively on the procedures in place to manage transactions. No one thinks for themselves or makes decisions without involving management at every deviation. you have tellers asking if they should deposit a $10 check from a customers grandma or reject it bc grandmas handwriting is a bit hard to read for the written dollar amount. no one trusts themselves to make decisions and its breeding a culture of over dependence on micro management."

BUT you are timed, ABSOLUATELY SUCKED! Yes there ways to help quickly AND perfectly BUT NOT ALL CUSTOMERS are the same! Many require major assistance. NOT FAIR AT ALL! I for 1 hate being rushed!"
good,"it great opportunity, and enjoyed it. the management was bit difficult to deal with but other than that, I learned a lot from the job, definitely would love to come back"
good,Wells Fargo was a good place to work to get experience for pursuing business majors. Co workers are very friendly and you learn a lot about business and handling accounts. Hardest part of the job is the customer service.
good,pay is based on work completed/experience; diversity and inclusion are very important; employees are treated fairly; promote from within in most instances

But when trying to helping in something fun, there was favoritism in who could help in the fun committee. That is the only thing I didn't like about it. But in reality... I miss that job very much and would love to go back to work on the team i left off with before i moved."

good,The first bank that I worked for  (Great American Bank) was purchased by Wells Fargo Bank. this enabled me to branch out and apply (in house) to a new dept that i had never worked  in and really knew  nothing about. It was amazing being able to learn and play an entirely new role (still in sales and marketing) Wells Fargo is an amazing company to work for in that they are willing to train employees and prepare them for advancement when earned.

good,"Overall this is a pretty good job if you're looking for a normal ""9-5"". Career advancements were available but not often, it always depending on who was manager. The atmosphere was nice. After the situation with employees creating fake accounts, they actually started focusing on customers satisfaction and that was when the job got easier. A lot of the job's focus was mainly on being able to open new accounts before then, etc. Nothing was truly ""difficult"" about the job.

good,"a typical day at work involved working my pipeline of loans which included reviewing documents received by borrowers to clear conditions for the required documentation.   When I had down time, I would check with other team members if they needed any help.  Management was there for support with difficult loans and any other additional items needs.  Hardest part of the job was when the system was down, at that point you were unable to keep within required turn times which servicing our customers was difficult.  Enjoyable part of the job was making our customers dreams on purchasing and refinancing their homes a reality."
good,Great company but too big and bloated the processes are redundant and super complex for no reason in some instances and the management is complex in nature for no reason as well

The most enjoyable part of the job was working with clients and getting to know them and the brokers' relationships. Management was very approachable and insightful.

good,"What has kept me within this company has honestly been the amazing team members I've meet through this journey. Not only did I have the most amazing co-workers + managers. But while working here I've gained a family. It's what has kept me going. However, the company fails to recognize and promote team members that deserve it and would rather bring in people from the outside instead of promoting someone that has been in the company doing the same exact work but without the title or the pay. Which has made most of the most amazing coworkers/managers leave the company."

good,"Wells was a good company overall.  The manager I had was very good.  My office closed, and at the time there were no footprints on the east coast.  Everyone had to find other employment or move to another state if they wanted to stay with the company.  I moved to NC and worked in the back office as a closer.  Good Times.  They didn't pay well though."

good,"I would say if you are looking to rebuild, WF is a good place to start. They do value hard work and sacrifice and will reward you if you prove to be valuable.

Customers are friendly but every once in a while you will get a disgruntled customer as with any customer service based job. I learned how to process transactions at the same time as talking with a customer to let them know that you care. My management was ok, I feel overall we had a good team. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a frustrated customer. Sometimes there is nothing you can do to please a customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to be around friendly co-workers. Having good co-workers really makes a difference because I wanted to come to work. Overall I enjoy working for Wells Fargo."

good,i learned so much from being at Wells Fargo. the Job work/Life balance is really good. There is always opportunities to network with other team members across the bank
good,I have worked for this company for a little over a year.  I have nothing but good things to say.  I do wish there was an option to purchase more PTO each year as some employers offer.  Other than that there are great benefits to working for Wells Fargo.
good,I worked there before Wells Fargo was in the media for bad publicity and I handled my job well. So I think with their re-invention of themselves it would still be a good place to work. There are no branches in Ohio for me to work at.
good,"I enjoyed working for Wells. There incentives went down that sucked, but they never made me feel like I was going to lose my job. a lot of advancement if you stick around and impress the right people. I had to leave for personal issues, and since then have found a new job, but I would return there."
good,"There is no greater culture then Wells Fargo but I will say the pay is low. The benefits were great until 2008 when the financial crash. Then they took back many perks and with the cost of living going up, Wells Fargo could not keep up."
good,"Being a contractor there hasnt been the ideal situation however if you can get your foot in the door, I can see that you would be happy and it could be a lifelong job."

good,I learned a lot from working with Wachovia and Wells Fargo. Wachovia was a great company to work for and wish I could have continued with Wachovia and that Wells Fargo would have kept a lot of what I learned with Wachovia when they took over.
good,"I loved this job however it is collections, they make the job the best that they can and there is indeed room for promotion but the call volume is normally high. They are fairly strict on breaks and they keep your wrap up as short as possible."
good,"There are a lot of great things about Wells - benefits are at the top of the list. Time off, insurance, maternity/paternity leave, etc., are all amazing. "

good,"Enjoyed working at Wachovia, and management were really on the ball, I enjoyed working with customers on there financial needs, I would occasionally fill in as a teller. When Wells Fargo was coming we were replaced by their own people."
good,"Wells Fargo currently has a very open and honest culture, partly to counter the effects of some scandals following a few shady business practices."

good,"I enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo, the culture suited me and it's a great place to build a career and get experience working for a marquee financial services brand. Definitely going through some challenges at the moment and if you decided to work at WF, you need to be comfortable and willing to deal with a high degree of change, especially over the next few years. For the last couple of years, the company has been is in the throws of changing from a business centric organization to a highly centralized structure for all shared services (Finance, Marketing, Technology etc), it's a painful process. Personally, I feel the pendulum has swing a little too far in the centralized direction, taking much of the autonomy and nimbleness around decision making away from the management team running a particular business. I am sure things will find their equilibrium over the coming months and years. A great place to be if you enjoy facilitating change in large organizations."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "

good,this company was a good company to work for i learned alot and was able to gain people skills. a typical day at work consisted of me answering multiple phone calls to provide service to the customers. i learned all about mortgages and how they worked thru the 6months course i had to graduate out of in order to be hired. i also learned how to navigate thru the companys software to provide customer service. the hardest part of the job was jumping into a whole new career whithout haveing any experience. the best part of the job was actually getting out to the floor and putting all the skills i had gained to the test.

Prior to working for Well's, I knew very little about credit, bonds, interest rates, etc. However, I feel much more confident and knowledgeable on the subject of finances. I feel managers answered my questions and taught effectively. The culture, where I was, was rather tight-knit. I genuinely felt that my managers and co-workers had my back.

They have a solid foundation and will hopefully make the changes necessary to bounce back from the recent issues and negativity surrounding the organization.

Personal growth and development are important and the company provides ample tools for both to their team members.

good,"If you are fresh grad and look for an opportunity to start somewhere, this is a place for you. They will train and develop you if you are showing an effort to do better. An average day would be answering about 100 phone calls a day for handling inquires and concerns about their banking needs. This company has gone through a lot from lawsuit to another. It makes them to flatten a new management structure to rebuild trust to the customers in nationwide. Diversity and inclusion is prioritized and it is my first company I have worked for that the minority is the majority in the workforce. Training is about two months before you begin working at the phone bank officially."

good,"Great place to work for all team members.  A fair employee culture.  "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working quickly and efficiently, a trip to the on-site cafe or a nearby place to eat, and sometimes mandatory overtime, which meant no on leaves until all the work is done for the day.  Management showed a desire to have fun.  I enjoyed the fact that we were working for the good by catching forged checks, and the potlucks were epic."
good,"Wells Fargo has been a great company to work for the last 22 years!  There is great opportunity for advancement, and the benefits are great!  There have been lots of changes with the culture in the last 12 months, which makes my job as a corporate trainer less engaging.  If you are looking for a job you can grow with, take a look at what is available!"
good,"Great Benefits, great company to work for. Chance for advancement is available if you are willing to work for it. Would recommend this company as an entry level company."
good,"Manage a team of 7 direct managers, that support a site of 150 team members. The culture is inclusive and leaders lead through a Servant Leadership lens. The hardest part of the role, is not being able to interact daily with every team member due to heavy meeting work loads. The most enjoyable part of the job, are the people I get to work with daily."
good,Wells Fargo is good at promotions and ensuring a good working environment. I appreciate all I got in terms of training from wells fargo. It was good overall
good,I do not like that they hinder your growth due to you not being in your current role for less than a year. Especially when they have you temporarily filling the position.
good,Working for a major company felt great at the time.I did get hired as a permanent employee.  Started as a receptionist and then received  a promotion to an Administrative Assistant before I was laid off.
good,"I worked at Wells Fargo during the time of the settlements. Prior to the settlement, sales goals were absolutely unattainable if doing it ethically. After, however, it became a strictly customer service-only job. This made it significantly less stressful, but the consistent heavy call flow left me exhausted every day along with losing my voice multiple times."
good,It was a great place to work. Management was very helpful. I learned a lot from people with different skills. I would highly recommend it if someone was looking to work there. However they usually hire only contractors. Few employment opportunities

good,People work together as a team.  Continuing education is encouraged.  There is a good balance of life and work.  Managers maintain excellent contact with the team members.  Working with and communicating to other Lines of Business is required.
good,"The company as a whole was good, however, the pay is not great and the opportunity to advance is slow. College degrees and experience outside of Wells Fargo don't matter."
good,It was a great place to work. I enjoyed the extra perks they gave. I wish they would pay a little more but I can survive with the  things they did provide. but most employees seem happy to work there. The benefits were good and the pto was great too.

good,"Wells Fargo workplace culture was extremely diversed. Some managers would assist you in your growth within the company.  They have plenty of opportunities to assist with that growth.  Their technology lacked a bit, however, over all they provided you with the essentials to do your job.  They do have great benefits and provide a fair amount of PTO."
good,Great experience and staff members. Would love to go back. Relaxed atmosphere and collaborative team members. Built some really good professional relationships. Management was easygoing and helpful.

good,I love that Wells Fargo take a moment to acknowledge the accomplishments of each representative and rewards them when that have succeeded at achieving their day goals.
good,"Company has been around since 1852 and isn't going anywhere anytime soon.  Management is hit or miss as with any large company.  Overall compensation factoring in benefits (401K match, profit sharing, PTO, Holiday, etc...) is well above average.  Opportunities for advancement in certain cities are almost endless and if you are willing to relocate are more than abundant."
good,The place was a good place to work. They give you freedom to be as productive as you want.  There are nice people that work there.  The environment is clean; the campus is beautiful.  I would go back to work there..for the right opportunity.
good,"A typical day at work would be very productive underwriting loans, clearing conditions, returning emails or phone calls and mentoring Junior Underwriters/Processors. I was responsible for my desk and had the policies and procedures available to guide me in my job so I can stay informed of changes.  Management was challenged with balancing the work load daily due to volume however was supportive of the team.  The environment was fast pace and very busy toward the end of the month and that was to be expected with this line of work. The hardest part of the job was not being able to approve every customer due to some just did not qualify even after all effort was made to save the loan..  The most enjoyable part of he job was the fact that I love my job and enjoyed working hard to meet the needs of my customers and I enjoyed working with my co-workers.  There was team outing and many time food was brought in to celebrate meeting the company goals."

good,"great company to learn people skills and management skills , but low salary for the amount of work you do and the requirements they ask you to do. Growth opportunities take awhile and I also feel politics play an huge part in your growth within this company."
good,Learned a lot about customer service and sales. Worked with a lot of great coworkers. The benefits were great too. I enjoyed being lead teller and gaining the experience.
good,"I worked in customer service, and so I sat at a desk and answered the phone 8 hours a night.  Breaks and lunches are scheduled by your supervisor to ensure coverage on the phones, which means that you generally spend them by yourself."
good,It's a great place to work. The pay in some departments is lower than the average for the area. I worked there for many years. I loved the team I worked with.

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Literally the most boring job I have ever had. Required to stand for full days where you might only see a handful of customers. Management was sympathetic but unwilling to do anything that would contribute to a more stimulating day.
good,"Fun team to work with, got to know customers on a personal first name basis. Fun team activities. Hardest part of the job is remembering all the accounts and products."
good,"I enjoyed working with my team, it was my second family. My manager was nice and helpful. Training took place in a different facility than your branch."
good,I will give an assessment as soon as a future employer asks.  I'm willing to stay with Wells Fargo or go to a different employer.  Trying to find a position in mortgage.
good,"Working and adapting to US culture"
good,"The typical work day at Wells Fargo Dealer Services, the division of Wells Fargo where I was eight hours a day, which included two evenings a week.  We were also required to work 8:00 to 12:00 two Saturdays a month.  I did not find this work schedule to be stressful or an encroachment on my life outside of work."
good,"a typical day was from 8 to 5. "
good,"I started at WF as a temporary Accounting Specialist.  After seeing my potential, I was hired on full-time.  One year later I was promoted to an Operation Accountant.  This company recognizes talent and rewards them for showing that talent."
good,"Good place to work with job security.     Good people and work culture. People who are willing to work in bank, this is the right place to work over here."
good,"It's a place where will learn to survive and manage stress in order to make sales, it is fast paced, sales goals are high, however it is a good school."
good,"Wells Fargo is working hard to implement change and I love their efforts to listen to team members. The benefits are fantastic and hard to find anywhere else. "

good,"I liked working as a vault teller for wells fargo bank i liked talking to the customers , the part of the job i did not like was the intense situation of having to make the quotas of referring products"
good,"Basically, went to work, clocked in, went to scheduled breaks and lunches, clocked out and went home.Working there taught me a lot about how to manage money and how to sustain or gain a good credit score. The employees were very divers there. Different cultures, different race of people, which made it a great place to work. The job was pretty much an easy job. Th e hardest thing was maybe keeping up with the different policies, because they constantly changed but Wells was good at informing there employees on what we should know. In fact, they had their own troubleshooting sites, which had tons of information. Wells always did things for their employees to try and better the work enviroment so we could create the best experience for their customers."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Great team collaborations and tons of room for growth and development if you work hard and stay consistent. There are also many ways to grown within the entire company.
good,collected documents from borrowers. locked in rates...processed loans for underwriting..gathered conditions...made sure loans closed on time...had to pass Quality control.
good,"Wells Fargo has been proactive in changing their culture from sales to customer focused.  During the last year of this change, it has become slower paced and has allowed our customer facing employees to spend more time with their customers and gain a deeper relationship with them.  This culture shift was not yet apparent within Wells Fargo Home Mortgage as their Home Mortgage Consultants are 100% commission based.  It was still encouraged to be top sales performers and active within the community to develop new business.  More and more responsibility was put on HMCs in the areas of compliance, underwriting guidelines and regulations which is understandable in current times of government regulation of the mortgage industry."

good,A typical day at Wells Fargo was pretty slow in terms of business.  Most of time was spent studying for audits and walking through the proper practices for transactions.  I learned how to properly recognize fraudulent transactions that were attempted electronically as well as in person.  The most challenging part of this job was teaching each person that I came in contact with that I was to mentor.  The management team seemed to be great in the beginning of my time here but near the end their attention seemed to fade away.
good,"Working in Capital Markets, can be fast paced, but I enjoy it. Proud to be apart of the Shared Services Team that sits in Charlotte, NC. The usual work week is 46 hours."

II came back to WF after being laid off. and was only there 6 months when the company decided to shut down my team, ending in another round of layoffs.  I did make a couple of bucks of the severance package, so I guess it worked out in my favor."

The hardest part was dealing with customers who were demanding and difficult, but I managed to find a solution that was fair and reasonable. IN that case, I was able to retain a customer for the bank. That job was a learning experience in many ways, including how to deal with overly demanding people."
good,great company to work for very flexible sales goals were overwhelming but no complaints otherwise great managers and great company. dedicated 5 years to this company.
good,"The days were always busy, which is expected of a bank branch. Management would made sure that everyone was in high spirits and motivated to succeed. Many of the branch customers were regular patrons, so trying to ""sell"" them on different products was difficult."

good,I learned a lot about the industry working for Wells Fargo Advisors.  It was generally a good place to work.  My last manager was amazing.  Unfortunately the pay was not impressive.
good,"Working at WF had its really fun and memorable moments. The staff/team and management were like family.  We all cared about eachother. Then over time that changed.  Everyone was out for themselves. A lot of favoritism in the branch.  Others were treated differently and unfairly.  When you did something really good it went unnoticed, and then when you made a minor mistake management made a big deal about it.  You also had to be very phony with customers.... you could not say things in your own words. You would be told how to speak to a customer. You had to be very careful the way you worded stuff. WF offers great medical benefits, vacation time, and a lot more benefits.  You can get really good bonuses if you do well on shops and balancing.  Overall, it was a great place to work. If you are eager you can advance very easily."

good,"Overall, working for Wells Fargo was pretty nice. I liked the benefits they gave me as a teller, such as discounts on my phone bill and discounts on gifts, and other things in that category. However, when you are short on money and there is absolutely no overtime, it was pretty difficult. To me, sales goals was really a bit much, too. I felt a little pressured, to be honest. I felt that some people would actually take the competition a little too seriously. At the end of the day, it was all about trying to help the customer, not force them to take something they don't want or need. Seeing the positive customers and having government holidays off were some of my favorite reasons for working at Wells Fargo. Overall, without the extras of work responsibilities, Wells Fargo is a pretty nice company."

good,"In the few years that i have worked at Wells Fargo India, i have achieved good growth in career and pay. The opportunities are many but the management and the current culture of cost cutting is playing a spoilsport. Due to this, many people are already on the look out for new jobs elsewhere. But join this company to experience something different."
good,"I worked for Wachovia Bank and we were bought out by Wells Fargo Bank.  Wachovia was a great place to work, plenty of opportunity for advancement and training."
good,"I had an amazing manager and in fact I cried when I turned in my resignation to her,  Originators are basically paid on a draw and the pay was too inconsistent."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,recently Wells Fargo Bank is shifting their objectives from sales goals which were steep to a growth approach. It is a relief to not have to sell but can focus on whats most important to the customer and help them achieve their financial goals. Will encounter all types of customers and helping each and every single customer is what is immensely gratifying.
good,"Competition in the workplace can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, a competitive environment can spur coworkers to continual improvement, using each other's performances as inspiring yardsticks. On the other hand, workplace competitiveness can pit coworkers against one another, creating stress and defensiveness."
good,"Fun, Challenging, lots to learn, competitive, relaxed, co workers werent very nice, they didnt work as a team.  I enjoyed that I learned alot. "

I learned a lot working for this company about mortgages and bankruptcy and there were always room for advancement, I did a total of 5 jobs while I was there. And it is a pretty relaxed company to work for as long as you are on time for work."

good,"Wells Fargo is given a bad rep for there past troubles ."
good,"My typical day as Wellsfargo would start off by a brief huddle every day with my team with my manager. This is our time to ask questions pertinent to the job, hear updates on any procedural changes, be notified of any specific tasks that would need to be completed by EOB. Once  a month, we have a team activity where each team member has the opportunity to lead our group in a team building activity. Sometimes we stay on site and sometimes we go offsite. This is a great time for the team to relax and get to know each other and it also helps the team stronger. The hardest part of my job is working the payment tool. We've only had it for about a year and it's difficult trying to figure out the issues because the payments are entered in by another department and sometimes they are messed up and it takes a lot of time to correct the errors.  Other than that, we have a layed back environment. Everyone knows what is expected of them. You do your job, follow the rules, make your best attempt to get it right the first time, and ask questions when needed."
good,I enjoyed my experiences at Wells Fargo. I good chance of seeing how a company deals with employees and how they support them as well.  I enjoyed my stay at Wells.

I began in the loan funding department. To the Loan processing environment . Next to the IT help desk. Then Production Batch Support. Then CA product administrator. Then Bank Programming.
good,Banking was a good job for home life. Only job in my career where the work did not carry over to home life. Type of work that never infringed on home life.
good,The culture was a huge part of wellsfargo success. I changed positions and I'm more of a motivator and being involved into the agents works as much as possible switching fields didn't allow me to reach my full potential.
good,I was always kept busy and I enjoyed the people I worked with. I like working in the new card data entry area. It was quick paced but you had plenty of time to get your work done. I wish it would not have been temporary. I would have loved to stay in this position as a full-time employee.
good,"Wells Fargo has gone through much scrutiny over the last year or so , part of it was Senior Management and cultural issues that I believe are finally being addressed.  I always enjoyed adding value and that is what I focused on in my role and had I not been displaced I would still be with the company."

good,A typical day at work includes completing 80 credit card fraud claims. I've learned how do make good decisions rather the charges are fraud or non-fraud. Management is very professional and the culture is business professional. The hardest part of the job is determining whether the charges are fraud. The enjoyable part of the day is fellowshipping amongst my peers.
good,"At the location I am currently at, the management and team members are relaxed, easy to get along with, and knowledgeable about their positions and are willing to help each other out if and when it's necessary. I get to see many of the same regular customers, who enjoy coming in to see us as much as we enjoy talking to them. I'm lucky to be at the branch that I am."
good,"With all the bad publicity that Wells Fargo is having, it had made business harder and harder to come by. Everyone watches the news and probably is affected by WF's bad eggs."

good,I truly have enjoyed working here.  The culture and the team that I work for are awesome. I actually get up in the morning and am excited to go into work.  Managers are awesome they expect you to grow and make a name for yourself.  They made it to where I could do a second part time job so they let me work from home or on my hrs as long as 8 hrs where worked they are happy.  Every day I learn something new.
good,"Underpaid position. Worked with customers, underwriters, authorized 3rd parties, and managers. The ""politics"" in the organization are a bit skewed. It's not always about what you know but who you know. Overall was a great ""starter"" position but had to leave the company because the pay was too low to cover daycare expenses."
good,"It was a temporary job for me, so I do not really have a say in it. Just feel that  the company has a big company culture that treats the employees really well."
good,"Wells Fargo have a happy environment, it is now focusing on helping and stablishing more our customer relationships, always making sure the customer's priority is the number one priority. It is no longer based on sales incentives. I have learned more skills to help customers and bring a good customer services, and at the same time to develop some management skills. The hardest part probably was to overcome customer's perception about the company after the whole scandal came out to light, trying to preserve in good reputation our brand's name."

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work outside of the call center. I had the best manager and leadership. The pay is okay but they should pay more for the position as a Retirement Specialist.

good,The retail side was not enjoyable. I was not surprised by the sales gaming that was exposed. Moving to a back office position felt like working for a new and better company. Everyone is friendly and eager to help which is great since the training is not well organized. Wells Fargo provides a lot of PTO. Advancement opportunities are always available but it's up to you to work for it.

This entailed validating income and credit reconciliation as well as logic from the previous underwriter.

There was a company buy out and it went from Norwest Bank to Wells Fargo which brought a lot of new changes, some good and some not so good.  I was a teller with the bank and I truly enjoyed my job.  The sales requirements played a major part of your job requirements.  If you didn't make your goals there was a very good chance you would lose your job.  I was a single parent with one income and I need job security.  I know now that the sales have been changed immensely in the last year.  It is something I would consider going back to."

My most enjoyable moment was working as a loan processor. Seeing that I have a gift of being detailed oriented. It made it easy to look at various of documents on a daily basis for era's to assure that they are compliant to the comapany's policies before sending the file to underwriting. Although being a processor had its perks one of the hardest things was denying a customer because they could not provide the documentation that was needed. For those who have knowledge of the mortgage industry know that at times it can be a lengthy process. So for a customer to go through the process and have to get turned away because they could not provide what was needed to proceed can be saddening. Throughout my whole expierence working at Wells Fargo I've learned that there will always be change whether good or bad and it's your responsibility to adapt to the change so you won't fall behind.

good,"My role as a personal banker was to take care of my customers providing solutions to their financial needs always asking questions on what was important to them to be able to help them succeed on whatever financial goal the customer had. In the ten years that I worked for Wells Fargo I learned a lot from the company itself, from my manager, co workers and customers. I learned that the best feeling is not reaching your sales goal but the feeling of being able to help your customer through the different options we had for them whether it was a loan a credit card or just to set up their direct deposit. My co workers also made a difference on my daily routine, I was lucky enough to work with very enthusiastic people that it rather felt like a family. The hardest part of my job was to decline customers for a loan when they had family emergencies or were struggling financially I always wanted to do more but there was only so much I could do. At the end of every day the most rewarding feeling was to know that I had made a difference for my customers.

Then check the company-wide mailbox if any of those affect forecasting or actual costs to your projects. Check personal and TOG mailbox 3 or 4 times a day to make sure immediate needs are met and accounted for. Check in MS Office to see if there are any scheduled meetings for specific projects and prepare/anticipate questions that might be raised and be able to answer quickly and with confidence. I had to set up meetings at least twice monthly with all PMs, once for forecasts and the other for actuals. Once forecasts start coming in for specific projects, I would put them in my Project Spreadsheet with macros which rolled up costs by AUs (billing units). Then would go into the master time keeping system called STAMP and enter the information in there as well. The Project Spreadsheet and STAMP would have to be within $5-$10 when actual costs came in on the next billing cycle. Added and subtracted resources to make sure the correct people are recording time to my specific projects. When the Project Managers call/lync/email questions, had to respond quickly to their requests to make sure they were staying on budget for their projects. Every week and on demand, we had Weekly Status, Line of Business, Full Year Forecasts, Full Year Actuals, and Monthly Reports to run and give to the Project Managers on a timely basis."

I had great support staff at the branches that tried to help and find leads to meet sales goals for the branch and for me.  I had a lot of training opportunities also.
good,"This was a great place to work with plenty of advancement opportunities. The banking operations process was very interesting and always developing better strategies and technology. I really enjoyed the innovation and applications of new ideas that employees shared to make the company better.

However, there was a slow rate to no new job development in the company's locations where they eliminated jobs due to upgrades."
good,"Great work place with supportive colleagues and managers. People are willing to answer any questions and always available. It's a big company and office politics are to be expected.

good,"Answering calls from customers and helping them with their accounts.  I learned different kind of customer service skills based on the customers I was taking care of.  Management was 50/50 some were very helpful. My co-workers were all great.  The hardest part of my job was the communication, we were told to ask for help when on a long call because they wanted our call times to be under 4 minutes, but not everyone was willing to help.  The best part of my day was knowing I helped my customers and made their day better."

good,"Wachovia, now Wells Fargo is an amazing chain to work for.  They treat their employees with respect, allow room for advancement, and provide convenient hours.  However, if you start out as part time, there is no way to move up to full time unless a position opens, and you have to apply for it.  On the plus side, there was a set schedule, so mixing between work and personal life was very easy.  The co-workers were great, and thoroughly enjoyed time there"
good,"Great place to start off career, working for wells fargo gives anyone the opportunity to grow develope for their future"

good,"Participated in a structured commercial banking summer associate program, which included a full week of credit training. I gained exposure to debt products and evaluated the creditworthiness of companies in the $20MM-$500MM range in terms of revenue using credit metrics such as operating and cash flow leverage, fixed charge coverage, liquidity and profitability ratios."
good,great for opportunity or growth either within the company or outside it.

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"It was a great place to work for the benefits and the co-workers were also nice . But, sometimes you felt more like a number then a person and they cared more about money then working for the customer."
good,"You can expect to face a ton of sales pressure and daily goals to help management reach bonus payouts. We have a strong expectation to maintain perfect customer service with every customer. It really becomes a family over time and I loved the people that I worked with and management was great. I enjoyed the customers and the experience that I learned at Wells Fargo, but the focus on sales is what I liked the least. I would be a banker with no bonuses if it meant I could still help customers succeed financially."
good,greeting customers and building long lasting relationships with both the customers and coworkers.  Assisted customers with their financial needs and gave advise of what the next step should be. Best part of working there is being able to have the friendship with coworkers and being able to help each other with motivation.

good,Great workplace and there is opportunity to grow with the company.
good,"Great Compliance Guidelines"
good,i enjoyed working at wells fargo in the financial sector. it was a great job until they started promoting slackers to management positions while ignoring my requests to be transferred. overworked and not enough recognition.
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo was answering up to 100 inbound calls per day from customers inquiring about their accounts.  I serviced both consumer and business accounts while offering new products and services to ensure that the customers needs were met.  I learned how to service quickly and accurately, listen for clues, recommend products or services that helps the customer save time and money while following policies, procedures and regulations.  The management team was very attentive and easy to talk to. They always encouraged us to give our best and to advance within the company.  My co-workers were very supportive and vibrant as it could be complicated when meeting company goals and expectations.  The hardest part of the job was when a customer wanted to close their account on behalf of something that was out of our control.  I always tried my best to retain the customer by empathizing, correcting the mistake, and offering solutions to avoid conflicting situations.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my progress through the stats and ICP calculator which involved a quarterly bonus."
good,I took calls on a daily basis assisting customers with their accounts and also offered them products and services that would help the customers as well as the bank. Co-workers were very friendly and all the supervisors were very helpful if needed. I loved earning extra cash for putting in a little extra effort. I would say the hardest part would've been having to learn all the products and services but as time went by it became second nature. This job really taught me discipline and patience and made me want to try harder each day to move up and grow with the company.

good,"Wells Fargo for me was a great learning experience. From the diversity of the co-workers to the customers, you gain a insight on what it truly means to have customer service. The fast paced enviroment, is managable; the high volume of customers should only excite you, not scare you. A GREAT COMPANY TO GROW WITHIN. very big on sales, the key to achieving that is, yes you've guessed; Great Service."
good,A typical day at Wells Fargo was go in with a mind set to win and reach your goal. The hardest part of the job was walking away without meeting your goal. The most exciting part of a day at Wells were the customers. They made your day.

I educate if we are different and go over what they may be missing in their process. I also do special projects given to me by my manager and complete them quickly as needed, but always push to complete before deadline. My manager is absolutely the greatest. She supports me and gives me tremendous advise. She guides me in the direction of where I want to be. That is climb the corporate ladder as high as possible. My co-workers/team members rely on my knowledge and skills. I train as I was trained to always be effecient, productive and if you need to ask questions, ASK!!!. The harderst part of my job sometimes is dealing with the attorneys and their staff. They love to question or truthfully want us to do their job. That can be alittle frustrating. Most enjoyable is my team members, manager and truthfully the knowledge I learn on a daily basis. In the bankruptcy world things can change in a second, so you need to be able to adapt. Knowledge is power!!!!"

good,I typically helped customers when they come into the bank for transactions. I learned how to manage money better. Management was fair and co-workers were easy and fun to work with. Hardest part was dealing with angry customers and learning how not to lose my cool. Enjoyable part was that the people I worked with was like a family and we helped each other when we were in need.
good,"We would answer incoming calls pertaining to a new or existing claim where we would issue credit, submit charge backs, and decision claim if necessary. Co-workers are friendly and helpful."
good,"A typical day at work was always varied depending on the nature of the client and how the person maintained their finances and the nature of the type of transaction the person was looking for, a purchase of a new home or refinancing their existing home.  The day usually started preparing the files to go to the underwriting department for review after the necessary validation of the client's information. I have learned that although the mortgage climate has changed drastically over the years with the requirements needed. people still need to be treated as their file is the most important.  At times this can be difficult when the client show no regards for you or  anything else but his own information and at these times it may require we give this customer some additional needed care to feel appreciated.  Although working in the mortgage industry for years but work is still customer service and administrative based as we provided this service for each of our clients to get their loans closed,  I have worked with the company 11 years and 11 months with a good manager and team workers and since I have worked with the same individuals throughout the years we have developed a close work environment."

I had many chances to advance and to grow within the company.  A new challenge every day.  There was always something different that would happen with the work and you learned something everyday.
good,No longer in business.  This was a family owned and operated business .
good,"I started with Wachovia with the promise that I could move up within the company. My first and only location was in a supermarket branch with I did enjoy the staff who worked there. I approached my year and looked to move up and was told that I had to go to a traditional branch first for one year and could move up. Therefore, I already had 1 year and the company said that I couldn't move up without experience in a traditional branch. They lied to me from the beginning but I did attempt to apply for a traditional branch but wasn't getting any call backs. I even spoke to the regional and branch managers but no luck. I ended up going to PNC Bank where I made things happen for myself through hard-work, dedication and happy with the culture. Wachovia was my first job out of college so I did gain some experience in the banking world where I am still today. If I learned anything, you have to work-hard, and show exactly why you should be promoted through meeting your numbers, relationships and flexibility."
good,Signing onto the desktop to answer both internal and external customers inquiries. Cross selling banking products that might serve the customers needs. I learned my great listening skills and analytical thinking. Although I worked independently I was also a part of a great team. The hardest part of my job was not having an office window.

I then review with the team the successes for the day. "

This was followed by reviewing documentation to clear outstanding stipulations previously decisioned loan applications.  We attended an underwriting meeting every Wednesday to be kept abreast of any new credit policy changes, trends, best practices, etc.   Each underwriting team had a team lead who led a ""huddle"" 3 times a week for a 'pulse check'.  The co-workers were really a good group of people.  We really did work as a team and supported each other.  The hardest part of the job was when there were multiple priorities that all needed to be resolved quickly.   The part of my job that I liked the most was analyzing data and formulating a strategy to work out a problem.  It was good to learn new things and then apply them to my ""new"" daily work."

good,"A job that is simple but horribly boring and non- satisfactory. I was raised in a non- complaint family, so this is a bit harsh from me. The people here are nice, the management is nice- everyone means well. However, your work as a collector is tedious, and if you get adjusted quickly- boring and non- rewarding. The systems are easy to understand, and people you speak with are not too angry about their situation. The job does not stress you out if you can handle an occasional hang up and mean language, and if you're okay with the repetition. There won't be anything new, you will come into the office and leave the same way you came in. It is nice, it is consistent. However, if you're looking for something that will challenge you and make coming into work worth something more than a paycheck, this position is most likely not it. Advancement is shady- typically takes 2 years to advance to supervisor positions, and there are certain positions that seem untouchable (don't try to be a trainer as there is only one and the position is essentially sealed). Raises every 6 months with good performance, and nice incentives as long as you do your job."
good,"Wells Fargo was an exciting place to work. A typical day would include answering calls, self monitoring your stats, peer coaching, games against other teams. Surprisingly, i learned a lot from Wells Fargo to things i would of never known about banking, what the company offers as far as products and services, and how to provide stellar customer service. Working at Wells was probably my first ""real"" job in such a professional,supportive environment. Although i have nothing bad to say about the job, the management is not all that special when you first get the job everyone is supportive, encouraging, and pushes you to succeed but once you hit the floor most of the managers don't ever have time, unless your the kind of person who likes being trained through emails. It really is just all depending on who you get as a supervisor, other then that i have no complaints."
good,A typical day for this position consisted of constant time on the phone and high volume calls. I enjoyed my co-workers and management would do their best to help me succeed. The hardest part of the job is sitting on the phone for 8 hours a day with little room to move.

good,"have a healthy environment"
good,Excellent company to work for with great benefits. It is a great place to start a career.
good,"Wells Fargo was an excellent company.  Busy post room, heavy workload, but an enjoyable environment. Worst part of work was large building, with sometimes heavy parcels to deliver."
good,"My workday starts at 7:30 AM and ends at 3:30 PM.  I carry a blackberry so I take work ‘on-the-go’ to address outstanding emails.  I also dial into meetings that are scheduled during various time zones.  There are also times that I schedule my own meetings to accommodate various time zones as well.  Each workday varies from the last.  Between meetings, consulting, problem solving, etc., I tackle my ‘desk work’ and make time to connect with my management, team, and business partners.  I rarely take a lunch.  I’m usually working through the lunch hour.  When working within a tight deadline, work comes home with me.  I’m constantly juggling numerous tasks within a given day so many of my workdays are multitasked.  I have customized my job work/life balance post my standard ‘office’ hours so it works well for everyone.  I also have the ability to work from home, when necessary, so this too allows me the flexibility to master work/life balance as well."

good,"You are the front lines of the bank, the name and the face that customers remember and the majority of them are great people.  In general everyone you will work with is a good person and you will get to know them well.  But do know that this is a sales position and that you will be expected to make high marks to receive compensation.  Management is under just as much pressure as you are to make sure these goals are met but they have leverage on you, mainly in the form of their title and time with the company."
good,Great place to learn and work after graduation or while in school
good,"Company provided training and educational means for completing required licensing."
good,At my current position I find it very rewarding because I get to deal with the general public and I am also able to develop subordinates.

good,"I started working at Wells Fargo Home Equity as a Funder and after 3 years I was promoted to a Quality Assurance Analyst! I would review funded loans and confirm that they were compliant, met with supervisors to go over the reviewed loans. I learned a lot at Wells Fargo, first I knew nothing about the loan industry when I started and Wells Fargo gave me a chance to learn and I ended up moving up to an analyst. This company was one of the first companies (Nationwide Insurance was another) I worked at that hired me without knowledge of the industry, gave me a chance and saw a potential in me to help me grow. I enjoyed the people I worked with and having managers that listened to my thoughts and concerns and were a huge help in moving my career in a very positive and growing turn. I learned that I really enjoy analyzing and that I am extremely detailed oriented."

good,"Great introduction to customer service, systems, and personalities"
good,Work day was flexible. I learned to keep myself professional. Management were on top of the game. very nice and helpful co-workers. standing longer period of time was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable is the exchanging words with customers.
good,"Learned new things and the co-workers are so cool and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting new projects and teamwork processes, and performance outcomes."
good,"High stress, high volume atmosphere, changing everyday. Enjoyed the fast paced industry."
good,Reviewed loan documents using risk assesment knowledge to determine if loans pass or fail.
good,Great job while going to school during the day. Compensation is better than many jobs found on college campuses. Your ability to take some abuse from customers is a must.
good,Loved having new things to learn in a fast paced environment. New guidlines and processes to learn each month. Always kept things interesting while processing home loans.
good,I was with this company for many years and was very satisfied with the company
good,Great company to work for but this was a sales job so it was pretty up and down in pay
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company with very good benefits,unfortunately I had to quit due to family tragedy, that I would rather not talk about."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Great company and great benefits. If you are looking to join an organization and see yourself excel and move up, this is the place to be."

good,"Great place to work if you are into Philadelphia sports, if you just want a quick job do not work here. They are part of a Union!"
good,A day at Wachovia was always different. From the many locations I floated to the people are all different in the many areas of Charlotte. I learned to evolve and consistently help all people with their account transactions. I enjoyed making friends with co-workers through out the Charlotte area. The hardest part of the job would have to be helping the usual guest that would enter the bank. If they did not know you they would not typically want your help. Earning their trust was a definite struggle when training. Management was very king even in the midst of the merger the bank underwent. The most enjoyable part of this job was socializing with guest and earning their trust to further help them in the future.
good,"A real good place to work at when I was there..."
good,During mortgage boom had a great time in the office.When the market crashed it all ended.Wells Fargo bought Western Sunrise Wholesale Mortgage.The original company who hired me was Western Sunrise.Wells closed that branch of loan servicing and relocated to Arkansas? They closed our office within 2 years.
good,Great company to work for. Benefits are very good and scheduling is flexible for college students.
good,"Fun place to work and great benefits, fast paced environment with good people who support and appreciate your hard work and attention to detail."
good,A great position to get into if you want to start out in the banking industry.... just don't expect to come in a full time or advance through the ranks
good,"I was a Lead Teller for 3 years at Wells Fargo. I had a goal to become a service manager and I was working my way up to it but my spouse took a job offer in another state and the Wells Fargo wasn't located in the area we moved to. I would make sure the teller line was in order with every day transaction with clients, making sure all the audit task was complete for the branch, was in charge of balancing cash vault and coin machine. I would place orders for cash and for working supplies for the branch. I would train the new tellers and coach them with sales. I enjoyed my job and wish I was still employed with Wells Fargo."
good,"I learned a lot about federal laws dealing with banking. I love working with people. It was a lot to learn at first, but I caught on really quick. Hardest part of my job, or the least favorite part would be sales. People can be uncomfortable talking about their finances so it makes it a little harder to sell things, but by building rapport with them you can sometimes get them to open up."
good,Wells Fargo is a good company but the department I worked in was not properly prepared for the growth it experienced. I would be happy to work for them again.
good,"A typical day in this role starts with a strong team morning huddle  beginning with recognition. After recognition we'll go through deliverables for the day including scheduling, sales commitments, service commitments, and month to date performance. Throughout the day it's a lot of client relationship building and helping all who walk through our door become financially successful. Enthusiasm and passion for cleint relationship building customer service is a must to be successful in this role."
good,Great company to work for.  It was challenging to produce sales but overall a rewarding job.
good,Great team members. typical day of work received tickets for day and completed 30 to 40 tickets a day
good,"Aspen, Colorado was a fun and productive place to work....Great customers, co-workers and friends"
good,"Pros: A good place for entry level experience, work incentives, and paid time off. Cons: the mortgage industry isn't very stable"
good,It was great working for a company that embraced the diversity of its employees.
good,Co workers had a can do attitude : staff was friendly and more of family environment willing to assist each other
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Company is very structured, they help and encourage employee growth, good benefits, Wells offers the best customer experience in the industry"
good,Not-so-relaxed environment with very likable co-workers.
good,"Everyday starts with team meetings where we discuss our achievements, opportunities and error analysis."
good,Wells Fargo Private Bank was a great division to be a part of.  It was like a family. I had a wonderful experience and great memories working for the Wells Fargo Private Bank
good,"a typical day of work includes a morning meeting with the store manager delivering sales expectations, followed by service manager 2 asking for your sales numbers (every hour on the hour) followed by service manager 1 asking for your sales numbers (every hour on the hour) followed by the lead teller asking for your sales numbers (every hour on the hour) followed by the customer service sales representative asking for your sales numbers (every hour on the hour). Micro-management ruined my Wells Fargo employee experience;  I sold bronze-level solutions every quarter and it still was NOT good enough for Wells Fargo as a company, or the management.  The most enjoyable part of the career was talking to and developing relationships with customers, who would walk in and ask for me by name.  I learned the virtue of patience."
good,It was a fun work environment.  Everyone on the floor got along well.
good,"Unless you're certain you'll climb the ladder, no matter where you work, or you don't really care for that kind of thing, i can't recommend WFHM in today's economy.  The boom days are over, and they are cutting back. "
good,"I enjoyed my job and had a good work experience with this company,"
good,Wells Fargo has a great team oriented culture.  They have the tools to make sure you succeed at what you wish to do.
good,"Analyze Personal and Commercial account activity, review intricate scenarios to determine the source of compromise on the debit card, then take the appropriate action per Wells Fargo Fraud guidelines"
good,"a typical work day here at wellsfargo was great, working in a fast pace environment and establishing a connection with the customers. What I learned there was how to work together with other team players, being knowledgable of what your selling is very important. The most enjoyable part of this jobs was being able to network with other bankers an to be given advice from tenant bankers there."
good,Fast paced mortgage business that strives to provide excellent customer service.
good,No review to provide at this time except for the summary above.
good,Wells Fargo is great employer with many opportunities. The company does not have as many opportunties in the Columbia area.
good,"Wells Fargo was a very stressful atmosphere. Everyday I would be responsible for taking a minimum of 45 calls. It was a sales position, so majority of incentive was based on sales quotas. The hardest part of the job was not signing off the computer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay."
good,"My day consisted of interacting with new and existing customers. Customer service consisted of account maintenance, answering questions, educating customers on consumer/ business accounts, loans/ lines of credit, savings, time accounts, etc. The sales involved acquiring new business and consumer clients, and cross selling all products and services. I also worked together with Wells Fargo partners to maximize other sales opportunities such as insurance, merchant services, payroll services, etc. My manager coached and worked together with the team for the overall success of the branch."
good,"Great place to work, involved in the employees and community, excellent pay and room for advancement."
good,"Very career driven company, great place to advance, very involved in the community and excellent pay."
good,I truly enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo.  The job was fast paced and had its challenges.  The only real drawback is that it is a very large company and some choices are made based on insignificant numbers rather than actual performance.  The management at the work site was the best you could look for.
good,The particular job I had was micro-managed and was unfulfilling.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,wellsfargo is a good place to work for my co-workers was very nice to me
good,A typical day for me was a consistant processing of brokerage accounts. I learned to manage IRA accounts. Management was fair and impartial. Co-workers were team players. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the different time zones for completion of work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the company always showed their appreciation through food days and casual dress down days.
good,Great atmosphere with management and co workers working hand in hand to achieve one team one goal
good,"Giving great customer services, working with your team and learning new customer service skills"
good,I built and maintained various internal and external relationships that increased selling opportunities.
good,"onsite training was fun with a competitive edge, great team atmosphere"
good,Iv'e been working here for 9 years and I like my job and the people I work with
good,"great business/professional work experience"
good,"Working at Wells Fargo definitely gave me a sense of accomplishment and made me hold myself to higher esteem. The workplace was clean, organized and in my opinion was the best place to practice sales technique. Once you sell at Wells Fargo, you can sell anything! During the workday, you have to balance a till and hit a sales quota. As the teller, every sale you get is created by your conversation and relationship building with customers. Customer service is taken very seriously because random surveys are made to your clients and if you do not get a perfect score, you fail. 99% doesnt cut it and you face discipline for missing one point. Which makes your customer service superb by the time you leave Wells."
good,"I establish a priority list of things to accomplish. Priority A, B and C. Priority A contains must do items. Things that will be more difficult if not prioritize first or substantially completed. I let nothing get in the way of starting and completing these. Priority B is very important, too. I make every attempt to complete these. However, priority B items can be somewhat negotiated if not completed. Priority C items are those maintenance things that should be done but won't affect operations much if not necessarily done that day. Sometimes priority C items take care of themselves. The important key to success is to accurately identify the proper category of priority."
good,great company environment a lot of customer care service required.  Learn to make cross reference sale while securing money transaction.
good,"I have learned a lot of banking thru my company Wells Fargo because of the helpful staff. They want you to be successful and promoted within with many applicants/co workers. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with the goals Wells Fargo give us, but with teamwork we all make it to where we need to be successful in the company."
good,"taking in bound and calling out bound to customer with concerns about mortgages make sure customers receive courteous and professional service answer all esclated call this is a day at wells fargo. a day with at@t for 32 yrs had various jobs customer service, sell phone equipment, took phones order worked in repair sold phone equipment collection and many other duties"

good,"Enjoyed my job from when it was World Saving, Wachovia and now Wells Fargo. In all my 20 years I have to say I did enjoyed every minute of it... I missed only 2 days and one time 5 minutes tardy. I learned a lot thru my processing times, did everything I had to learn and challenge new tasks to move up. As a Manager, learned how to handle my roll as a leader and a manager. Having to do payroll, hiring/firing, one on one with my staff which were 6-8 employees. Making sure they all got the same treatment and guide them thru their careers. As a go to person, other departments depended on our services to help them with research, payment processing, encoding errors, missing payments and with electronic payments. The team worked very well together to solve the issues. The hardest part of my job was letting one of my employees tell them they had a hygiene problem that needed to be taken care off. And the most enjoyable was when I received the President's Award."
good,"A typical day would just consist of reviewing loans, the co-workers were decent upstanding people, most were enjoyable to work with and easy to get along with.  There was conflict with few things and most everyone worked together as a team, the hardest part of the day was getting used to all the changes, but with that type of job that is something that you are going to have to adjust to."
good,"very good place to work, i worked there for 10 years.  very strict on the hours had to work, this division is no longer open"
good,I managed everything from the beginning construction of the building to the selling of the salon and everything in between those 3.5 years.
good,A typical day at work consist of handling transactions and having teller to customer conversations.  I have learned the overall ways of banking such as checking accounts and credit knowledge.  My co-workers are friendly and very much enjoyable people to work with.  The hardest part of my job is getting customers to understand why I can't process a transaction due to banking regulations.  The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know knew customers daily.
good,a typical day at work is very relaxed and quit with minimal supervision. The co workers were very friendly and work as a unit to get goal accomplished.
good,Really enjoyed the culture and the work. There was a geat work life balance
good,I enjoy working at wells fargo because there are many different career opportunities.
good,very good compensation but poor organization and leadership of management

good,I really enjoyed working here. With hard work decent financial gains.
good,"Great company with plenty of business. Pay could be better, co-workers were great."
good,I started on the ground level and was given an opportunity to advance quickly while interest rates were low and their was plenty of business to go around. My co-workers were extreamly helpful while I was learning my new position. I was given a very good environment to flourish.
good,"Wells Fargo was a good company to work for, a work day is fast, always learning something new, co-workers are great"

good,"Always exciting working in the banking industry, very different in comparison to the travel industry."
good,"good company."
good,the benefits I've had with wells fargo was probably the best I've had. I had 23 days of paid vacation a year.  the medical benefits and 401k package is very good as well.
good,"This company is great to work for with common shared values, but sales goals to extreme"
good,"On average our day would go by so fast since we where inside a Thomb Thumbs Location customers would always keep us busy with questions, problems or issues with debit cards, or just wanting to open a checking or a savings account was common.  The staff and manager where awesome and every one worked as a team, so that was fun about the job, the hardest part of the job was keeping every customer happy, the most exciting part of the job for me was building rapport with my customers and keeping them happy."
good,"I worked at the Wachovia Service Center in Wilkesboro, NC.  While it was there, the management was great!  Easy to get along with all my co workers - the benefits for working part time was amazing as well."
good,"I assist multiple Loan Officers with VA, FHA and Conventional Purchase and Refi loan transactions. I have direct and constant communication with the Borrower, Realtors and Underwriters throughout the loan process from set-up to closing. Order appraisal, credit reports, flood, title and insurance. Compile and distribute spreadsheets for management in their absence."
good,"Accessing all systems, checking voice messages, checking voicemail, returning and replying to all messages"
good,"Wells Fargo's main goal is to help customers succeed financially. Therefore, we need to provide the right solutions for the clients using the many products that we offer. Depending on which wells fargo you are at, you might care more about your sales than your clients. This means that you will push product down a client, when they don't need it, just to meet your goals. Yes we have sales goals. The branch I work at is sales driven but not if the client is not in need of those specific products. This means, we don't offer you a credit card unless we see you need it for emergencies or to start building credit. We don't offer you loans unless it will help you lower your interest payments and possibly pay it off faster. We don't offer you accounts unless they will help you save money in the long run. At our branch, we aren't product pushers, we are financial consultants for our clients."
good,Good work envirornment with adavncement opportunites. Management was always available to asisst.
good,A great company with a lot of opportunities to learn and grown
good,"Typical day began at 8:30; I was really just working alone at a desk looking at imaged mortgage loan files, making sure everything was there and that all legal requirements were met by the lender & borrower. I'd enter data into a data-collection application, essentially contributing to a profile of pertinent information from the loan. Review typically took 20-40 minutes to look at every document and enter all the important data. Typically I'd do 10-15 a day. It was fairly difficult to learn the review process at first, and the company had high production and accuracy expectations, but in time I became more and more experienced with it and made fewer errors. "
good,"Daily I take about 70-95 calls a day. I have learned that something exciting can happen each and everyday. I have learned how to manage a team of new hires, who are learning a new job, and details about how to do their job and do it well. I work with co-workers everyday to make sure that our team is the top team in the site. Typically the hardest part of the day is to maintain exceeding the daily goals each and every hour. The most enjoyable part of the day is when the day is over and I can see the accomplishment that was made."
good,"I have enjoyed the near 5 years I have worked for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.  The work is challenging and demanding, but it's extremely rewarding to be a part of the homebuying experience.  There are lots of opportunities to learn and they have a great benefit package with 401k matching and stock plans.  It can feel like family but unfortunately when numbers are down then you realize how big the company is because the focus is on the bottom line.  Such is the story with most large corporations.  But overall I would say that I have grown a lot at this company both personally and professionally and I don't regret the time I spent here."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Great Managers that are willing to listen.  It seems like they really have your back.
good,"interacting with new people on a day to day basis, problem solving, etc..."
good,"A typical work day starts with clean up; catching up on all the e-mails and phone calls I'm missed in the 15 hours since I left my desk. I address important items right away then take a big picture look at my workload and prioritize accordingly."
good,As a mortgage company sometimes it becomes difficult to maintain certain offices or departments. It's very understandable. I enjoyed working for such a diverse company.
good,"A normal day would start with a huddle, which we would discuss the previous days performance and what today's commitments and appointments are. After the huddle depending on traffic we would either engage in cold calling or we would assist tellers with customer interactions.This provided us an opportunity to get the customer to sit down to discuss financial priorities and possible make a recommendation based on their needs. It was always great to see someone succeed financially based on something I was able to assist them with. I was very focused on my team so whatever was needed whether it was assisting the manager with coaching or performing maintenance on the ATM I was always willing."
good,Wells Fargo is a great company. The position of being a collector just was not the correct fit for me.
good,Each day I went in it was busy either for the bank or for me personally. I loved to get things done and loved to show that I got something done at the end of the day. I updated my managers on progress and I also kept everyone in the loop about everything. I think the hardest thing about my job was when the audit people came to check up on us I knew that we would be okay but I would still be a nervous wreck. It is a very serious thing and I felt so responsible for it. I loved dealing with the public. I met so many people while working at the bank and I loved everyone that I came in contact with. It was so much fun to get to know them and I couldn't have asked for a better opportunity.
good,Friendly and fair management staff. Flexible and prompt. Good place to work.
good,I worked in a productive environment. Management was very supportive in providing the tools needed to perform daily tasks.
good,"enjoy working for this company, Everyone welcomed me to the company and we all fell like family. My manager gives constructive criticism and she is always there when i need her. She has taught me well mannered customer service skills. I cant think of anything that i consider as being hard but the most enjoyable part is meeting people and help satisfying their financial needs"
good,"okay place to work, but no benefits and long hours,  and to much driving around"
good,"Consistently met monthly quota each and every month"
good,"Typical day very busy prospecting for mortgage business, following up on leads, attending meetings, phone conferences, etc"
good,Everyday is challenging and rewarding!! My team was involved and helpful.
good,"Excellent co-workers in a sales driven environment. Taking calls in an inbound call center setting from service bankers with leads. My job was to thoroughly profile our customers to find additional needs besides the initial referral. Helping customers was the most enjoyable part of my job. The most challenging aspect was dealing with customers that we just couldn't help. Management was very helpful in providing tips, counseling, and best practices to sales bankers. Learned a lot about the financial industry."
good,The atmosphere was always pleasant and co-workers were compassionate and focused.  Very busy atmosphere and excellent business skills.  Management was constantly involved and very supportive. It's ashame I had to leave.
good,Wellsfargo is a wonderful place to work. The pay is great and the supervisors really help you to advance in the company. The co-workers are awesome people to work with.
good,"Overall great place management needs to be reviewed Employees are wonderful, plenty of room for advancement. Meet new people everyday and get to help them out."
good,"Cashing checks, loan payments, deposits, answering phones, etc"
good,I enjoyed assisting customers with their transaction and being able to fit certain products that will help with their financial needs.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I was a teller; so my main job was to process transactions. For example process deposits, withdrawals, cashiers check; but at the same time i was responsible for my sales goals which required talking to clients to upgrade there accounts."
good,"I would typically receive inbound calls from home mortgage customers whose lines of credit or loans were in the process of maturing; I would let customers know of the options.  I learned about the mortgage industry....lines of credit, loans, etc. The management was very supportive and my co-workers were helpful as well. The most difficult part of the job was learning to toggle between multiple applications while explaining what is going on with a customer's line of credit, but the most enjoyable part was helping people."
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. The pay is very great and very diverse envoirnment
good,"- Reviewed prior shift's reports and numbers"
good,"Great people, Great Company. Great Benefits. This company cares alot about its employees and Customers."
good,Reviewed loans independently; received feedback at the end of the month on quality
good,"Steady work for responsible employees, good mix of cultures and nationalities, co-workers very respectful and good-humored.Lots of cross-training available if you are interested in additional options."
good,A typical day at work can last anywhere from 12-14 hours when the housing market is up. Stress levels are high but the employers are there to help out during the busy times. You must be very organized to keep up with your workload and must be able to adapt to change quickly. You must also be able to manage and understand several different programs that are used on a daily bases. Going above and beyond to help out a client who is in a tough financial situation is very rewarding in itself. A big part of your job is acheiving top marks on a survey that is filled out by your clients so it is very important to maintain a personal relationship with each individual. Customer service is a key factor in the business.
good,"A typical day at work would be receiving files to close and working with a lot of friendly and helpful people. In the mortgage field things would get intense at times, but that is the nature of mortgage. People were always helpful and enjoyed going to work everyday and helping customers achieve refinancing their homes. I was always happy when we were able to help our customers."

good,"I have worked for Wells Fargo for almost 10 months now, and it truly has been a great company to work for. Recently; however, due to rising interest rates they have had to do significant cut backs. Over 2,300 people were put on a 60 day notice. This means that on the 19th of October all 2,300 people will be laid off, including myself. The entire site here in Birmingham, Al is going to be completely closed. I have truly enjoyed my time here and loved what I did."
good,Wells Fargo is a dynamic place to work with. It is a fast paced environment with a set goal accomplished at the end of the day. Management had given me an opportunity to expand my knowledge in all areas of operation starting with accounts payable to accounts receivable. The company had give me the opportunity to learn other areas outside of my current responsibility as Cash Application Specialist. I developed strong communication and relationship skills. Consistently exceeded expectations in all tasks given and was recognized for them. I acted as backups to co workers in their absence. The hardest part of the job is when I expect too much of myself to be perfect. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see a task complete and perfect.
good,"Tellers help customers with deposits, withdrawals, check cashing and account questions. You have to meet quarterly goal numbers. Which is very hard."
good,Managers and work directors are knowledgeable and happy people. Always willing to teach those who want to learn more and care about your well being.
good,"Great place to work, Flexible schedules, Good for college students"
good,Company has very strong values both for customers and team members.
good,"As a bank teller you get to meet all kinds of people and just in small portions get to know your customer.  Diversity is probably what I got out of meeting so many customers.  Fast paced job, need to be accurate, polite and attentive."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Great working environment, learned something new everyday"
good,"Relocated to Charlotte, NC decided to move back to CA. Fast paced production environment."

good,I learned a great deal of information on how to protect yourself against fraud.
good,The employee's that I worked with in the Settlements Department all were very happy with their working situation. The Management team also had their employee's best interest in mind and valued their input concerning the various job functions.
good,"A typical day at work is very fast-paced which I enjoy. I work in a self-managed, dealine driven department. I've learned how to be a team member, how to work efficiently with people across the country to achieve one goal. I've learned the value of branding. I'm a sales person. My manager is awesome I absolutely have no complains about him. The hardest part of the job is that it's unpredictable. The most enjoyable part of it is that I'm good at it and my co-workers help me make my days less stressful."
good,"Pro's = Many resources available to help grow business. Flexible work hours, work from home capabilities, great benefits, generous compensation package. Cons = Too many bank overlays on products, restrictive underwriting and slow turn times. No base salary."
good,"Preparing customer account documentation for imaging into DIPR Imaging System"
good,"everyone is eager and willing to help."
good,This company is very productive and has a great training program. They are very employee focused and this makes for a great work place environment.

good,Great job. My work experience in this enviroment was great however the pay was not high enough for the experience that I bring and the hours were not good for my family life.
good,"I really enjoy what I do becuase I have been directly a part of rebuilding the economy and helping improve the housing market throughout the real estate mortgage crisis. As an experienced home mortgage professional I have extensive experience working directly as a mortgage loan servicing specialist.  I have a wide array of skills which include preparing approval packages for modifications, portfolio risk assessment, analyzing financial statements, escrow, short sales, appraisals, credit report analysis, title liens, judgments, subordinations, public records and bankruptcies.  I am accustomed to handling a large customer pipeline and have over 5+ years experience as a mortgage proffesional. Sometimes it's difficult to see people struggle with hardships such as unemployment, divorce, death, and disability, but ultimately I am here to help borrowers with the best option given there current circumstance.  All in all the job has been very rewarding and the knowledge and experience I have attained will help me move forward in my career."
good,"The most enjoyable parrt of my job is helping people,Wells Fargo is a great place to work."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company and I enjoy working there, the people that I work with are great, they kick you out after your 40 hour work week and the benefits are fantastic.  On the down side is that the job is very monotonous, we do basically the same thing every single day.   "
good,Very good company with many great people whom I miss dearly.
good,"At first, I started as a teller and worked my way up to a customer service rep, and lastly a personal banker.

good,"At Wells Fargo you typically arrive early and leave late. It is a very sales focused enviroment and they are honest with you about that from the very start. I have learned to engage customers and manage conflict well, as money is a very sensitive subject for most. Upper management has very high expectations and are clear about communicating them. Employees form a tight bond do to work enviroment and having to work together to meet expectations. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help a customer in tight financial times because of their past money management and the most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers to achieve their goals.

good,"Wells Fargo is my first job after graduation. Wells Fargo has shown me the value of a hard days work in the real world. I have a great manger and work with a young, ambitious team. My position with Wells Fargo currently is very production based and there is a lot of independent work with little guidance which I enjoy. I would like to have a job with a little more human interaction however. Most days are spent behind a computer. All in all Wells has been an excellent career starter.  "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The typical day at work was assisting and satisfying customers."
good,I learned alot about dealing with a large number of people & all of their different personalities. I am a people person & love working with people. I learned that I can adapt to any situation without notice & have the best outcome.
good,This a very production and fast paced environment. Wells Fargo is a very diverse company that is engaged with their employees. Management and co-workers are easy to communicate with. 
good,"Working at Wells Fargo increased my proficincy in goal-driven sales. Every day managers set sales goals for new accounts and credit cards. My co-workers were easy to get along with and fun. The best part of my day was when I reached and exceeded our daily sales goals.  "
good,Would like to have stayed but the merger with Wachovia at the time made it very difficult to close the loans I sold because the fulfillment process was so unorganized; that has since changed.
good,A typical day at Wells Fargo was making outbound calls to welcome customers to their new auto loans. I learned to polish what already came natural to me and that was to be very helpful to the many questions that new customers had about the auto loans they obtained. My managers were all very nice and understanding. My co workers were all a joy to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the irate customers but the most enjoyable part of the job was the laid back environment and friendly people who worked there.

good,"Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely seeing customers leave happy. Its very rewarding to be able to help people with their financial needs. A hard part about it is when there is nothing you can do to help. I never want to see a customer upset especially when they are in my line. My coworkers were amazing and uplifting and the management tried their best to motivate and coach us as a team. As far as the company itself, I think the fees are outrageous. Some of the policies are things I would NEVER incorporate into my own business. Its hard working for a company with policies you wish you could change. But I loved my job and I definitely helped the customers to my fullest extent."
good,Great company to work for all around. I enjoyed my time at this company and would work here again. 
good,A lot a interactions with coworkers and customers.Learn more about management and managing time.

For the most part, management was knowledgable and supportive. I enjoyed my cowrkers. I knew alot of them from my days with First Union/Wachovia due to the mergers.

The best part of any day was when a customer wanted to let my manager know that I had done a great job in assisting them.  I had a lot of good friends at work and that made the job enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job was referrals and selling, I was not good at this and it made the job very unpleasant. "
good,"A typical day at work included; processing checks, post office deliveries."
good,"I worked at Wachovia, now Wells Fargo for 18 years, and would still be there if the Co, had not merged with First Union.  I had several jobs thruought my 18 years, and learned from each one.  The co-workers were always great, and easy to work with, which made the job easy to do.  "

good,"I would assit my teller in reaching and exceeding company goals. I learned that anyone is teachable. The key root to drive someone to exceeds their own expectations is to get to know them and an individual. I became good at cracking their ""Why"", what made them want to be there. The most enjoyable part of my job again is helping people, my customers, my tellers, my bankers, I trully loved what I did. "
good,"Wells is probably no different from most large institutions. Cubicle environment, muffled noises, and one person who talks just a little too loud on the phone. Management is management, they want to know before it happens, and what you will do to fix it. Co-Workers are friendly and generally very helpful. Everyone is busy and just trying to get their meet their deadlines. Wells has a lot of perks including food courts, specialty shops, employee programs, and wellness facilities for your convenience depending upon the location you are at. The hardest part of the job is getting the reporting done in the various manners they expect it and of course the endless meetings that you have to attend when you are trying to work. Every once in a while you get an opportunity to joke and laugh and that would be the most enjoyable part of the job. I take any role as an opportunity to learn. Encountering new applications can be overwhelming, but can also be partly enjoyable. There are so many applications out there that all you can do is try and learn what these systems do, how they interact with other applications, and what to do if someone finds something wrong. There is always an application being created out there to learn."

good,A typical day at work varies greatly from location to location in a Personal Banking retail position. Mine is hectic. There is more work than management is able to give you resources to handle. This is sometimes just the way a corporate retail structure works when balancing out sales and customer service. Management in my personal experience has been fantastic in every conceivable way. Co-workers will also vary greatly from location to location. The most difficult part of the job is deciding which fire needs to be put out first due to the high frequency and variety of extra work that comes along with such a position. The most enjoyable part of the job is being given the opportunity to succeed in sales and customer service by producing positive tangible results in helping customers meet their financial goals. It absolutely makes everything worth it to see a clients life improve because of financial needs that you uncovered and found solutions for.
good,I would walk into the call center and get myself ready to take and make calls. I enjoyed the motivation that the managers gave with giving out prizes for work well done.

good,Work at Wells Fargo was fun and was different everyday. You never really dealt with the same customer or did the same transactions.

good,The manager is very down to earth person. Have good team. I do code for CCER(Commercial Card Expense Reporting).
good,"A day starts with specific guidelines to set up the bank for safety and efficient environment to work. Then, more staff will join to service the teller line or help customers with banking transactions. Depending on the business the managers and lead staff will coach, encourage, and overall boost the morale of the team for better service and sales score. My co-workers were excellent, and friendly enough to socialize outside of work. We help each other out when one of us feels like we're in the gutter. The hardest part is the amount of customers we need to satisfy for perfect satisfaction. When it gets busy, it's really busy. Most enjoyable part is the co-workers and nice incentive programs for good performances."
good,I was given may learning opportunities and worked hard to keep my knowledge current. I worked with multiple departments to get my job done each day. I handled many escalations in helping my manager and I also helped train current and new hires. I was also able to manage between 7-12 employees which was challenging and exciting. Working as team is very important and communication is essential. In dealing with multiple states one thing was clear as to how each office handles things so differently and being able to adapt or help them understand a correct procedure. I love it when it all comes together and you can say you helped someone get into a new home.

The employees were great. I have fond memories of working there."

good,Created loan servicing documents along with research loans and changes related to them. Reviewed all terms and conditions of loan documentations.
good,A busy and intense place to work begin to end. Always learning and changes sometimes weekly. Management always trying to improve work place and make the process easy. Team members makes your day and time go quicker. When you can't help a mortgagor due to the financial status. The most enjoyable part is when you're able to tell the mortgagor they have been approved for a workout retention.
good,On a daily basis we handled at least 50-70 calls.The calls consist of helping customers with online services.We had to utilize multiple scrrens for different reason and not everything was given to us in training.However we worked as a team and helped eachother out with different issues we came upon that we had no answer to but had the capability to ask other co workers who had the answer to the situation we were in.As a team we had a goal each day and worked hard towar meeting our daily goals.

Many co-workers with ideas for making day go by quickly with planned activties, lunch, after work get togethers and socializing.

good,"They days of simply handling bank transactions are over. This company is very sales and customer service driven for all positions within a retail store. Tellers no longer process transactions, they have become salesmen and are required to meet quotas as well as provide top rated customer service. The atmosphere within the store is very friendly, it becomes hard if you fall behind on sales for the quarter. The most enjoyable part is the friendships you make."
good,Wells Fargo is an excellent place to work. I found it difficult to get hired on as a full time employee.
good,"This was an enjoyable place to work, even with the stressful environment of having to call people who were in financial trouble. I learned a great deal about the mortgage industry as well as many useful skills in dealing with all different types of people and personality types. I enjoyed my co-workers, we were a good team and always tried to help each other out and a management team who always pushed me to strive to be my best. There were difficult and stressful parts of the job when we had no options for people to retain their home, but when we were able to assist others with options for retention it made up for the ones we could not assist."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo.My only reason for leaving is that I was offered another job paying more money.

good,"Management wasn't the greatest on my team, so cant speak for the company as a whole, just my team. But the experience and training is good to take with you for other jobs. Hours and overtime is great. The company its self treat its employee great."
good,Wells Fargo was an inclusive experience. Team members were forward and willing to assist. Retail banking is a great industry for anyone looking for a diverse customer base and helping people manage finances through cross-selling solutions.
good,Most day are long but there are day where you do get off early.  Co-worker are easy to get along with.  The Management are very helpful and fun to be around.  Workplace culture can sometime be conflict because do to rule set by the company.
good,"Wells is a good place to work for numerous of reasons. For me, it brought stability into my home that I didnt have before. Wells Fargo pays well, provide benefits of all kinds, full-time flexible schedules (depending on the dept), and plenty more perks. I would not recommend this job to anyone that is not susceptible to A LOT of change, growth, and hard work."
good,Great job to advance and grow! Wells Fargo is diverse. I would say build a great relationship with your co-workers and bosses because the baning industry is small and everyone knows everyone.
good,A great company to work for. Team member development is encouraged and supported. I have been with them over a decade and through this time I have been exposed to many great leaders who have helped me along in my career.

good,Great place to work depending on the team members and managers. Everything is family oriented. The benefits are legit. The hours were flexible and the customers were great
good,Management made me feel at home when at work. The best workplace and company culture I have experienced. Would recommend friends and family to work here. The only downside is that there are not enough opportunities to progress in the company.
good,"I absolutely loved my job at Wells Fargo. Yes, things get busy and I had to work hard but there was always room for movement and advancement. My managers were amazing and I always felt like I had a work family. The workload did get very high and I could not maintain my work/life balance. However, my managers were very supportive and just wanted to see me succeed."
good,If you are looking for a job in business or banking then this bank is definitely the number one place you want to start!! everyone there is like a family that helps look out for each other when they need it most. I've had bankers and managers opening their own windows on the tellers side to help us help the customers when it gets crazy busy. each one is different but you're always part of a family when you work for wells Fargo.
good,This company taught me so much in a short time. I was able to learn the ins and out of collecting.  I found myself really enjoying doing skip work.  I learned how much i enjoyed being able to those who needed the help to keep their vehicles and work out payment arrangements.
good,"Wells Fargo pays very well, paid time off. I dislike the non-existent company culture. It is noticeable that WF is going back to getting the tellers to sell of products by introducing weekly goals, I believe the management could get more training on how to handle a team and motivate them. Inclusion of all team members has lacked at my current branch."
good,"Wells Fargo offers excellent benefits, competitive pay. Job functions and expectations were exactly as they were represented in training. Training was through and paced well"
good,"Ok, relaxed atmosphere but limited room for advancement in Canada as this is a US bank. Very rigid credit underwriting. Excellent benefits and rrsp plan."
good,What I liked most was the benefits and how they gave back to the community and allowed the employees to participate in that. Working in a branch felt like they were your family the company embodies great team  spirit.
good,Overall good company with diversity and inclusion.  Benefits are alright and the pay is excellent. Excellent vacation/  time away and paid holidays.  The training could be better it’s not as thorough as it used to be years ago...
good,I have grown with WF and have been allowed to give back to my community in many different ways. Diversity and inclusion is important at WF and this is reflected in our employees.
good,"I enjoyed the routine, but also was willing to change things up when it was called for. Team members were like a family. The more we worked together the better we all succeeded."
good,"Ive been with Wells since June 2019. So far its been as good as a job can get. The PTO is generous, the option for overtime is abundant so despite your base rate your liable to make double that given the overtime your willing to do (not to mention the shift differential is a plus). If you don't like talking on the phones on being in 1 place most of the time then you won't like this job. But outside of that its anything but hardworking."
good,The employees spent a great deal of time together both at work and after. Definitely a since of family that worked well together. The customers were a pleasure as well.
good,Satisfactory Job.. Night shift.. Colleagues are extremely supportive and have some breaks and topics event's are done. happily worked in that period of time.
good,"Great inclusivity and diversity with a concentration on innovation. We are always looking for diligent, nimble and loyal fellow employees. Please come home to the Wells Fargo Family."
good,"It's a good company provides all possible facilities with in the organisation, competition takes you at Higher pace in the organisation with your smartwork. Provide cab facility  both ways and outing is one of my favourite part in the organisation.team members are supportive."
good,"One must be willing to give 100% to stay on top of workload. Great culture to be a part of. Slow advancement and low compensation. Many tools to help one prepare, but timing is key."
good,"Overall, it is a solid place to work that has a tried and true structure to it with fair and impartial reviews most of the time. There are, like lots of different places, a few bad apples here and there but for the most part... everyone works hard and likes to be there."
good,Excellent place to work. Training is amazing and benefits are outstanding. Wells Fargo really goes out of their way to make you feel special as an employee.
good,"It was a pleasure to work there under the write management.  Unfortunately my 1st manager didn't have Mortgage experience, just general management duties.  2nd Manager was a micro manager that disrupts constantly.  Several bonus structures which makes additional income available and consistent."
good,"Overall a great company, promotes from within, plenty of opportunity in the retail and operations channels; however, limited opportunity in the private bank, especially for minorities. I left when the sales pressure was at its height in 2015."
good,"It was a fun job, but you do the same thing every single day. They pay was just increased to 15 this passed year but there are also a lot more responsibilities. It can get tiring for some people."
good,I enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to join a company that cares about its employees and trains them to succeed.

good,"great benefits and discounts by being a wells fargo employee "
good,"My typical day at work consists of answering calls from customers, agents, and bankers and assist them with opening claims, asking them questions, researching claims, and providing them with a resolution and/or timeframes. Some days are busy, some are slow. The workplace can be tense, and at times, feels like I'm back in high school."
good,"This was a pleasant place to work with very friendly and helpful people that made me feel welcomed. A typical day at work was smooth and easy, the management was professional and cared about the employees feelings. The team members were friendly and everyone seemed to enjoy each others company. The hardest part of the job was learning new processes as this type of work was new to me. It all worked out fine with the help of my team mates."
good,"I like working there they had great working experience with other cultures"
good,"For the most part, you can feel confident that you don't have to worry about security from day to day. However, advancement moves at a snail's pace, as this is where politics come into play. "
good,"Very structured, so not for those who are looking for a fun start up environment. But the team is great as well as the management. If you lead the conversation about career advancement they will help you get wherever you want to go."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my years at Wells Fargo. I worked with great teams both in New York and Nebraska. Management was engaged in developing diverse and talented teams. There was opportunities fro advancement for associates.
good,"After the on-boarding process, I have been in a constant state of learning. New skills/services have been handed to me and I have had to learn as I go, but always had someone to lean on in case I had questions/concerns. Overall, a great work environment with very knowledgeable people."
good,I enjoyed my time with Wells Fargo there’s really nothing to complain about my only complaint was coming in the morning and leaving after work it was the parking structure took a minute to get out of.
good,"I enjoyed meeting people. Talking and learning them and their needs. I enjoyed building their trust and relationships so that they trusted when I wanted to help"
good,"In order to succeed you must have an excellent time management to make sure you complete your duties on a daily basis. You are always learning and must adjust to a changing environment, policies, and current events in the world. Department leaders help keep the workplace fun and enjoyable by organizing themed festivities."
good,"Wells Fargo cares a lot about their team members, They offer a great health benefit package options, Bonus, PTO, Sick time. Wells Fargo also offers great training to all team members."
good,Overall a good company to work for although some districts do have those bad Apple managers. They are very open to working with your school schedule as long as it’s manageable within business hours.
good,Recent changes to senior management has changed many basics of the work culture. Still a good place to work learn and grow. As per the market the Management is also changing.
good,Lots of pressure to push unneeded products on customers to keep a job there! Really too much info is given to a teller to push those products! Great banking services except no exceptions for those who accidentally overdraft by an amount under a dollar and charge of 35 dollars! That is just robbery to anyone! Especially if there was a savings account attached and that is 10 to transfer even for a penny! Ouch ouch ouch play nice Wells Fargo!
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to live. Good management and benefits. They care about their employees. They have a great work/life balance. I would recommend this company to anyone as a good employer.

good,Wellsfargo is great company that offers great benefits and opportunities. I have learned alot about the banking industry which gives you opportunities to help people with there financial needs.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of a lot of team work. You need to be able to work in a highly team oriented environment. Management cares about your needs as a team member. Hardest job would be when emotions run high, either tears or anger with customers. But this is in any work place. You just need to know how to manage and be a people person."
good,"People and teams are great to work with, they have systems in place however plugins are not allowed with sketch. "

good,Entry level role turned into a 3 year commitment with a promotion with more room to grow still. Great work/life balance. Pay is a little low considering the Maryland/DC cost of living.
good,It's a good place to work. Good benefits and career development. I enjoy the inclusive culture and openness of management. There's always room for career advancement
good,Excellent benefits from day one. Awesome company enjoyed working there. Lots of sales goals and regulations to learn make sure to take lots of notes in training.

good,"I loved working here, especially being able to build clients who become close to you. The environment is great and the benefits are great. The work-life balance is just not there. I had a difficult time just trying to get covered or call off due to family emergencies or school."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Gives you great experience, they encourage growth and development, and they truly care about you. My boss is always wanting to know how he can help and make my work experience better. Its amazing to have such great support."
good,"I gained invaluable experience that led to many new opportunities in the mortgage industry. The job demanded a lot of hours, and there was almost no helpful training. Management was fair. It's a great Entry Level opportunity, but I left the company due to lack of foreseeable advancement."
good,"This job was a great experience. This job is great for a lot of different reasons. When working as a teller there is a lot of multitasking that takes place and a level of customer satisfaction that has to be maintained and by working as a teller here, it exposes you to many different characteristics that are really important to have in the work place. Also, the job culture is fantastic, it really was a family atmosphere I felt when i showed up to work everyday and I really appreciated that."

good,"Wells Fargo is a great company and depending on your goals can be a great place for a long term career. "
good,"Great place to work , they understand life at Wells Fargo, pay is decent and seasoned employees treat you like family once they warm to you. Management is awesome, much opportunity to volunteer for the community."
good,"The company is very supportive, and in front office roles the pay is good. In back office corporate roles they only hire in mid tier cities and pay fine. The company is being forced to cut back heavily on expenses as the growth cap remains."
good,"Great company to work for and feel like they really try to take care of their employees."
good,"The pay is decent, no sales goals like other banks so it's not as stressful. Very easy to move up from teller to personal banker or lead teller. However, very difficult to move up to any other position after that. Also, depending on where you are, there are no sick days. If you get sick and have to call out, you have to use your vacation hours."
good,"This is a great place to work for, paid fairly, a lot of benefits. The only bad thing is that they still need to invest more in technology cause system are slooow"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"It's a good company to work for however, sitting all day getting yelled at can be overwhelming. Some jobs just aren't fit for everyone and I feel like this is where I struggled most. Coming from doing face to face working on my feet all my life, it's a huge adjustment."
good,"I am on the phone my entire shift.  They're pretty good to us, but they don't spend time on the phones, so they forget how difficult it is to make sure you do all the off phone things they want us to do.  They get annoyed that we don't ""read messages and emails"" they send us with updates on our job information, but if we ask when our email time and ""study"" time is, the tell us on our own time.  That I don't like.  Otherwise, for the most part, Wells Fargo is very good to us.  They recently updated the exercise room with all new equipment and at the same time, got a new security company that actually lets us come in to the building before our first thing in the morning shift for morning exercise.  They also brought in the stuff for us to have free coffee or tea which is very, very nice.  The hardest part overall is the anger and open hostility toward us by callers.  This has really increased when Wells Fargo made the news and it is very tough to take.  They also like to make us move often and I don't even feel comfortable there any more.  Believe it or not that is tough to take that the management moves us around a lot.  I finally cleared all my personal belongings out of my desk and I even desk share now, so I have nothing there that comes from home that I can't carry out in my purse or tote every day at the end of my shift.  There is no ""warmth"" there because of that.  But, because I serve my Lord and savior, Jesus Christ, my days are generally filled with joy and I can get through everything at the job with Him at the center of my life.  And would it be asking too much for"
good,Team work and co-workers were great. Developers work smart to complete coding and testing on time for releases.  Love the extra defect team process to allow developers to move on with sprints.
good,"Workplace culture: Professional "
good,"You get weeks of training including listening to calls and role playing different scenarios. There is definitely a learning curve for efficiency. There are opportunities to move up after keeping the same position for a year. The benefits are great! You don't get official ""sick leave"" but you get plenty of PTO."
good,Wells Fargo does provide a more positive work-life balance and the help and continued education that's received is a whole lot better. I wish the culture could be better as far as trust and family orientation- being able to want to hang out outside of work (i.e. bowling or going out to dinner or doing a birthday party for a coworker). Other than that the job is pretty good there's a balance and it's working.
good,I have nothing to say about this other than Wells Fargo is a well-known bank who has been in business for many years & I learned a lot while I worked for them.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with at this company we got along as a team and assisted each other when help was needed, the supervisor was very helpful"
good,"Fairly laid back atmosphere, loose dress code.  Enjoyable coworkers.  Overall Wells Fargo was a very good place to work for someone looking for stability and good benefits."

good,"Though I can't speak for the company culture as a whole (various departments have different cultures), I found my department's to be very supportive of my goals and visions. As an intern, I wanted to work on different projects and connect with employees in different departments, and my boss allowed me to do so and even encouraged such behavior. It can be a very hands-off approach and self-paced job, yet there is enough collaboration time and team meetings to facilitate group cohesiveness. "
good,"Worked here for about 2 years, no real complaints, the company has so much to offer especially to the team members. Also, it's very diverse which is really amazing because working in a multicultural setting shows the company is NOT bias."
good,"I manage about 300 plus accounts as a Loan Adjustor. I have the power to make final decisions, discuss the terms with our attorney's as well as the customers.  The workplace culture is very structured and productive."
good,I have been working since 2002 and loves it! I will continue to work and enjoy the company.Its a great company with benefits. Advancement opportunites.
good,"Responsible for opening and closing the branch."
good,"Wells Fargo is big on Development. The growth potential is endless. If you own your career path your manager will support you getting there. With benefits like Tuition reimbursement the company sets their people up for success. The culture is set around the Team members and our Customers. They are generous with PTO. Honestly, this is a company that someone can go as far as they want to go in. They are not quick to get rid of people and the support and resources are readily available."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wonderful company to work for. Felt heard often when ideas were brought to the table. Often had the chanve to speak with leadership at round tables, town halls etc."
good,working at wells fargo taught me a lot about sales and relationship building. Wells Fargo allowed me to grow and be a leader in my branch. the leadership skills I learned i have used in other areas of my career
good,"Wells Fargo was an excellent place to work as a student. I received valuable experience, was exposed to typical work life and schedule, and was well compensated."
good,It was a nice place I don’t have any complaints worked there for a few months the people were nice and so was the work environment. I would recommend.
good,i typically do manager duties. wich include support the team individuals and provide support to them. also review their performance and numbers and provide coaching
good,"I loved working with my team. Everyone comes together to get the job done. A really laid back environment. Management is really good. No one hoovering they trust you to do your job."
good,I had a good experience and a solid welcome into the banking industry. I learned a lot about how to approach customer situations especially in difficult situations.
good,"Great place to work and a lot of room for advancement. Obviously has its cons, but genuinely loved working at Wells Fargo as a Teller. Really seem to want you to advance."
good,"I am presently a contracted employee there and I actually like my job, especially my co workers, they are a great group to work with.  management understands life happens and are flexible if you have to leave due to an immediate issues.  They are usually understanding if you or your children have doctor's appointments and have to leave early.  I wish I could stay longer but my contract will be running out soon.  I will miss my coworkers terribly when the time comes to leave.  Great place to work!"
good,Flexible with school schedule and opportunities for advancement. Monthly and quarterly meeting to discuss how we can do better with fun activities; meeting not boring.
good,"Although I enjoyed the people I worked with at Wells and had the utmost respect for my branch manager, I was there during the time bankers were under pressure to produce multiple accounts and sell products.  Consequently I worked with some people who acted a bit unethically and their environment didn't fit my business style.  I am more relationship driven, and the environment at the branch where I was assigned was more transnational."
good,"it is great place to work but if you are looking for high rage, you can look for other job, but you if you are looking for Work/life balance and this is good company you can find it."
good,"It started off as a very well-intentioned job.  The training before hand was great, the on the job training was decent.  It was difficult for me to enjoy being good at my job when others were jealous of my numbers out the gate and started drama.  Management didn't take serious investigative measures, and the pattern repeated.  Got tired of management not being around to do their part of the job that allowed us to do ours.  Made it stressful when it didn't need to be."
good,I love working for wells fargo unfortunately i feel like they can benefit from paying their employees more. i love my branch and my co workers but i need to work for a company that pays more and offers better benefits.
good,"Knowledge in the industry is unsurpassed.  Great people.  Stressful and fast paced, but overall a great place to work.  They put the fun in dysfunctional."
good,Wells Fargo by far gives employees the best benefit package. Plenty of sick and vacation days. Paid holidays as of day one. Great 401k and Roth IRA as well. The only thing I would say as when I worked there they over emphasized sales over customer service. Although you are shopped for customer service as well.
good,nice place to work but i am currently a contract staff. I would love to be a permanent staff. i have applied for a permanent position for the job i was working as contract .hoping to be hired.
good,"I was learning how to communication within my team members, how to handling the workflow on busy day/high volume, most we're enjoyable is have a potluck and birthday cake to separation our  team member's birthday."
good,"Good place to work, but not enough pay for the area. Proactive and customer oriented. They give you the tools to grow within the company but it's on you to use them or not."
good,I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo (then Wachovia/First Union National Bank).  The focus was on the customer and doing things efficiently and not burning the staff out.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I was with Wells Fargo Dealer Services for a handful of years before our branch of operation was eliminated due to some mishandling at the branch level. I loved my job and coworkers. I had so much mentoring, support, advancement opportunities and fun at my office. It was a shame all 38 of us in our office were let go. I've been trying to get back into WF since leaving-- no other company I've been in has been able to come close to the culture at WF."
good,I enjoyed Wells Fargo.  The atmosphere was laid back and not too much pressure to meet goals but more focused on helping customers.  Actually had time to know co workers.
good,"Mutual fund evaluations"
good,"Great company. I would work for Wells Fargo again in a different department. But the specific department I worked in, took a toll on me mentally. Very stressful on occasion."
good,"Unfortunately, the last few years of negative news coverage was a barrier to gaining traction in some markets.  Overall the company was very good to employees and the group that I worked with was highly motivating."
good,"Management was great, you learn so much and grow in many areas. They provide all the training needed to be successful at work.  The team members are great and very supportive."
good,over all i liked working for Wells Fargo the downsizing and recent India sight cut our work everyone was throwing people under the bus in order to save there own butts.
good,"new calls all the time none stop"
good,"Pros "
good,Being a teller at Wells Fargo is easy enough when it comes to regular tasks. Cash Handling/Balancing/Customer Transactions are simple once you get the hang of it. The difficult thing about working for a bank is when customers want you to make acceptations to policy and procedure which in the banking world often tie into adhering to government regulation. Wells Fargo management is very good at standing beside those requirement most of the time but customers are very hard to handle when they declined a transaction at the teller window and it can be very stressful. If you are looking to work in the banking industry you have to have a strong head and you have to be able to say no to customers in the politest way possible while taking the backlash.
good,After May 2017 they lowered the incentive goals as individuals because the company took a hit with law suits in Orange County. Once the goals were removed or prorated it didn't pay as much but there wasn't any pressure for sales.
good,I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo and would go back in a heartbeat because everything about working for Wells was pleasant and enjoyable.  Not a lot of stress and I enjoyed everything about the department I was in.
good,"WF has been a great place to be. Hours are generally flexible, policy states we have two work from home days per month, and benefits are good. Biggest issue is that it is very Cliquey. If you are not a favorite of the manager, say goodbye to opportunities. Raises are always 2% unless you get a promotion then it is 4% which really sucks. We have the policy to work remote twice a week but many managers frown on this so it is not good for your career to do. There are many fun events which is nice but it sucks when nobody from your team wants to go see it."
good,A lot of the rules are very strict compared to other banks but its all to protect the customer. There were not enough positions to move into and not many took time to figure out a career plan.
good,"Enjoyed my time there thoroughly, although the lack of room for growth at my particular location was a letdown. Otherwise, fair management and stable working environment."
good,Company care about employees. upward learning opportunities for advancement and growth. . Training was provided for development. Management showed interest in  employees development and customers satisfactions.
good,"You can move up in the company if you are willing to move as the company is spread out all across the nation depending on department. Benefits weren't great, but perks could be okay from time to time."
good,"Good job for what I needed at the time. Certainly not what I would want to do for the rest of my life. Felt like a drone in this position, and there was high turnover. It's a call center job, so what more can you expect?"
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was a part time position as a teller. The day to day operations consist of customer deposits, withdrawals, and uncovering financial needs for customer."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,If you choose a career with the company it would benefit you to choose a path within your first year and stick to it. The sales culture has definitely changed and Wells Fargo has become more of a relationship bank. Since the sales culture has changed there has been a decrease in potential compensation. I truly have one of the best managers I have ever worked for and I learned plenty from leadership.
good,"As for recent changes occurred in the past couple years, there has been struggle with keeping management in place. As structure of business changes, so does the personal which is understandable. Trust is earned in the banking business and it requires skilled interactions to perceive the correct message across. I would still recommend Wells Fargo as a job opportunity for a predictable hourly wage and processing. Vast amount of benefits available for team members and their family."
good,"I held a number of positions at Wells Fargo, it was a fun, fast-paced place to work.  Great team members.  The systems, processes and resources for employees at Wells Fargo are vast."
good,"Great benefits package, fair compensation, great culture, inclusive and diverse. Just rate it a 4 because of some of the gossipy people that will get you down but that might be everywhere."
good,"I was fortunate enough to be part of Wells Fargo LLC because it is an amazing company. Work environment is very productive, its comoetitiveness is healthy. And the facilities are amazing!"
good,"I love the people I work with, the work is consistent and keeps me busy on a daily basis.  I do have a reasonable amount of freedom with making decisions for my team, which is wonderful."
good,"was my introduction to retail banking, had a wonderful team of individuals and loved my clients, I worked during the sales rush and also during the ""change for the better"". the culture has improved extremely since the beginning of 2018. I would recommend this job for anyone looking to start a journey in finance."
good,"I loved working for Wells Fargo and found the environment to be very friendly and the people helpful!  I left to stay at home with my daughter, but would consider going back to work for Wells Fargo in the future."
good,This is the type of job tat you will learn a lot about financial. Its a great job to build in that in area for career or personal. Working for Wells Fargo have been opening my options on how to manage money the right way. I would recommend this job to a friend.
good,"Enjoy holidays and Xmas days"
good,laid off; many management changes; lack of management direction.  good pay & benefits.  Wells Fargo does not re-hire prior employees: do not know why.
good,Throughly enjoyed working as a contractor at Wells Fargo. I felt as if i had ultimate autonomy on my work decisions and was given a fair work/ life balance as well.
good,"It is a great place to work. With all of the changes that are being made the company will be around for a very long time. I'm just looking for something more in my field, but overall was very satisfied with the company."
good,Typical day when I was a teller at wells fargo was that I had set goals that I was required to meet each day. I had to make sure I went out my way to please each customer and that their experience at wells fargo was excellent.  I learned a lot about different accounts and customer service. The hardest part of my job at that time was school and work but we were able to figure out a schedule that worked for both of us. The most enjoyable part of my job was that team members were recognized for their customer service and was given a gift.
good,Job very demanding in turn around.  I was paid salary so any work done after hours was not compensated in the mortgage area.  The benefits at this job were very reasonable and the hardest part of the job was the turn around on the mortgage packages during the refi boom.  Co-workers and management were always a pleasure to work with in every department I encountered.
good,I love to work here.. Good clean environment...staff is great to get along wit any issues u may have staff deals wot on spot.lots of over time..if your willing to stay
good,"Your experience will be directly tied to the quality of your manager.  Annual pay increases are minimal, if you want to get paid more you need to move positions.  Incentive compensation is a joke.  Good benefits, lots of PTO."
good,Brookhighland Branch two of the best I have ever worked for. I just needed more Saturday mornings free than they were allowed to provide. Schedules were controlled on a regional level.
good,"Well Fargo is a great place to work ,opportunity to grow is there when you have the experience to apply . The atmosphere was good with current employee. lower level management was not that great but overall is good,"
good,Great benefits and opportunities but the company as a whole does not have protecting the consumer in mind.  Definitely do your research on the position and determine if it's a good fit
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"As a Staffing Coordinator, I served all the branches in my area.  I maintained daily attendance log, processed HR transactions, served as the initial POC for branch managers and employees.  My department was small, as a result, my manager and coworkers were very collaborative in our daily duties.  The manager was always available to assist us with our questions."
good,"No day was typical in my role as Relationship Associate and Executive Assistant.  Each day had a different set of opportunities and problems.  However, these challenges sharpened my problem resolution and critical thinking skills."
good,Great clean work place. Management cares about employees. Pay could have been hire due to many task one department handles. Longer lunch breaks are needed due to large facility and walk around facility.
good,They were very productive and geared toward the tasks that were laid out by upper management.  Any questions or concerns that one may have had were always answered.
good,"It is very good working at Wells Fargo. Team were very friendly ad productive. We as a team, made many enhancements and work culture was very good. We never gave up on any tasks."
good,"I was a contractor in the tech space, so I couldn't really say what being an employee was like there. I was asked to come onboard full time, but declined due to another opportunity that was more challenging."
good,"I really enjoyed the hours of business. Loved the people I worked with. Great benefits, flexible scheduling but of course its based on your manager. HR is always very helpful"
good,I like working for wells Fargo. I have obtained a fair amount of expercience. The paid holidays are nice and the vto is nice as well. Management is alright. the environment is bearable. the pay is decent. The people you work with are amazing. the hours are amazing.
good,Good company to work for. You get out what you put In.   They want to advance you and bring you up with the company.  They will train you for the next step in your careers path
good,"Responsible for processing loan applications in compliance with bank policies, meeting investor guidelines and demonstrating lending strategies, including collecting data and ensure the completion of applications."
good,Fast paced yet required quality and customer service from their employees. Provided bonus when you meet expectations. Communicates those expectations so you know where you are constantly. Provides training to help meet those expectations. Many people to work with but broken down so you are not lost and can receive guidance when needed.
good,"Wells Fargo was a great company to work for when I was there.  They valued their people and provided opportunities to grow, learn, and help the community.  I really enjoyed my time there as an employee."
good,"Wells Fargo was an overall enjoyable place to work. They had great heath and retirement benefits. Once I reached a certain level of management, however, it was hard to get any further movement within the company."
good,One of my old managers cared more about sales then anything and would tell the ladies to dress up extra nice to go get guys to open accounts. He did not care how we got them as long as we provided the numbers.
good,"I had been with Wells Fargo since 2005-2015 and I learned so much to become a self-motivated, knowledgeable, and professional employee. I also obtained Series 7, 66, and life insurance in 2007."
good,"Wells Fargo had its issues with treating employees like numbers. On the other hand, the training, and the perks often made up for the robotic atmosphere. This company is a great learning tool for any position."
good,our branch is in a small town so it's not as busy as some branches usually can be in suburban or city branches so atmosphere was more relaxed. Great place to learn though and build experience with little stress in my situation.
good,I was still in school and able to obtain the job. It helps if you have customer service experience and cash handling experience. Customer service is important.
good,"Can be stressful but the pay is good. Good team of employees and fair management. Good benefits and good company overall. Mandatory overtime limited, over time available at employees request."
good,"helping clients finance autos "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Release management was fast paced.  Team environment was amazing.  We all helped each other to be successful.  Management listens and provides support to the team.
good,the only negative during my tenure was seeing my coworkers go through several layoffs. It made me worry about job security. I loved my team NUPRM and they loved me we were like family.
good,"Great company and culture however the success, exposure and opportunities for potential growth are dependent on the type of manager one has.  If one has a manager that is insecure, a micromanages and one that plays favorites, then it will be difficult to advance within the company."
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work. I feel supported  in my role as a lead teller however there is not much room for promotions behind the teller line and I would like the opportunity to build long lasting relationships with clients.
good,Day to day job was easy. Coworkers were fun. Enjoyed interacting with customers daily. Enjoyed counting cash and keeping it within limits and standards. Management did not get along and sometimes made for a stressful environment.
good,My overall experience with Wells Fargo was great. Management was very supportive of it's employees. Compensation was great. The company offered bonus trips for great performance.
good,Relax workplace culture that makes it fun and interactive while working with clients to make sure we meet their financial needs.Great culture and environment
good,Very stressful especially in sales. Unrealistic expectations set by corporate management and by Wells Fargo Corp to its other divisions. My direct managers were amazing and I worked with great people.
good,Wells Fargo provides you with the tools and (continuing) education to do your job effectively. The Managers do a great job of encouraging work/life/balance.
good,This was a very good company to work for.  The work environment is very good and the managers were pleasant to work with.  We did have a step by step script you pretty much had to follow which was a little monotonous but understandable.
good,Easy to work daily customer service dont expect to advance quickly. FInd good management without you will simply burn out with the work load and lack of comradere
good,"Company that cares about both customers and team members. On the commercial lending side of the bank, there are excellent compensation packages and employee benefits."
good,Wells Fargo provided a great opportunity for me to apply my technical knowledge and experience.  I was given projects and allowed work independently. I enjoyed interacting with teammates.
good,"learn home mortgage products. work with many different personalities, mortgage process changes consistently, worked with many vendors, attend to customers and agents, daily and weekly reports, able to meet deadlines, understand home loan process, assist with appraisals, and title work."
good,In 2006 I started with GE Capital which had a great environment that encouraged employees to come up with ideas for improvements and to implement them.  A strong emphasis on inclusiversity.  In March of 2015 the division was purchased by Wells Fargo which has a similar culture.
good,"Great place to work with really good benefits. After tradition sales goals were eliminated, career advancement declined greatly. Otherwise, pay is fair and daily duties are mild."
good,"I had a great experience with management and coworkers. The nature of the job required that I sell mortgages and generate my own clientele. I was able to do this in the beginning but then ran out of steam as my closings began to dwindle out."
good,Good organization to learn banking knowledge while you work on projects and decent pay and perks. Management is OK but should more aggressive and employees should be given more opportunities to explore things.
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo started with a staff meeting to go over daily, weekly and quarterly goals. At Wells Fargo, I learned how to build long lasting partnerships with clients. These partnerships led to successful goal attainment  and great customer service ratings. The work culture at Wells Fargo was 100 percent professional and results driven.The most challenging part of my job at Wells Fargo was to constantly maintain a high level of customer satisfaction.The most enjoyable part of my job at Wells Fargo was to be part of a team with a mission of always exceed expectations."
good,"productive, fast pace, team work , easy access to supervisor.  the culture is first the company, employees and customer excellence. hardest part is the constant changes in policy some written into policy others are not, its part of job knowledge.  The most enjoyable part of working in wells fargo is the team work environment."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Good place to work, nice people, but constant change. Great if that's what your looking for and enjoy, and this may be the right place for you. If not, it can be frustrating and stressful."
good,"I was there many years and saw many changes. It's a great company but there are many ""umbrella"" companies underneath the WF name, which may not be as good as another."
good,"I know the work environment has changed since I left, but for the 5 years I was there I really enjoyed it.  Pay, benefits, and management were all a plus."
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to develop new skills that are transferable to any industry. Leadership at Wells Fargo consistently provide individuals with feedback on performance and ways to improve.
good,"Wells Fargo offers tons of benefits. With the whole new structure of Wells Fargo, there's less goals which means less revenue. By 2020, they're anticipating to close more branches and cut employees. Poor management. They have a mentality of hiring within so all you have to do is kiss butt. A college degree isn't valuable here."
good,I enjoy the people I work with and the challenges of my job and the travel to great cities across the country including Canada and Mexico. I also enjoy the flexibility.
good,"Felt valued  by company, felt training was above average for call center environment and that employee success is a priority.  Lots of internal hiring and management support."
good,"As with all large companies, satisfaction with employment at WFA depends entirely upon the area and team you work with as there are varying cultures spread across the firm. Fortunately, the last role was a tremendous experience. The environment was fast-paced and challenging and management was well-attuned to the necessary direction, capabilities, and personalities of our team."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo. Management can be a pain sometimes... that would really be my only complaint. I enjoyed my job day to day, there was always something different and I enjoyed building relationships with my customers. It was fun when they would go back to you just because they liked having conversations with you and catching up where you left off. It is a very hand on job. Teller school semi prepares you for what is coming but the real learning is on the teller line. Once you get the hang of things it all comes naturally."
good,Current atmosphere is friendly and there is a great work life balance.  Management is flexible with schedule and very supportive.  Enjoy working with colleagues. Pay is rather on the low side but the benefits are great.
good,The most enjoyable part working for Wells Fargo was to be able helping clients with their assets. I had the experience to learn how to plan your days at work by been more proactive.
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was good. I wasn't pushed into doing sales, and they were very willing to work with my school schedule. They starting off pay is nice because they pay much more than minimum wage, but after that, even if you are an asset to your branch and star performer, raises are few and far between. There were some corporate wide raises for tellers though, and so I received those raises. All in all, a great place to work as long as you're okay with customer service and can count well :)"
good,"Typically when I go in I would start with getting a cup of coffee, free provided by the company, and hop on the phones to take incoming calls. If the days were slow I would socialize with the very fun coworkers next to me. From this job I learned efficiency and to think on my feet. Our management made learning these things easy and the work environment fun with parties, activities, and all sorts of other things. Personally I think the hardest part of this job is the calls. The customers are not always grateful and friendly. There are times when the customers would not like the answers given to them and they would not be entirely understanding. However on the other side of the spectrum, the most enjoyable part of the job is the company of the coworkers and the management making the irate customers bearable and making the job fun."
good,"Fun"
good,"Hours I worked were good. They asked what my preference was and were good with request. They encouraged learning more on the lending side of banking and supplied resources to further employees knowledge. Management changed frequently and was sometimes difficult to have questions answered in a timely manner. When first started we were located in a Fulfillment site which was wonderful, all departments were available to assist. WE were taught underwriting which made the processing tasks much easier and meant less touches on each file. When we moved to branches, it often took a lot of time to reach someone with any questions. The workplace culture was good with additional team members to bounce questions off of. Also having access to loan officers more readily. The hardest part of the job was at times the lay offs and the turn over of employees. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people which led to learning new ideas and resources. I made life long friends."
good,Wells was a fabulous place to work with the exception of the low pay scale to employees. The environment and people were great. Opportunity for advancement was limited.
good,"WF focus on providing a great customer experience, employees are encouraged to develop themselves for career opportunities. Working with team members to provide service to our internal customers."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A nice place to work. A lot of practice with numbers and a high volume of clients. Great benefits as well as a fair pay. Enjoyed the hours and the companies policy’s
good,Great company to position to work for and obtain. Career advancement is really pushed throughout the company. Tuition reimbursement is available. Off weekends and holidays.
good,"Fast placed very busy stressful but loved it"
good,The company recognizes work well done by giving commensurate bonuses and commission. They treat the employees monthly lunches. Give regular training for advancement and improvement. Give proper coaching.
good,Wells is overall a good place to work. The staff is friendly and the work was consistent and steady. The facility is centrally located and very accessible.
good,The most enjoyable part about my job was the interacting with different people and enhancing their needs.  The co workers were also nice to work with.
good,"Interactive with customers all day everyday, ensuring their needs are taken care of.  Opportunity to learn lots about the financial world.  Have to meet weekly activity goals to show you are doing your best to meet customers needs."
good,Wells Fargo is an excellent company to work for. I do not have anything else to say. I do not wish to offer any other comments or reviews at this time.
good,"well compensated"
good,It seems most Tellers are part time.  I would feel more secure if they offered full time Teller positions.  They do have full time positions ... but it's 1 full time to 3 part time.  It's been a few years since I have worked there ... but I remember the benefits were top notch.  Hoping that hasn't changed.
good,I worked in a mortgage branch located in downtown Birmingham and had a strong manager and a good support staff at the office.  I enjoyed my time at Wachovia and left because I was changing industries.
good,Wells is a great place to work and I believe anyone can thrive there. I have had a good experience working there. The company does show their employees leadership examples.
good,Has great culture and strategic initiatives help each employee stay mission focused and customer engaged. Team members are friendly and after hours connections as well work relationships are easy to generate.
good,There are some great people in this department. The workload is definitely not too much and if you have an issue with your workload there is an environment where you can voice your issue.
good,Flexibility to swap schedules was available but having to look around just so that you don't show up late for work was always a challenge. My manager told me that I had to perform to earn my requested schedule but that still left me on the losing end and my request was honored.
good,"My time at Wells Fargo was all business and no play, I believe this was due to fact that I was contracted for limited time. Objectively the organization seems to be well organized and dedicated to it's expansion."
good,"Everyone in the branch is committed to helping each other thrive in the environment. However, it is difficult to come into contact with upper management outside of the district at times."
good,"Started out with very good training, extra hours when branch was short staffed. The benefits are excellent except for the health insurance (high deductible plan). Very hard to advance."
good,"Working new and existing cases for customer-related issues with the mindset to try and do what is best for the customer.  It taught me how to better multi-task, prioritize and work more efficiently.  Workloads and be high and there is a fair amount of stress but it was rewarding when a difficult issue is resolved."
good,"I worked with this company right before the legal trouble they went through. Even then, the sales goals were attainable but it took a lot of hard work."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A typical day at Wells Fargo was back-to-back phone calls. Each phone call ended with a soft sales pitch about a product or service that may fit the customer.
good,"It is a fast paced environment, but very inclusive. It has a lot of different activities to work in a group activity. My position is one of the most important positions because we are the ones that talk to the card holder daily."
good,"Typical day was sales driven."
good,"I enjoyed the daily interactions with the customer, and the different transactions that they needed assistance with. I enjoyed my connection with my branch members. I also enjoyed the clean environment. I sometimes travelled as a teller to different branches to assist and they invited me back multiple times to assist. I assisted multiple customers, and encountered many different request for transactions."
good,"I spent about two and half weeks in training and then spent a week shadowing. I got hired on at a busy branch so it was pretty intense when I was first on a box. The managers could be a little better, but overall the environ is good."
good,"Great management, opportunities to grow & learn, flexible schedule, more time dedicated to work than meetings, the environment is conducive to allow for ""heads down"" work and work-life balance is a priority."
good,Great place to work. Great Benefits. Family Oriented Team Environment. Paid time off and Volunteer Opportunities available. Child Care assistance is offered through Bright Horizons. The opportunity for growth and advancement is excellent. Good company that allows you to grow and expand your knowledge.
good,Slow paced environment but it was still fun and i did learn a lot about banking. Branch's typically get slow through out the day which makes time go really slow.
good,"I am fortunate to have a great Manager. We work in the branch as a team which makes it a great work environment."
good,Good work culture with work life balance and opportunities for advancement.  Banking industry is undergoing enormous change due to demographics and disruptive new ways to manage financial assets.
good,With Wells Fargo going through a rough time with the scandals and law suits that they paid out recently. I can definitely say that they are working hard to reverse their image and help the customer as much as possible. they are implementing many different programs to help their workers better understand the customers needs and wants.
good,Management team strives to see you advance within the company. Sometimes extremely hard to make advancements due to lack of hiring. Flexible hours for collage students and multiple jobs people.
good,I really like working there. They provide a fun Place to work with a productive goal by end of day. Good training provided. nice working environment. Everyone is very nice.
good,"day to day was always interesting, people that i worked with were fun to be around,training was good, work place culture was very good,most enjoyable part of job was the completion of the job, a job done riight"
good,"I didn't want to leave.  They are a good company, but wanted advancement that I could not find.  Good work life balance.  The support their employees."
good,"While there are many benefits for working for WF, the most challenging is career advancement. There are few opportunities or affirmations with promotions."
good,A great place to work if you want to go into banking. You can move up fairly quickly if you put your mind to it. I got promoted within 8 months even though they say you should have at least 1 year in your position.
good,The overall experience as an employee was average. The branch I worked at was very unorganized and the teams communication was at an all time low. Management was not on the same page and all had different visions for the team and workplace.
good,"Flexible hours, great place to network and make good money."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Loved working for Wells Fargo besides how low the pay was. Helped count money and make sure company was following appropriate policy. Helped customers have an amazing experience.
good,I enjoyed worked for WF. My department was part of mass layoff and unfortunately I was not able to find another job internally.  I would be eager to work there again if the right opportunity was present.
good,"Management became too focused on quantity rather than quality, not in an overall detrimental way, but if it is not addressed could lead to issues. It pits team vs team, and creates somewhat hostile emotions between members in the same department at times"
good,"I was promised that Wells techies could retrieve my past customers from a CD that was created at National City Bank.  That did not happen and I lost ten years of customers, which left me with no way to contact all of my previous customers."
good,"There were always promotions. In my time there I had three managers. The first two were great and always pushed me to be my best self and encouraged me to apply to higher positions. My most recent manager is never there to support us and only acts the part when the district manager stops by. She is also always late, takes extremely long lunches and leaves early."

Know your boundaries, limits, and expectations, and you'll be fine! Wells Fargo is a great place to start your career, however, after 5-7 years you feel like you can't learn anymore unless you find a new role. Well you can't find a new role because its extremely competitive and all about who you know. I wouldn't stay long term."

good,"Even considering the immense regulatory environment, Wells is a wonderful plate to work with many opportunities for growth, and has a great an effective diversity and inclusion culture."
good,"I worked in the Winston Salem office and it wasn't that bad of a place to work. My direct supervisor was stationed in Charlotte and she was very understanding. The only flaw with WF is the amount of criticism it's facing with the government. With all of the audits and penalties it's facing, job security is definitely a major issue."
good,Great company to work for. Best work life balance. Great benefits. Good managers. Good products. Wonderful colleagues. Best company to work for. Will definitely work again.

good,We all help each other to succeed. Great environment to work in. Friendly team members. Very flexible in working with your schedules. Tuition reimbursement. Excellent benefits. Match 6%.
good,"a typical day at work is managing my pipeline, based on report. I learned a lot about the mortgage industry and corporate america. Management can be displaced for non-performance reasons. Work culture is very diverse and laid back at times. The hardest part of the job is peak season dealing with money hungry hmc that try to quickly push a loan through with a whole lot of problems and dealing with ignorant customers. Most enjoyable part of the job, they feed you a lot."
good,"Wells Fargo as a whole takes really good care of their employees. The knowledge that they provide team members are not only essential at work but in everyday life as well. Character building, guidance, and even my own personal training has grown while with the company. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to go out in the community and talk about growth, progress, and teaching people how to save for the future. Wells Fargo can be very hands on when it comes to the community."
good,"I enjoyed my tenure with Wells Fargo. I left on friendly terms and my Manager was awesome. Additionally, I loved working at the CIC site and was impressed with all that it provided."
good,"Stay on your toes and focus on your numbers and you may just be alright. The sales goals and service goals are reviewed daily, and sometimes on the hour. You are monitored and there is pressure. The people aren't bad, and its a diverse environment, the only color the company sees is green."
good,Nothing to say in particular...contract position - would like to be closer to home and work outside the home more. That's about it for me on this subject.
good,"Great team work, awesome management. Fast paced. We celebrate diversity."
good,There is a lot of growth potential and management encourages growth. Fun all around good people to work with. One thing I remember the most is the ability to learn something new everyday.
good,"Wells Fargo did push me to excel in management thru on-going training and the opportunities to share that knowledge.  Over the course of the years I was involved in many different entities of the company.  It was on a continuous change for a while, but I walked away with a broader experience for it."
good,"Wells Fargo overall does offer a vast amount of career opportunities, and you have to start from the very bottom to get to where you want to be. A lot of branches and locations I have worked with and visited have poor management and a lot of slackers. Some branches are busier than others, but when you are apart of a busy branch the days get very hectic and stressful due to the high volume of customers and cash-handling. You learn a lot and there is always opportunities to learn more however, some managers are not willing to teach or are lazy and you have to pick up the slack. Having strong customer service skills is a must, however in banking we are dealing with clients money and you run in to many rude and obnoxious people on a daily basis, so sometimes its hard to keep cool. Overall, it is a good place to work if you are interested in Personal Banking, Finance, Accounting, etc. but for a job just to pay bills it sometimes seems not worth it. It's hard to move up to a higher position or get promoted unless you are a favorite by upper management and they already have you in mind. Other than the typical work cons, Wells Fargo can be very rewarding when you are given the opportunity to help someone in need, because people go to the bank just to see your smile and to talk about their weekend. I value my job because of the customers that have turned into friends and for the possible career advancements I could receive."
good,"Wells Fargo has come a long way from the pressure-cooker sales driven culture to it's current 'Change for the Better' campaign.  Customer experience is now the #1 priority and team member retention has drastically increased.  The company change has been on-going for one year and shows no signs of finalizing.  As great as this change has been, it can be difficult to understand at times why things are 'flip-flopping' so much throughout the year and what is truly going to be expected of your job.  Regardless of this, Wells Fargo is now a very tolerable place to work and advance your career."
good,Great place to work if you like dealing with customers every day and talking to people a great deal. Always opportunity for advancement. Feel as if favoritism is part of the job.
good,"It was great working in Wells Fargo with perfect life and work balance."
good,Good people working in a tough regulatory environment.  Solid products and services with a high focus on the latest technology and innovation.  Conservative lending practices established over the long term will service to protect the banks investors and clients a like.
good,"I worked for commission so my work was a little different. "

good,"Nice place to work for.  To advance is based on who you know. Depending on the manager, it is a great opportunity to learn a lot from the position. I would recommend working in commercial department."
good,Enjoyed my time with them.  I didn't have any issue's with them.  They gave a good amount of PTO and room for advancement.  You enjoy the team that you work it.
good,"Take phone calls regarding consumer credit cards"
good,"I have had a great experience overall at Wells Fargo as an IT Professional.  I have seen people leave and come back and get rewarded with higher pay and promotion/advancement.  I have been promised a promotion for 3 years and nothing.  This is my direct managements fault.  I have received a doctorate while working and it doesn't seem to be recognized or rewarded.  I cannot apply for jobs that from an education and experience standpoint I would more than qualify, but because I am grossly underpaid for my experience, when I apply for another internal job, they see the salary and cannot bring me to the minimum easily for the posted position."
good,"My position with Wells Fargo provided me opportunities to advance my career. The work is well organized by management, Expectations are provided in clear and concise way."
good,Lots of opportunities if you are looking in the right places. Management is there to assist in the best way possible. You need to be a motivated individual to be successful.
good,"Diverse Org"
good,People are great and overall pretty secure job but going through a lot of changes. Lots of ways to stay engaged if you choose to. As long as your flexible its a good fit. Don't have to take work home.
good,Quick interactions with clients while processing transactions. Multitasking was one of the biggest lessons in this job. processing transaction while converting and also selling products. It was like a second home and family. Hardest part was leaving to lunch or break when I would see a line. My clients hands down where the enjoyable part of this job.
good,"Never the same day twice. Always used the brain and creativity to think outside the box for solutions and better performance. Time mgmt needed and patience,"
good,Great learning environment and a patient banking coaching staff who will walk you along the way and help you get to your full potential at your own pace. A severe work schedule with minimum breaks throughout shift. Fast pace work environment with a friendly competitive atmosphere. It was difficult to bonus because one was only allowed 2 errors per quarter.
good,Excellent employer. Wells Fargo provides many advancement opportunities and gives employees the ability to work on their own with limited supervision. Great benefits and overall culture.
good,I had a great manager! I was pulled in to projects and I completed deliverables on time.  It was a great experience and my team was awesome!  Very fast paced environment.
good,The most enjoyable part was working with the people in the department and the outside agencies. I was able to learn a lot about title issues and the necessary steps to clear them.
good,"The roles I had was one that I could learn to grow. I learned to multi-task on a daily basis as I deal with upper managers, investors, vendors and mortgagors. I worked both in a group and alone depending on my projects. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help everyone depending on my department. The most enjoyable part was the learning, rewards and acknowledgment."
good,stressful and pressured to make sales. It was more important to make sales than what was best for the costumer. Management was not professional at all.
good,Wachovia was bought out by Wells Fargo. Most of upper management was let go but the difference was that Wachovia had good and solid technology where Wells does not. Lots of manual processes with Wells Fargo making processes frustrating where with Wachovia there was limited errors because of good technology. The pay wasn't as competitive but you would learn and be rewarded for your hard work.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Worked with Wachovia before it became Wells Fargo. Loved working for Wachovia. They were fair to their employees and took care of them as well.  I learned a lot about the various accounts to reconcile.  Always was able to grow within the company.
good,is a really good place to learn a lot of stuff about banking. a pleasure to work with a lot of nice people. managers and co-workers are really good to be working with.

good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work, as they see their team members as an asset worth investing in. There are plenty of development, training and professional advancement opportunities available to employees."
good,As a whole Wells Fargo is an amazing place to work. I have had few issues with this employer.  As per the normal work place there is always room for improvement in some level.
good,"Wells Fargo likes to hire within. Your promotion will depend on how hard you work. However, you have to be proactive and get involve in different activities so your name can ring a bell to the upper management. At Wells Fargo is about who and what you know."
good,"Enjoyable place to work, of course the usual issues with a large organization with alot of security concerns but all in all its been a good p[lace to work thus far."
good,No comment at this time.  People are very helpful and very professional. Once I have more time in I will perhaps provide more information.  For now the company has been great.
good,"Working at Wells was a true team approach to meet the needs of the client.  Each member knows their responsibilities, but we all will step up and assist where needed to make sure no task is left undone."
good,I loved my coworkers and everyone was willing to help each other to get the job done. It was a very encouraging work environment. We found ways to make work fun.
good,I worked on a lot of different projects so I was able to learn a lot. I also collaborated with many senior management on high priority and time sensitive tasks.
good,"Great place to work and state a career.  Great pay, good hours, great benefits and you learn a lot about banking and business.  However, i was very happy to leave after 3 years, because i had found that i got everything out of the bank that I could have."
good,"Great place to work, gain lots of different experiences and advance.  Wells Fargo has a positive employee culture, pay and benefits are competitive. I recommend this employer."
good,"Overall, my experience as Wells Fargo was a pleasant one. I was hired as a contractor for my analyst role that was to take roughly six months and I finished my project in four months. I was in the commercial mortgage department and it was very structured, but each employee I met was friendly and worked diligently. My manager assigned to me during my time was incredibly welcoming and friendly and made sure I had all the resources I needed as well as made sure I had access to someone for questions when I had them."
good,"Learned tons of information regarding mortgages including escrow, insurance, rates, terms, etc."
good,Wachovia offered benefits that was financially rewarding.  It was hard hours but that is what is expected with the pay.  Wachovia has been sold to Wells Fargo.
good,"They have a good benefits package.  Healthcare, Vision, Dental, 401K, etc.  Enjoyed the inclusive atmosphere at Wells Fargo and the opportunities to grow and move up within the company."
good,"good place to work,"
good,"When i first started, i was real nervous because i was dealing with peoples money. It took awhile to catch on and learn all the procedures that are required. Some days were hectic and some days were great. You build great relationships with your customers. One thing i valued was having the customers you connect with requesting you to work with them and their accounts. The company really tries to help you out and work with you when it comes to situation dealing with your hours. The branch i worked at was unorganized and having the managers bump heads every other day that would make the work environment difficult. I constantly would ask my manager for more work hours. I was working 2 jobs and really wanted to make WF full time, and at that time, my supervisor asked me to apply for the 40 hr position but then slapped me in the face and gave the position to someone who had just started a month prior. and gave me the 30 hr. while i was the one always available & believe i put my all for this company. I quit my other job to make them priority to only be given 5-10 extra hours a week. Before quitting my other job, i was working over 50 hrs a week. So i went from 50 hrs with 2 jobs a week, to only 30 hours a week with them. It hurt me so bad and my bills started catching up to me. Just be careful with the branch you choose, and the people you work with because they were stressful for me."
good,Good company in process of restoring reputation. A lot of things to watch out for as far as compliance with everything that is going on in the news. Besides that I would recommend for the education and team experience.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,They had a great thing going until they made sales mandatory and then expectations grew. They really worked hard to recognize their employees but then the bottom dropped out on the events.
good,We had great performance but weren't/havent been named in the news so greatly. That just cause turmoil within some of our interactions. I've been in banking for many many years. I've seen many changes which is why I'm always set up to learn something new and I appreciate that very much.
good,"Friendly place to work- treats Team Members well. "
good,"Typically, as soon as you arrive to work you log on to the computer get in ""Ready"" mode and immediately start taking calls. Most days you are getting calls back to back. Ideally, calls should last about 3-5 minutes, but there will be those 10 minute calls and even up to 30 minutes. You do not stop taking calls until it is your break or you have a scheduled training or team meeting/huddle. The goal is to provide excellent customer service by being efficient, friendly, and knowledgeable. For me personally, it was mentally straining to have to deal with those customers who yell at you or do not understand the simplest of things. You definitely need patience for this job."
good,"I would be the first one in the office and the last to leave. I managed the office as well as the employees. I made sure everyone was up to date on their required learning classes and updates. Managed Schedules, sent packages and distributed mail amongst the employees. My manager was a hard worker and took care of his employees."
good,easy job that allowed plenty of growth fast paced and had plenty of room for advancement  willing to work with you in areas that need improvement and the company is fantastic about developing from within
good,A good place to work.  Stress level varies by the day.  Managment does a good job trying to keep up with the changes coming out of Washington.  My supervisor was good and tries very hard to make sure people have the tools for success.
good,"Process routine transactions for customers after verifying that signatures are correct, that written and numeric amounts agree, and that endorsements are present. Balance currency and coin in cash drawer daily at the end of shift. Navigation of multiple computer systems, applications, and utilization of search tools to find pertinent information. Focus on customer service, along with staying positive in interactions with customers and team members. Answer telephone calls and direct questions to the appropriate team members. Promote Bank products and services to match the customer’s needs."
good,Wells Fargo is a very progressive company with a great culture that anyone should be glad to work for if you find the job that suits your character. I would recommend working there to anyone.
good,I went from being and assistant to a home loan processor #4  culture was fantastic.  Coworkers always had your back and did not hesitate to step in and help or give advice.  I loved the fact that I could help people to keep there home or put them in a new one or even a home of  their dreams.
good,"you take anywhere from 80-100 calls per day, you interact with customer and coworkers, adherence and customer satisfaction are some of the most important things in this job"

good,I worked there for eight year and after every thing that happened there it is the only banking corporation that I would consider going back to after talking to the employees to I go into bank with
good,"I suggest negotiating the highest salary you can when starting your career at Wells Fargo.  Wage/Salary increases are based on an annual performance evaluation and the pay increase is minimal."
good,"Job was a stressful, but the peers and atmosphere working within were amazing.  The local and regional managers were generally great to work with.  Typically most days dealt with a lot of customer service, both in person and over the phone.  Competitive job that involved a lot of complex, in-depth work that must be in compliance with regulations."

The most difficult part of the job were the sales objectives and attempting to coach teammates to meet the almost impossible goals.
good,"I had a wonderful experience working at Wells Fargo. The company is not only customer focused, but gives to their employees constantly. The only reason I left Wells Fargo was due to being out on medical leave and positions not being available once I returned."
good,Wells is no longer a place where you can achieve advancement by being a sales shark. You must truly put in hard work and grow in your career to achieve advancement. I would say there is no better time than now to work for Wells Fargo.

good,The business took a hit this year which caused a large decline in business and reputation for Wells Fargo.  My job was something that came naturally for me and I always hit all of my goals. Hardest part of my job was only being able to communicate with customers by phone or email and lacking the face to face connection
good,I sit all day for 8 hours taking calls. I've learned a lot of banking and how it all works. The management is always there to help you when you have question. The teams you get put on are super social and willing to help. The hardest part is staring at screen all day and sitting all day.

good,"I worked for Wells on and off for 8 years in different parts of the country. The overall management and how the company works in terms of the mortgage side is pretty consistent across the country. How your environment is will depend on what department you work for in the company. The front line of mortgage is very stressful, not appreciative of its employees in an overall sense and management does not support a very team environment its pretty cut throat. The post fund side of mortgage is very different. The risk side is a great place to work, supportive managers and a great environment. "

good,I enjoy the interactions with customers and at WF they allow me to meet the needs of the customers. I receive daily feedback on my progresss and ways of achieving higher goals. Diverse culture and ability to work independently. I have been with the company for a total of over 15 years and it saddens me that I have to look for another company. Due to changes within the department I no longer can stay without having to move.

They have great benefits and room for advancement, but you have to be motivated to help Wells Fargo customers and their stockholders."

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo was an interesting place to work. The employees seemed content with working there and even bragged about it. A day at work can be spent either head down in my work space or at home.

good,I've been with wells fargo for 7 years. great benefits and work balance life. they give you extra holidays most people do not get and as much as a government worker.

good,"Working for Wells Fargo, for me was a tremendous experience mainly because prior to my employment I had never worked for any type of financial institution before.

Demand increased with little regard for work and family life balance."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I learned how to use Microsoft word, excel, and outlook much better. A typical day at work i would split up documents on the computer and trace a box around their signature. Otherwise, i would sort the mail that comes in and take the papers in the envelopes out and sort them by state. There was a variety of culture at Wells Fargo which always cool to me because there's so much you can learn from others. The hardest part of the job would probably be that there was no customer interaction in the area that i worked in. I am a big people person so i was not used to be isolated like that. Most enjoyable part of the job was how laid back and easy-going the employees and management were. Yes, they make sure you're doing your job, but they were always friendly and helpful towards me."

I have learned behind the scenes information regarding home equity lines and loans, as well as how the bank can re-coop losses based on fraud reasons.

When I was hired ti was to work as a teller for several months then get promoted to a personal banker which I had experience with from working as an assistant manager at an in-store location for IBC.  Unfortunately, a work freeze was implemented after I was hired and was not able to advance my position in the company for almost a year I was employed.  I ended up moving on to another company to increase my salary."
good,"A typical day at it me going in with a mind set to accomplish my goals that I set, whether its sales and helping as much customers in a timely manner to reach company goals, sometimes it tough, but for me learning never stops and management varies at time whether, but do their very best to meet company and branch goals, I try to help my coworkers in very way they need, because we are a team and team works together, the hardest part of my job sometimes is not making a customer happy not because I can , but knowing I couldn't  help them because it wasn't  part of my experience and the get upset about it.

good,"A Typical day at work would be I would come and open up all of my systems, i would then start taking cases out of the system and see if they had all of the components to be able to pass. Management doesn't really bother you. My co- workers would engage each other and me on a daily basis."
good,Wells Fargo is a great advancement opportunity. They promote from within the company. Management is mostly laid back as long as the work is done in timely manner and the quality is good.
good,"You have days where it is busy and it then it can be dead. It's not a steady flow of customers or people to help. Management can be micromanagers.

good,"Great place to work , great people ."
good,Great job if you want to work 40 hours a week and go home after. The employees were all great people just working to provide for families. Hardest part of job was being up against deadlines without the appropriate resources. Everything was constantly changing and you just have to adapt as its cooperate America true and thru. When I first started pay was great and as years passed they kept shrinking commission payouts and making the goals harder. The go getters are not paid much more then the bottom producers now which just made people want to do the job and leave not much more.

good,Wells Fargo Bank is a Professional work enviorment where one can utilize their developed communication skills to build life long customer relations.
good,"A typical day at work would be fine until you have those customers where you need clarification. The time it takes for the teller to get clarification, to get an override, to get help in general, takes time away from helping clear the line, to doing other operations. Training was a brief glimpse of what could happen. According to previous tellers who went to training a year, two years, ago, this wouldn't have happen. Training was intensive."
good,"I loved working at Wells Fargo! The management and supervisors make sure they get to know each team member personally and you just know you're in an environment surrounded by people that want you to succeed. The pay rate is very good for the job, however it depends upon the hours that you work. I was a Phone Banker 1 so a typical day at work consisted of taking about 80-100 calls, maintaining a certain sales (referrals) rate and average call handling time of at least 4 and a half minutes. It was not always an easy job to get done, but it was very fast-paced and enjoyable for the most part."
good,I am completely thankful for the opportunity I've had to work for Wells Fargo. They have great training and care about you as a person. The only issue I've encountered is their process for promotion. Daily I develop and strengthen customer relationships with Wells Fargo to gain their lifetime loyalty.

good,"Fast paced work environment, ample room for advancement, unrealistic expectations for sales quota, and very strict time frame to meet goals.  I was overall satisfied with the way the company operated.  I would recommend the job for someone whom would be a better fit."
good,Opening procedures were simple and always done in pairs. Morning huddles are a time to organize the day's goals and points of focus. Everyone in synergy during high-volume times always made it easy through stressful hours. Our service manager kept us in line while getting ready for our audit WHICH WE PASSED! My wish of one day counting millions of dollars came true.
good,My experience there is phenomenal. I have learned a great deal of responsibilities and requirements that are necessary to complete and get the job done as a teller for Wells Fargo.It is a great company to work for and the co workers there are extremely helpful and their desire to assist the next employee to move forward and be successful in moving up in the company is wonderful and extraordinarily unique.

good,"its a good place to work in you like to take 100-120 calls"
good,"Wells Fargo is a fast paced environment with plenty of room to grow. One thing I've learned is that the greater public lack financial awareness. Management style is based on how we receive customer surveys, if surveys are good manager are not overbearing. If you receive anything less than perfect you will be subject to coaching and micro managing. The co-workers I had to pleasure to work with have had great attitudes and were team players. The hardest part of the job was to trying to cross sell efficiently while building a relationship as well as completing complex transaction under a very short time frame. What I enjoyed most was the life long connections I made during the 5+ years that i've been there."

good,"Wells Fargo is very sales oriented, but the company provides sufficient training and coaching to team members. The hardest part in facing objections from clients. The best part was being well compensated for doing a good job."
good,pay is good the people are nice but 120 calls a day for customers calling in about problems you really cant help makes it stressful and having to service the call and refer or sell a product in under 4 mins
good,I have had the opportunity to work my way up this company. They base their hiring off of skills and experience not a degree.
good,Wells Fargo offers a very friendly environment that allows learning and growing.  My co-workers are very friendly and are willing to help out when they can.  I come across a lot of people everyday and I encounter a wide range of situations.  This allows me to prepare and learn how to react and solve a variety of problems.  Management also encourages questions to be asked and educates on policies and procedures throughout the company.
good,Good company to work for and learn how to be a call center representative in customer service. Focused on service and numbers.

good,"WellsFargo being one of the top Fortune 50 companies handling its own IT from India locations offers a variety of products and learning opportunities for an IT Professional like myself."
good,"Fast paced, demanding environment.  If you put hard work in you will get rewarded.

Overall, it can be a very rewarding company to work for when see first hand the help you can provide to customers during the largest purchase(s) of their life."

good,I enjoy my employer and position I hold. I have no intentions in leaving Wells Fargo. I'm simply looking for part time employment.
good,"I have found Wells to be a great place to work, if you can get in; referral seems key, which is expected.  Once you're in though, it seems hard to move positions and there is not much visibility in some areas because many of the positions are remote.  I have enjoyed my time, but would like to explore other opportunities to further my personal growth."

Most enjoyable part of my day was the unity of my co workers. Learned how to interpret and understand State Law terminology.
good,"Wells Fargo was an awesome company to work for. I worked at a fulfillment site where we processed loans. Management was great and the coworkers were great as well. You really start to become somewhat of a family after awhile. The hardest part of the job honestly was just the volume and the attention to detail. We were dealing with million dollar homes (million dollars and up - most expensive loan was $5,000,000). Since this was the case one mistake could cost thousands of dollars in penalties. I learned so much working with Wells Fargo, I owe a lot of my work experience to Wells Fargo from customer service to data entry and learning various types of industry software programs. The most enjoyable part of the job was THE FOOD! The home mortgage consultants would show their appreciation for all of our hard work by rewarding us with lunches. Management also provided food for any late nights we had to work. Wells Fargo is really great at providing incentives, rewarding your service by recognizing quarterly (if you meet the requirements), and ensuring that the team members are happy doing what they do every day."
good,A great place to work. The people there are like family and the work is fun since it's constant moving so the time goes by really fast. The most enjoyable part of the job are the meetings because it's usually about something fun. The hardest part about the job is catching up with old work.

good,American Tv was one of the best companies that I had worked for. Great management team as well as great co-workers. Very long work days but definitely worth it. Overall good products to sell and great atmosphere.
good,Enjoy working with the people/teams in Roanoke.  The work ethic is strong and Wells will work with you to develop your strengths.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company, you get to meet alot of people and days go very quick. Depending on the branch you process more than 100 transactions a day, well at least i did i was on the commercial side, i stayed busy all day. Really enjoyed working for this company, awesome benefits, and ok pay for an entry level job. I think i've always had great customer service skills, but this job just brought them to a whole different level, and co workers were a blast to work with. It is a sales job so you have to be on top of that, and sometimes it was fun to compete with my coworkers."
good,"Great place to work. Good Benefits. Proactive management, who are willing to help you succeed in career developments."
good,"Working with customers financial priorities and processing monetary transactions. Great place to learn how to adhere to customer needs that's what I enjoyed the best. The most difficult part but, still rewarding of the job was complying with sales quotas. Management was tough but, made the hard work worthwhile."
good,"Exceeded goals and recognized yearly for top performance by Wells Fargo."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"It's a fun place to work at, really easy job. Transactions are easy, not complicated. Coworkers are really nice and help each others. Managers are always there to help and can relay on."
good,"The company pays well and has a great compensation package, although the benefits are expensive. The job becomes tedious after a while as it is on the phones. The standards are strict but the management team is understanding and willing to work with you to acquire the skill set necessary to do the tasks required. You can have a lot of fun and it is a fast paced environment requiring focus. If you looking at getting something that is going to require attention to detail and clear communication skills this environment will require both, and challenge you to get better in those areas."
good,"Although this is a great company the salary may not be.  Like any employer in the 21st century, security for most workers is hit or miss. But, if you like the work and provide a fair days work with ethical habits you will love this organization."
good,"As a collector, we sit at our desks and contact customers that were past due. It is a face paced environment with heavy focus on incentives and the statistics that drive the incentives."
good,"This was a small independent advisory in which a lot of my role was not very clearly defined. There was a little of everything from working directly with clients, to securities and fund research, to event planning and marketing. No two days were the same. "
good,Started with a good supportive manager. The team was fun to work with. Everyone was eager to help each other out an to give feedback when appropriate. Always felt like an important part of the office.
good,"It was a nice place to work fast paced, but easy to do once you get the hang of it. Problem solving skills are needed. The managment forces you into moving forward even if you're comfortable where your at. Some want to move forward but can't. The system can be backwards, but if you're comfortable with that the job is good."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job are the people that I work with and the job that I do. I have the power to help keep mortgage holders in their home in their time of need. It gives me a great feeling of satisfaction knowing that I am helping someone in their time of need. My only problem with the current position is that there does not seem to be a lot of communication between management. You get a lot of different answers depending on who you ask. I have learned that the best way to get the job done is to rely on yourself and the policies and procedures that are posted online. Taking the time to do your own research, will save time in the long run and will avoid wrong paths based on what you asked or who you asked. The company in general has treated me very well and I will always be thankful for the opportunities they have provided for me, but it is time for a change and to broaden my professional outlook."
good,"Good Working environment and challenging day to day task."
good,"I have worked for the company for four years and I believe that this is a great company if you perceive it that way. There is many opportunities for advancement, if you work for it. The vacation time is really awesome."
good,"I worked at the Kansas City Wells Fargo Auto and when they shut down I transferred to Virginia Beach Wells Fargo Dealer services. These offices were night and day. I will set review on VA office due to KC office closed down."
good,"Same routine everyday very laid back job, Don't like the fact of Wells Fargo being so Hungry about their sales goals but understand the business of it. Always a constant up date or rule. Don't like that each district have their own different set of rules."
good,Management is user friendly and supportive and shall guide for the best career and more or less the team members are also supportive
good,"Responsible for providing customers with a “WOW” customer experience. Also, responsible for processing payments on customer’s accounts and providing them the option to set payment arrangements to best for their needs."
good,"Great Environment, had a very motivating team in my department. People are always looking to help you grow and improve. Good work/life balance, and project bring on good challenges."
good,"There is a fostering environment, that keeps you motivated and moving forward.  Career centric, your supervisor is there as a guide for you to use."
good,"good co to work for. lots of turnovers with staff and management, always good if you wanted to be promoted but no replacements when people did get promoted.not fair with the rules, management didnt seem to have anything or could come to your defence if something went wrong or a mistake was made either some one from the other dept would have more to do about a certain problem than management wouldnt even know what was happening until you were either being wrote up or fired, you really couldnt defend yourself they would just fired you without wanting to be fair and listen to your side.didnt agree with the way they handle conflicts."
good,Enjoyed working with wells Fargo .. Learned a lot...Well rewarded and good Salary and recgnition for best performance
good,Typical day consisted of detailed account of cash and outstanding customer service. I learned how to anticipate customer needs and provide a solution as well as government regulations and banking procedures. The management and co-workers all had a collaborative mindset to provide best service. The most enjoyable aspect was the maintaining business relationships with clients.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I work every day to contribute a positive attitude and try to make my customers and coworkers smile.  I strive to portray a professional look and conversations with customers.  I am a good listener, and feel that I am a good communicator.  With each customer, I look for opportunities to match them with a Wells Fargo product that will make their life easier or better.  I want customers to come back to me when they have future needs, so I create a personal relationship with them and when they leave me, they feel that they have been treated with care and respect.   The hardest part of my job is dealing with energy vampires, and I steer clear of them every chance I get. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and creating relationships.  Management at Wells Fargo is just enough hands on to feel guidance from them, but are not micro managers."
good,"I have total 3 years of experience in this company. As a Senior Financial Analyst I have learned so many things, i prepare Production, Quality and Other reports on a daily basis and handle team members and check the volumes on a regular basis to complete with in the SLA time."
good,"i loved it at wels the people there was great. They treated me like i was family the whole time i was there. The training class was very helpfull in doing the job, i learned alot the whole time i was therer and was sad that i had to leave"
good,"At the start of the day, I'm responsible for checking the ques, to see if there were any unfinished items/requests that were sent in after 3 pm the previous day, & if so, taking care of them. Then I'm responsible for opening the mail, sorting the mail & distributing to the proper areas/people within my department. Then I'm responsible for answering calls, emails or any other requests that may come in & QA all new loans updating them on the system as either orig. rec'd or deemed copy. Making sure all checks & unrecorded deeds are sent out to the proper people/area. If there are documents within these loan pkgs. that haven't been scanned onto the system, then I'm responsible for prepping and/or scanning them onto the pkg. so that the documents are available for viewing along with the rest of the loan docs. rec'd. Then, I'm responsible for checking to see if there is already a file for this customer on our shelf & if so, filing those loan docs. with the existing file. If there is not a file for this customer, then I'm responsible for creating a folder & label for the customer, adding in onto the system & filing it correcting within our file room."
good,Can be a great place to work depending on who you work for and where the location is.  Very goal specific.  People don't stay very long usually.  Always short staffed so hard to get vacations and time off. Loved the people that you meet and friendships you can make.
good,"Wells is a very large employer.  There are good areas of the company to work in, and some others that may not be as good.  There is plenty of opportunity to move up in this company if you work hard and make some good connections.  Typical of a large employer though, it is harder to make a name for yourself vs. just being a number.  I prefer locations that Wells has in the suburbs vs. downtown due to traffic issues."
good,"I enjoy working for Wells.  My manager and department manager are kind, intelligent, and respectful leaders.  They care about the products of the company, along with the employees."
good,"A typical work day included reviewing prior work day numbers and assessing for the future. Customer service was always there ensuring that every word spoken and every action taken was thought through and seemed right in the customer's eyes. Management was very strict "
good,This is one of the best companies to work with when trying to learn and advance through to different career paths. There is continuous training for every change made within company policy and daily huddles to help promote self-confidence and a productive work environment.
good,"ok to work for.  Great benefits, but ""my opion counts"" is really lacking. There are ways to move up. Just work hard and you will promote"
good,"•  a typical day at work: Monday to Friday (8 hrs /day)"
good,"A typical day for me at work is pretty usal. we come in an have our morning huddles, speak on where we would like to go with the company. We then open the doors to the customers and serve them with top of the line customer service that i thrive my self on."
good,A typical day at work for me includes processing loans and billing.  I learned to be detail oriented and to manage my workload in order to remain calm under deadlines. My co-workers are supportive and work as a team to facilitate smooth transactions.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of advancement.  The most enjoyable part of the job is facing and overcoming challenges that arise.
good,I have enjoy my work experience with Wells  Fargo. I particularly enjoy working for my current manager. He allows me to work without micro managing. I am more efficient this way. My job consist of consulting and advising borrowers of company products and working with our back office team to help to the loan get to closing. The only issues sometimes you work with others he may be burned out and may not share your same passion in helping out the customer achieve there overall goal.
good,I did fully enjoy working at Wells Fargo but i do believe they can hire better management. I had to leave because of my child being ill but i would recommend this company for anyone looking for a good steady career.
good,"Typical day included working on a computer with dual monitors. Used  a database system to resolve deficiencies found in loans. Learned a lot about mortgages and loans in general. Learned how to contact customers in the most efficient ways possible. Management was very helpful. Good training program, very flexible schedules. Great co-workers, if you ever needed help they would be there for you to explain the situation."
good,"productive workplace, nice workmates, fun to work with because of recognition every month. very supportive teamates. no payroll disputes."
good,"busy day is enjoyable"
good,"Go into work everyday with a smile on the face, ready to take on the days task. Whether it would be a walk in the park, or putting out fires all day.  Pulling together as a team to stand 10 feet tall reaching goals.  "
good,A great company to work for they promote balance between work and family. A bonus is number of locations and divisions they across the country and abroad.  I highly recommend Wells Fargo to anyone.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Training could be a lot better just because someone know the product does not mean they know how to train. But, the over all experience was great."
good,"Before Wells Fargo, it was called First Interstate Bank.  Great job, was like working with family.  Everyone helped everyone, management was involved with the employees.  Open door policy, bonus programs, great benefits, and a real pleasure to go to work.  "
good,training was good to get you ready for the job. if you work hard it easy to moved up. Extra hours are there if you need them. Got more money if work early or a late shift.
good,Stressful sales environment. Daily huddles around sales goals and what you need that day. Not much room for growth once you get to banker.
good,"Learned many aspects of the mortgage industry and self development.  My typical day is working my pipeline of files, obtaining/reviewing documents to complete HOA payment requests, emailing/phone calls to Associations-Title Agencies-Attorneys-Investors to obtain documents needed, completing excel spreadsheet for payments, requesting payee headers and FHLMC approval requests, assigning work to team, assisting with auditing and coaching team members while providing excellent customer service through the whole payment process and adhering to investor/state statutes.  I enjoy the team aspect of my job.  It takes all of us (co-workers, management) to be successful.  All of us help each other and learn from one another."
good,"In my position here I was a Customer Service Rep, did basic teller transactions and cross sales of bank products and services"
good,"Once you last a year into the initial position, you can request to be considered for a lead position.  And there are always lead positions available."
good,"Excellent benefits package and room for advancement, but the  compensation less than competitive,  Very fun work environment and the company is trying to gain more exposure in the marketplaces lacking a strong bank presence."
good,"Working within different areas of business, each area is varied in maturity as far as business model.  Some still focus on immediate/project need while others work through strategic planning to balance their business model from reactive to include proactive thought leadership."
good,A typical day would be engaging with customers and  obtaining their needs and meeting them. The culture is customer orient and I LOVE IT.
good,"Huge company where you get lost with all the people, But have a great management training program. Consistency is key in this company."
good,"Great benefit, good salary, and excellent environment, enjoyed working for this corporation."
good,"My review is"
good,"As a teller Wells Fargo is not a bad place to work. I don't have any complaints about the organization. One misconception that I think people that apply for teller positions think is that selling is the bankers job and that tellers just process transactions. That may have been true years ago but the fact of the matter is that this position is just as much a sales position as it is a customer service position. The tellers have sales goals (which are taken seriously) to meet just as the bankers do. Your primary responsibility as a teller is to process transactions efficiently and refer customers to bankers based on your conversations with them and what you see in their profiles. If communicating effectively with people while handling large sums of cash sounds like a feasible job for you, then go ahead and apply. This position can really be a launch pad if you can meet sales goals."
good,"I started in 2005 as a teller and was proud to leave as a lead teller. I felt it was time to ""leave the nest"" were I grew in knowledge, my comfort zone. I was ready to take what I had learned in knowledge on the teller side and grow from just placing holds and doing approvals for deposits when teller supervisors/managers were not available."
good,I love working with the public I make sure I do things right the first time and make sure when the customer is finish they walk away with a smile on there face and don't have to come back to ask the same question or feel a little on edge that what transaction we just did was not done completely. I also make sure that every customer is treated right to send the word of my customer service to there other family and friends.
good,overall a very good company for someone to find out what diversified financial services can offer in a career.
good,Learned how to sell services and products to customers. I received several awards and bonuses for meeting or going above and beyond my job duties. Learned about the banking industry.
good,"You will be on the phone 90-95% of your shift.  "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Team oriented. Team huddle every morning before work. The employees are a tightly knitted set of persons. Have developed my people person skills and team building skills. Great organisation to work.
good,"very great place to work"
good,"Well's Fargo Teller positions involve a strong sense of team work to achieve group goals. High expectation of consistent TOP customer service scores, along with high sales expectation. Strong money handling and processing ability required."
good,Wels Fargo has extremely excessive sales and service goals. It is a very fast-paced environment where you learn a lot about finances but deal with excessive amounts of stress. The hardest part of the job was to always score 100 percent on customer service surveys. The most enjoyable part of the job is most often than not helping people succeed financially.
good,"I enjoyed the environment  at Wells Fargo. The work load was constant and consistent. Management was great and helpful, there were daily pow wow meetings allowing employees to voice any concerns and suggestions. The only thing that I did not like was the department I worked in was the lowest paid but the most work. Over all Wells Fargo was a company that allowed advancement and continuous training."
good,Productive  and competitive environment with the ability to grow inside of the company
good,"I was a rehire with Wells Fargo, but had to start from scratch when I moved to California.  I was the Sales Manager of the mortgage department in Montana for 8 years and coached over 10 loan officers.  I was recruited from Citibank and worked for an incredible manager.  However, when my guarantee commission expired, I was still struggling with getting business from local realtors, thus why I made the change."
good,Would assist about 80-110 customers a day. Would take care of their needs and also find products or services that woulHd benefit them. I learned how to multi task. The hardest part of my job was while banker coaching. Had to show new hires how to service a call and look for customers needs. Was able to help them achieve goals and graduate from training. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers.
good,"Great company to work for, although the pay compared to other banks for the same position is lower than average."
good,"Lot of learning opportunities, friendly & approachable management,"
good,Energizing fast paced environment attention to detail. Co-workers like family.
good,"Great company to work for, I worked there 9 years, great management, balance between work and life, great benefits"
good,"Worked as an Research and Adjustment specialist, friendly atmosphere."
good,Well known company that is one of leaders in industry. Depends on who you are working under but I had a great experience. Great culture with plenty of resources to promote career development.
good,"really looks out for it's employees financially. When things went south with the economy, at least there was a good severence package for us"
good,"Every day is a good day with exciting work. I learned a lot after joining this company Especially, I evolved so much and extended my technical and domain knowledge over the time."
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. My position revolved around virtual reviewing. We review loans to make sure all of the data is correct before sending it to the next process.  I've learned a lot about loans while being employed for this company. Wells Fargo has a friendly staff environment and everyone is always willing to help each other. We are a team here.
good,"Wells Fargo was an excellent work place all team members were a delight to work with, my service manager was great along with store manager. everyone was helpful to one another and strive to be the best at their position."
good,a growing company with great exceling opportunities for those who want to advance in the company as leaders.
good,I enjoyed working with company I learned a lot about the banking industry. My co-workers were a pleasure to work with and I made a lot of friends there. The hardest part of the job was working on the weekends but I made it work. The most enjoyable part of the job was training new hires.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Not the best place to work. Money is not always right! You have a lot of customers that come to your line they haven't the slightest clue what the heck your talking about.
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo in the Home Preservation Department consist of managing and prioritizing task, which need to be completed from day to day. There is consistent communication with customers inquiring about the status of their accounts, as well as, the reviewing of documents provided for retention options available to avoid foreclosing on the home. I've learned many things such as, time management, punctuality and reliability in order to be successful in my role. My co-workers are very helpful in assisting with questions that may arise and also provide the additional morale that is needed to make the job enjoyable from day to day. The hardest part of the job is communicating decisions to customers that may not qualify for retention options. But, what I enjoy the most about the job is helping customers and advising them on the approvals that potentially assist with keeping the home."
good,"assisting with everyday bank transactions, cross-sales of all bank products, providing ""WOW"" customer service to our member of the bank, cash handling, counting and balancing teller drawers and the bank vault, opening accounts, providing members with financial advice, training new hires, making sure procedure updates were received and followed"
good,Wells Fargo offers a wide portfolio of financial services.  Employees come form a diverse background who focus on doing it right by the customer.
good,Couldn't have asked for a better company to work for.  They were great for working mothers and families.  Wells Fargo....not so much.
good,"very busy work environment, learned all aspects of banking industry, started as teller and worked my way up to financial specialist, excellent co workers"
good,"Great place to work, management is great, My co-workers are very help full"

good,"Great company to work for"
good,"I am able to expand my knowledge and understanding of title issues related to modifications and foreclosures.  This is in addition to my previous experience with closing loans for Source One Mortgage Corp, Citibank and Onondaga Savings Bank (Onbank) for the Serino Law Office."
good,I love working for the company. They are big on promoting from within before looking to outside people which is also a big plus.
good,"typical day was setting up money for day, night deposits, atm deposits, setting up supplies for all areas, getting money from vault when needed, go to different work locations when needed (float teller), friendly customer service, lunch breaks, 15 min breaks, fast and efficient customer service"
good,I had great leadership while at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage! They have a great training program that really allows you to feel comfortable when hitting the phones.
good,Great place to work and room for advancement. Good training environment.
good,love getting up everyday to go to work it did not work out for me after iI had my twins
good,"The management is excellent and clients receive great services."
good,"Wells Fargo was a wonderful place to work. The management was very professional, my co-workers were very helpful, the pay was pretty decent. The environment was positive. Very fast pace and challenging work environment. I worked at Wells Fargo for 8 years and I've learned a lot with dealing and handling customers. I've also learned how to help manage a team of 16 people."
good,"During my 16 years at Norwest I managed several operational departments. Updated procedures for all departments and created and implemented a disaster recovery plan for several departments."
good,"Recognition is one thing Wells Fargo is good at doing.  They do no let a good job go unseen or unheard.  Also, the enjoyable people that work for Wells Fargo make the job fun, as well as the dedicated customers."
good,"Pushed for sales. Both inbound and outbound. I opened accounts, and serviced customers accounts. I looked for ways to uncover solutions to help customers financially succeed. It was a fun and up beat culture."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"My last role (Sales Development Consultant) did not have a ""typical"" day - it was a jack-of-all-trades position.  I handled written/verbal communications, copy editing, internal marketing, project management, team supervision, business integration, and compliance."
good,A typical day at work is productive and challenging.  The days go by quickly.  My co-workers and manager are great.
good,"It's good company for part time, and if you like sales and don't want to worry about college, you can always become a banker a jump  into the middle class."
good,"Nice place."
good,"It all depends on your team, and I happen to have a great one.  Our manager is dedicated, open to ideas, supportive of goals, and yet maintains high expectations.  I am motivated to deliver results and feel pride in my work."
good,"Wells Fargo is definitely a great company to work for in most circumstances.  Management always seemed to encourage personal growth, even in the face of increased turnover.  Some departments can get a little sedentary, but for the most part there is much room for growth.  The compensation factor is curious however.  As someone who came to Wells Fargo at an entry level, the raise/bonus structure would work out better if I were to leave the company and come back at a later point than if I were to stay with WF my whole career.  Other than that though, great benefits."
good,Job was easy.  Met company quarterly objectives.  Co-workers were easy-going.  Pay was alright.  Learned maybe this company was not the right one in serving the public.
good,"•	Reviewing and closing of Mortgage Loans"
good,"My days consisted of informing customers about new promotions/ sign up deals."
good,"My basic job duties consisted of helping customers with their finances, providing excellent customer service, dealing with and meeting intense sales goals, and cash handling duties. I've learned a lot about different companies and the variety of opportunity in the business community. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate and unsatisfied customers. However, the most enjoyable part of the job was the diversity of situations and people i had the opportunity to interact with."
good,"Best place to work. Good work culture."
good,Very corporate setting where you get to interact and assist customers with their financial needs.  An individual within this position has to be very knowledgeable and compassionate when dealing with customers financial details.
good,"A day at work for me starts and ends with speaking with multiple clients about their finances and what financial issues or goals they have. I also coach other employees that need assistance during the day. I learn about clients financial needs and help them manage their money. My co-workers are open and friendly. But many of them have issues with the job requirements. The hardest part of my job is getting customers to see that they can do better than what they are doing. Yet on the other side of that, it is fun to see customer understand what is explained to them see them succeed financially."
good,"Great work when they hire you, try contracting first.  This company likes to keep its workforce educated and up to date on all aspects of your job.  There is even a management program."
good,"Opening of the branch ,preparing for the customers to start coming and giving great customer service"
good,"Working with a team of people that had been at Wells Fargo for years and knowing their strengths and weaknesses helped to create a team that really knew how to get things done.  My co-workers were good at their jobs (they should be, since I trained most of them) and everyone got along well.  Our management team in Minneapolis strived to make the team in Seattle feel very much involved with the decision making process.  They were the best bosses I've ever had."
good,"The best part of my job is being able to interact with my customers and my co workers, I thoroughly enjoy both!  I have held several positions in the 11 years employed here, and only truly have difficulty finding the right position at the right location!"
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work. Great leaders to look forward.
good,I worked for Wells Fargo over fifteen years in a multi-divisional financial service organization. Wells Fargo recognized my ability to succeed and provided myself a challenging and rewarding career with great management and professional work environments.
good,There is a lot of pressure when it comes down to protecting customer information and handling cash on a daily basis can be overwhelming at some point. co-workers are friendly and respectful and the company. There are also events that are hosted for employees just to have fun such as picnics.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Very diverse and community & family oriented company that recognizes and compensates its employees well for there dedication and hard work.
good,A typical day at work is usually very busy and non stop which I love.  I work best under pressure and try to keep as busy as possible through out the day.  Some of the best management and people that I've ever worked with.  There is a lot of comradery in this office and that's something that is very important to me at a job.  The bad stressful days are never so bad when you work with people you consider good friends.
good,Loved working for Wells. You are provided every opportunity to succeed at all levels.
good,Day at work at wells fargo menas contacting potential customers for origination to create revenue. the job I have larened and participated in has few shortcomings.
good,"I have been working with WF for over a year and the company is not bad. It has great incentive program. I have great co-workers, great support and great location."
good,"Even though I got laid off this is a great company to work for. Management was pretty good, and helpful. Work environment was fun and laid back. So much PTO you won't even know what to do with it all. If the mortgage business didn't go down I'd probably still be there."
good,"Being ideal with out work in office is the typical day at work, but spending that ideal time in learning something new is the most good thing. learned many things from the day one joined in this company as a freshier."
good,"This job was a call center job. the calls came in though a cube box, so I had to learn who to be quit on my feet"
good,A typical day at work would include managing the customer service floor promoting engagement and an overall fun environment.
good,Signing in and then have daily meeting to let know what to expect and what systems are down to make sure prepared for the day.  i learned to take calls as they come and make sure to include management when the cal requires of it. My co wokers educated each other and other resources to make each other sucessful. the hardest part of the job was to have to wait in a queue for escalations and have the customer get more irate.  I lloved the enviroment of having fun and feeling apprecaiated.
good,Wells Fargo is a great company with great advancement options.
good,"Stressful at times but also a great company to work for. Learned the in and outs of the refinance experience, also learned to work a pipeline,"
good,Loved working for the company just sad that my site was closed or i would have continued employment
good,"A very professional and business environment with room for growth and development, interpersonally and professionally."
good,"Professional work environment, unlimited potential for growth."
good,"•	7+  years’ extensive experience with Software Quality Assurance(QA) and Software testing process with a wide variety of projects and environments including strong fast faced Agile(Scrum) Methodology, waterfall methodology, intensive database applications,Web applications, Extracts and Oracle packages."
good,Have truly enjoyed my experience with Wells over the past 10 years at varying locations around the country.
good,"A typical day would involve sitting down on the computer and checking the paycheck related information for errors on this one software device they had. I worked a 2 PM-7 PM shift and when we finished the job for that day, we would take a break around 5:00 and do the next day's work. What I learned was to type at a brisk pace consistently for an hour or two at a time. It was one of those type of jobs where once you got the hang of it, there was no problem at all."
good,"Process everyday banking transactions. Approving teller overrides. Provide a high level of customer service emphasizing problem solving, a repeat of business, and establishing sales leads to hit daily targets. Order supplies including cash shipment. Detect, prevent and report fraud."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo offers great benefits to team members including matching 401k.  A typical day would involve making sure the whole store opens smoothly  and always maintaining team member engagement.  I manage a team of 10 tellers (directly) and 10 bankers as well.  The most fulfilling part of my job is when i see the team members that i hired get to the next level.  As a leader,  their success is mine as well.  I always want to make sure that create an impact in their careers.  About 80% of my day involves helping and servicing customers to make sure we provide consistent level of customer service to every individual that walks in the branch.  While providing service, I also coach on finding solutions to make each of my customers' banking easier for them which then leads to sales for the store.

The hardest part was dealing with the corporate office and sometimes the accounting service centers made the simplest tasks difficult because we had to run everything by them.

good,"Outside of school, this was my first technical writing position. I enjoyed the experience of working with many different departments to determine their user needs and create the documentation, written and online, that helped them do their jobs. It was exciting, and I loved meeting with the clients, learning about the programs, and brain-storming a new approach for users to access information. Projects were discussed, needs were accessed, and writing and editing took place, and deadlines were met.The process was like a well-oiled machine, and along with the client, I worked with editors, graphic designers, and program analysts to create the user-friendly documentation needed, as well as writing implementation packages and updating current documentation. I learned so much about how to work on four to five projects simultaneously, and how to work with the documentation team to meet deliverables. Everyone had a part to play in an effort to release a successful update, new user manual, quick reference card, or bulletin. The hardest part of the job was staying on top of clients to make sure they provided all the information that was needed to complete the project. The clients had many projects that they were juggling as well, so I had to learn to take advantage of every project update meeting I had to get my questions answered and to get the necessary information needed so I did not have to hunt people down later."

good,Wells Fargo has a very laid back culture. The California way of living has completely transcended into the culture of the company.
good,I worked in Customer Service answering phones and that can be a hard job to do at times but i did it. Corp. Trust was no joke and when MMKT drop it became more stressfull i was ready to leave only because the Customers lost a lot of money and they were not trying hear nothing but where is my money. Co-work was just co-work.
good,The overall work experience was great; there seems to be a high turnover at times. If you are looking for a career starting in Customer Service and working your way up would be the place to start.

good,"I enjoy working for Wells Fargo. I believe they are a great company and I received great pay and bonuses, although it is a very demanding environment. The work day and work load is stressful and the upper management isn't supportive. They put you through a great training program prior to throwing you into the lions den, so that was helpful. If you are driven and good at sales you will fit in just fine."
good,"The retirement plan is excellent with a six percent match rate, the free and discounted banking services are awesome, there's tons of opportunities to move up if you work hard- and experience is often seen as more important than education.

good,"Typical day includes handling and counting cash and providing excellent customer service. I learned the details of banking and sharpened my customer service skills. Management is very encouraging to reach goals. Co-workers are very supportive and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job would be running a six lane drive-thru on Friday alone. The most enjoyable part about the job is getting to know the customers and speaking with them, and also the fact that there are exact procedures to follow."
good,"They provide you with everything you need to advance to where you want to be. Classes, education, and mentoring is valued to help you succeed."
good,Wells Fargo as a corporation is an integrated financial services firm that will allow you access to many different arenas of the bank.
good,• Managed 25-30 customers at a time and to help them refinance their mortgages or give them a second mortgage.
good,A typical day at work you have 2 of these kind of days. your either really really slammed or dead as a rock. on the days your are slammed is the days to work so hard with customers on new sales as new checking savings acts credit cards etc. on a slow day you will usually still be busy just not as many sales unless your calling on the phone to sell products to customers and if you are really good at that you can get a whole lot of sales. But for most part your usually dealing with account maintenance.
good,"Overall its a good company once you are an employee, but for a contractor is not that great. They hire me for an 18 months contract and cancel it after 2 and a half months with only one week notice. I will not work for these people again."
good,"Early arrival before the customers charge into the quiet branch in search of the first available teller. Greeting customers with smiles, and working out their financial concerns, so they are completely satisfied that we helped them with their work in an efficient and perfect manner. While communicating with the customers about their plans throughout the day or how their previous night was the hard part comes in with trying to sale a bank product in Spanish. Although a manager was there to help me sometime, I was left alone at times to try and sale a product in a language I never spoke in my life. Managers were somewhat there to support me when I didn't understand a transaction, and at times they would just discipline me for not doing the job right when I couldn't understand the transaction in the first place. Co-workers would laugh at my disciplinary and tell me not to worry. Co-workers would also care when you failed at something, but not applaud one when something is accomplished. Ive learned working for this company that when it comes to work your alone although you smile at everyone and pretend to care, but at the end of the job day you only have yourself, family, and outside friends. In spite of the fact of being embarrassed in front of customers in a language I didn't understand, and laughed at by co-workers I enjoyed making sales in a different language. I also enjoyed the adrenaline I received when a new customer would walk up to my window because it meant I could receive a potential sale, a difficult transaction, or just have a friendly conversation."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I learned to audit and learn banking skills, learned advanced communication skills and computer knowledge, also advanced my speed using ten key pad."
good,"I love this job. Yes, its a bit repetitive and you do have to spend a lot of time on the phones, but I don't find it to be terribly stressful or difficult and its very easy to leave at work when you leave at 5. Lots of opportunity for bonuses and overtime. Too bad the job is an interim position and not permanent. Knowledgeable managers that don't over-insert themselves into your day-to-day routine but are more than willing to answer questions and work with your personal life schedule. I just think its a little strange that they tell you this is not a permanent position, but then won't let you post out for a year."
good,Early start hours
good,"outstanding place to work , excellent trianing. strong brand."
good,Great work enviornment. team members are easy to work with. laid back workplace.
good,"It can be a challenging job at times because it requires high sales goals and you constantly have to remind yourself to put those as your top priority. The management is motivating and the coworkers are the most enjoyable part. Overall, a good company to work for."
good,"Supervise 12 employees, have all my reports for the day completed in a timely manner."
good,A typical day at work sometimes can be hard but whats wrong with a little challege I strive hard in everything I do.
good,"My work day started as soon as I walked in the door. We always had people in the building. I worked near two hospitals and three colleges so thing were always hectic. I had to learn how to not only do my job, but to learn to assist other co-worker when needed. That means knowing there job just as well as my own. I learned the different products and took it upon myself to learn about other products that I was not required to know just to stay above the pace I was required. If I had down time I spent it making phone calls and updating myself on our system just in case there was something new. I used my own method of organization and could tell when anyone was in my space. I would stock up on all the supplies I needed so I would never have to stop and look for anything. If there was something that needed to be done on the Teller side they would always come to me. The manager coming to me all time was an honor, but also was overwhelming. This job was very stressful, but I loved my Customers and helping people is very rewarding in itself."
good,"The customers can be EXTREMELY rude, you have to deal with anything they come back at you with. Cursing customers is an everyday thing, The pay is not worth the stresses of the job. The management is wonderful, they will do anything to try and help you. The co workers are also great, they are very helpful and are willing to spend time with you to work on things you need help with."
good,Helping customers secede financially while delivering great customer service.
good,A typical day would be delivering great customer service. I was able to learn how to communicate with customers on two different levels: the face-to-face level and through the motorbank. The management could have been a little better. I loved working with most of my former co-workers. I developed many friendships after leaving. The hardest part of the job would have been the irate customers. The part I loved most was the relationships I made with my customers.
good,I really liked my job and working for the call center. The co-workers were like family. The promotions were nice and steady. I learned a lot with computers and I was allowed to be creative and I had a voice on the team.

good,I have many positive things to say about Wells Fargo. If you are a hard worker and can meet or overcome goals you can go far.
good,Had the most amazing people to work with. Everyone in our department pulled together and worked as a team for fifteen years. If a team member fell behind the rest of them would always assist to make sure our jobs were done properly and orderly so that we could meet our deadlines on time. This company was also very understanding to the needs of their employees if ever in a crises.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I've enjoyed working for Wells Fargo thus far. I believe that the banking industry has a very strong contender to deal with. Wells Fargo is a conservative bank with innovative ideals to achieve their goals.

good,"Wells is a great place to work , you come across many experienced individuals who help you gain knowledge, Things move a slow pace so it can be challenging for technology oriented people to cope up with slow pace."

good,Reliable job that works with their employees. I've been promoted 3 times within my 2 years with the company. Workload can be a little stressful at times but the company is constantly rewarding and acknowledging the additional steps non-management agents take to assist clients.
good,I grew my skill set immensely working along-side great leaders. Understood my career path and assisted in building a map to get to point B. I would recommend Wells Fargo to anyone seeking a start in the financial industry.

Then I have my first meeting of the morning, then I follow up and do some work to get my project moving forward...and then I take my afternoon calls and things start to slow down around 4pm.

good,This job allows room to grow and to succeed as a team member as well as individually. I was thankful for the opportunity after my job search and was offered this one.
good,"The buildings are getting remodeled so everything is brand new and very modern. Unfortunately the work is very repetitive, but it can be rewarding. Especially when you are able to save a home from foreclosure."
good,"Over all it's a good place to work. They changed a lot so incentives and bonuses aren't that great and pay stayed fairly the same. Benefits are fully covered and 401k is available. They do consider 30hrs a week ""full time"" which i had an issue with. As well as in branch bankers have to go through the STAR interview process. If you dont answer accordingly, you dont pass the interview. I  I res"

I was initially assigned rather simple projects which involved updating existing training courses.

I would welcome the opportunity to work there again."
good,Overall good work experience and customer relations.  Team  building.  Sales goals are hard but achievable.  Great management support.  Great benefits.
good,Wells Fargo was a fantastic place to work with a company culture that is tailored toward its employees. Wells Fargo would always celebrate employee's successes. Management was known for serving food and hosting competition that foster teamwork and leadership.
good,"The job isn’t necessarily bad, it’s just the fact that when you’re taking customer calls, the customer is allowed to curse at you and call you names but you have to sit there and take it. You can’t hang up if it gets ridiculous, tell them to stop, or give them even the slightest bit of attitude otherwise you get in trouble, like most other customer service jobs. The pay is really good for being an office job, and the company itself is really flexible for any accommodation, but the managers talk about their employees all the time and don’t care who hears it."
good,I enjoy working with my leadership and team members.   I learned a lot regarding banking especially regulations regarding the industries.  The training is on going and feedback is given in a positive manner.

My main issue with the job was that management did not always have it together (schedule being late, not ordering things properly, bickering) which really affected the branch as a whole.

good,"The Private Bankers I work alongside at Wells Fargo, have a great amount of motivation to make deals and close loans on time. This motivation helps to drive me in my work, but could also be stressful when we had numerous loans closing at the same time. An incredible amount of organization is needed for this job in keeping all loan files on par with their loan progress and closing date. A very rewarding position when sales is a priority and a top skill of yours."

Their FMLA cases were handled by Liberty Mutual, and that was an unpleasant experience. They essentially gave me the run around until Wells Fargo had the grounds to fire me. My experience actually working for them was very good. My boss, as well as many of the team leads there were very fair and friendly. They offered overtime and I never felt like I was being targeted or picked on. They even managed to offer me accommodations for a medical problem I had. As long as you work their, you shouldn't have a problem. My only recommendation is to be careful when trying to get FMLA or any sort of extended time off with pay. They will drop you in a heartbeat."

Your adherence to your schedule will be affected with the possibility of corrective action and you could even get fired  no matter how well you do on your call or how well you service you client - you could still get fired just for taking a break if its outside the scheduled time, when you yourself cannot control when a client calls in."

The work was the result of a regulatory review and as such, high visibility at the executive level.

In the end, the phase that I worked on was completed through a massive effort by multiple teams pushing for a successful project end."

It was fun, competitive, and everyone one there cared about one another. We were treated fairly and management did everything in their power to help you inside and outside of work. The only thing that didn’t work for me was my schedule because i was trying to go back to school, but i would definitely recommend the auto collections dept."
good,"Great management. Great benefits. Good pay. Great company to move up in. If you can get in Operatons, do it................................................................."
good,great company to work for. Gained a lot of knowledge  working in the mortgage field. Wells Fargo is wonderful  is a great company to work for and also a great company to grow with! The knowledge i gained in mortgage field working in the call center was a great experience.
good,"Fast paced cash handling and transaction processing for banking clients. Assist customers meet their needs or refer them to the proper resources. Build rapport with customers as colleagues."
good,"Wells Fargo Financial was a great place to work.  Great team atmosphere.  The only problem was that Wells Fargo Financial closed, leaving all of us to look for new jobs"
good,Loved all the people I worked with at Wells. Management was fair and made working there nice.  Wells is always training and making sure all employees know what is right and what is not tolerated. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes there just weren't enough hours in the day to meet all the work that was coming in.  I liked learning all the products we could provide to a customer.  Then being a part of making it happen.
good,Very great place to work. team members and customers are the reason people stay at wells fargo.customers make wanting to come to work worth it. very caring enviroment
good,Enjoyed working in the fast paced environment Wells Fargo provided to employees. Would definitely consider working for Wells Fargo Bank in the future.
good,great development program where managers take took the time to figure out your goals with the company and help achieve those goals with your given commitment. They love to promote within when they see that someone has gone above and beyond to develop their career.
good,"After eight weeks of intensive training in DDA accounts, I moved from a classroom to a desk where I took calls from Bankers; bank employees located all over the world. On average I received 110 calls per day with each call lasting around 6 minutes. Sometimes I would receive calls that took much longer and required time to help the banker get their customer exactly what they need. I enjoy talking to people and helping them; which is exactly what I got to do a hundred times a day."
good,"My typical work day was arriving early to set up the store by counting cash making sure Tellers were ready to go and preparing for my appointments I had set for the day. During the day while I did not have any customers I was continually learning to new policy and procedures, calling and setting new appointments, taking walk-in customers, and also participating in offsite events. The hardest part of the job would have been adjusting to all the changes Wells Fargo was going through at the time. Wells Fargo had gotten in some serious trouble and was scrambling to make changes to its culture and its policy and procedures. The best part of the job was being able to help all my customers with any of their financial questions or concerns. I really enjoyed helping customers by providing several different options that they had not considered before."
good,I would either open or close the bank.  I learned all the mandatory federal regulations and always made sure that the reviews on those were done yearly.  I truly enjoyed taking care of our customers and insuring that their needs were met.
good,It was a good place to work but was heavily regulated and procedures were constantly changing.  Compensation plans changed almost annually.  The benefits were very good there.
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to work for. All of the employees were very good to work with and for. The customers were mostly great and you really got to know the ones that came in often. Wells Fargo had great benefits and were really a family oriented company. the only downfall I could see was the sales goals. It would interfere with the transactions you were doing for the customer and very often they would get upset because they were just in there to have their transaction  taken care of and not to be sold products every time they came in. Now that the sales goal program is no longer it should be a great place to work.
good,"Worked with wealthier customers, handling your everyday banking concerns over the phones, doing things such as Moving money from one account to the next, taking blocks or holds off cards, change of address, replacement cards, file claims for fraudulent activity on the account etc."
good,I start my day with checking e-mails and voicemails. Make phone calls selling mortgages to customers who are new to us or have an existing loan. Send and reply to e-mails from management and customers. Attend meetings when scheduled and training. Work with Home Mortgage Consultants sending leads to them for applications. Give education pieces on credit down payment and resources as needed. Overall good environment. Diverse and easy going. Most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I helped educate someone to where they felt comfortable with our company and our loan operation and being successful in sales.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Productive company with many opportunities for growth within. Company offers shift bids for possible schedule change from time to time which allows you to change your starting schedule in case you don’t like it
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work for, the customers are the best and so was management in my department that I worked in. Great at collaborating with other departments as well."
good,I was really happy when i got the job at wells Fargo. It taught me a lot. It gave me confidence. Tbh i thought tellers shouldve made more. Because we are the face of the company. Iwas low key stressing on sales but if you know your job and you have the passion it wasnt as stressful i always made my goal.
good,accomodations were awesome! their scheduling system was the issue for me as they were unwilling to accomodate my schedule to allow me to keep custody of my child. I was forced to find employment that was willing to work with me more.
good,"I have been with Wells Fargo for a bit over 6 years now. I have had success and difficulties with the company. The management has helped develop me and move me up and down (my option) the corporate ladder. They have good benefits with health, eye, dental, law, death.... and a great 401k match rate. They have moved in to right direction of the last couple of years. There has been some less than great press in the last few years, but they are still taking care of their clients and most of their staff members."
good,"Working for such a well known bank has its perks:"
good,"Now that sales is gone it is a lot better. 2 weeks of on the job training. Customer surveys can get you a pretty big bonus. The healt benefits are a little high, but they give you money towards your deductible every year"
good,"Everything is well. just need more pay for positions in higher ranks in comparison to what other banks are paying for the same position. training is good, benefits are fair enough"
good,Working with people through the foreclosure process can be stressful but it was rewarding when I was able to help someone keep their home. Wells Fargo offers a lot of benefits and it is generally a fun environment.  My supervisor and team lead were awesome.  I wish I wouldnt have had to move. Would love to have stayed.  The way a low and when I went to a competitor they offered me nearly $4/hr more with a higher bonus structure so I felt I wasn't being paid fairly after the fact.
good,"A typical say at work including functioning as a scheduled seller or teller depending upon banking center's specific needs, retaining and deepening relationships with banking center customers and "
good,"It was a great company to work for starting off. The people and managers I worked for were always great. Salary and benefits are also good, however, not enough room for promotions and development."
good,"the staff here really cares about you and your progress. everyone is willing to help each other out. since you are a commissioned role, the hours are somewhat flexible and the vacation time and holidays are a grea plus.the culture here is very inclusive and upbeat"
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for Wells Fargo.  I mean there will be a few hiccups here and there.  You won't always get along with a manager or a coworker but...in my experience...we were like family.  It was very hard to find that anywhere else.  The pay was great for starting out.  They train you on everything.  It was a great job and it opened the door to a lot of other opportunities.
good,Great work/life balance with relax atmosphere and collaborative team approach.  Excellent benefits package with above normal time off.  Overall a good company to work with.
good,"Working at WF is largely determined by the Managers' personalities and beliefs. The first branch I worked at is a lot more stressful, demanding, and competitive. However, it wasn't the case in the other location I move to. They are very caring, professional, and supportive in our personal and professional growth."
good,Loved the fact that we were able to work from home 80% of the time. Learned many new testing tools and methodologies. Management always backed their employees.
good,"What stood out to me most about my time at Wells Fargo was the genuineness of the people who work there. From day one I felt very included in the group. Shoutouts were given frequently during the morning huddles, giving recognition to the hard work that my coworkers and I did."
good,We all enjoy may activities. Being working there we can solve any kind of problems and most enjoyable place to work. We have many cultures in this place.
good,Enjoyed managing a book of business acting as point of contact for these same clients.  Great partners within the bank.  Benefits were great.  No opportunity to advance from Retail to Wealth within the bank.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I actually never fully hated my job at Wells, but the infrastructure here is just not built for everyone to be remote.  No 2 people IW ork with at are in teh same city, yet we're still using lync to communicate.  There is a seperation and it causes a feeling of frustration when they're determined to move their projects to SCRUM style project structure."
good,Great Management. Lots of calls. Most of the time it's doing password resets for customers. Managers are always willing to help. The people I've worked with are great. Everyone helps each other.
good,Enjoyable place to work. My supervisor was fantastic and provided a great work environment. My co-workers were also very great to work with and provided for an excellent work environment.
good,"Great company to work , old system but a team environment , every one helped each other to get thing done , no bully no unfair treatment . Work was simply just the system was out dated."
good,"I believe this company is almost too big and therefore sometimes the left hand doesn't always know what the right hand is doing.  I had a different experience in each department I worked in, even though I was doing the same job."
good,"Place for career advancement, opportunity to grow within the company but low commission pay. Began with the company as an entry level banker and advanced to become licensed with a series 6 and 63."
good,A typical day at wells fargo start with a lot of loans that i have to go through first thing in the morning. While working at wells fargo I learned how to own a home and more on home loans.
good,"Work is balanced each day, not stressful. Opportunities to learn new things with/without asking. Good place to work. Hard part is reaching production."
good,"Good company to work for, team members are always there to help, great discounts and benefits for employees. Company that cares about your and your family"
good,I learned from this company that they promote advancement from withing. This company doesn't want you to stay in the sat place too long. The hardest part of the job is staying the path. The position is demanding but you will get used to it. Management and fellow employees are willing to assist and advise.
good,"Inbound/Outbound call center for building and maintenance repairs for Wells Fargo locations. Assisting customers, team members, property managers, and vendors with opening work orders and service request for janitorial, landscaping, HVAC repairs, plumbing repairs, lighting repairs, door and lock repairs and more."
good,I loved working for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage but it wasn't without stress and a lot of hard work. Management could have used a bit of help with interacting with employees and making each person feel valuable.
good,"the management there want to se you excel and help you work towards goals you have set for yourself to improve within the company.  Every three months you sit down with management and they make sure you are working towards those goals.  A typical day is taking calls from customers that come in to enroll, withdraw, borrow or cash out their accounts from their 401k plans."
good,It was a fun experience. I worked with a great team and I learned a lot. I learned to be patient with people and how to resolve issues. I learned how to follow proper procedures and manage a team.
good,"Working for Wells Fargo has allowed me to meet and work with many diverse individuals, both team members and outside the company. I appreciate the philanthropy we practice and that we are encouraged to volunteer in our communities.  It is a fast paced environment. It can be very challenging to meet the requests and needs of the different individuals and teams I support. While I enjoy this challenge, it is one of the hardest parts of the job."
good,"I loved being a Financial Advisor; however, you must rely on a great partnership with the community bank. After the settlement, this relationship was broken, and so I left to avoid not getting paid."

good,Wells Fargo offers some paid community service time and gives numerous opportunities to volunteer in the community. There are also tons of committees to be involved in.

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,This position was a typical call center environment. I enjoyed the employees and the culture. There was a team environment everyone working towards the same goals.
good,Wells Fargo is a very good place to work.  All that is required is to follow rules & regulations.  Management has room for improvement. There are too many conflicts of interest there.
good,"Good place to work with reasonable daytime hours. Sundays and holidays off and a lot of paid time off compared to other jobs. The job is stressful, though. Robberies are a constant concern."
good,Wells Fargo was a place that allowed me to try several roles in a short period of time and allowed me to build other skills as long as it benefited the business
good,"great place to work with advancement opportunities and great work life balance, however it can be stressful and may be too fast paced for some as well as having a lot of responsibility."

good,Wells Fargo Focus Salon in Customer Care. They also focus on being culturally diverse. They always look at the bigger picture of maintaining a customer long-term instead of just focusing on numbers.
good,Great place to work if you want career advancement. The company is big on hiring from within and management is very supportive if you want to learn a new role or gain more resposibility. The only thing I don't like is the mandatory overtime.
good,Wells Fargo will teach you how to become a great personal banker. it will provide tools and resources to assist current and potential customer. you will have the chance to move up within the company
good,Just wanted more opportunity to shine. If that would have happened I would still be there. Ill always miss my Wells Fargo family but when you have to make more money you go where they see your potential.
good,"The company has great working environment, and the Service manager and branch manager are extremely professional. But the pay rate is not that much and you don't get too much working hours if you only work part time."

good,"My overall experience at Wells Fargo was great I would still be working there if not for being laid off because of budget cuts. the hardest aspect of the job was dealing with costumers sometimes, however they have a great training program there that teaches you to deal with people that are not so pleasant."
good,"What I learned most from working at Wells Fargo is that an environment based on focusing on the problem at hand and not trying to find blame is extraordinary.  As humans we all make mistakes, we don't see every possible outcome.  Focusing on solving the problems that arise in the course of normal operations allows truly cooperative teamwork."

good,great place to begin a career in banking. many resources are devoted to the development and education of team members at Wells Fargo. Management was strong and supportive.
good,"I was having fun there but the work culture is not good but the earning is good so yea, i'll recommend it to someone who is looking for big money. Nice place to earn."
good,Unorganized management and no room for advancement. It took 2 weeks for my supervisor to followup with me about any issue I had at work also I only had (monthly coachings) about 5 times out of the 16 months I had worked there. Good luck new hires.

good,Wells Fargo offers exceptional training and guidance throughout your occupation in order to advance and intake more experience. Very hands on and fast paced.
good,to work as a team  and provide exceptional customer service to all my customers. The benefits are great and they also have the 401k to help you with your retirement
good,As a teller you pretty much do the same thing every day.  All you have to do is learn policy ad procedures and be good a cash handling.  But you build a mini family with your co workers so its great .
good,"I am in a support role to an executive and their team. My role suits me perfectly as I am very passionate about my duties to provide professional, consistent and most confidential support daily.  I take extreme pride in my job and I have complete faith and trust in my boss. I love my job and I am very happy."

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Typical day consisted of working behind a desk, working at your own pace. It was a inbound/outbound blended model. I would look at accounts to mitigate fraud and assist customers with filing any possible fraud claims. A very fast pace position that you had to adjust to any changes which helped to grow and learn new systems if required or if they saw an opportunity to grow within the department. Everyone is very friendly with each other depending if you part of the same hiring class. Its difficult to get to know new faces since you had minimal time to do such. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help the customer with any fraud concern or being able to stop fraud before it happened and giving the customer a sense of relief that they are in good hands."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo. The managers are flexible and care about you as a person. They are good about listening to your needs and giving you the proper training.
good,"I would say Wells Fargo is a great place to work, if you can keep up. I was able to keep up and advance rather quickly within the two and a half years that I was there, going from a teller to a customer sales and service representative to a personal banker, and finally, to a service manager. The pay is good, not great. However, the benefits are excellent, so I suppose it ends up balancing out. When I worked there, they would give a full-time employee up to $800 a year for completing a few health-related tasks. This money would go into the individuals HSA."
good,Working at Wells Fargo was a huge learning experience for me. I took on big responsibilities and had to know many policy's. Once i got that down pat it all came together. I loved building report with my customers and i really feel like i made their days better. Management was probably the hardest thing about the job. They most of the time let the stress of the job impact the way we were treated and if you couldn't handle that then the job was a lot harder. I for sure could even brighten their hardest days. All in all i loved my job and hope one day to get back into the banking buisness
good,Help write processes & procedures. manage day to day operations and work flow with in our department. Work production queues to help the team meet SLAs & deadlines.
good,"The pay is great. The benefits are alright. The hours are fairly flexible, which tends to accommodate our home life. I do enjoy the one hour lunch. Management is firm, yet patient. A typical day at work is me sitting at my desk for eight hours doing my job. We do have team meetings and coaching sessions throughout the week, but I much prefer to be left alone so that I can get my job done."
good,research. I enjoy researching information and using many resources to obtain the information. I also was able to work various shifts that allowed for appointments I needed like 6-3 or 7-4 or 8-5.
good,During my time here I learned the value of quality. I loved that my career was in my hands. I would sit with my immediate bosses to discuss what I needed to be successful and they always made the time to sit with staff to discuss areas of opportunity. Great Value in a work environment.
good,"I have had a great experience with Wells Fargo. They have offered me great benefits, work incentives and overtime pay.  I feel valued as an employee, and i value them as my employer. I found the job in itself very interesting though it can be stressful at times. You will need to have at least an intermediate knowledge of computers.You also need to be able to handle criticism and irritable customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer is grateful of how you assisted them on their concern. The hardest part of the job is de-escalating."
good,Great work/life balance and Wells has plenty of hubs to work from if you are located near the Charlotte area.  Telecommuting is also available depending on your role and manager.

good,"Great company to work at, very friendly staff, great pay. Management was good. Good work culture. The work was very easy to do. Enjoy working there. Learned a lot."
good,"- Bank transactions, customer service, cash handling. "
good,"Wells Fargo is a place which you call a career, not a job. You will be expected to come in and out of work on time. You will learn self-discipline, money management and several other things that can even help you to manage your own account. Your team will support you! View your team as a team! Even as a family, because half of your life will be spent there at work, but Wells Fargo will pay you well for it! If you can balance your personal life with a demanding work place you'll do fine. They will pay you guaranteed! If you decide to work your way up, then you will earn time off, but more responsibility. You own't have to keep working on the weekends like everyone else. That's the great part about Wells Fargo. If you get your cruddy toes in the door, stay there! You can work your way to a breathing point."
good,"This company started out as Northwest Computer  Services and ended up as Wells Fargo.  I enjoyed working here. They were fair and honest with their employees.  In the early days they had employee events for the holidays, but as they grew they were phased out.  I worked in an atmosphere that was bright and sunny with nice personnel.  They were very supportive of needing time off to address personal matters.  I enjoyed using their flex time option."
good,"I enjoyed the time spent with Wells Fargo Advisors. The pay was decent, however, my particular department was very stressful and fast paced. Overall, I do not have any negative to say about the company."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "

good,"Advancement is quick, staff I full of wonderful coaches and eager learners! Huge supporters of diversity and community volunteering. Over all a wonderful company"
good,"Joined this company to enhance my career in banking sector , risk management , compliance , wholesale banking. This company is great place to work . Apart from working culture Wells help in various CSR activities."
good,"Great opportunity for promotions, fast pass job, great management, benefits are great.  A typical day at work is assisting customer's with their mortgage problems.  Solving issues on every call, providing a first time resolution and responding promptly and diligently. The hardest part of the job is that every call is slightly different.  Sometimes you will have to talk about things with customer's that may seem unpleasant.  You will not always please customer's.  Some will be frustrated with their situation, not necessarily with you.  Some of the toughest aspects maybe procedural changes.  Things constantly change on a daily bases.  You have to learn to adapt to each situation."
good,A very nice place to work because you get to learn all about banking. The atmosphere is pretty calm for the most part. Hardest part of job is managing the high volume of customers.
good,"Very structured, professional office. Demands and expectation often times created high stress levels. Great management. Great teamwork. Overall, great dept to work in"

good,I started with Wells Fargo as a part-time teller while still in college. They were very flexible with my school schedule. It was an overall great experience.
good,"fast paced, how to deal with irate customers Management was good"
good,"A typical day at work is busy , things are always changing so I've learned multiple ways how to navigate over 4 different systems at once to assist a client . Management is awesome and very evolved with each employee in the department which is why I love the work environment. I would say the hardest part of the job is the constant change due to me working with client brokerage accounts and having to explain to them  why changes where made. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to assist clients and meet their needs to the best of my ability because I love helping others."
good,The job oppertunities here have changed for the better recently because of the scandal that just happened. i honestly believe the company is restructuring in a way to avoid all of that from happening and is trying to give their employees a good expeiance.
good,"Wells Fargo India Solutions Pvt Ltd is first company i joined after my graduation. Its a great place to work, the team mates are very helpful and the work environment is really good.

good,"I loved working at Wells Fargo. The team leads and managers are very supportive. Working at Wells Fargo has taught me a lot of things I felt will not only help me at work but also in life. For example, how to empathize with customers because that was one thing that i had trouble with. The hardest part I felt about the job was the sales because if we didn't meet our sales goal it would affect keeping our position there, but overall I loved it there."
good,"Provided great opportunities for learning and advancement, although legal regulations were interfering with the ability to provide the level of excellent customer service that I and the team were accustomed to providing our clientele, particularly with the arrival of Obamacare.  I listed the job title as Account Manager as that was the function of the position; however the actual title assigned by Wells Fargo was Account Executive."

But, the good thing in this Bank is that they provide for the needs of itrs employees like sleeping quarters, transportation allowance, and other allowances. If only it would not affect my health I would not resign in this Bank."
good,Unfortunately it was merged with Wells Fargo. Wachovia was a work/life balanced company. I came to work with Wachovia due to the First Union/Wachovia merger.

good,"Very open and welcoming atmosphere, all employees highly encouraged and trained to build confidence. Non discriminatory and tons of room for advancement within the company."
good,"I've been with Wells for 6+ years. They develop people for life, not just for a the job they are doing. The one thing that I've observed is that there is a culture of popularity that does not always lend to the best people being promoted within. I like the new culture around building lifelong relationships with customers and asking questions to uncover thier needs vs selling something for the sake of selling it."

As i moved directly from college to such a big company, i find the organization culture is so different when compare to my student life. gradually i adopted to to that in one year.

One out of maybe ten will be something different and those are the ones that keep you going, except when they are an angry customer."
good,Wells Fargo has fantastic benefits and lets you access them very quickly. The only complaint I have is it's been very difficult trying to move up within the company.
good,"several years have passed since my employment at Wachovia. It was during the beginning stages of the transition to Wells Fargo. I did love this job, I was a teller and my leader was beyond amazing!, Super helpful, very personable, proactive and responsible. She set an amazing example of what leadership should be. She was always happy and approachable. My old co workers were all very easy going and fun! For the moment I was employed, the benefits were stellar, and who doesn't love banking hours? It definitely fit well with my school schedule. Unfortunately, I moved and the job was very far from my area."

good,Management is great and really does have open door policy. They are willing to work for you. great people to work with and clean. Pay is very good and yearly raises.
good,"I love my job and team mates. Management is trying to make it more balanced, ts at the senior level that the stress has been placed upon us.The work itself is not daunting, it can provide challenges, but the volume with the number of production employees is overwhelming. It makes it difficult to be rested and rejuvenated due to the mandatory overtime hours per week and per month. That being said I would say the time requirement is the hardest. I love to help our clients/ customers both internal and external and I would say that is what I love the most about the job."
good,"I loved working at Wells fargo, good people and great leader. "
good,"As a phone banker time goes by quickly which was the best part of the job, but talking to people on the phone especially about their money is very stressful and can at times be emotionally draining. It's a full time job of being on the phone and getting through phone calls as fast as you can with great customer service (understandable), in a room with no windrows, and trying to offer Wells Fargo products to customers in each call, this is one of the stressful parts of the job. Management and co-workers are great they're very supportive which is one of the best parts of working there, the best part is the benefits."

good,"I managed 10 banking centers with sales and profit responsibilities."
good,"I get a request from my team to contact a business customer about their interest in a loan, line of credit, expanding their business relationship to help their business grow.

There are plenty of opportunites to move up in different positions and expand.  The hardest part is keeping up with sales and goals and meeting reguirements that management teams have.

Therefore, in putting the right people and the right management who could lead the people sometimes cannot be determined always right. In the end so many regrets, disappointment, and unsatisfied for the people who work under them have felt mistreated, unfair, and discriminated whether intentionally or not; directly or not; or just the type how the individual management lead their people. That kind of situations are sensitively to be their typical day of work; they cannot learned anything productive and benefit; scared and do not trust the management; favoritism in co-workers; making all the jobs are the hardest job; and there is not enjoyable working with them and the company."

It was everything I could ask for in regards to work environment, job position, customer interaction, etc. The hardest part about working there was attendance, and integrity.

The job was getting done.  We had friendly competitions on who got the most sells that day. What I learned about my role was that being a leader consists of teaching others what you know best.  I learned how to become a coach and a teacher to help them become successful.  My co-workers were the best.  We got along quite well where it made the working enviornment that much better.  We were friends, but at the end of day business was business and sometimes we'd get after each other to do what needed to get done.  I'd say the hardest part of the job was telling customers we couldn't process their transactions as they wanted because sometimes I knew that they needed funds to pay their bills.  I loved my job and everyday was enjoyable to me.  I loved when my teammates came to me for help, for advice.  It felt good to be a leader."

good,Had a great time working as an intern for Wells Fargo. The job was not very structured nor was the management. 
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of paying Wells Fargo Financial owned electric bills and tracking each payment through an excel spreadsheet, next on month end I process the payments and ship them to our Accounts Payable Department for issue of funds. At month end I upload monthly payment reports to MIS Collections and process those reports. After that I work with vendors to provide complete check back up for checks that they have received from us.

I process these on an excel spreadsheet and give reasons as to why I am paying or not. I am also working on another project that requires alot of attention for the Wachovia loans and this process is to eliminate steps in our process so that we can do this process quicker giving us better opportunities to do more processing on other projects. One last thing I do with electric bills is that I call clients for billing troubles so that we can work together and get them taken care of."
good,Soon as i arrived I checked my daily calender for appointment's for that day.  I call each of my Clients to verify they will be home for me to do my inspection of the home. I was gone most of the day and when I returned I would pull my Client's Credit Bureau and decide if they qualified for second mortgage and if they did I would start with what I could pay off and what cash would be available.  After I'm done with all paperwork I sent to home office for last approval.  If all went well I called to schedule for the Client to close loan and sign all the mountain of paperwork. I loved how I felt knowing I was making them so happy to pay off all debt.  The hardest is when I had to make the call they were not approved. I had to learn it was just part of my job.

good,The bank is a great place to work. They are all about work/life balance and flexible scheduling and allowing telecommuting.

Then how many solutions you found for your customers via referrals to bankers is what decides how much you get. Rapid promotion if you are enthusiastic but low pay when you first start as a teller.

good,Wells Fargo was a good company to work that offered decent wages and quarterly bonuses. Management is friendly and helpful in training new employees and promoting awareness of new company policies and procedures. The workplace culture fosters a safe and productive environment. Employees are presented with challenges every day that require them to think on their feet and respond quickly to customer needs. Quarterly sales incentives became a stressful factor towards the end of my employment where upper management was pushing sales quota aggressively down the chain of command. The most enjoyable part of the job is the genuine interactions and lasting relationships that you build with customers from all walks of life!
good,great company to work at. lots of in-house promotion. the benefits are pretty awesome. I paid is very good for the job you are doing. Because of the fact that I work at a call center is can a lot of work.

good,new challenge everyday. meet different people with different personality and build a life long family at work. get to know customers and experience how banking is behind the window.
good,"My days flew by, I always felt as if i needed more time in my day to get more work out because it never really felt like work so my days wen super fast. my team serviced the payoff and collateral functions for the whole sale and business banking group, searing lots of docs and searching the different systems to ensure all docs were found. I learned about the life cycle of a loan, products and services, bank regulations and compliance, doc scanning and time management. It was a very diverse environment. The hardest part was finding the correct docs form bankes that we acquired and reading attorney written docs.I The most enjoyable part was knowing that at the end of the day, the jobs i competed made a customer fell satisfied and complete, because I was the last stop to them being proud to pay off the loan and gain full ownership of their property."
good,"-Everybody was nice and we (Tellers) helped out each other! "

good,"Wells Fargo cares a lot about making sure a team does well together. They set up ""team building"" activities such as movie nights, bowling, holiday parties and potlucks. I enjoyed the small team I worked with as well as the workers in branches in our area. We all got along very well. My manager was younger than most so she could relate to me but sometimes that showed in a negative way in her work effort. I wouldn't give this company a bad rating whatsoever. The pay isn't the best but they definitely taught me a lot because it was my first time in banking."

good,"Good place to work at as long as you have a good Manager.  I started out with a terrible Manager who was full of drama and did not teach or mentor me.  After a few years she was replaced with a person who was greatly qualified and immediately started to show me tricks of trade and I became a much better Teller, soon becoming the Lead Teller.  I would have liked to stay but our branch is closing its doors as part of an optimization plan to become more efficient."
good,"Over-all, Wells Fargo is the better bank option to work at. Unbiased, I'd say they hire decent people, with high morals. Great benefits, amazing work-life balance.My supervisors really put their team ahead of themselves. They truly did away with sales, and focus on what's best for their customers. It's definitely a trade off. "

good,"In general, a good working environment; opportunities for advancement within a unit; good team members; strong use of current technology; great cultural diversity"
good,"The OP II position is an excellent entry-level job, and the Park Avenue campus is a nice place to work. The environment is good and so is the management.

good,Best part of my job was helping customers save and think about their future financial needs. Never a day without learning something new from either a team member or customer. great hours closed on major holidays.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I never had issues when I worked there. Incentives were fair.I really enjoyed working with my management team and they were great about developing us and coaching us. Had I not moved to a state that didn't have Wells, I would probably still be working for them ."

If the customer was approved for the program, the process was given and a specialist assigned. If the application was not approved, other avenues were explored."
good,I feel we should get paid more for the job we do but other than that it's a great place to work. The supervisors are easy to work for and my coworkers are a lot of fun.

My daily work flow was constant, I was non stop from the time I walked through the door until the time I got in my car at the end of the day.

good,"Handling cash. "
good,"Culture is changing, but has caused more difficulty for advancement.  Great benefits and plenty of vacation days, but salary and quarterly bonus structure is inconsistent and not very attractive."

good,"Working at Wells Fargo was a fun but had its inconsistent moments. One minute the bank is empty and the next, there's a line out the door. Working there taught me how to think on my feet and to pay attention to detail. It's a huge responsibility to deal with other people's money and it feels like an accomplishment when you balance your drawer by the end of the day. The management was very supportive and flexible. They scheduled my hours around my classes and I really appreciated that."
good,"I would not leave if my job were not moving to a location I cannot move to. I have been with company many years and have really enjoyed it. I have been promoted multiple times, with many opportunities for growth & development to further my career. Team I work with is great & I love my direct manager. Company however decided to change its model recently and this is why I am losing my job, hate to see all the changes since loved the way things were before. I understand however due to the market & things that occurred on the bank side that change is necessary. This transition has been very bumpy with upper upper management & they do not seem to be completely aware of what happens here on main level & the impacts that are happening to the direct consumers because of it. Otherwise, again very good company to work for & I hate to leave."

good,Have enjoyed working for the company the past seven years and would recommend any future job seekers to work for the company it has been a pleasure working for this company
good,"My group may not represent all of WF.  As indicated, it is an energtic, and fast-paced/demanding place.  At the same time, the culture is respectful, not petty or discouraging - as I have found occasionally in other corporate environments.  They have lots of pro-liberal policies and cheerleading, which amounts to moral cowardice, but all in all, it's a decent place to work."
good,"-A typical day was our daily morning meetings to look at our monthly goals and how to accomplish them. What we could do to develop more business."
good,"It is a good place to work. Their training is one of the best. Great culture great benefits too. But as an online customer representative, they are not willing to provide part time position, it was so hard for me when i worked there before and went to college at the same time."
good,We are relocating to san Bernardino. its too far from my home 65 miles each way. I want something closer to home.  (I like my job and what I do. I would like to retire from Wells Fargo but I cant make that long drive. I would be stressed out.
good,Good place to start off if you want to stay in financial industry. They definitely give you opportunities to advance. You get to make great relationships and networking is huge.
good,"Days are structured like any corporate company. Working in the banking world you learn a lot about how interest rates, financial investments and money work. The hardest part of working at Wells Fargo is the red tape and levels of departments that have to review documents and files. Sales is heavily staffed but the fulfillment teams are understaffed. "

good,They did have a hard time  with the sales culure. But they are getting back to the customer now. They want to grow the team member and the pay is really good.

good,"I loved working in the bank. Hours were flexible and co workers/managerial were very friendly. The reason I left was because of sales, it was getting too serious and there was less focus on customer service. There's always opportunity to grow in the banking business and move up the ladder. If I had a chance to go back, I definitely would because sales and service goals have made a better change since then."

good,Worked in Wells Fargo as a bank teller as a college student. It was a good opportunity to learn about banking and finances. Had a good time working there as a part time teller.
good,"Typical day at work was busy and always something to do. If you or doing update training. Work included working with realtors. Builders. Home owners and all the 3rd party vendors like insurance company, surveyors, and appraisers. Hardest part of the job was the day to day making sure the loan was moving along quickly. I enjoyed management of loan officers and helping them build thier business."
good,"Each day was comprised of processing and sorting sensitive customer information.  Since we had to sort quite a bit of work, we had to work together as a team.

Discuss any pressing issues that need to be addressed or escalated. Go through voicemail and emails to respond to any messages left. Create a game plan with other team members on projects that involve other team members, and share questions or concerns. Set goals for accomplishments for that day and get to work. The hardest part of the job is getting a project that does not have clear instructions, because that will cause delays in progress and affect the outcome, or completion of the project. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you successfully complete a project on time and get a thumbs up from Management"
good,advancement for hard working employees. Ability to develop new skills and training when needed. Coworkers really cared and built a relationship with them.
good,"Working for Wells Fargo has taught me a lot in general about what to consider when running a company overall. One great thing about working there, was the research tools, and support that was available to the employees at all times. Working within a company that has so many different services and products, there was something new to do each day. So having that support to refer to when needed was very helpful. The sales tactic has never bothered me, I have always exceeded my goals and never had a problem doing so. However, the tactic that was taught to the employees seemed a little aggressive, and most employees did not feel comfortable with it.

good,"Processed incoming/outgoing ACH wire transfers, ATA transfers."
good,"Overall, this company is wonderful to work for. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. You always feel like you're a part of a family when you go to work. I gave Wells Fargo 4 stars mainly because of my situation. They were not able to accommodate to my school schedule so I had to resign. Benefits and compensation are the best I've ever seen. The only other thing I would complain about is the strict enforcement of sales. I understand it's a business and that is how they make their money, but managers were getting fired if a teller didn't make their quota. Other than that this company is wonderful and hopefully someday they will change their sales requirements for employees."

Since working with Wells Fargo I've learned alot about credit, how important it is to know your credit score and history and about investments.

good,"Wells Fargo is a wonderful company. Being a top employee for them for years was easy because I truly believe in the company. They really care about their customers and in the department I was in the management was wonderful. The only problem with working for this company is if you are good in what you are doing it is hard to advance out of that position as ""You are to good that it would be hard to replace you."" Also if you are laid off due to department closure it is very hard to get back into the company even as as a top dedicated employee."

good,Texas provided an eclectic group of customers. I enjoyed interacting with and helping others.
good,"When I would arrive at work, I would set up my drawer and immediately start to help the customers. While helping, we would look at and gather some information from the customer to find a need and then determine a product or service that best suited their needs. But even more importantly, we needed the make sure that the customer left happy. Also, throughout the day I would need to perform many tasks that were more internal and not dealing with the customers so much. Throughout my career with Wells Fargo I took on many tasks simply because I loved to learn more information and just increase my experience and knowledge. That was one of the things I liked most about it, the constantly morphing atmosphere whether it be policies/procedures, the customer traffic, or the employees. The position is a very tough position and I saw a few people come and go. I think the toughest part, both for me when I started as a teller and the others, was the sales aspect. I struggled with it in the beginning but I eventually got the hang of it and got promoted to Lead Teller. Most of what helped me was my management. I had three managers and what one of them struggled with, there were two others there to help. Having great coworkers makes for a better work atmosphere and I couldn't have asked for a better team."
good,"Great work culture, plenty of opportunities for advancement."
good,"> Excellent management team."
good,"My job daily was repetitive, but yet also rewarding due to the incentives they would put into place for meeting daily goals to help boost moral and constant recognition. Due to the fact it is a very repetitive position you have to keep yourself challenged in all areas by setting your OWN goals. Management could use a little more training prior to being in the position they with held as most would choose favorites and make you feel as if you were still in highschool. my co workers were very uplifting and friendly, developed alot of new friendships through the time i was there."
good,"In this position I was a phone banker assisting customer with their banking. Some customer called for their balance, and to move monies from one account to the next as well as purchasing new accounts as well. I learned a lot in reference to the banking side of business. The management was very pleasant, and the co-workers were pleasant as well. At Wells Fargo I don't remember having a hard part of the job.

good,"I was a money counter for Wells Fargo a few years ago. I loved the job. I would sit in a room and count money all day. That was all I did.  It was rather hard because you are just sitting there counting money and there are a lot of rules to things you have to do. However, the pay was excellent and I loved the job. You have to have a certain personality to do this type of work. One of the things you have to be willing to work by yourself.

However, if you are needing a short term or long term leave of absence for medical leave, family care leave, or any other leave with the exception of maternity leave, you will be expected to pay Wells Fargo back the time you were gone. Although you were given an ex- amount of Paid Time Off at the beginning of the year. You are still required to pay Wells Fargo back. You can not work it back. You have to pay it back out of your own pocket. And there is no literature that states that in the employee handbook nor does the HR department warn you about it before submitting your leave of absence. I took a medical leave and family care leave and was force to quite to become a primary care giver for my close family member. I was told I have to pay back a large balance to Wells Fargo for my absence. And if I don't, I will not be re-hired, and could negatively mark my credit.

So i went from a strict, by the books manager first that really set a standard to a friendly manager who did whatever it took to make customers happy but with limits, then to a manager who only held the title of manager but seemed to hate the role. The hardest part of my job were my last months there. The most enjoyable was the customers and my co-workers."

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,While working there you answer a lot of phone calls. Help out customers. Make copies of paper work. Ask for help if you get confused about certain calls. The management there is excellent. They always help out if you are nervous or find it difficult. The hardest part to this job would be being able to be fast and not afraid for challenging customers over the phone. I enjoy the way everyone gets together and talk about issues and try to get some insight from each other through the day.
good,A typical day at work begins with reviewing the schedule for today and logging into the systems to be used that day. I've learned a lot about the laws and procedures that govern collections. Management is very understanding about things that pop up in life and very willing to help in any way they can. I have great and knowledgeable co-workers to whom I can ask for help. The hardest part of the job is working with the customers and trying to help them. The most enjoyable part of my job is hearing the thanks in a customer's voice and I know that I have accomplished something to make their life a bit easier.

good,A typical day at Wells Fargo was very busy.  In this position I learned that time management was extremely important in the workplace.  I also learned how back office Business Loan processing worked.  The hardest part of this job was keeping up with the amount of loans that came to the team.  The most enjoyable part was communication with the bankers that submitted them.
good,"Currently at Wells Fargo I am a personal banker and I help customers on a daily basis including, loan and consumer deposit account applications. Along with going to businesses and cold calling customers for new accounts. Plus, I help with the closing and opening of the Branch."

good,"I obtained great information on the proper etiquette in consumer collections, management was great and understanding, co-workers were helpful and pleasant, the hardest part of my job was not being able to help my clients with their accounts."
good,This was a part-time job. I learned a lot from this job. This was my first banking job. The co-workers we real nice people. The hardest part of the job was when I was unable to cash a check. I felt really bad for the client. The best part of the job was the competition we had going on and always being the best at the job.
good,"Absolutely wonderful company to work for. Great benefits, pay, peers, managers, job security, and ability to maintain balance between work and life."
good,"A typical day at work for me at Wells Fargo included, opening the bank, counting ATM deposits and night drops, opening drawers, buying and selling to cash vault, opening credit, opening checking and savings accounts, customer transactions, balancing drawer. I learned many new things while working at Wells Fargo, how a bank operates, the importance of good team work and a good attitude towards customers as well as each other. How to multitask when the pace picks up, paying attention to each detail. My management team was fantastic, My teller supervisor was a great mentor and teacher to me when I was first hired. The store manager was great, paid attention to each team member individually. My co-workers were always willing to assist when needed, great energy and team work. The hardest part of the job was, having to adapt to another language. My branch was primarily a Spanish speaking branch with many Spanish speaking customers. The most enjoyable part of my job and time with Wells Fargo would have to be learning so many new things, and meeting such great people to work with."

I learned how to be a better leader at Wells Fargo.  Culturally they are focused on the customer while driving results for the shareholders.  I am so thankful for all my time at Wells Fargo."
good,"Poor work life balance, micromanagement, compensation not equal to ever increasing job duties, limited career advancement, poor collaboration between coworkers."
good,"High call volume in bound and out bound. I was a team player and was always willing to help my co workers with information if needed. Also was able to process payment, update financial information for a modification review."
good,"I can only say that innovation and free thinking of ideas and encouragement is the crux to a better entity. Moreover, inclusiveness and encouraged team effort is parallel and the life blood of any company"
good,"No support. Low morale. High turnover. It was a typical call center where the only ones that advanced was management. If you need it for the benefits, I recommend."
good,"She was raisit, embarrassed me every chance in front of customer, she put me on Xanax because of all the stress I was on plus she lied about me..... I really wish someone would read this from the company"
good,A typical day at work is stressful. Have a lot of work pressure. But the team is good to work with. Ample time is given for analysis. The timelines are stringent.
good,its okay to work her i just think it is time for me to go and find something new due to the fact that the area is not like it was when i first start and i don't like the mangers
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Varied as some days were busier than others due to location"
good,Learned a lot advanced quickly. Didn’t have issues until regions closed down people were laid off & departments went under new management. After the change morale went down & we were treated unfairly
good,"They train all their employees....."
good,good company very nice people great workstations the job was high pressure doing downtime can be boring co workers was OK the hardest part of the job was dealing with so many different personality and supervisors from other teams are no helpful
good,"Sales positions with a draw on commission, made for a stressful life."
good,"Good management, good bank a lot of products to sell to customer and this products can really help them."
good,Nice company to work in.Has benefits 401k has all the benefits you need.Always hiring I enoy the meetings and outings.
good,I do not wish to write a review about Wells Fargo. I enjoyed working there and would consider going back if the right opportunity was presented to me at the right time.
good,The company has a lot of potential for hard working individuals and is rewarded. I enjoyed the opportunity to grow and be part of a leading team. I overall managed the international client based learning on the foreign client and business owner.
good,Wells Fargo gives you the opportunity to give back to the community with volunteer programs but managers decline the time off to volunteer. Their is no support from management in regards to advancement and that is because they lack the knowledge or will to help a team member.
good,I enjoy working for the company and love the position that I am in just think that some supervisor decision need to be changed and updated. There have been some individuals placed into the role of supervisor without any supervisor skills at all.
good,"Great compensation, good benefits.  Management however creates a horrible job culutre to work in.  Hard to move up in company, basically only laterall moves..  Good to start here, build a resume and then take your talent elsewhere."
good,"i love working there but its only for 2 hrs a day . looking for full time work . i love the people that work there. The worker there treat me like family . I clean , mop, window, vacuum , clean bathroom , stock"
good,"It is a great work environment, since it was near the mall. Yet, the compensation is not that great and hours do vary."
good,I think the best part of the job is that each transaction is so different based on the person. I also love that I grow relationships with so many different people in the community ity
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for if you have the correct management coaching you.  The ability to move up within the company is practically impossible. They only start tellers off at 20 hrs a week so turn over rate is horrible which is not good for customer service.
good,Lately the typical work day is very long because there is not much going on but a lot of busy work for us. There is a lack of inclusion in this role. A lof of the contractors are expected to help but not expected to be able to hear all of the details of the projects they are working on.
good,"You get in, you do your work, and you keep it moving.  Management has been there for quite a while.  There's a mentality of what's already in place, just leave it.  No real innovation."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Good pay and benefits, lots of legal responsibilitie. Management plays favorites. Lots of changes to policy. Lots of required compliance activity to complete quarterly."
good,They offer great benefits and great time off. It all depends on which team you work on and who you will work with . a great managers will help you move up and support you.  A bad manager or group will make it feel like you are working in a pit of vipers. One wrong move and you are going to go down.
good,I was 1st introduced to Wells Fargo in the late 90's after answering an ad on the job board at the school I was attending.
good,It was fun while it lasted. Although I am displaced I will miss my co workers and their helpfulness. We grew to better our selves and the customers that called in
good,When something goes wrong management only look after themselfs not caring for employees. Management get paid more then employees and in most case work harder .
good,The culture was a sales culture but very unethical. they would make you sell products even if customer did not want the products.  I taught me to be a manager but I was not pleased with upper management
good,Great working there if you have the right management team. With the combination of the right people and Management. Big banking has changed in the last ten years
good,"1. worked more than 2 files per day"
good,It is a company that has its customers first and foremost in mind. there was also fun things to do because this is a fast pasted work environment.
good,"Typical day is taking anywhere between 50-70 phone calls. You are expected to keep each call under 5 minutes, and expected to offer a type of Wells Fargo product to a customer on every call. I have a lot about the banking and financial world and how banks make money. Also have learned more about online services for banks. Wells Fargo micromanages to a point that sometimes it feels uncomfortable. If you do get a supervisor that is actually willing to listen to you and is interested in your progress stay with them, because there are not that many. Hardest part of the job is selling because they are forcing you to make an incentive whether you want it or not. Enjoyable part is working with different types of people."
good,"Wells Fargo at work program, volunteer to the community and benefits, 401k match program."
good,Management can be unfair but its koo I guess. Didn't like how I was handled. Management doesn't really care about their employees. They're only concerned about stats. Or should I say they care for those they choose to card about.
good,"Manager was dumb af "
good,"Great company with awesome benefits. Everyday consists of the same stuff, it's really boring. Management sucks, they dont care about keeping employees."
good,Hard work required. Things are different with every customer. Some days can be better than others. The people you work with are fantastic. All in all a great place to be employed.
good,I appreciated the opportunity I had with Wells Fargo in 2003 as I joined a dynamic culture that promoted growth and development in the Orange County office I worked in. However transitioning over to another entity in 2005 I found a different that did not embrace my growth and development to advance on the career path. However I maintain a positive approach to all the business objectives before me.
good,"I learned a system of business at Wells Fargo. How to prospect clients, build a book of business and cross sale to existing clients. I have learned many of their systems. I'm confident I can take all that I learned to another company or start my own business."
good,Loved my job management not so much. great experience. Great retirement 401K but the pay you had to really pu sh for but the fact that i loved my jab took the place of that. They push far too hard on the sales side of things.
good,"loved the bonuses, stressful working environment. would return if the right opportunity came about."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Advancement offered to those less qualified and less accomplished based off personal relationships
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company and i personally use them for my financial needs."
good,"Keep an open mind"
good,loved working with private bankers. won customer service of the year had a trip to the bahamas
good,great experince w/ wells fargo....management in memphis tn from the corporate level needs some looking into but for the most part i was able to add many job skills for the financial market to my resume
good,"Very fast pace. Interesting things learned after years of serving the community. Management at times not as supporting. I worked and managed different backgrounds and cultures and had a wonderful experience do so. The hardest part of this job is getting upper management to understand that the front line (in the lobby-Tellers, SVM, BM and Bankers) is where the rubber meets the road and you must have first experience the ride before making demands and changes."
good,"This is great company to work for, however I am looking for more of a challange in my day to day work."
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company, however was not  happy with  management leadership skill and the way they acted towards their employees, and not happy with the way they push to sell products, not necessary for consumer."
good,A lot is expected so you have to work very hard and pay attention.  Not a lot of training so you need to be a self starter. I have always worked 100 percent remotely for Wells Fargo so you really have to figure out a lot on your own but I enjoy working independently so it has worked out well for me.  I have gained a lot of experience in the technology field and appreciate the opportunity I have been given.  You can only work a 24 month period and then you are required to take 6 months off from Wells Fargo.  I don't think they hire contractors in career positions very often so it is sad when my contract ends and I'm out looking for work again.
good,this is sentence number one. I like to write sentences. I feel that I am very good at writing sentences. I am challenged by writing compound sentences.
good,No I just don’t care for them. The company has great values but the employees are scum and trash. They are all for them selves and everyone else can fail.
good,"A typical day at work began with walking into the bank lobby and seeing both business and regular lines wrapped around because of how much traffic we would get on a daily basis. Our main goal was to get as many customers to sit down with a banker, get the line down by closing time making zero mistakes, and balancing down to the penny. Management isn't the greatest. Managers would often embarrass us when we would ask for help or had a question. They would also often forget what they were doing. I would say the hardest part was having to often get yelled at because of poor management and having to apologize when it wasn't our fault. I did learn a lot from working at this bank. Wells Fargo offers great benefits and there's a lot of growth room. I would highly recommend to work for Wells Fargo. Unfortunately this specific branch needs to improve on a lot."
good,"the management has an area of opportunity around consistency and team member experience. "
good,"The job and atmosphere was very focused and time sensitive. The supervisors were very focused, trained us well and supportive to what we had to do. I have always like a lot of work around me in processing. Being productive and effective is good for me."
good,Maybe it was just the branch I was at but the company could take better care of the employees. The pay sucks but you get to work with a lot of good people.
good,"Great for working while taking college classes. Not great if you're looking for full-time work. The company, in my experience, does not promote from within which is disappointing."
good,I would recommend anyone for this position as I started out as a collector and advanced to several different departments while there. the management was great to work with.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Caring management culture overall. Provide  good benefits and paid time off. Office environment is clean and updated to modern day ergonomics. Ability to advance career with so many divisions within the company.
good,"As a consultant, worked very hard, averaged 50 hour weeks because I was very busy and loved supporting my teams of project managers, technology managers, etc.  Very bright team of engineers and professionals, learned a lot, and was deeply honored to work my first tour at WF.  The management treated the FTEs and consultants with equal appreciation, value and respect."
good,"I enjoyed my limited time there."
good,Management is nice and respectful. The work is easy and fun to do at times. The work is either group based or a solo performance. Easy tasks to complete.
good,"When I started as a teller, the management was amazing, they treated you like family, drove you to succeed, and encouraged you to be your best. After a little while, they moved on and a new manager moved in, the attitude changed drastically. And it was well known that our positions were not secure, it became more a matter of making ""numbers"" and less about taking care of people, being reminded that ""HR"" has already been spoken to and confirmed that we could be removed for not making ""numbers"" was a definite drawback."
good,"It was very structured and educated me a lot about the accounting field. Management was great, most co-workers didn't interact, but I loved it anyway because you were challenged often."
good,"My day began at 8:00am and started off with a meeting going over sales goals for the day.  Review any additional training needed and continue with daily opening procedures.  I learned so much from this position and I was able to implement all of that knowledge to my personal life, which I have been able to improve my financial future,The hardest part of the job were the hours I put in. I worked six days a week 10-12 hour days.  The most enjoyable part was making a difference and able to help customers."
good,"Wells is not for the faint of heart.  It takes perseverance and the ability to change with the turnover of management."
good,Wells is a great place to work.  The north carolina locations are extremely friendly and accommodating.  Be prepared to negotiate salaries with this employer.
good,The midnight shift permanently threw off my sleep cycle but I enjoyed the work. I used to drive for hours between buildings listening to Family Radio. That's how I found out about the FBI's Liberty Corner Campus by the Lyons VA where my dear old Grandma used to work. The Fellowship Bible Institute was a foot in the door where for the next ten years I studied the Bible and learned everything about nothing. The whole of Scripture can be summed up in two words Spiritual Love or AA for short.
good,The people are ok. All the customer like to see the same tellers don't like new people.
good,Child Care Development . I learned how to teach children no matter what learning disorders and how children's brains work. Management was amazing and always gave us the training and tools to excel at our jobs. My Co workers were amazing and everyone worked as a team to make sure our classroom was the best it could be. The hardest part of my job is trying and failing until you find the right route for each child. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with children.
good,"If you enjoy a dynamic enviroment, then this would be best suited for you. The managment team is very concern about a work/life balance. The company has various forms of compensation."
good,"FemWorks was a very flexible job and took on while in college."
good,I enjoyed working there and learning how to do calendar management.
good,Doing the eight hour shift you spoke to customers that had problems or they wanted to know were there title was or about thieir payments
good,"It was a job where I knew what to do and my supervisor let me do it, she was confident in my abbilities which was a very good feeling. I was able to work around my husbands work schedule for car pooling that was great since we live a ways out. My team worked togeather to accomplish a goal, we openly took advise and had fun."
good,Very productive environment. Underwrting large volume of loans on a daily basis
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Poor Immediate supervisors aren't on the same page as the company policies, and go by their own rules. Shows favor and doesn't support current team members."
good,"As a contractor, you're not giving a fair chance.  You working hard achieving goalscoring while the permanent employees asking why are you working so like. Contractors are treated different.  Back during First Union & Wachovia days this wasn't acceptable.  First Union/Wachovia was awesome.  I do believe in my Heart Wachovia would have bounced back."
good,Great place to improve your math and analytical skills and develop better customer service skills with a diverse population. As well as opportunities for advancement outside of retail banking.
good,I learned valuable insight and many new skills.I loved my team and I love the culture. I enjoyed the work I did for our customers. The hardest part of the job was leaving.
good,"Typical day, open for business and we take care the customer on everything there need, management are helping on mayor issues and training on polices & procedure. "
good,This is a serious place to work at. None of the managers are on the same page. I am glad for the work experience however not enthused by the management.
good,I had the opportunity to learn management role at wells Fargo. It was productive and sometimes stressful place to work. As an employee I felt we were under paid.
good,Wells Fargo is good company to work for. I still like to get back to Wells Fargo. I like the fast pace moving environment that not only keep you moving to finish your given tasks but also help you to learn to move forward towards the next level in your desired career.
good,I really don't have anything to say about this company. You would have to apply and get hired to see what it is about. If you are interest in banking then you may like this company.
good,wellsfargo  was a great job to have other then my management team. they are very unfair sometimes. my boss was a very young woman that seemed to care only for her self and she was very unfair at times.
good,I loved the community I worked in and during the time i've spent working for this company. I've had some awesome female managers unforutantley my time had to end. My balance with education is more important wells fargo didn't have enough flexiblity for me.
good,It was a great working experience and  enthusiastic environment. Every day tasks are most challenging to learn new skills. The most enjoyable part  of the work is the convenience of work from anywhere in the country.
good,Excellent work ethics and teamwork. management is very cooperative and understanding. learned how to process FC loans from the point of view of the originator (lender)
good,Enjoyed making phone calls and collecting past due payments.  I was the top collector with Wells Fargo during that time.  The more calls you make the better results you receive. Enjoyed doing the research through skip tracer to locate payees.
good,"Typical day: client interactions and providing customer service,"
good,"I enjoy the amenities but there isn't much room for growth as a contractor. I was really hoping for a career with Wells. I enjoy the campus at CIC. People kind of just keep to themselves, so it can be a little lonely if you are looking for work friends. I also wish they had more vegan food options."
good,"daily cash handling, how to deposit and cash checks, how to send money to other countries  how to balance at the end of my shift, filling ATM's, Management as stable. Great. nothing was hard  it was fun learning everything it was my first time working in a bank."
good,Really love working for Wells Fargo Dealer Services but was recently advised if I wanted to keep my job I would need to relocate at this time this is not an option for me.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,They put too much pressure on cross selling products.  We had to make a quota every quarter and if we didn't we'd be let go.  Job security was not good but the activities the company would do for the employees was AMAZING!
good,This company was a good company to work for. It is one of the leaders in its industry. Typical day at-work was calm. I learned a lot. Management was average. The workplace culture was casual to corporate. The hardest part of my job was getting Test Data generated and prepared for Test Execution. The most enjoyable part of the job was being surrounded by IT Professionals.
good,"- Maintain boardroom calendar, prepare for meetings "
good,Great benefits for anyone who wanted to succeed both personally and professionally. Great Diversity and Inclusion initiatives. Promotion and salary/wage is dependent on the team member's accomplishments and the manager's opinion. Great people in general to work with. It is like a family for me.
good,I like the people that I worked with on the front line and some of the P.B. They need a better Manager that are over the tellers.
good,"Good Place to work. There are opportunities to move up and to different departments. Once you get in the door, you will be golden. Insurance, 401K everything available."
good,Wells fargo was a great place to work for.  the work environment and people were great. I would love to come back to work for them again
good,"Wells Fargo provides a balanced overall work structure when it comes to work life, compensation and benefits, however, job security and advancement is minimal, the job culture, doesn't equally compensate personal that excel, this can be challenging when workplace policies inhibit one from moving forward due to inner company politics,or policies put in place with minimal notice or supervisory support,that can inhibit you from either building a future with the company or prevent you from taking on future leadership"
good,"I typically come into work and the first thing I do is set up my work station such as signing into my computer and setting up my cashbox for the day. I also look into our daily branch goal sales to see where the branch is in sales as well as my personal sales. I like to speak to my supervisor about ways to improve on our daily goals. I log into our product data base system to learn about new products that we can offer to customers. Throughout the day, balance my cash to make sure I am balanced by the end of the day. I work with merchants and foreign exchanges as well, and need to make sure my transactions are balanced at the end of my shift. I enjoy working as a team with my branch and being able to help our customers with whatever they might need."
good,"this was adirect sales position with income,credit,and service analysis. I talked with over 100 customers per day building raport on best products and knowledge"
good,This job was based on production so there was not mingling or positive morale there. The environment was ok but I have graduated to be a medical assistant and this was a job I took while in school
good,"Typical day is very busy"
good,"I am a very upbeat, affable person.  I have strong relationships with my co-works and have much fun with them in and outside the office.  My job was been very good for many years but the environment is deteriorating with all intense regulations.  I am looking for something where my success is not dependent and constantly impeded by the performance of others and the tedious and numerous complications that are to the point of being amusing.  "
good,Company offers fair compensation and good benefits.  Good work hours and no weekend work required.  Good support from home office.
good,"I have had a great opportunity to learn and grow at Wells Fargo, but with corporate guidlines as they are, compensation is extremely limited year to year and promotion to promotion.  It takes a a lot of hard work to be successful here, and there are many peripheral benefits, but the base salary is hard to live off of in the operations environment."
good,"taking care of client needs, management need it improvement but team was a great team to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unfair treatment."
good,This organization does not appreciate its temp to prm employees.

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Working at Wachovia was an amazing place to work at until the business was sold to Wells Fargo

Once at the Private Banking level all staff there worked under minimal supervision because it was understood that to be there you knew what you were doing, what was expected and you were expected to deliver.

I learned everything from the basics of retail banking to the fundamentals plus of Investments and Trust Allocation in my time at Wells. I was exposed to every division of the Wealth Management Group and for that I am eternally thankful. Wells was a company that believed in supporting it's employees and celebrating them as well. I developed wonderful mentor relationships with my management staff. The hard part of the position though would have to be at times getting a last minute call from a client who wants to complete a transaction and they do not understand nor do they want to hear the word NO.

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Good company to work for just a lot of constant changes and no true defined policies or procedures. Lack of support from Management. Once they have the new system in place it should be better. Micro management which brings the moral down for the team. Favoritism is shown to certain team members.
good,"I absolutely loved working for Wells Fargo in IT for almost two years being 100% remote for that entire time. However, they recently hired a new CIO who is very out of touch and old-fashioned by wanting everyone  to go in to an office. If you are not located near an office (not just a bank branch) you will be let go. Also, any new hire positions cannot be remote even if the existing team is still remote.  "

If you apply before that time you get another 3 months added on."

good,A typical day involved a lot of clientele.  A constant exchange of monies and friendly smiles.  As tellers we tried to always please the customer and offer friendly suggestions to make their banking needs more effective and enjoyable.  I was able to look up their accounts and print our a variety of bank statements and other personal or business information that was helpful.  It was important to take our time to make sure all of our transactions were accurate and accounted for.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"It was very stressful to be obligated to do sales everyday. Other than that was perfect, as coworkers, managers environment. The days go by fast as its always busy."
good,It was great minus the pay. There is no way someone can live off that. I was a college student at the time and struggled financially for a long time. It seemed there was no opportunity for advancement.
good,"I worked at the westheimer and lazy hollow location. We ended up losing both managers and things became hectic. We all worked overtime, policies weren't being followed, we were on the verge of failing the audit (I believe the lady just felt bad for us). Before all of this though, Wells Fargo was a great fit for me it's just after losing the managers it became very stressful."

good,"Working with Wells Fargo was a great success for me. I was able to not only use the skills and talents that I have acquired over the years but learned so much more.

good,"Very fast past "

good,"Wells Fargo it's self is a really great company. The work was good, the pay was fair but the management is horrible. I had worked for Wells Fargo for over 7 years and I probably would have stayed if the management there wasn't so horrible."
good,"Love the job and the people I work with. Hate the hours and how unset they are and can be.  Very fluctuating. Wonderful company to work with, but you also should have a second job."
good,Wells Fargo as a company to work for was enjoyable. Some managers needed to be replaced. The company does a lot for the communities they are in and a lot for the employees.
good,"Competitive, a lot of change of policy and public backlash over company media is pretty tough but overall they treat employees fair...................."
good,I was with the company for 5 years.  I went through the big change that was an explosion in the media with the scandal and I will say that the company as a whole is different than it was 5 years ago.
good,A typical day involves reviewing third party review. I learned negotiation skills and collaborating with internal and external clients. Management is open policy.
good,I learned a lot about closing as far as the documents that needed to go out to the closing agent and the like. I saw the day in and day out issues that arose with trying to get docs to the closing table on time. I enjoyed the closers that I worked with as I learned a lot from them while I was there.
good,"You see and learn a lot in 20 years.  Wells Fargo has been a great company to work for, overall.  However, there have been many changes over the years . . .some good . . .some not so good.  Senior management touts its theme of team members as the competitive advantage but really needs to put that into practice."
good,Great place to start and gain experience. You are able to learn a lot about the banking business as long as you work hard and have someone supporting you
good,It was easy to meet their collector goals and metrics. Since all your calls were outbound to credit cards that were past due it was a fairly easy job.  The more calls you made the more money you collected.  Didn't have a bonus plan at that time.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo has been a wonderful company to work for.  I have really enjoyed the benefits they have offered as well as my co-workers. I have really enjoyed the many years i have been with the company.
good,I have been working at this company for nearly 15 years and I have enjoyed it thoroughly. I need more flexibility and opportunity to advance. I needed more of a challenge to allow me to grow more.
good,I loved this place unfortunate the job was temporary. I would go back if offered a new position.I have nothing bad to say about the company. They treat you well.

good,I enjoyed my time here.  Way more laid back than BOA.  I would have like better organization.  For the most part it was a great learning curve.  I would recommend you know what you want to do when you arrive.
good,"Very busy, you do need to be able to multi task and manage priorities.  Also be prepared to provide excellent customer service via email or phone as well as in person."
good,I worked as a part-time teller. My day consist of cashing checks and making deposits. I learned how important it is to pay attention to what you are doing. Management was really great. Just the job security was the biggest concern.
good,need better management some retire and others come in and take over like there is no tomorrow and alienate the original teams and bring in their friends to work.
good,"In a sales role, you may hate your job, but wells Fargo has a great compensation plan and pays huge commissions. If the job pays good, it is a good job in my opinion. Mortgage is unstable however, has up season and down season."
good,this review is based on my experience with my group. Other groups and jobs may differ.  It is definitely a great place to start one's career.  I was exposed to a lot of deals and even did more then what was asked for my role aka dealing with customers.  The only knock I have is the pay sucks and that's why I plan on leaving.
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work. I have learned a lot since my employment and I work with great people. Wells Fargo is a great place to work.
good,overall is a great place to work but it takes to much of your life with the work hours there's no time for family. If you have help for your kids or is single its the best place to work.
good,Worked for 3D Datacom providing planned network enhancements at various Wells Fargo sites along the east coast this year.
good,Received inbound call and occasionally made outbound calls on customer request. Management were very laid back and were very helpful when needed. Hardest thing about working in this department with Wells Fargo was it was only a temporary position. No room to be hired on and the end of the contract wasn't set and was sudden when ended.
good,"If you are working for the right management team, the sky is the limit. A good market is key.  If you are hired in to a bad market with a district leader who does not follow integrity, you will be miserable."
good,I like the type of job that I do. mega mergers and technology has diminish this type of job. it is not a secure job and pay is not good but that's just the way it goes...
good,"I worked with an excellent group of professionals. Lots of us had no experience in AML. However, I can say Wells Fargo served us well by giving me a career patch that I'm still on and really enjoy it. The day was filled with new work that always challenged me to learn new things. The management staff is really the most encouraging thing for me because they took an interest in my learning and desire to really learn the knowledge it took to really be successful in the AML world. The co-worker were world class team members. We did lots of things together outside of work being we worked downtown we would always be together during the many events that took placed just outside our office doors.The hardest part of the job is when they decided not to keep all 200 team members."
good,"Productive and fun place  to work"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Helping customers financial and also help them succeed financially. Getting to know our customers on a regular basis and work by multitasking different task at the same time.
good,"Very structured environment fun place to work, learned to interact and get multiple personalities to work together to achieve personal and team goals. Peers and overall team members very friendly and easy to work to work with.  The hardest part of the job was management as they are very impatient and panicky when it comes to seeing things through and not allowing things to take root to really change for the positive. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming into work know what had to be done and leaving each and every day knowing you accomplished what you came in to do."
good,Great Opportunities for advancement. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics but expected from big companies.
good,"I had an overall positive experience at Wells during my almost 9 years. I was let go under questionable circumstances never having a productive discussion with management. Management needs to focus on leadership, and development of employees as opposed to being strictly numbers driven."
good,"Before Wells Fargo, the bank was called Wachovia, Wachovia did things for the employees, fun stuff, When Wells Fargo took over they set about getting rid of all employees from Wachovia."
good,"Aggressive sales goals and forcing bank products down customers throats but not enough bonus for what we have to do. Other than that, good company to work for. Some managers are great, other sucks. Just depending what branch you go to."
good,"Good company to work for, excellent benefits  Good work environment, opportunities  for promotions. Excellent managers and training programs."
good,"Wells Fargo TOG division is tough. It is very fast paced, very demanding and some work long hours 6 days a week to keep up with the demands. Technology is constantly changing, so being slow is not an option."
good,"typical day at work- was pretty good"
good,I have had a great past working for this establishment. I appreciate the learning and success that I have gone through. I am looking for more opportunity at another reputable company.
good,"Wells Fargo was an ideal job that helped   me to reenter the job A  typical day there was exciting, The duties I had there were very easy to understand. I enjoyed the teamwork that ywas performed bycoworkers and I was excllent"
good,The work itself was great.  The manger did not keep me well informed.   I was really surprised when my contract ended.  I wanted to be hired permanent. I would still go back if they wanted me to.
good,Wells Fargo cares for their employees and offers support and education to employees. Great benefits and retirement plans. Could work on changing some guidelines in mortgage application processing center in order to close more transactions.
good,"Established quantitative models for using VIX to hedge clients’ portfolios when market goes down."
good,"When my husband was working sixty hour weeks, and not able to enjoy a balanced blend of home and work life, I volunteered my management skills as his assistant."
good,WF has not adapted as quickly to the changing economy. Unrealistic goals and replaceable attitude towards their employees.
good,"I appreciate every job opportunity regardless of the experience. The experience has helped to build my resume, skill set, and knowledge base. I have gained excellent marketability from each and every position I have held."
good,"Job was good, you're at a call center with 8 employees in 1 isle just a few feet from each other. 8hrs answering calls from upset customers about the online banking. Troubleshooting issues and assisting them with the website. Management was good, co workers were great very helpful. I learned a lot of the online banking and how to deal with all kinds of personalities with out taking them personal. Hardest part of the day was when customers didn't want to hear the policy they just wanted their way but the most enjoyable part was when I can help the customer resolve their issue and make their phone experience smooth and easy."
good,"My gripe with Wells Fargo is the job category classifications, and regional salary midpoints within each category.  Once you reach the midpoint of your job class, your pay increases begin to go down until the point it reaches zero.  Many positions do not have a higher job category, or there are too many others with that higher category to advance.  This really forces your hand to do things like post your resume on Indeed.com."
good,Enjoyed working their and learned a lot.  Good management.  Great co-workers.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Day was as if you were not at work, very easy work load and awesome managers at times."
good,"Wells Fargo has been one of the best companies I have worked for in my current career. I can say that I have been blessed to work in such an industry in allowing me to gain experience and knowledge in multiple aspects: customer service, sales, marketing, management, HR, community involvement, laws and regulations. "
good,"A typical day at work I would have to provided excellent customer service to clients, collect past due mortgage payments and regularly met monthly goals, reconciled customer complaints regarding missing payments, and loan transfers,educated customers regarding mortgage history,offered payment alternatives to customers with past due balances. I learned how to move and work in a fast past environment."
good,"Look at sales report, have a morning huddles, contact anyone who we met the day before to follow up with anyone.  planning for the day and how we could get 20 sales goals daily."
good,"This company is awesome. Unfortunately at times you run into horrible management styles at different branch locations, but that’s the reflection of that manager and not the company itself. However when you do encounter with a great leader the sky is the limit for you."
good,Meeting perspective students and being an ambassador for L.I.U-Southampton College was a fun and educational experience.
good,Great place to work - credit card processing system sales was my speciality.  Wells offers a full-range of financial services
good,"A typical day at work consisted of making sure everyone pipeline was maintained and up to date on their workflow. Managing pipelines and reports via spreadsheets. I learned a plethora of knowledge about how short sales and modification process works. I learned excellent customer service skills and became more proficient with spreadsheets, access and outlook. I loved my co-workers. They were very easy to get along with and made some great friends and looked up to me for my knowledge of the job. The hardest part of the job was the distance from my home and the lack of advancement."
good,Base rates raised felt like was set up for failure.  Loved co-workers.
good,Numbers driven environment with a considerable amount of interaction with the customer base.
good,"I am enjoying working for Wells Fargo for the past 4 years and look forward to many more if I can a position that fits me, but I am also looking at outside opportunities to see if I can further my career."
good,I was given the opportunity to work with out supervision as I knew what was expected of me
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was leading efforts that had a direct impact to corporate objectives and goals.
good,A great place to work great culture however low pay and benefits.
good,"It was a great job if you enjoy property and casualty insurance; however, they closed my specific location."
good,A Typical day arrive at 7:00 am start working in the assinged quques. What i learned i learned to balance my workload prioritizewhat needs to get done right away and what can wait . Management wasnt the best. The hardest part of the job was being intrrupted by the phone calls. Managemnet wanted the accouts we worked to have no mistakes but yet we were intrrupted on almost every account due to a phone call. I did enjoy working with my co-workers .
good,The work environment is great.  Great work hours. the best part of the job is vacation and 500pm
good,customers take the hit so employees can benefit with the salary
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Review anywhere from 40-120 resumes per req to pre qualify candidates. Those that were qualified would be seet up to have an initial phone interview with myself regarding background, skills and culture fit within the group being applied for. Based on my feedback this person would then get an interview with a hiring manager or be rejected. "
good,"WF is an amazing company to work for.  This entry level job has all the other qualms as any other so not too much to really complain about.  IF you can get in, do your year, and get out this job is ok."
good,"My time at Wachovia was amazing. I had an amazing group of individuals that I had the pleasure of working with along with an amazing boss. I left only because of the Wells Fargo merger, the change in job description from Customer Service to Sales, the loss of my 12% shift differentiation for working odd hours and the lack of job security. My time at Wachovia was a great one though, and while I worked for the company I thought it was a great employer."
good,My typical day at work can be hetic. We have deadlines to meet and customers who are wanting their loan processed and closed as quickly as possible. I am never late on any of my projects or files since I have been able to learn our harp program quickly. Our department changes daily. There is always something new with a government program in our mortgage department. 
good,"Working at Wells was a very well diverse company It has a work out rooms that can be used at anytime of the day,so you can work off stress before and after work. flexible work hrs."
good,working here i learned the value of customer serivice and how to work better in difficult situations the fact or meeting and being trusted with so many responsibilities was incredible.
good,"i learned a lot about the Mortgage dept. on how to manage your pipeline what has the most poritorty and what is needed to complete a refinance, how all paper work has to be in order & up to date. because we were so busy i had to learn a lot on my own by asking questiions, i enjoy speaking with customer and hearing how excited they are on purchasing or refinancing their home"
good,I've had the most amazing experience of growing thanks to my assigned position as Administrative Assistant 1 in the Corporate Trust Services through Office Team. Now in the insurance I'm perceiving the same.
good,Ability to work with law offices to benefit customers to get loans closed and funded. Opportunity to learn federal and state lender guidelines and rules.
good,"The hardest part of the job at Wells Fargo is that you can't get sucked into the ""sales before the customer"" mentality."
good,Fast past environment
good,Provided excellent customer service to members regarding accounts products
good,The most enjoyable part of working with Wachovia is that this company has great opportunity for upwards advancement.
good,"processes customer transactions within established guidelines. Identifies and makes sales referrals, recommends alternate channels, cross-sells bank services and products for Wells Fargo partners, provides excellent customer service. Duties may include safe deposit, merchant/vault, ATM processing, bonds and coupons, foreign currency and night drop."
good,enjoyed my job wish it wasnt temporary assignment. great environment vey ncie coworkers
good,"A typical day at work for me, is assisting small business customer with there business needs. Duties include but not limited to processing credit card transaction through Wells Fargo database. Filing disputes for fraudlent check card purchases, assisting customer with telephone transfer. Also have aggressive sales approach to best fit each customer needs."
good,Assist customers with their operation.
good,"Working at Well Fargo, one will learn what it takes to be a great sales person and customer service. One should be detail oriented and professional. The job tasks are a bit routine, so one must like conducting everyday routine job duties."
good,There was never a typical day at work.It was always changing. I like the fact that I learned something new everyday. Fraud is a very large operation and there is a different type of fraud everyday.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A typical day at work starts at 10:30 am and ends at 7pm. I perform customer service for small business owners. Management is not the best but they definitely want you to do well. Coworkers are great.I would say the hardest part of the job is the expectancy keeps changing. We are loaded with more and more work everyday but not compensated for it. I would be willing to stay there if they offered me better hours. What i enjoy most about the job is the availability to advance.
good,"Working at Wells Fargo, I've learned 10 keys, researching abilities, being a leader and a motivator. The management level was top notched and they care about our quality and performance. They will do anything they can to make the workplace better by having us provide feedback."
good,"Good pleace to work , good people, training could be a lil more hands on. wouldnt reccomend to someone who has a hard time affording expensive wardrobe.. you got to look pretty everyday! personally not my kind of work."
good,Great company to work for. I’ve learned so much. This  company is a great career opportunity. You get out of this company what you put into it. Very fair
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work if you enjoy customer facing customer service work. Training program is very thorough and easy to apply to actual job responsibility. Bad is hours (weekend work) and paid time off is linked to other employees time off. difficult to get time off. Salary is poor and career advancement if difficult.
good,"working at wells fargo was the perfect day to day job i loved it, trainning is definitely beneficial . pay rate is great, they are very big on the mission of wells fargo."
good,good place to work overall! Really got to make great friendships! Not the best paying bank but not the worst. Banking hours not the best. No sales goals anymore all very customer centric based! Great way to start your banking career
good,"Like anyplace there is politics involved.  Ideally it does not interfere with your job.  Overall I have had some really exceptional management whom I learned a lot from, and I have also had some that had only their personal interests in mind.  Hopefully they have retained the great ones and not the more selfish ones.   I have not worked there in a while and since then they have had to reinvent and rebrand themselves.  While there was a lot of sales pressure, I never felt that I had to compromise my ethics to get sales.  So for those who felt it, they may have had different pressures from their management, limited resources or lowered ethics.  To compensate I had to do a lot of canvasing for new customers off the clock but in a sales position, I believe it is just a mindset you have or you don't have.  This was almost 10 years ago so I do believe that culture is gone now that they do not have sales goals.  "
good,We had a daily quota to meet as individuals as well as the team. I learned a lot about the banking industry until it made me put forth extra effort. I enjoy talking to different customers on the phone. It really melts my heart when I'm able to give a customer great satisfaction. I love going beyond and extra for customers.
good,"Very good place to work,you are able to grow and being promoted is always encouraged. The environment is good and you have many resources to assist whenever needed."
good,"WFB Online Division was a great place to work with wonderful people. Unfortunately I had to relocate out of state or I might still be working there. "
good,"The best job ever . "
good,"Always changing with an opportunity to advance. Fast paced with ample opportunties to learn.Training was constant because of the fast paced environment of state and government laws are always changing . Along with company guidelines , policies."
good,"Love the company, however, depending on the department you're in advancing can be very difficult. The benefits that are offered are great. I do find it strange that most entry-level positions they don't advertise internally to employees that want to move to a different department."
good,T hff e job was great. Most managers were professional except one. The pace was fast and very competitive .  The work flow heavy which I loved. I was busy.
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to work for with great benefits and incentives. Great supervisors and good with moral and acknowledgements of appreciation
good,"I honestly enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo, just that the manager at the branch I worked at was not good. I ended up feeling stuck once they had gotten ride of bonuses due to their ""Scandal"". The branch I worked at was apparently too busy for me to relocate to another branch, and when I requested advancement recommended by the VP went through the interview process. Didn't get any follow up from the recruiter, and the new hire that got the position was clearly not experienced in banking in the U.S. I attempted to relocate however I was unable to. If I had gotten the position I would most likely still be working there, or even if I relocated to a closer branch. The staff and company were great."
good,"Worked in an environment that was not beneficial to my growth."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The only bad thing that I can say when I worked here is that the sale goals were ridiculously high. It stressed everyone out. The managers I had made it fun to work and I learned a lot.
good,Overall Wells Fargo was a great company to work for. The sad thing is that Senior Management made some very poor decisions to better their selves instead of looking out for the company.
good,I enjoyed working as a team leader with Wells Fargo.  Training new associates was my strong point.  The hardest part of the job was trying to service a non serviceable customer or an associate that wasn't trainable.  For the most part everyone got a long with each other and supported each other when needed.
good,I learned alot working here and can see a long career on the Broker side of healthcare working with clients and their employess. Ling hours but flexibility with work from home and time off
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work, there are production goals so you should get faster processing files as you gain more experience. Sometimes there are new files that take time but for the most part the work is repetitive. Sometimes we receive 1 project in a mass amount and so at different times certain things become priority, but  you also can't get behind on your other work. It becomes fun once you figure out how to balance a heavy work load. Then the reward is; there are weeks where the work comes in slow and so it becomes more of a relaxed environment."
good,"Benefits at Wells are good"
good,"Management was off page from P&P - never on the same page, would be told to do one thing and the next it was completely wrong. Would be accused of not fallowing P&P when it was exactly fallowed. Management was rude and very hostile to certain employees."
good,I've worked for Wells Fargo Advisors for over 10 years. The people are all fantastic and I've loved every minute of it. The only reason I would leave is for a pay increase.
good,"no words their not to much to say not enough help for individuals who have tuff personal lives. company great. The issue is managers having favorites, not the same treatment, lack of getting help when needed, dealt with alot of attitude from well groom agents."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the office environment which was very friendly and organised. The cafeteria was very accessible to employees at Lunch.
good,"Log into the phone to take incoming calls. Calls vary upon call value, requires a lot of reading. You can learn an absence of financial tips and comes along with benefits."
good,"Wells Fargo was very accommodating to me while I went to school. I was able to take night classes at the university and have 1 day off during the week in order to pursue my degree. Unfortunately I could not continue to develop within the financial sector, as I was working for consumer retail, so I pursued external opportunities."
good,"great company with lots of benefits. i love wells fargo and i always have and will no matter where my career takes me, but sadly im at a stand still and need to try something new"
good,"Management left a lot to be desired, hard to find work life balance, loved my co-workers and benefits. Pay is below average for underwriting. Location excellent."
good,This is very diverse company.  I work people form all over.  I have learned a lot from my time with the company.  I really enjoy my job and my position in  the department.  I would not want to work in any other department.  There is no where for me to move up to.  I can not move to higher position than I am in until someone leaves.  This company has good benefits and 401k plan. They also have good resources for helping a team member in need.
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for.  Received valuable training and coaching to excel on a daily basis.  Gained invaluable knowledge and skill set.
good,Audits and risk are increasing drastically. Systems are extremely outdated. Management is finding it difficult to keep up with all the new policies concerning risk.
good,"loved the job pay was not good. if was a way for career growth I would to go back. •	Working in a professional environment where I explained, promoted, and sold products and services to customer such as travelers' checks, savings bonds, money orders, and cashier's checks. Using computerized information about customers to tailor recommendations and handling large sum of money."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I like working at baking industry, since it is fast moving industry with challenge works.  I think wells fargo is not only committed to banking but also its community. They put people first, cultivating and treasuring meaningful relationship."
good,All employees were very kind and helpful. The job itself was very stressful. There was so much pressure to meet certain quotas. Without the proper training. Glad I was personally able to catch on fast and exceed expectations.
good,I love working there. I feel like I am a part of the work culture there except for when there are activities specifically designed to not included managed resources.
good,"I really like this company and its focus on delivering a world class customer experience and maximizing on its team members' abilities to engage customers in conversations. I do not like that advancement opportunities are limited. For managers, it feels like you are held in this role and unable to gain the necessary experience that it takes to move your career forward. In the past, managers were advised that to stay in their role because it was a direct indicator of how profitable and successful a branch is. The longer a manager was is their role, the higher the profit and smaller the turnover."
good,"Wells Fargo offered a very supportive environment. Team building and collaboration were a huge positive. For a large corporation, I never felt like a number, but a respected team member. The management team and senior executives were always available to mentor and encourage growth in my career and job skills."
good,I really liked the people in my department. I personally thought that management left a lot to be desired. More importance was put on procedures rather than on the quality of customer service.
good,"I was commercial credit department manager assistant when I left in 1984. I reviewed commercial loan documentation to ensure all required documentation was on file. Also I reviewed commercial loans for their credit worthiness based on their grades which determined whether they were reviewed monthly, quarterly semi-annually or annually. I went through intensive training in order to perform this responsibility learning to interpret commercial financial statements and write thorough reviews describing companies' financial health and ability to repay their indebtedness. I generally admired local management except for the fact that, in the end, after much training and keeping the commercial loan officers on their toes, getting much better audit results, I hit a wall and wasn't offered much hope for more advancement; hence, my departure when the sudden loss of childcare occurred."
good,"I worked for about a year in the auto finance collections department, the primary duty was calling those late on payments. It was a bit challenging at times but was also nice to use the tools to assist those who needed it."
good,I have enjoyed my multiple positions with Wells Fargo but found that I am better suited to managing a large multifaceted sales team or fulfillment team.
good,"Many job opportunities for someone in the Technology field, but not always in the San Antonio area."
good,"I liked working for this company.  Good benefits, fair pay.  Job growth and expectations were clear.  Good work life balance as well.  I would recommend working here again."
good,"•	Responding and resolving inquiries and complaints for investment products and services from clients "
good,"Wells Fargo is an excellent company to work for because of their benefits. However, they have changed the bonus structure for my position. This has caused me to have to look elsewhere for a better oppertunity"
good,"Management was knowledgeable, workplace was not stressful, the job could be stressful. I was able to learn FNMA and Freddie Mac, user friendly systems."
good,As an assistant for the Wells Fargo Advisors team I had the experience of understanding the modality of how financial advisors work. It was a very enjoyable experience.
good,Awesome place to work as long as you are apart of a good team. Company is going through change but overrall not a bad company or experience. Definitely an opportunity to grow as long as you are willing to put in the work.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Has culture of caring - through its value system."
good,After being with the company 11 plus years I have grown tremendously. It's an environment that shapes leaders and now I feel it is time to spread my wings and explore what else is out there.
good,There are many opportunities but also constant change. Commitment to constant learning is important and networking is key to advancement. Many opportunities to participate in risk management due to scrutiny on the banks these days.  The risk programs are many and keeping up with all of the teams and reporting structure is a task (thus so much re-org).  It can be difficult to stay in a certain area due to re-organizations and the number of people competing for positions.  The workplace culture is diverse.
good,"Coworkers was great. At times goals were hard to reach. Leads were very helpful. Peers were helpful as well. Great benefits. Even though work was serious, we had a lot of activities to make the easier."
good,"Excellent manager and a good place to work."
good,The work culture is great. It's structure on a team environment were you have a lot of support. Training classes available to anyone. Managers are available for one on one to offer support.
good,It's a great job I just can't sit down for 8hrs a time I have to be up and moving around but over all a great job to have. Great first job. I would advise anyone who loves sitting setting
good,real nice friendly people and real fun place to work at consistent and cater to the employee offer training as well as great help on the floor when needed
good,"Wells Fargo is an excellent company to work for.  I have been there several times and if I had to it all over again, I would have never left. Great coaching team. They are on top of the empire."
good,Its a great place to work! I really enjoy working here. I have been with the company for a long time. The atmoshpere is fun and safe. I love my co workers.
good,"Personal bankers work in retail banking branches and assist customers with various needs, such as opening checking and savings accounts; obtaining mortgage and auto loans; investing in certificates of deposit (CDs), money markets and other commercial banking products; and planning for retirement or college.2"
good,"Typical workday revolved around, doing my daily tasks. Usually i was left alone to do my work, and then help out with others if needed or asked. worked with other team members on projects."
good,"I love working for WellsFargo because its a great company ,but mainly because I really love my team. Everyone was great, we all got a great relationship. I enjoy the location, the customers. My experience was great with the exception when it get very busy. The location in Ashford Dunwoody peak time in 11:30-1:30PM CHAOTIC!"
good,"Make no mistake, this is a high demand company, but if you can keep pace and are success focused you will find a home where you can advance quickly and learn a lot in the process."
good,"working at Wells Fargo taught me good values and integrity, good work ethics, and challenged me to manage my own clients, and growth from other managers and team members helped me grow from the bottom 5 to top 3, i really loved my job, gotten emails from CEO about my performance with customizing the banking experience to each life styles, making a new way of banking, i gotten a rise before i left Wells Fargo"
good,"I worked in the Wholesale Sales Operations in two functional roles. The first role was compiling all of the China transactional to ensure applicable taxes were applied correctly. Second role, I worked in the Risk Escalation division disseminating business reports to all impacted line of businesses that were impacted from errors globally when processing of payments from business subsidiaries were interrupted due to a system change order design that failed, new server added that failed, or perhaps manual processing errors due to not reading letter of credit appropriately."
good,"Of all of the financial services institutions that I have worked for, WFC is the leader in my book in terms of building a sustainable, long term career."
good,I loved working for Wells Fargo. I just didn't like the differences moving from one regional district to another. It was almost like working for a whole different company.
good,"I was very happy working at WF, everyone was supportive and always helping one another.  Good benefits, excellent communications, technology second to none...."
good,i have not felt very secure in this position. There has been guite a bit of moving around and I'm have been looking to return to an underwriting position within the bank for some time now.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,If Wells Fargo did not have so many lay off for unexpected reasons it would be a great company to work for. The job stability is not dependable. They have wonderful benefits but at any given time your department could be discontinued.
good,Working at a Wells Fargo contact center was a very stable and productive place to work. I liked my working relationships with my co-workers and management.
good,I enjoyed the group I worked with and did not have a comprehensive view of the whole company. The bank is currently under investigation for unscrupulous acts to customers. My team was in advisory so it had nothing to do with these acts.
good,WFA is good place to work.  Nice people and conservative management.  Huge company.  Culture good.  Parking is a pain and working downtown....location is not greatest in terms of safety.
good,"wells Fargo was a great place to work for, it was a lot of advancement options available everyone worked together as a team, salary was fair, team work, and great culture"
good,Wells fargo is a very good corporation to start a career in mortgage banking.  Good company to grow with. Training program is a cut above the rest and opportunites are available.
good,"Good people and interesting work. The sense of teamwork and being on the same team came through everyday,  I enjoyed the casual atmosphere of the work environment."
good,I have learned a lot and gained so many skills with this company. They really have great benefits for their employees. This job and this position has been good for my professional growth and will be a great addition to my resume.
good,Every day going into work is different. You either have a relaxed day or you have a busy day. It can be quick-paced when you get rushes or when it is busy all day overall. It is a very friendly environment and very team oriented. Training and Shadowing helps you learn the basics of the everyday job. You learn the system and you learn the products that Wells Fargo offers to customers. It is a very customer serviced oriented job and its amazing how you can make or break someones day.

I've truly enjoyed most of the people that I have worked with, its a very easy going culture everyone is willing to help you grow and move up. Management is hands on for the most part whether upper level or your manager in the branch. I've learned so much about all the tools and ways to be financially healthy, also in the ways of coaching my team members. Not everyone likes to be coached the same way. I've also increased my communication skills while working with my managers to articulate what I need from them as well what they need from me. The hardest part of the job, when you have your slow days. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to get to know my customers, help them accomplish their financial goals whether its setting a savings goal and reaching it or getting them to another partner and that be successful."

good,"Wells Fargo was a great place to start in the mortgage business, but the pay was not very competitive. They did have good benefits while I was working there."
good,"In my experience, with slow traffic during certain hours of the day is where you need to take most advantage of. I work in a steady-heavy traffic pace environment and it's honestly those slow times where you can actually get work done. You really need to speak up to management because they normally have to juggle a million things at once in their minds and if you don't say anything on what you need to, nothing will be done, you will not be heard or understood. It's best to just say something, ""Raise Your Hand"""
good,"I learned different aspects of the company helping other department and ability to move to other jobs.I was able to learn finance by helping that department when they didn't have enough coverage. Company is very good to employee's with the benefits and vacations. And works with employee's to accommodate the different start and end times when needed. My job gets to call companies for money and that doesn't always go very well so need to confirm we have a signed lease - sometimes customers not happy or have excuses why payment isn't sent. I love that I continue to learn something new every day. My group go out for lunches, playing pool, bowling. We invite managers from different departments to our monthly meetings to help us learn about other job responsibilities and policies."

You had enough support and training to understand your job well and the opportunity to move up. The benefits are decent if you chose to take them. Quarterly bonuses and a chance to be recognized. I truly enjoyed this job and would have stayed if the branch did not close and there was a place at another location in my area. I felt valued as an employee and a person. Management takes the time for your opinions and questions and stands by you. I have noticed that I compare new management at different job to management at Wells Fargo and miss it."

good,"Great Place to work, Management is knowledgeable and will allow for flexibility in your schedule. They are even starting to allow Remote work for underwriters."
good,"Work is simplified because the training is very good and provides exactly what every employee should know in executing our jobs.  My supervisor is very effective and the most supportive higher up.  The department manager provides time whenever an employee seeks an audience to vent out our concerns, problems, and all other work related needs.  The team I belong to is truly amazing. The primordial ordeal of common employees is the security of tenure.  Being a good company which renders good service, we hope that it also provides security of tenure to its employees.  The culture we see is that the company can dispose employees at will anytime, which makes it non motivational to stay."

good,"Really enjoyed my coworkers, they were always kind especially in the morning. I was disappointed I could not continue my contract there because of conflicts I had in my own life."
good,"Great staff, managers and overall a wonderful place to work. Lots of stress at times due to influx in volume; however, most if not all employees were team players.  Lots of room for growth and proper tools for training."
good,Great for operations side. You get bonus. No bonus for Administrative Assistants. Trying to be more diverse but no high black leaders but they do have women.
good,"i was part of the layoffs they had in 2016, so i wasn't with the bank for too long. i was there long enough to get a general feel of the work environment which was laid back but busy."

This was a fast paced environment that was extremely challenging. The team was incredible to work with! The training associated with this position was amazing!"
good,"Steady work until business dropped off/slow times lead to lay offs, otherwise was a nice company to work for with Co-Workers who are team players and family atmosphere."
good,"As with any company, there is good and bad. I like Wells Fargo because of the excellent benefits and discounts offered to employees. The work environment is different based off where you are located. I worked in Virginia with Wells Fargo and the atmosphere was completely different from when I worked in Charlotte. To me, the work ethic was better in Virginia not to mention the pay was better as well. "
good,Management promotes advancement. Very scheduled and organized priorities for the day. Processes are very streamlined for all locations. Being able to input ideas and to be taken seriously is a hard task to achieve.
good,the company is great to work for. you just have to be careful with what door your foot got into. cause moving within a group is easy but transitioning between groups takes a lot of effort

good,"Great work experience, very professional employees and loads of activities for one to advance their career. I've worked there several times, as far back when in was First Union. Many of the folks are still there, most in management positions."
good,Wells Fargo was one of the greatest companies I worked for. It was a great experience to work for such an established company that values its customers and employees.
good,Focused on strengthening customer relationships by focusing on cross selling products to become one stop financial center for all financial needs for customers
good,"great place to work great management, great benefits awesome bonuses. health coverage, supportive team and supervisor, starting pay is reasonable as well as training course and length of time."
good,"Would recommend anyone to work here. Well trained management, reliable co workers and excellent training for new employees. They supply you with all the tools you need to succeed in your position."
good,It was a good job to work for as a newbie into mortgage.  I have great customer skills which really showed and I gained lots of knowledge about the operations.
good,"lets just say i should have never left. great atmosphere with great people, willing to work with family and school the only down side is the half saturday"
good,"the day was good."
good,Trained teammates on the Mortgage System for two to six days. Once completed We would support the teammates in their daily responsibilities. 
good,"Good place to work. Competitive pay and overall great team work environment. Awesome benefits and discounts. Changes in company created issues, but they were overcomed"
good,Great company to work for. Would like them to make it more balanced between Job rolls with pay. There has been a lack of focus around Management and equal pay.
good,Wells Fargo is a good place. They no longer have a branch in Springfield Mo. I left because there was talk of closing our branch and they did. We had a great team!
good,"I loved it there. I wouldnt have left if I didnt have to relocate. I will go back there any day if they have another role for me there. Also, I loved the team so I guess that had plenty to do with my experience in my time there."
good,I can't complain much. It's a wonderful work environment and the company is great! You really get to learn a lot as you go and you begin to build long-lasting relationships with both co-workers and customers.
good,The company itself is great.  I love the focus on the growth of employees and customers.
good,"i learned all there is to banking, also learned how to dress for success. All my managers there were like coaches to me, they train and help also guide me in the right direction. what i enjoyed there the most was the friendly co workers and customers , hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers, i wasn't so use to that back with my other jobs."
good,I handled 20-30 inbound calls a day with company's submitted payroll for their employees as well as tax information and trouble shooting for clients data entry and provide great customer service.
good,The initial contract had me working with a local manager who was very supportive and interested in my personal growth and advancement.  When the contact changed I began working for a manager out of state who relied more on independance and team work within his team.  Both roles were equally challenging and supportive.
good,"Amazingly huge infrastructure to manage, tons of opportunities to learn."
good,"Enjoyed working for Wells Fargo and loved my job, probably would have still been employed if there was a position available in Charlotte,NC"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo is like any other company - if you get in with a good management team, you will excel and enjoy your job. I do believe in the company as a whole. I believe that they try for a work/life balance. It is overall a great place to work."
good,"Pay is good, usually incentives involved. Vacation and benefits. People I worked with were very professional but relaxed. It was collections though so there are the unpleasantries of what comes with that title."
good,"I really enjoy working for Wells Fargo Bank. The company it self is moving in the right direction with their team members. The one thing I can say is, your branch manager makes, or breaks your feelings about the company. I have had 4 at my time here, and it is quite hit or miss on the culture you end up living. Luckily mine has been good for the most part, but I have seen other team members leave due to management."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Wells and the typical day you handle transactions, process payments, balance, service the ATM, allow customers in to their safety deposit boxes."
good,"Sad to leave. I've enjoyed working with many people and clients with Wells Fargo. Working with our clients was joy and sometimes a hardship, but well worth the time and energy. I've worked with the relocation department for 12 years and have loved every moment. There are always good and bad days with any job, but this one was worth it. I've answered phones, coded loans, and updated computer systems. Again, sad to leave."
good,Wells Fargo gives many work opportunities to grow and promote. Excellent culture of caring of team members. Management is always there to coach and support you.
good,"Good leadership, and competitive environment. Recent news about  Wells makes for difficult conversations at times with prospects. Distinction needs to be made between the conventional banking side (where the incidents took place) and the enterprise lending arm of Wells Fargo. However, to the market its all Wells Fargo."
good,"During my time at the bank, I met many good managers, the structure at Wells Fargo was great, it was a system of check and balances, and it allows you to grow. Unfortunately, during the time I worked at Wells Fargo, the culture of hunting for 8 sales a day was serious. Even on your days off you were required to have 8 sales, that to me was unheard of and it was in my opinion wrong. Now, the only thing is that so many people liked Wells Fargo that having sales came easy. Recently, I have heard that they have changed the culture of needing so many sales a day, and if that is the case then this is an amazing place to work and you should take the chance on a strong company."
good,"Being with the company for almost 3 years now, I can say it is the best company i have ever worked to date. The culture is very welcoming and embraces intercultural diversity."
good,"Reviewing signed applications and agreements, while uploading/imaging into online storage system. I learned how to be better at multi-tasking and the learning the ins and outs of the application process. Management wasn't always on the same page, but myself and my co-workers would always help assist management. The workplace was very quite and social. There wasn't really a hard part of the job, I was able to learn quick and even was used to train other employees. Most enjoyable part was always being able to help when management needed it, them relying on me to help in anyway."
good,Good company to work for. Very customer oriented. Great benefits for their employees. Doesn't have enough recognition or bonus opportunities. WF does offer great PTO to start.
good,"The corporate culture was great. The pay was decent for what you did. I learned a lot. As a contractor you have only 18months. if you like to continue to work there you have to wait 6 months after your contract is over then reapply, assuming the position is still available."
good,Wells Fargo is and exceptional company to start a career with the company cares about their employees and they show that through all the flexible options they offer the workers.
good,"I would say that Wells Fargo as a company is an amazing place to work and to grow. However, some of the departments often ask too much of you as the work load is too much the department to handle."
good,Great place to work with smart and innovative people.  The company is energetic and challenges team members to always better themselves.  Wells Fargo focuses on its people!
good,It very good to work where a person will not feel pressurize to work. Every day challenges where the system will get struck frequently it is very difficult to start the day when the system is not working properly.
good,This was a great work environment but the position was only temporary. Management was excellent and there seemed to be a lot of room for growth within the company.
good,"Company takes care of their employees, great benefits and leadership. There are many opportunities to move up or change your career. Truly the best place I have worked at."
good,"We were always busy but I enjoyed working there. The customers and the people I worked with were great. I learned a lot about how banks work,different accounts, loans, etc."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Great place to work, with allot of autonomy."
good,"Wells Fargo is a nice company overall to work for the pay is good and management was okay. The benefits were great, but stability is scary at Wells Fargo because they are always laying their employees off."
good,"yep I work for them. they are big in Charlotte and west coast. What else would you like to know. they are just like any other big corporation/bank benefits, time off. they strive to aid employees."
good,"Solid co-workers with a good work/life balance culture.  Compensation seems to lag industry competitors.  Overall, a decent workplace with great benefits."
good,"Great place to work, Management is good in handling various tasks, overall work culture is good, many initiatives by company in employee engagement and retention."
good,Wachovia Securities was a great company with a lot of great people wanting to mentor and guide. the company was very relaxed and still professional in nature of its culture.
good,Wells Fargo is a very good company to work for. There are plenty of opportunity for growth within the company. I have been with them 4 years and have had 5 promotions.
good,"Typical day consists of coaching tellers and doing clerical like work. Assist with transactions as well as process. Assist Managers with daily tasks and prep for audit,"
good,"Really strict rules, even though I didn't work for the banking line of business it was a stuffy place to work. I enjoyed the time I had to learn but when Wells fargo and Wachovia merged it was a mess."
good,"The people at the company is work friendly and the systems are easily to configure and install. I enjoyed working with everyone there, especially the full-time IT crew there at Wells Fargo."

good,I loved the management of Wells Fargo that I worked for. I actually enjoyed going into work everyday. I wish I still worked for Wells Fargo. I was very sad when I was terminated.
good,Good Place to Work.  Good health benefits & good work place environment.  PTO & holiday pay is good and average.  Company provides an additional 14 hours a year of paid leave to do community service (which includes going on school field trips & functions with your kids).
good,"A typical work day is just answering phones all day and providing customer service, I have learned to be patient with people, as well as how to help reduce risks for the company as well as the customers. Management is amazing at the phone bank but at the branch level I have experienced the worst. They don't treat you like people and they  only care about themselves succeed and will throw you under the bus at a moments notice. Your coworkers will be nothing short of amazing and the company culture is something to be envied."
good,"Research third parties contact information to submit requests for W-9/W-8 forms and review accuracy. Analyze data, maintain database, develop and perform status reports."
good,This is a great place to work.  Great Management.  My co-workers were wonderful.  Lack of permanent positions.  Very busy and a fun environment.  Would stay if a permanent position opened up.
good,"enjoy working there, I have great team , awesome manager with great understanding. love what I do  everyday for the customer. The district manager is the best manager I have ever work for"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo was  a good place to work for before the market crashed. Once the market crashed, the economy took a dive and it was very hard to get people into homes at the time."
good,Analyze a variety of different loans and Charge off decisions to minimize banks loss. Mentor less senior team members in the complicated process to make it simpler and easier to understand.
good,"Managed a nbr of high-visibility projects as Test Coordinator working with Business, PMO, IT, QA, etc.  Enjoyed working with teams.  Collaborative culture but not top pay"
good,Wells Fargo is a great company and great to work for I am contracted through a temp so I actually work under them but for the most part I love core and how the training is great place to get experience
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work and advance. The company likes to promote from within to retaining talent and their investment in training.
good,"company is good and o.k. to work for and I work with a good group of people.  We work as a team.  Enjoy my time with First Union, Wachovia and Wells Fargo Bank."
good,Review modifications for borrowers to ensure the proper decision is accurate and correct. Easy to make errors due to multiple workarounds and multiple programs that are available. The error rate is minimal which makes it common for underwriters to be written up.
good,"The company is rooted in core values that were established in 1852. They continue to be the foundation that drives the success of the organization. People are the company's Competitive Advantage."
good,"A typical work day is all about leads and appointments"
good,It's a good place to work; however I am commissioned based high pressure and can't make my monthly obligations.  Management tries to help but is negative due to not making monthly goals.
good,Great co-workers.  Managers on your side.  Compensation can be hit or miss.  Good location in Copley Square.  Room for advancement quickly
good,The bankers hours is nice because you can balance out your work life and family life. In order to grow In the company you really have to push your self. Management main focus is producing success as a group not individuality. Great benefits good company.
good,"its a good place to work since its a great bank, unfortunately i was going for engineer computer science field, so for that reason i had to persuade different dream"
good,"I had the privilege to work at World Savings, which was then purchased by Wachovia, for 15 years.  My final assignment was in the training group, an extremely rewarding experience."
good,"I could have learned more on the job but the company atmosphere did not encourage this. The primary goal was to complete the assignment at hand. WF Capital Finance is located at a corporate complex in Santa Monica named The Water Garden, a well designed and landscaped corporate park. Co-workers were friendly, plenty of room to relax on breaks."
good,"Typical day at work:troubleshoot computer"
good,"A good place to start a career, decent pay for people who have never had a job , enjoyed working there so far. Will recoupment for people who enjoy working with customer service"
good,The company is great to work for and they have opportunities for movement throughout the company.  The culture is great as well!
good,"It overall a great place to work."
good,"If you work hard you will advance.  However, there is a zero tolerance for theft, loss exposure, lying, and not showing up for work.  Every team is different and each district is different.  But in the end Wells Fargo is a business and they will let you go no matter how long you have been there, how good of an employee you are/were.  It is very easy to make friends but you still have to watch out for yourself.  There is a lot of sensitive information you are responsible for and are expected to protect it.  When I was hired we had hands on training and now that is being phased out to virtual training.  There are many daily duties that you are expected to be apart of.  The first, third, and pay days of every month are very busy for any branch.  You are expected to meet your sales goal every quarter and if you don't meet them you will have a one-on-one with service manager to see what can be done differently to help you achieve your goals."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I appreciate the opportunities to learn and grow at Wells Fargo. I have been able to advance my management skills and learn the many aspects of Default Servicing."
good,Wells Fargo has a great team of managers that push you to personal and professional development. The environment is relaxed.

good,"A typical day at work consisted of meetings for multiple projects and executing senor management reviews for implementation."
good,the work was great but the stress levels are not for everyone. I learned that all customers have financial issues and needs assistance.
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo included finding accurate information for customer quickly and being able to communicate it on a level that they would understand. It required the understanding of navigating computer systems promptly and efficiently. You have to handle customer concerns with care, respect, and a sense of empathy. There was also a need to sell and enhance the customer experience through products that may further their relationship with Wells Fargo. Provided quality customer service by displaying patience and understanding  while handling calls that include customer frustrations, deescalating calls and assisting customers to the liking that they stay with company and further their business."

good,This is a great company to work for in any department.  They treat their employees right with benefits and employee treatment.  Wish I never left the company would always recomend anyone to work for this bank
good,I enjoyed working at the company and the job day to day but the pay and hours were not enough. The home and work balance was good day to day but again the hours were not enough and forced me to look for other works. If the company offered more hours and more pay as other banks I do believe they would retain employees longer.
good,"I didn't meet the quota of calls required for each day. It was not a good fit for me. Although, I do get the opportunity to apply for jobs as an employee still which is great. Obtaining a position there is very hard."
good,"I had a great team and supervisor, they had games and contests as incentive for employees. I liked when they had me work in diff departments to test out other things. I liked there cafeteria they like to take care of the employees"
good,Wachovia Bank has a good training program for tellers and tends to promote within which makes it a good bank to start a career.

good,"loved working for wells fargo, I have learned a lot about the financial advising business, however, there is little room for advancement at this point, and I feel that I am ready to take the next step in my career.  I love working with clients and helping them succeed financially"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This company is a great company to work for if you are a student. They work with your schedule and pay is above minimum, plus you get benefits. I would recommend this job to anyone going to school."

They have taught me to play to my strengths and develop my weaknesses then to search for other career paths that fit my strengths and I am passionate about. I have learned so much about myself working here. Especially that I am very analytical and have a knack for written communication and am passionate about integrity and compliance.
good,"A typical day would start off with a morning huddle with the entire team to get the day started. We discuss achievements, production and the customer experience. I learned so much from this company that helped me utilize my previous experiences and apply them to help me become successful. The management had its ups and downs, in the Los Angeles market there was constant change and management was never consistent so it made it difficult to build a steady network or a support system. My co-workers have always been open minded and adaptable to change."
good,"It's a good environment, great people. Diversity is the bank, treats clients very highly and provides excellent customer service"
good,Learned alot about loan reconciliations. Co-workers were fun to work with and there is constant work available. Busy all the way up to the last couple days of the month.
good,With this position it was all about production. Being able to meet daily goals and go above and beyond to satisfy work requirements to get the job done.

Also I have to identify any potential fraud or illegal activity. It is my job to know the rules, regulations, guidelines and laws and implement them in every decision I make on top of my proven good judgment to come up with a decision that best suits all parties involved."
good,"My typical day working as a Teller would be working with Customers' Money, and Making sure that I have handled their financial needs in the appropriate manner.. I have learned that there are many different types of people in this world, but I treat them all as an equal.  My branch has a new manager that is very difficult to work for.  My co-workers are all like Family to me.  The hardest part of my job is not being able to help a Customer that needs Money that I can not provide for them if their account does not have sufficient funds available.  The most enjoyable part of my job is Balancing at the end of every day."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "

good,"This was my favorite job.  I loved my boss, he made the place a great place to work!  I learned that if you work hard, you will get rewarded.  I started as part time Operations, and quickly advanced to full time Operations Supervisor. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers; we were a small branch and became like family.  The hardest part of my job was my low salary.  Unfortunately, the three financial advisers who made up the branch left to pursue their careers at other financial firms.  Because I was in operations, there was no position for me with them.  Wachovia was purchased by Wells Fargo, and I was moved to another branch."
good,"Great first job.  Learned a lot, espically stuff you cannot learn in a classroom.  Praticial life skills that many just don't learn about or acquire anymore"

good,"A typical day started off with a walk through of my team's area with a morning greeting. I then would review my team's previous days activities and address e-mails. My typical day involved handling multiple escalated questions on complex issues and resolving customer complaints. I learned something new almost every day and was involved and the rollout of many complex changes within the department and the mortgage industry. I worked with a great team and within a department that felt like family. I enjoyed all aspects of my job especially the interaction with my team, our customers and my peers. Unfortunately that took me away from the administrational aspects of the job. Working on my time management skills helped me refocus on those duties. I most enjoyed working with the vast diversity of people I came in contact with, from team members I coached and mentored to customers I assisted with complex issues."
good,I would augment existing databases containing company information for my employer who was an investment banker. I learned great organizational skills along with leaning how to use various web scraping softwares. I worked closely with my boss on a number of projects which asked for great attention to detail. The hardest part of the job would be to adapt to new projects at a fast pace. The most enjoyable aspect was that I was allowed to offer my input which was always accepted and considered.

good,"I started this job in August of 1985. I working in the main vault. I counted the deposits for main customers. Then I transferred out to a branch where I was the head teller, new accounts and compliance. A typical day consisted of opening up the drive-up for customers accepting deposits, payments, and cashing checks. I opened up new accounts for customers and set up safe deposit boxes for customers. I was in charge of monthly audit of the tellers, the ATM and the vault. I worked on a team of people who would service the ATMs throughout the Salt Lake Valley. I enjoyed seeing the customers that I had come to know and helping them in whatever they needed."

good,"I love this place. I love the people I work with, and I love what I do."

good,"I had know Idea to do loans but learned quickly. "
good,"Always has been a very customer focused experience company."
good,this was a contract position to a specific cause with specific date. Great support from IT and team hireacy.

My daily activities include coaching, development, training, human resources, providing team building activities, manage the daily functions of the team, and address team members issues as they arise."
good,"Love the schedule, however job security is not always definate"
good,Counted over 200 million dollars a day.It is a very demanding job and room for little error.This job was the sooner you got done the sooner you where off. If money was unaccounted for you must find the error can correct it.At the end of the day I did not like money like I thought I did.
good,"Since WF is such a large company, there is room for advancement. Training is decent, but turnover is high."
good,The typical day at work is sitting down all day typing in checks and invoices...

good,Get to know the customers so I can greet them by name and remeber how they want their daily banking needs done fast and right so they can know their business is valued. I learned working together as a team makes my branch have a great business day daily. The hardest part of the job is servicing two ATM machines and the most enjoyable part is seeing the customers and knowing that they know they are appreciated.
good,Love the people I worked with. Had no room for advancement. The customers should always come first and the struggle was the bank just wanted you to sell no matter what.
good,"Very upbeat environment , good challenges, workable solutions. Great management"
good,"A typical day would be taking inbound calls from account holders and helping with their daily transactions, payments, transfers, and recommending additional products and services to best benefit their needs. I learned that everyone has a different story of life which helped me understand where they were coming from and why they were calling the bank. Management talked about encouragement, but never put actions toward it which was very disappointing. The hardest part of the job was never being able to know the outcome of the individuals that I helped. The enjoyable part was being able, on numerous occasions, to turn an irate customer into a happy customer."
good,"Wells Fargo was a great organization to work for. The work I did was very demanding and also interesting. I was a victim of the nationwide recession and resulting downturn in the Real Estate markets, especially in The Wells Fargo California R/E Loan Group for which I worked."
good,High stress environment
good,"Making sure our Customers had the best banking experience possible. Resolution of cash drawer, teller consignment items, ATM machine, night depository, main cash vault, express box, also order cash and office supplies as needed. The hardest part of my position was selling or referring services that I was not familiar with. I really enjoyed working with the customers and helping them meet and understand their financial needs."
good,"I though Wells Fargo had a great culture in the Costa Mesa office, management and other staff were warm and knowledgeable. They had an open door policy and treated everyone as a team. The only negative was corp HR with respect to the interim positions and layoffs. They had no order, no reasoning on the order and left people employed longer that had no reason to be there. They were able to benefit by getting between a month to two months and had not been on a team nor touched a file for months prior to their notice. While others were on producing teams, with full pipelines, got asked to leave while other sat around playing card games. That was a bit much for me and you can tell my bitterness; however, I would go back, just not as an interim employee. I really enjoyed working there and the people I worked with; the layoff and the origination of it, was not excepted."
good,"I loved working for wells fargo I was an excellent top performer that excelled in every aspect of the job, but I was fired due a personal bias which made me think twice about the company Im currently going through a dispute process with the company to get my job back which is OK but they will let you go for anything."
good,I loved working there til they changed everything from our time going in to days off
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. Itis a very reawrding company for those who wish to work hard.
good,"The company offers wonderful benefits, as well they promote core values and a cultural diversity. Management attitudes do vary per department and also managerial rexpectations are prone to routinely. Generally, Wells Fargo works with your personal life schedules"
good,"I noticed that Wells rarely hires direct. They hire 90% of their staff locally on a temp basis. One min you are happy at work and the next you are called into an office and let go because they decided to ""end the temp contract early"". No security."
good,Good company to work for but management was not always good to work with. It was like walking on egg shells w management. Managers could be rude and passive aggressive
good,"Working at wells fargo has always been a great experience. Besides providing exceptional customer service, we also had to show alot of personality. Being able to smile and let your customer feel at home was always our goal. We made sure that we had communication skills with our customers and were able to listen, understand, and act on any given situation. As a bank teller you had to make sure you were bilingual in both English and Spanish to better understand the customer. The job itself was full of attention to detail and multitasking. Ti perform the job right, a bank teller had to have cash handling experience, ability to use a register, Ability to assist customer with Cash deposits, withdrawals, money and bank transfers, check cashing, money orders,  and cashiers checks."
good,I worked in an environment that was laid back but professional. Good pay and work wasn't too difficult. There are opportunities to move up if you stay long enough.
good,Moving up can be difficult. The company is big on who you know and what kind of impression you left on them. I recently lost a promotion to somebody who had less experience than me and was less qualified due to the fact that they knew the district manager on a friendly level.
good,Great company to work for it's just part time hours and I need more hours..if you like to cook and being with the public this is the rite company for you ..I really love to do what I do
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Great company for entry level position definitely need to work hard to move up in corporate. Managers are always willing to help and push you to succeed
good,"Wonderful place to work with great people and benefits..are out of this world, great location around lots of vendors for break and lunch. Diversity is sincere"
good,The chandler campus is quiet and you are left to manage balance your own time. This is a positive quality for me as i am not micromanaged and I am able to accomplish many of my task ahead of schedule.
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to work for. Plenty of opportunities to explore for a career. However the compensation and advancement is lacking a little.
good,"Great way to start my banking career, great culture, and energetic team with a desire to strive for greatness each day with great management and leadership behind them."
good,"Always helping you to grow and succeed. "
good,Good work life balance with excellent work culture. Colleagues are helpful and everyone will always give a warm welcome. Each team member is a leader and guides you to be successful.
good,"Wells Fargo was a very pleasant experience. The employees and upper class were helpful and outgoing. Also, everyone was team friendly. Didn’t have to many problems. Other than angry customers"
good,"Cash Reconciliation of Clients, Sending out Cash on Time, and extensive Research. Hardest part was balancing cash reconciliation. Wonderful workplace culture, everyone was very helpful, team based environment."
good,"Great place to work! Good place to learn and build on technical skills. Manager is greta and co-workers are diverse and experienced enough to offer good advise, when needed."
good,Wells Fargo provided a friendly work environment.  New facilities and multiple schedules to accommodate a variety of needs.  Upbeat and positive associates and management.
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. There are lots of opportunity for growth and lots of professionals are available to assist in getting you to the position you desire.
good,My experience with this company taught me a lot. How to deal with the public how to gain my trust in specific job sites and also how to run my own job sites with out any supervision
good,I liked working at Wells Fargo with both the managers and co-workers. I worked to different times as a contract employee and covering for people on Maternity leave and injured boss.
good,"no time i do not want to"
good,"Depend in the group you are in, I work for a great manager and excellent group. There has been insitances where people reached out to me personally asking if they can be part of our team because they really enjoy working with our team."
good,"I love my work and looking out for an organization which will help me grow. In turn I plan to help the organization reach new levels. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"It was a great place to start my teller career, I dont personally reccomend working in an in store location but the team environment is great! The only thing is that they are very strict about rules after all the trouble the company itself has been in but they are simple rules to follow they just seem tedious."
good,That setting educated me from a financial aspect and made me more driven towards my goals. My managers made this place healthy and created an environment that enabled progress.
good,"Schools and other benefits are making Wells Fargo the best place to work."
good,The merger brought changes but nothing you couldn’t adapt to. Wells Fargo had a different culture but not totally different from first union and wachovia.
good,Tread lightly if your external and know nothing about banking. Learn and listen! Most  importantly grow.! It is a wonderful place to work and learn the inside scoop on banking. It really helps you grow and maybe end up being your career.
good,"The only stress came when sales were the only way to get bonuses and they shamed you for not getting enough. They backed off of that more after the scandal. As for money, the stress comes from loosing $200, after that you get written up, the next time its a informal warning, then formal and they fire you. When theres a huge line and they're rushing you to get it moving and you don't count right its easy to mess up."
good,"A typical day for me is preparation in the morning before clients arrive, which is very important.( water and coffee is ready) We laugh a lot in my office, there is joint effort from other team members and that make all the difference. I have an opportunity to meet and talk with clients every day  on the phone. Also when they come into the office for an appointment of make a deposit. My office is very diverse and we get along well. We have outside social events as well Holiday luncheons."
good,"I work in a super fast-paced marketing group that pushes out tons of work for clients each day. My small team is nimble and fun, and spread out across the globe."
good,"If you work hard and use the resources and training provided, you will be successful. "
good,Feel as if they should allow growth more often as well as more hours . Love the job but the hours provided are low and for a bank I think they should offer more compensations .
good,"If you like to take call center type with fast pace, call after call this is the place for you. The facility is nice, cafeteria is HUGE and they have their own chef and salad bar, etc. There's a game room for employees where you could play pool, watch Tv or just relax when on break. Security there is top notch so you don't have to worry much about anyone breaking in etc."
good,Wells fargo is overall a good place to work. Management can get tricky but it's worth it. Stay focused and do you work you will progress just fine. Pr
good,It was a great experience and had a great team to work with! There we're flexible hours and considering remote working with phone and zoom. I apprecia
good,Greta company to work. Tuition re-imbursement available to part-time and full-time employees. The ability is move up within your career is outstanding
good,Great place to be able to grow within the company a lot of customer experiences are gained from it a lot of amazing people that want to see you succeed
good,"Family oriented with strong supportive team members that can be counted on working as a team with a common goal for success of the company brand, center working in, team and individual achievements."
good,I enjoyed my time with Wells Fargo for 7 years. I was given opportunities to advance my career over my tenure with Wells Fargo. They shaped the man I am today
good,The job pay and benefits was amazing. The management and overall atmosphere at the branch I worked was less than to be desired. If there was different management I feel that it would have been a better experience.
good,"•	Handled a high volume of inbound calls (50-120) from customers with varying levels of questions and or concerns."
good,"Working here gave me great experience to build my career on. There are many opportunities to move up and grow. Wf is big on development.  I've had many great bosses,  only one bad one."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Loan Origination and Bulk Purchasing with $850,000 credit lending authority as follows. "
good,Overall it was a great experience. Management plays favoritism and is very unfair. Pay is good and hours are perfect for families. Usually very flexible and understanding.
good,"I was always the first to arrive at the job. After I go through the morning procedures. I would already have our morning huddle prepared but I would go through the task that had to be completed. Then I would hand out assignments. I had to make sure I was always fair so I would rotate task as well as lunches. Organization was very key with this job because it required so much such as leading the tellers, taking care of operations, also being cross trained as a banker and a teller. The most enjoyable part was getting to know the people."
good,I was hired through a temp agency and when WF got hit with the major $1 billion fine they let everyone they hired go. It was very depressing considering how well we were doing.
good,"Work on complex customer service requests and prepare credit packages."
good,"I was able to move up within the company and learned many"
good,"My first Manager was Awesome. "
good,"Call centers can be quite brutal. You are tied to your desk and your every minute is monitored. Given that, Wells Fargo does a great job keeping a positive and collaborative environment even in their call centers. The company is great to work for and management is supportive to assist with career advancement and learning opportunities."
good,Typical call center environment. Answer phones. Stressful at times. Good benefits. Flexible schedules. Quarterly bonuses. Management not the best. 15 Hour starting pay
good,"- Relaxed atmosphere"
good,"Wells Fargo cares about their employees, great place to move up, they offer great benefits, and the paternity/maternity is unmatched. Worked here 6 years"
good,Company itself is genuine. Wells Fargo cares about their employees and communities. Wells Fargo has great benefits and opportunities for their employees both professional opportunities and personal life opportunities. Management is not so good.
good,"Wells Fargo offered great benefits. Although, their salaries are not competitive. It’s a very fast paced work environment. The bonus structure is great!"
good,"Busy enviroment, but with decent salaries and good benefits. They expect hard work and sometimes the works volumes can be on the high side. Management, on the whole, is good and supports staff."
good,"While my role in the company was not directly in a banking location, I can't help but feel impacted by the scandal regarding accounts over the past few years. It will taint my view of the company regardless of what they do to try and correct it. Management knew and did nothing, while they required employees to partake in ethics and courses touting reputational risk and accountability each year... Disappointing..."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. Work life balance was encouraged. My manager was one of the best I ever worked for. Training was constant to keep everyone compliant and given the tools needed to succeed.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance"
good,Nice place to work good co workers. If you are looking for a morning only job wells fargo is a good place to work had nice work environment. Definitely recommend
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I love Wells Fargo very much. i WOULD work for them anytime of the week, i want to be with a company I can have a future with.  Wellls fargo is an amazing company to work for!!!!@Q!"
good,"Great place to work , however telecommute was not an option for my job then, work life balance was hard to achieve."
good,"There was a restructure in place. Other departments knew about it. However, when I was offered another job I was talked into staying only to have a restructure a month later. My manage said she didn't know anything about it which I find very hard to believe when mangers in other departments were asking me to post to another department."
good,I was only there a short time but everyone was very helpful and nice. The environment was very pleasant and relaxed.  I wish it was a permanent position.
good,"If you're looking for a starter job that you can get excellent paid days off, and an office type environment, this is the job for you. Sales driven goals determine advancement and raises, but the goals are almost unattainable. Management is understanding to a point, however upper management could use some reconfiguration to support employees growth."
good,Overall a diverse culture and great company to work with. Company provides managers with the appropriate tools to be able to coach and mold team members and allows employees to grow.
good,"I enjoyed most co-workers and direct manager.  Work was typical for underwriting, challenging but normal files.  I  had decided to stop traveling with FDIC employment so took less pay in exchange for regular hours and home life.  It was what was expected.  I didn't choose to go into management with this company."
good,A typical day at Wells Fargo.  Complete morning reports.  Go out and visit your dealers on your preplanned schedule.  Build great relationships with the dealerships and let them know what Wells Fargo has to offer and have them understand how to put deals together so we can build a strong portfolio for the dealership.  Monitor the relationship so we are both getting the most of Wells Fargo programs.  Return to home office and document all your work performed that day.  Encompass training in the day to day visits with the dealerships.  Collect anything the dealership may owe us.  assist immediately for any dealership requests.
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work and my co workers and I worked good together  as a team. We show our customers respect with a friendly faceand smile and they love us.
good,I was hired through a temporary staffing agency and it proved to be not exactly what I desired at that particular time in my life. I would recommend this opportunity to anyone seeking a professional work place.
good,"Loved working for Wells Fargo, just wish the compensation was better.  The people that work there are generally friendly and thorough, which is a plus in the financial industry."
good,I was always treated fairly with them. I worked for them twice because of my boss. Very helpful and engaging. Always worked with me to solve problems. Help with guidelines and clients
good,"I enjoy my job as a Detection Specialist. Workplace culture is positive with little to no issues, the hardest part of the job is sometimes completing all of the work. Management works hard to assist in personal and professional development. Overall, I enjoy my job and would recommend it."
good,"Great  place to work for someone needing part time employment, who does not require benefits, great, friendly staff as well as management, perfect job for people who love to work with the public. Busy atmosphere,"
good,"A typical work day consists of seeing at least 10 customers. You'll help with loans, credit card, opening/ closing accounts, going over transactions history with customers, filing fraud claims and so much more."
good,I really enjoyed my time with WF and hope to work for them again in the future. Enjoyed the United Way Community Events every year. The People I worked with were very professional and very kind and supportive.
good,Till this day I enjoy a beverage with my old Wells Fargo colleagues. The workplace environment was always warm and inviting. Lunch was shared with colleagues each and every day.
good,"My days were about 50% meetings 25% program initiatives, and 25% training. I learned too much to comprehend at work and on completion. I did not know what I was trying to achieve until I completed the work. I like the people and respect the experience. My training was confidential and supported by the efforts of US bank."
good,"A typical day involved speaking with client companies to address covenant violations, modifications, and business updates.  This information would need to be circulated with management and team members to determine appropriate next steps.  Management was interested in working with employees to develop analytical and soft skills. The workplace culture changed slightly over the years from Foothill Capital, a smaller finance shop, to Wells Fargo.  Compliance became a greater portion of the work day over the years, but that is consistent with the finance industry.  In sum, it is a great place to build a career with smart, caring individuals."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Well Fargo was one of the best work environment that I've ever worked in. The manager of my branch lead by example and inspired me to do some of my best work,"
good,"typical day involves me reviewing my everyday list, removing or marking as needed for notes. my bosses are very understandable and reliable. hardest part can be keeping up and ahead with the job, sometimes it is swamped other times it is pretty slow"
good,"In my 13 years, there have been changes however overall it's a good place to work. i have been able to advance upwardly since I have been with the bank."
good,"The wells fargo operation facility is running 24 hours and i started to work the dept of verified the cashes and the customer transaction receipts after my valuation was a great the bank gave me a new opportunity of account balancing, it was a great experienced in my life as a part time worker."
good,enjoyed working here . Would look forward to work with Wells Fargo always. I am still in touch with some of my colleagues & felt that we were a great team.
good,"Fast pace, high performance, cross-functional team collaboration. Teams from all over USA and International locations. Most positions require 5-10+ years of experience. It is not a place for someone just entering the workforce."
good,WF was a great company to work for.  They took care of their employees.  The training programs offered we well put together so that you were truly prepared to start performing the job you were hired for more quickly.
good,Great company to learn and grow with. Training is exceptional. The benefits are great. Mentoring and leadership courses are awesome. Diversity and inclusion was extremely good
good,"excellent culture that actually appreciates the time and money invested into their people.  excellent benefits, excellent perks like 4-5 weeks of pto and personal holidays."
good,It's rough. It takes a certain personality to be able to call people and ask for money you know they don't have. I originally thought it was more of a role to help customers manage finances/give advice but you're collecting from elderly on social security that has overdrafted and clearly can't pay anything. The people are great -- the snacks and break rooms are nice.
good,I enjoyed working at wells Fargo the team i had at that time was very easy going and ready to work. They even worked with me school schedule. Evem working saturdays was okay too.
good,I worked in a call center which has since been closed down. The management there was amazing. We received extensive training and were well supported. Despite being the best call center in the country we were shut down.
good,For all the things i have to deal with becuase of the policy changes and things that they have changed i think i deseve more pay and for the fact that i have been thur a bomb threat and not once has the emp compisated for the hazard of working in a place where i could be physically harmed.
good,"Greatness, like, many objectives, is in the eye of the beholder. One simple test for greatness is how a company is experienced by its constituents – its customers, its associates, its owners, and business partners. They treat all of their constituents well and, in their own unique ways, aspire to greatness."
good,"good to employees"
good,"As much as you see Wells Fargo in the news, they really take care of their employees and offer numerous benefits.  I am able to work from home and build my own daily schedule.  all and all it is a great place to work - the opportunity for advancement is challenging and competitive, but doable if you are in it for the long haul."
good,"-Ambiente dinamico, y propicio para aprender. Cada dia tenia sus dificultades pero muy enriquecedora experiencia en cuanto a la formacion de una carrera."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The pay is higher than other banks and if you are willing to move tons of opportunity. The company is well managed and provides a great work environment. They have been making extensive upgrades to the San Antonio campus so it gets nicer by the month.
good,"Typically the only thing that is a hassle here is the customers. They'll degrade and demean for no good reason. You are required to stay on line with them, even if they're exacting death threats or threats against your family."
good,"Love my coworkers and job, everyone made it fun.  Just need to include provide pay raises and recognize when others are working hard.  Paid time off is phenomenal and they are flexible and understanding with hours as everyone has things come up in life"
good,I have worked here for 3 years on and off mainly due to the influxs in jobs and India taking most of them but they usually try to take care of you as long as you have a great manager.
good,"Good company to work for... gives good benefits you get pto, holiday pay, and insurance. Flexible hours and if you are a hard worker you are able to go up in the company."
good,"Presentations of clients, business and local banks. taking loan applications, scheduling appraisals and completing loan applications."
good,"ok company to work for. "
good,"They care about their employees, truely believing that if they take care of us, we will take care of them. Makes it great to actually love going to work! So integrated with family and so many opportunities and resources offer to everyone"
good,Working here was a good experience. The culture could bring the employees together in a cohesive way. The overall moral and work load was not overwhelming. A good place to work.
good,It was a great place to work for. It had room for advancement. Upper Management looked out for their employees. They was a company who recognized their employees on a monthly basis.
good,"Research canceled and denied loans accounts, print our complete packets, complete spreadsheet and send off to Iron Mt for pickup to put in archive storage"
good,I had a great experience working for Wells Fargo. This company offers tons of benefits with even just being a part-time employee. I had a lot of support from my co-workers and I enjoyed interacting with people on a daily basis and meeting new faces. I would definitely work for this company again.
good,Great company to learn and grow.  Ability to be promoted within the company is an added bonus and the skills are transferrable to other similar companies.
good,Good benefits with mobility for promotion. Learned a lot of different job skills and valuable experience through different positions in banking. Good bank to work for.
good,"There were opportunities ot improve skills and learn advanced procedures."
good,great place to work only reason i left was because I was moving and wasn't going to be staying in the same town. great people and great mangagers they really listen
good,"•	Prepared Business Requirements document according to requirement related to Mutual funds conversions and large amount of positions that were moved to different platform."
good,"Great work place. I'd actually go back to this job. Had my very own cubicle. Pay was super. Actually the highest paying job I've ever had. They just let me go because I was dating the vice presidents daughter and when we broke up, they fired me."
good,"I loved working for Wells Fargo. My customers trusted me and when i took the time to educate them on really what them and their families needed they came back for more services because they knew i would do it in the best interest for them. Now the management was horrible in Las Vegas because all they cared about was ""how can we get this customer to add an account or apply for anything"" hopefully now there are no sales goals and all personal bankers and educate their customers on how to have a wonderful financial life"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Fast paced, I was able to learn a lot about finances, mortgages credit and the banking industry. There was good leadership in my experience with Wells Fargo. The hardest part of my job was the incentive structure being quarterly. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning how give great service on every call and build my skills."
good,"Management very supportive, co-workers collaborated, excellent benefits .  Leadership truly cares about your success in the position. Training is extensive and on-going but necessary and provided by company."
good,"I like working at Wells Fargo. The digital PMO has projects that are on the cutting edge of financial services technology. (i.e., person to person payments, social media etc)"
good,"It's a great place to work, but it's hard to advance if you don't get licensed. The company does give certain deparments an opportunity to get licensed."
good,"Was a great place to work, became a place that i no longer felt proud to say work there. All the controversy made it difficult. I would love to continuing working for the company, but it is not stable and is uncertain."
good,"Okay place to work.  Environment suitable, management okay, hours okay, workplace culture comfortable, very detailed work, spacing and work area per worker suitable."
good,Teamwork is the major experience. We worked as a unit to remediate the required products. Also scheduling and cooperation was another excellent trait.
good,"Good benefits, good pay, strong company with many opportunities for growth. management can be iffy depending on what department you are located in. But you will have that everywhere you go."
good,"Great for first job! Fixed Schedules, no overtime. Needed a certain amount of accounts opened which I found very weird. I have heard from friends that it is more laid back now."
good,"Overall, a good place to work. Interesting field of work. Relaxed environment. Management easy to communicate with, Full time work, 40 hours a week, benefits after 90 days, and closed on major holidays."
good,Great to work here. Management is good. Free transport but always late. Very less hike. High expectations on the job. Mostly second shifts. No clients
good,love the call center to death. the managers there are awesome and have fun. but they took away our monthly bonuses which suck so now we have to wait till 45 days after the quarter is over to get a bonus.
good,"Although the money earned was a plus, the stress of maintaining numbers that the company silently required was very difficult.  As I grew at the company things seemed better in some areas, but worse in others.  You knew who your friends were, and who was not there for you.  It's sad that a company can just be about numbers and making money when they say they are customer centric."
good,"Opening branch securely, preparing teller team for work day, morning reports and documents, scheduling, ordering cash shipment for branch, conference call for lead tellers, and daily one-on-one coaching of teller team. Balancing vault and cash lines. Making sure all breaks and lunches are completed in an orderly manner while maintaining an efficient business. Also having a keen eye for great customer service to all of our customers coming into the branch. Morning huddles to pump up the entire branch for the work day. Being a leader and setting the tone with all interactions."
good,A typical day at work would begin by having a team meeting with the manager to make sure our day was planned accordingly. I learned to have plenty of patience with unsatisfied customers and always be willing to help anyone regardless of their attitude towards me. The culture was very family-like and definitely enjoyed working with my team members.
good,"To me the work place is all about the people and they way they treat each other.  I understand hard work and a serious approach to handling business but being rude, unkind and nasty creates a culture of division and unease.  I've been blessed to work for a the same company for 11 and for the most part all the people were professional, thoughtful and caring."
good,"This is a temp project management job and will likely end in 6 months. Little is known about the full time jobs, since our team is receiving less that normal information. Not a job I want to keep given lack of full time opportunities."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Worked behind a desk and didn't speak to many people.  Did a lot of numbers and worked in a cubical with five of us trying to achieve the same goal.  No drama, great place."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company with access to many resources for their employees. From tuition reimbursement to up to 10,000 in grants if your or your family is in dire need, they really take care of their own. I am starting my masters and and am getting too busy to adhere to a fixed schedule."
good,"Great company, great colleagues, great management, great benefits. "
good,A place to start in learn and grow within the industry to get you up to your next level and what you want to do in banking. Learn a on how To be a team player and reach goals that u set for yourself
good,you work as a team and its pretty cool how everybody helps everyone else out and it has cool benefits and its pretty quick to go up job advancements. its nice
good,"Wells Fargo demands a lot of their employees, but also rewards them adequately for their commitments.  There are many opportunities for advancement, and are often encouraged to pursue them."
good,Good Job. Many opportunities just didn't seem like I was getting anywhere in the compay.Many people get in certain positions and get comfortable but it prevents others from moving up
good,I have worked for Wells Fargo for the past @ 11 years. It was been a Good Company to work for.  Hard to advance within.  Company is going through Restructuring and reduction in size as well as consolidation.
good,Was good place to work just no more room for advancement here in my dept. Always felt like I was just running in place hre. I was too far up in my position to find anything else due to my pay here.
good,Fast paced environment must be on top of your game. The Dealer Services division is currently going through a lot of chages.  I worked with a great group of people that worked hard for a common goal.  We worked hard but also made time to have fun. They offer great benefits and fair pay.
good,"I was the drive thru teller, I was busy all the time. I learned to balance"
good,enjoyed employment for over 20 years.  customer focus and team atmosphere as priority was center of responsibility and was required for customers financial success.
good,"Wachovia bought out World Savings, and once they did that they spent the next 2 years laying off numerous people including people of high ranking management positions with exemplary tenure at the company. This resulted in low morale so us managers had to work harder to keep employees motivated to work. After over a year or so, I eventually got laid off as well. I really loved working for World Savings."
good,"I experienced what it was like to work with dedicated, understanding managers who not saw their employees just as employees but as their outside roles, parents, students, etc. I also work under those who didn't care about what employees were facing and just see us as numbers. Two very different sides of the spectrum and overall the company is a good company but management needs a reality check.  The culture and diversity are amazing, I have met and worked alongside people from every walk of life and it has impacted me as a person and a worker."
good,"This job was very rewarding being able to assist in helping homeowners in finding way to save their home. By taking in important information about the household income and showing and they them what to do, in their case."
good,"Busy place and fun people to work with."
good,Good work life balance as long as you are in the right group. I had a great time working here! The worst part was the constant restructuring. It seems as if you get a new chain of command and boss every few months.
good,"I think Wells Fargo is an excellent company to work at for someone who is comfortable working with customers on a daily basis. I struggled because of my nature to excel in Back Office Operations, but they would not allow me to apply for positions that were more suited for me. Because they only let you start out in customer/sales positions, the competition was intense and I was competing against people who were natural sales men and women."
good,"I mean ver hectic , being a branch manager in a guard company ,on a daily operation , with office staff including dispatchers , day to day reports to the President of the company ,work enviorment was challenging"
good,"I really like what i do and enjoy coming to work everyday .  I have a great manager ,  which makes life much easier at a big company.  She is always supportive of me and helps me in every way possible."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The typical day at work starts with following up with all the loan in the pipe line to make sure they are moving along on time with out any issues. After that i begin prospecting witch includes sales call, phone call and working with bank employees on what to look for in potential clients."
good,My managers are very supportive in my development. I enjoy the diversity within the workplace as well as the clients that come into the branch. I have learned a lot about the banking working here.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work, I worked in a call center and everyone there sets you up for success. I had probably the greatest supervisor ever while I worked there."

good,There was not room for easy advancement within Wells Fargo Advisors as an assistant. Employees were taken care of and made to feel special and appreciated.
good,"I enjoyed working here. But it was an all night thing. 12 to 14 hr shifts. It did get very boring.  I was a patrol supervisor so I would drive around checking on the other employees,  guard Banks, and work from 5 p.m. until 7 a.m. 4 days a week."
good,I left the company as their reputation was starting to be questioned. The competitive sales culture was something that pushed me to become a hard worker and made me strive to succeed.
good,I had a blast for four months but temp agencies didn't sercure outside employment Job sercurity and they hired inside. But while I was employed the had a great training program and plenty of experienced support system.
good,Positive work environment but focus too much on perfect ratings and not enough on how to improve the process.  I am not a fan of JD Powers being very representative of TRUE CUSTOMER experience and employees should be paid on obtaining opinions and improving a process not just obtaining 5 ratings.
good,"Wells Fargo's management is outstanding.  In the 4+ years I have worked with Wells Fargo, I have had the pleasure of working under three different managers and ever one of them were by all means outstanding!  They build and promote a strong culture of honesty, caring and respect."

good,"I was with the same group for five years, so we were pretty much family. Over time a few of us did move on, but the ones left near the end were close before the group was laid off due to company reorganization. Management changes did bring some harsh times and adjustments, but over time acclimated to the change. A typical day at work was coming in and reviewing what loans were in our pipeline to review. The job was not customer service, it was all on the back end, so did approve loans, but it was all review and research before creating the documents required to go to the borrower, and then close out that file once the signed documents returned. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the changes once the modification approval job was created. This job brought the most challenges of dealing with quality control, and preventing the one error we were allowed per month, while still achieving high production per our forecasts. The upside to all of this was still being able to freely ask questions and discuss files with the group members who were happy to help out. Being a part of the specialty team I helped with questions from other groups, and discussed changes in our own small team. Overall it was a great first experience in the corporate world for me a year after getting out of college."

You can bid on change of schedules quarterly so if you need to change your hours, that’s the time to do it. You are also given the option to work overtime a lot.

good,"The day to day work was not very difficult and if you had a great team it would be easy. I was employed there during a time of extremely aggressive sales practices. This made a very hostile and stressful workplace. Management would aggressively push for daily, sometimes hourly sales performance. Threatening to terminate employees who did not obtain unrealistic goals. As I was exiting the culture of sales and service began to change. The ridiculous sales goals and practices were abolished. The primary focus was shifted to service. One thing that was always great the employee benefits. Healthcare was affordable with amazing coverage. The employee discount was unbelievable as well extending to cell phone service, theme parks, and even vehicles. Wells Fargo has worked on  correcting bad sales practices, but the culture has always the same. The company has always valued employees and service for the customers."

good,"typical day at work means helping customers with their financial priorities, finding multiple ways to reach their financials goals and making it an easy smooth experience"

good,"Working with Wells Fargo as a teller has been a pleasant opportunity although, it can be both repetitive and slowed paced it is a very enjoyable job. It can be an rewarding job when you work hard and achieve weekly goals, meaning you may be acknowledged verbally for what you have done correctly.

If I could work for an institution like that again (which I did find in First Piedmont Federal-but where I am relocating to, does not have a First Piedmont Federal) I would do it again! Wachovia was a place that was very busy, you wanted to go to work; a place where you could get to know your customers (they were not just a number); a place that took very good care of their employees.

Wells Fargo has the best benefits for health insurance, eye insurance, dental insurance, 401K, etc. The downtown location is conveniently located near endless restaurants, fast food places, etc great for shorter lunch breaks. They have mothers rooms as well as break rooms you can sit and eat your lunch. The Jordan Creek West Des Moines location has two cafeterias both provide endless options for breakfast as well as lunch, it has a mini gym and while I was working there they provided free massages every Tuesday.

good,"Wells Fargo had an interesting management style for my department - Personal Banking Manager -  they gave us all the tools needed to service higher value clients ($50,000 + in deposits) and gave us the authority to make decisions on all aspects of the account relationship.  Along with the authority came accountability so if our decision was costly, it could result in termination.  The Personal Banking Manager job changed drastically when Norwest Bank acquired Wells Fargo and kept the Wells Fargo name but emphasized the sales aspect by calling the branches, ""stores"".  Typical days involved interacting with our clients and giving them best service on an individual basis."

good,"Customer service based position. Assisted customers with bank transactions, deposits,"
good,Great company to work for.  Minimal growth opportunity due to a lot of tenure in position; which is great for the company overall!
good,"My day starts with setting up my day to reach out to existing customer and preparing to meet & greet new customers. I make phone calls to my customer to let them know of any products we may have that they can benefit from credit cards, loans, etc. I also open checking & savings accounts to walk-in customer as well as off- site customers where I go outside the branch into a business and offer staff at work accounts with Wells Fargo."

good,"If they focused less on sale and more on employee, this would be a great place to work for."

good,Great work/life balance and benefits. Managers were very helpful and concerned about me as an employee and as a person. Lots of team building events and bonuses.
good,"High customer contact, offsite visits, very busy but was a pleasant enviorment to work in.  Management were hands on and approachable. Co-workers were helpful and team players.  The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that at the end of the day you were able to help others and get a sense of acomplishment.  Hardest part was sometimes being able to covey why was promised could not be delivered in a timely manner."
good,Days start early as there is always so much to get done.  Co-workers are great and welcoming.  The hardest part of the job is sitting for 8 hours.
good,"A typical day at work varied from day to day.  We have people that did various tasks and if they were out or the volume changed you were asked to help out regardless of what your assigned role was.  Primarily, I would prep files for closing.  We work closely with Private Bankers and the VIP cliental that came with them.  We worked on prepping their files for closing, ensure that all required documentation was in the file, verify things were in compliance, and ensure that things were correct in the internal LIS system.  We would work with management regarding rushes and priority files.  The hardest part would definitely be month end rushing and making sure that we met all closings so that the relationship with the client and banker was severed as some of these clients had  long lasting relationships.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with.  Sometimes you just get a group that really clicks wells and works great together.  I have to say that this was just one of those jobs where I was fortunate to work with the people I did."
good,"Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Collector 1 basically had me interacting with costumers daily via telephone."
good,"Typical day at Wells Fargo is just a regular normal day. Logging into workplace to begin working, contacting customers for documents needed or ones with errors, helping other co workers when needed, and just having a positive attitude. Management was phenomenal and coworkers was always focused and reaching their goals. Hardest part of the job was informing customers that we declined for a refinance. The most enjoyable part of my job was the positive atmosphere and friendly team working co workers."

good,I really enjoyed working for this company and felt that it was a progressive company with many opportunities for advancement.  I was promoted a couple of times in a very short period due to hard work and advancement opportunities.  I thoroughly enjoyed my work environment and my day to day tasks as an operations analyst.  I was able to review processes for the company and had procedures that I had written published for the company.
good,"I am on personal leave at he moment from wells fargo wanting to join back either at wells fargo , or any other reputed bank , the requisition # at wells is 3793497 this is a position in chapel hill branch at university mall ,"
good,"I start my day by logging to our phone system, Once that's done I log into about 12 different programs that I use through out the day to service our customers. I then check all my work emails through outlook and check calendar for any scheduled meetings. I am still logged into our Phone network so I'm still taking calls in-between time. I then start pulling up our technical cases and working them 5 at a time.

good,"I worked 7-4 Monday-Friday - being on time and ready to work daily was required. I worked on the post closing side, resolving issues that occurred during a home mortgage purchase or refinance. The management style was very relaxed, but it was understood that they were keeping an eye on people.  Out of my co-workers, I was on the younger side, however still managed to get along with everyone great.  The most difficult and most rewarding parts of the job were one in the same. It was difficult to come across a deficiency or encounter a customer/borrower that was difficult, and then the enjoyment would come in by learning a new process or being able to walk a customer through a particular situation.  All and all I really enjoyed my time with Wells Fargo and would be more than happy if my next employer was of similar nature."
good,Wells Fargo is a very solid bank with high ethical standards.

good,"Heavily focused on the coaching and development of team members. Learn how to manage others, drive for results,and maintain balanced performance"
good,Started with Wells in November of 2011.  It was my third time working for them.  Achieved the highest authority level of conventional lending within that time frame and was on the fast track to receive my DE and VA authority but the announcement of the branch closure derailed those goals.  At peak time would review approximately 10 - 14 loans a day.  2 of those loans usually being new underwrites.
good,I had good managers and there was a team environment we worked independently and as a team to solve problems and develop better procedures.  I was responsible for Reconciling the trading positions to the Bank of New York our holding company.  I researched and resolved exceptions and maintained records for internal and external audit requirements. I enjoyed training and developing new hires.

Though the associations most have with the Wells Fargo name are stage coaches, the Old West, and of course the bank, Wells Fargo is very much a Technology company.  Wells Fargo has over 2 acres of Data Center space within their Tempe Operations Center alone, and they have 5 other Data Centers within Wells Fargo buildings in the US alone."

good,It was a good great place to work if you met you sales goals each day and for the quarter than life was pretty easy for you
good,"It was an over-all great place to work, management was wonderful and very supportive. I would say the hardest part of the job is having to remember every detail for each and every transaction."
good,A worker learns how to efficiently complete duties and assist other coworkers. There is always the opportunity to remain busy during the day. A worker has the ability to cross-train.
good,"I worked at Wells Fargo (First Union/Wachovia previously) during 14 years. After an accident I was not able to drive far and resigned and started working near home . "
good,This job kept me busy.  I always had something to do.  Everyone was great to work with.  The training was extensive. I learned new techniques when dealing with customers. I found the hardest part of the job was in sales.  This was a challenge for me in trying to convince customers they needed a certain product.  Overall I enjoyed my time here.
good,"Happy to be part of Wachovia. "
good,I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo. It was a great expierence and a nice change from previous work. I learned a lot about the banking world. My co-workers were all great to work with and all team players. The hardest part about this job was balancing work and home life. There were several nights we were required to work late with little to no notice. The best part about this job was the satisfaction of knowing I went out of my way to help all my customers.

good,Very good experience with customer service and banking system including financial products knowledge and sales.
good,"WFC is a very well run, conservation, risk adverse financial services company."
good,"The bank was the only place I've worked at, as a full-time employee. When I was working in Philadelphia, I loved the atmosphere. My group was a team. When I moved to Charlotte, it seemed to be everyone out for themselves. I didn't have good training, so I made frequent mistakes at first. Because of those mistakes, I was passed by for salary increases for 4 years. In 2010, a few months before I had to move back to Philadelphia, I received a small increase. Other than what I stated, it was a relatively easy job that I enjoyed. I enjoyed the majority of my co-workers as well. After a series of events, I am currently on a job search leave. I wish it was more than 3 months, because although I have had an interview for a job, I am uncertain about it. And I have another upcoming interview. I am hoping one of these produces positive results."
good,"I can't say to much bad about this place. Despite what you might hear, they pay very well compared to other big banks. Though their commission is capped, you'd be hard pressed to get more anywhere else. What's more, they LOVE their employees, well at least the ones that are hitting their numbers. Amazing pto, benefits, training programs and on and on. The biggest downside, the stress. Your job constantly hangs in the balance and you are asked to hit ever higher goals. Nothing is ever good enough and sometimes it seems they want you to throw ethics out the window. Personally, while I loved the company, I hated the job. Given the chance to work for wells corporate, I'd take it in a heartbeat."
good,"worked with strict deadlines and minimum supervision. Had goals to meet every month.Had a great working environment with laid back employees.Fun part of the job was monthly meetings and lots and lots of treats, goodies, potlucks, luncheons etc"

good,Supporting customers with their banking needs including online banking and account reviews. Making sure that all of customers financial needs are taken care of to help them invest in their future.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I was one of the key players who made a difference and was the ""Voice"" for many customers. Being able to work in an envirorment that allowed me to do what I'm passionate about (improving the customer experience) was very rewarding. Knowing that my decions increased customer loyalty as well as improved the overall companies bottom line was what made my days enjoyable. To go to work and know that change would be made based on my analytical and research skills was great satisfaction."

good,"Typical day at work was busy yet productive. I learned to supervise, approve, know about every aspect of banking, lending, loss prevention and training and developing staff. Mangement was always by your side to support you and make sure that you moved onto the next level. My cowrkers are still my best friends, some of the ones that I brought aboard moved on to Management and are still aboard. The hardest part of the job was the day that I got down sized. The most enjoyable part of the day was the respect and honor that I had from clients and co workers."
good,"As a lead teller assisted with related activities such as night deposits, check disbursements, and collections. Conducted a variety of customer service tasks which include providing account balances, transferring funds, tracking deposits and various record changes.

During the downfall of the financial industry Wachovia was bought by Wells Fargo the culture changed. This was difficult for a lot of the clients. The ability to grow and advance within the company was more difficult.
good,"great place to work great benefits, wish I was still under their name!"
good,"Good job. Work culture is supportive for work life as well as personal life. But, it is competitive. They hire for a project and if it fails in next few months, they tell you to look for an internal job posting which is not fair. This happened many times in my presence to my peer teams."

good,Wells Fargo was a great experience. Although there for a short period of time I enjoyed the structure and dynamic of the company. I would highly recommend anyone who enjoys customer service to apply.

good,"Improved time management skill, presentation skills"
good,"Working at Wells Fargo is very demanding, between goal setting to completing it, to following up with new and old customers, fulfilling all needs as best you can, some traveling is necessary to earn business, knowledge of products and services makes the job easier and you more confident in your offers to needs. Being active and assertive helps"

good,I enjoy what I do. My manager cares about me and my career advancement. Your development plan is up to you and you need to put it the work to make it happen. I have found that when I talk about my goals someone is listening and they guide me on the right path to get where I want to be. The time off is great! 401k 100% match up to 6%. The best thing about Wells Fargo is that there is never a dull moment.

good,"Even though there has been negative press about this organization, the leadership and training structure is of the highest ethical substance. However, the sales culture did create desire from employee segments to ""game"" the system and pursue illegitimate and sometimes illegal means to obtain goals. This should not be a reflection of the overall culture or business plan."

good,Wells Fargo has one of the best benefit packages. I love that they show  employees know that they care and that they are valued. The company also sheds light on other cultures and hold events to allow employees to learn about one another and others background.
good,"This position allowed me to have a work/life balance so I can go to school and study, but also gave me 30+ hours a week to make a living. The management was awesome and the overall culture of the company was great. The only thing was that getting promoted seemed nearly impossible due to a huge hiring freeze."
good,Regular banking skills and its a good place to learn banking with the best training. I recommend it over most large banks and they have great benefits for even part time.
good,"My stay with Wells Fargo for 5 years taught me how to assimilate with different kinds of people from different cultures. Nice place to work with, smile"
good,they will promote you when they see a potential. it probably the area I was working with but they were all supportive of what you do. they will train you and push you with no questions.
good,Iwould have liked better communication between management and HR. No comm and no one knows whats goin on . over all I really liked the people I worked with .
good,"Great environment, but more structured due to compliance"
good,I worked in two locations (Maple Grove and Arden Hills) primiarly as support staff.  I loved working with the managers.  I valued opportunities for growth.  I left in pursuit of a career change as I felt I exceeded my growth potential at my current position.
good,Great company to work for. Strong growth potential. Company corrected micro management issues and stress of daily sales goals. Benefits are Amazing and top notch
good,Working here was a great experience for me on customer service and how to deal with customers when they are very distressed and are trying to get things done.
good,"It was an ok place to get my feet wet with the mortgage industry. I worked as a sales assistant and a mortgage consultant. The management at the location that I was at wasn't the best but, it got me interested in training and process improvement."
good,Just don't like the fact that moving within the company can be extremely difficult. I love working for Wells Fargo and I would really hate to leave but when it comes to the work/life balance-it's hard.
good,"I was going to college while working and they gave me the flexibility I needed. They encouraged growth, but was only possible with high sale numbers. I know this has changed due to unethical lawsuit, so i am not sure how the company has changed."
good,"A typical day at work is to come in and begin to take calls at your scheduled time util breaks or lunches, management may or may not give us meeting or huddles, additional training everyday for updated information based off life event, financial changes, prime rates.  The job is not too enjoyable, you come to work do your job and leave, i typically am no longer excited to come to work.  The hardest part about my job is attempting to transfer calls to designated areas and some departments are not well trained or assisting bankers at a branch that are not knowledgable on products or services."
good,I really loved when wells fargo moved in a different direction and started its Change for the better roll out. I learned a lot during my time at wells fargo. They trained me on how to be a successful manager and uplift and encourage my team.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"It was a great time there and great opportunity. Learned a lot and was a great environment to work in."
good,"A productive place to work and meet people from different background. some management could be better it is a positive culture they promote teamwork and values, where the hardest part is slow down of work due to the late arrival of couriers but the most enjoyable is when I have done a job and get to go home for the day."
good,"The job require the teller, to be on their toes. Be able to handle large amounts of cash. Be available to comfortably talk to clients about their future."
good,"loved the company, such a great company to work for. on the other hand management was horrible at the time I worked there. (teller line). Benefits are also great."
good,In the 20+ years that I have worked for the company I have been allowed to grow in y processional life as well as my personal life. Working in middle management and developing others has been the highlight of my career.
good,Professional & treated fairly. Wells Fargo is a good company to work for that's why I stay. You receive annual raises & the benefits package is excellent.
good,I liked that was trusted to do the job right; received awards for a job well done; received recognition; excellent benefits; opportunity to self-develop
good,"Like with most big corporations these days, we have lost a lot of the human element with the MICROMANAGED, ROBOTIC way most businesses are run.  Sometimes ""common sense"" is thrown under the bus and replaced with robotic standards which most humans try to emulate but at the end of the day, everyone looses."
good,It was a great job until the new hires made more starting than the people training them. The job was awesome but trying to advance in the company was very difficult. Plan to only apply at one other position and no more! They will not hire you. Managment always were in meetings.
good,Enjoyed working there. Sales pressure was tough but not impossible. Great with employee recognition and great benefits. Always felt included and like I mattered to management.
good,"Overall is a really good place to work with a great environment and you learn a lot."
good,Great company to work for. Great management and being able to work from home a couple days per week. You get a lot of pto days when you first start working.
good,"Good company"
good,"At the beginning of my career I was able to advance very regularly as long as I performed, which I did. As I grew with the company tremendously, though, it became apparent that some of my potential growth was stinted due to higher level managers desire to keep me in their district or in the role I was in as it seem fit for their plan, which mostly benefited themselves. I will be now searching for positions at other companies that offer the incentive and pay that I deserve with my current experience and certifications."
good,"Great company who ruined their rep, even worse management. Exciting first few years until management turn over which was the worst decision my branch ever made. Went from #2 branch in region to number 20 inured 6 months. Embarrassing."
good,Great place to work at. Throughout my journey with Wells Fargo I received ample training and great job opportunities. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new things and working with a great team.
good,Wells Fargo was is a great company to work for and I'll miss working there and will recommend anyone looking for for a good place to work to apply at Wells Fargo. I enjoyed working with the company and the last 15 years.
good,"Great opportunity.  Recommend.  "
good,"I was a funder for Wells Fargo and it was my favorite job to date.  The day was productive and you were always busy, which I liked.  Overall Wells Fargo Funding positions was my favorite job to date."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo is a great company and would recommend it to anyone. Great experience with insurance that was top notch here in the metro area. Career advancement is there and if you put your mind to it you can go anywhere.
good,"Great company to work for, although it was a temporary position. I would go back in a heartbeat. The people were great, my supervisor was great and fair. The environment happy."
good,"Your shift is fixed, but the team's are really great to work with. If you love customer interaction then this is the job for you. You can work on the teller line or in the drive through window. Quick advancement is possible for those who are overachievers."
good,Very good i recommend but the balancing is very strict you have to be very careful also dont make friend s at work because everyone is a rival for the next position
good,"In this industry Wells Fargo has been the best company I have worked with. We care about the client , and work on getting better every day. Wells Fargo care about their employees , helping them improve, with available access to  mentors, training and room for advancement. They are very work\life balanced."
good,"I love the pay, However it's hard to make full time because they do pay well. Part time tellers are just flunkies to stop overtime for full time tellers and to cover their lunch. Also Saturdays are not rotated, depending on the branch you may work every Saturday and it's not overtime."
good,I worked for the new Wells Fargo and really enjoyed the environment they are creating now. They cared about me and ensuring I had a great work/life balance!
good,Wells Fargo was a good place to work at. My management really cared about me and wanted me to succeed. Expect micromanaging and constant culture shock with constant changes.
good,Great company and great people to work for and with.  Challenging projects that made me a stronger PM.  Flexible work schedule.  Great setup for remote.
good,My career was jeopardized by a manager/VP  who used her management position to fire me because she is married to my fiancee's ex husband. She wanted to control me and mis treat me because of the personal situation. I had a GREAT career with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and I was attacked.
good,The company provided a lot of team bonding and building exercises. We would have daily meetings regarding team goals and company announcements. I loved assisting all of our borrowers throughout the process of their transaction with us.
good,"I commuted to the Wells Fargo office in Winston-Salem since 1999 until I was offered a telecommuting position from my house in Greensboro NC in 2012 until my department was displaced end of 2018.  I really worked longer days working from home than I did in the office because there was no commute time and I would work some on the weekends even though I was a salaried employee.  The job at Wells Fargo virtual server appliance delivery required several project meetings with the vendor and the department contacts.  I had to determine if we could provide the blue print engineering design in our VMware environments.  In 2018 I delivered 1400+ virtual appliance servers into the Wells Fargo VMware environments.  This position was very technical and covered all data centers world wide.  Majority of all appliance servers are linux based so my knowledge of all Linux distros was very important.  I kept notes and design on all projects because corporate information security servers required several servers world wide.  Some Appliance servers I delivered - Guardium, Cybereason, Cisco, IBM, Symantec, just to name a few."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo is very laid back to me. i have been a top performer in my position for a long time and mostly left be at work when i come in to do my shift. The managers trust me and I trust them. Its a very easy going job for me, but I want to challenge myself by moving up to higher paying job especially now that I earned a degree in business. its time to continue to expand my career and upgrade my life financially."
good,"Wells Fargo has a lot of great opportunities for everybody, wells Fargo try to help its employees in their career path. working at Wells Fargo has giving me the knowledge I need to work in any financial institution, it has so many resources for the employees to grow in knowledge and  maximized their skill."
good,Wells Fargo was a great company to work for as they provided opportunities for growth and placed an emphasis on entrepreneurial spirit regarding the completion of duties.
good,This company compensates very well for your time. A little stressful as there are many guidelines that need to be followed and monthly goals that need to be met. But this is a company that truly cares about its employees and customers.
good,"Wells Fargo has a good work/life balance."
good,"Love it but got to leave. Diversity love it. Great environment to work at, if you don’t like to have someone on your toes, don’t work there. I’m very independent and don’t like people to be on top of me when I know I’m doing my job"
good,"everyone had a job and they did it to the best of their abilities, working together to get the job done and get through the day with no problems.Everyone tried their best at their jobs and enjoyed what they did."
good,"Working in a call center environment dealing with inbound and outbound calls constantly. you have to have a skin and skill to handle how people may treat you over the phone. You need to have to be able to handle situations you normally wouldn't have over the phone. You're handling calls regarding people's homes and livelihood. You're expected to collect and make arrangements for collection all while reviewing and noting the account for any changes or broken payments prior. Fast paced and at times extremely stressful, the job is not for the soft at heart."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo CIC building in Charlotte NC . It was a great place to work and my coworkers made me feel like family there. There were some challenges with some of the calls I received from customers' but I had the necessary tools and support to help me along the way.
good,I enjoy my job  and  it has  taught me a lot. There is  constant  changes but the  training   follows. The supervisors are  on the  floor  for assistance if not  available a team lead is.
good,"When I arrive at work 45 min before opening, I prepare for the opening of the bank by taking in the first reports, opening the vault, running the night drop, getting change for the other tellers and making sure that they are ready for the morning,. Helping with the morning huddle, coaching the tellers on how to stay audit ready and in compliance with Wells Fargo policy. "
good,"Wells Fargo was progressive in its HR practices and HR consulting.  While the public impression of Wells Fargo deteriorated, I know that Wells Fargo was a very ethical company and would terminate anyone committing fraud or taking any action that was not consumer centric."
good,"-Like any place there are pros and cons of working for wells fargo"
good,"Great enterprise work environment. The people you work with are very flexible and authentic. Everyone does what is right for the business and genuinely gives 100% to get things done within time lines. You'll find authentic, approachable folks who encourage a family like environment. "
good,Great management. Wonderful team I worked with. No opportunity for career advancement due to all contract positions. Would love to work for them again.
good,"Wasn’t bad place to work, loved my coworkers and certain customers. They have great benefits and the pay wasn’t bad. Developed many friendships over the years"
good,I retired from Wells Fargo and my years spent there were extremely satisfying.  Opportunity to advance and learn was available to everyone. I was considered a partner with my supervisor and not just an assistant
good,"A typical day at work consists of filing reports, helping customers maintaining a cash limit, balancing a drawer. Management is great, very supportive and genuinely cares about you at the branch and district levels."
good,Great company to work for. Offers career options and friendly environment. They provide efficient training and opportunity to grow your skills and knowledge.
good,I remember every morning we would huddle and have a quick few minutes to talk about our goals and what we can do to make us a better choice for our valued customers and what is new.
good,"I was a mortgage consultant, so my hours were flexible.  I liked that. "
good,"Great overall experience working as a teller for Wells Fargo. Great management and team work. I worked for wells Fargo for a year and the bank culture, salary ,benefits, work life were convenient."
good,"A typical day at work as a teller is always fun being able to interact with so many people in only 8 hours! "
good,The day at work was difficult given the number of hours worked but rewarding. The management was difficult in the beginning given the incompetence but management was rewarding after competent management management was put in place. The difficult part of the job was the bureaucracy in place between multiple levels of technology when attempting to put in place advanced software and hardware technology in the data center environments.
good,i loved working at wells Fargo it was one of the best jobs i have had you have so much room to advance in wells Fargo at the wells Fargo i worked at was like a family we worked as a team and we always valued our customers
good,A solid company that cares about its employees.  I had autonomy to make decisions in my role and an opportunity to work with some of the best people in their field
good,I loved working for this company. I wish my position hadn’t been eliminated. The benefits are wonderful and management really cares about the employees. Great Maternity benefits.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,This is a great company to work for it has been a great experience and I have learned many skills . The incentives here are awesome and I have enjoyed working here
good,"Wells was very good to me!  The pay was great and the benefits were awesome!  I hated to leave because my center was closing. But even after that, Wells paid me for a year and then provided me with job search assistance and resume services!"
good,"Wells Fargo is very concerned that all employees enjoy a safe and enjoyable work environment. While not a requirement, they do insist that all employees find a best friend at work and provide help in cultivating relationships with members of your own as well as supporting teams."
good,I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo. I learned a lot about the mortgage industry.  I worked with a great team.We worked as a team and we had each other's back.
good,"It was a great place to work"
good,"Exceed quarterly sales goals on a consistent basis. "
good,Great company offers a lot of room to grow and advance in your career. Many different avenues of the bank you can go down keeping a wide variety of options open to you to take in the financial industry
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work, as long as you are willing to put in your eight hours and take own your own advancement. Mentorship is available throughout the company but can be hard to find. Management tended to focus on day to day routines, putting out 'fires', and keeping metric thresholds. This can be great when on-the-spot leadership is needed but can lead to pockets of micromanagement and sometimes unethical behavior. The last four years at Wells Fargo the unethical behavior part, thankfully, disappeared, but clearly, the company is still suffering the effects of it. Employees there are one big family, and that's the best part of the job - the culture of caring."
good,My manager made working here amazing. He was flexible with our school schedules (many of us tellers were going to college full time) and overtime was rarely required. Sales goals were never an issue and never pushed on us inappropriately. Nothing bad to say about working here in my store!
good,"Great place to work for. Great environment, but management can be a little tough to understand. great flexible schedules and the ability to work remotely. great people such as coworkers. great. work space. recently renovated."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo, has given me the experience to provide customer service that goes above and beyond. I have learned many new things concerning leadership, conversations with customers, organizational and computer skills, as well as cash handling, and laws/regulations. Working at this company will help me in my future career choices, and I am glad that I was given the opportunity to work with a great company who cares about their employees and customers."
good,"Excellent company to work for however the management i experienced in my time there was TERRIBLE. My coworkers were great, teachers were great, any and all other applicable positions which I encountered were either up to or above par as far as my expectations were concerned."
good,"Goood place to work great pay and benefits time "
good,"The people who work for WF have, so far, been great, with one glaring exception.  My first manager was a great guy.  My second manager was the worst. However, I would still work for WF again."
good,I enjoyed my position with Wells Fargo and my co-workers felt like family. The sales goals did start to increase making it difficult for employees to realistically meet their goals for their bonuses and I was wanting to look for a different career change. There have been a lot of changes since I have been there that I cant really give a personal opinion on but while I was working there I did enjoy my job.
good,A typical week is 40 plus hours lots of knowledge in compliance and customer service support.  I have a great staff that works with me and very supportive.
good,Really enjoyed my experience here. Communication is very important when dealing with clients. Management is helpful with issues and complaints. The people here are great.
good,I worked with a great team and my managers were always there when we needed them and gave proper support.  Everyone on my team was a true ream player and would still be there had they not shut down the Orlando mortgage site.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"When I worked at Wells Fargo, it was a great place to work; with the exception of the sales goals. I was pushed to meet sales goals that were unreasonable at times. It is my understanding that they have since done away with the sales goals so it should be a much better place to work now."
good,A typical day at work for me would be pulling up my pipeline and working my files in the order they are cleared to close.  I contact attorneys and balance closing disclosures to ensure the borrower's closing flows smoothly.  The hardest part of the job is contacting the borrower to let them know when their home can't close on time.  It is very disappointing.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the family oriented environment.  The company is very diverse and I think that is very important.
good,I started out at Wells Fargo as a data entry clerk. I worked hard and proved myself in the lockbox area at Wells Fargo and was promoted to a Work Director (team lead). I was focused and committed to the job and tasks that were assigned to me that lead me to another promotion years later. I was promoted to a manager (supervisor).
good,Nice environment with potential for advancement if you work hard and your goals are met.  Benefits are competitive and culture is for those that are goal oriented.
good,It was great working for a strong company.  Benefits were great as well as pay.  The culture is relaxed but with a corporate look to it.  Maintained busy through out the day.
good,Wells Fargo is a prestigious company with many advancements and potential opportunities. They strive to kee their employees happy with flexible hours.
good,This was a great company to work with with great leaders and compensation. I would definitely recommend working with them if you are given the opportunity. They have great incentives for their employees.
good,"Start work and finished in 8 hours, sometimes longer depending on the workload. I loved my boss as well as my co-workers. This is a company I would have stayed with for the rest of my working days. WFB work culture applies to a diversified make up of people. The hardest part of my job I would say is being able to stop in the middle of an unresolved approval. Most enjoyable part is being able to help people become homeowners."
good,Over my years at Wells Fargo I was most productive in learning how to better structure my finances as well as helping others. It is a great company that has so many tools to help you exceed and grow. The hardest par of the job was when we had high traffic but with the help of the team its easy.
good,Wells Fargo had one of the most tolerable work environments for a call center. I was able to be comfortable at my desk and make it personable. This helped with working long hours when I needed overtime. They have parties and award their employees for a job well done. There are incentives when reaching goals but also good training to help you reach those goals. They care about their employees. I had an overall good experience while working there.
good,Wells Fargo was relaxed place to work. The only negative aspect was meeting sales goal every quarter. If not met after 3 months you were terminated. Too much pressure to meet sales goal.
good,Iloved my job however wells fargo decided to close my center and the center they decided to move to was to far away for my family and for me to travel each day.
good,"I have been impressed with Wells Fargo as they are a kind, understanding employer who truly does try to build the careers of all of their employees.  I would not be leaving if it was not for a recent lay off"
good,"Excelente place to work for but things have changed so everything I knew is diferent now. There are no more goals to hit everything falls under the branch itself as a goal, which I would say is better now, they focus now more on customer service."
good,"I worked within the Mortgage Services/Home Equity area of the business.  The organization was very open and partnering. The culture was great and I had the opportunity to learn and grow during my time there, as well as made a significant contribution through the work of our team."
good,"Wells is a good place to jump start your career. If you are looking into a financial services career, Wells Fargo is a good place to start.  There are opportunities for all genders and races.  It felt like they cared.  Be aware of the way promotions are extended to employees."
good,awesome people and company to work for !!! there is a lot of benefits your entitled to and also a lot of opportunities in the branch for you to strive for success
good,"it was fun to work  at wells forgo. Looking for a new bank? Read expert and customer reviews about Wells Fargo covering financial services offered, customer service and more."
good,"I genuinely love working at Wells Fargo. There are a lot of opportunities, but bankers don't have to be licensed. Hard to move up past banker because of that. I also do not like how full time employees do not get 2 full days off each week. You have to work Saturdays sometimes and when you do you only get Sunday off. At my location if you work Saturday you get a half day during the week, but that is not the same as a day off. I feel like there is no reason that a full time employee should not be guaranteed 2 days off a week. Hire more part time people to ensure it. There are many jobs with even less hours than Wells Fargo that gives their employees 2 days off. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Generally a great place to work. People are well taken care of with great benefits. Many employees I came across over the many years I had been with the company had been there several years including one of my former manager had 37 years tenure. Restructuring and layoff times were often stressful and affected work morale negatively.
good,"i love the company i work for and am not looking to leave, but add another job to supplement my income.  The company has been good to me and i love my job's flexible hours"
good,The Phone Banker role training was unbalanced and ill prepared.  The extent of product knowledge required to be successful is shadowed by the attempt to build a fun and relaxed atmosphere.
good,Definitely room for advancement family-oriented I made a lot of great friends the managers were really great and easy to talk to.] There was a great balance between work and family issues. People knowledgeable and was willing to help you excel in the direction that you wanted to go
good,"Wells Fargo is a great bank to work for. They are very competitive when it comes to opening a certain amount of accounts daily. I loved my position there, I just wasn't making enough."
good,Good company to work for with brand recognition.  Has lots of training courses.  Very compliant.  Fair they pay for performance.  Have most products available.
good,The company was very successful and it strives for it's employees to succeed in every aspect. The management was amazing and was always so helpful. I truly enjoyed the people that I worked with.
good,"When I worked for Wells Fargo it was my first job out of college. It was an excellent way to get into mortgage lending and I had a blast. My management team was great; I was identified as someone they wanted to promote and who could add value in more ways than just my role and I in turn was offered plenty of opportunity. The pay was very satisfactory and bonuses were quite rewarding for hard work month-over-month; however, I have heard since I left the company that pay was restructured and may not be the same. I was forced to leave Wells Fargo to relocate due to family needs that arose; if this had not been the case, I would have stayed at Wells Fargo, and I seek to regain employment with them someday."
good,working for wells fargo feels like a family if you work with a good group of people and can get along with everyone. good bonuses even though theres no more sales goals. growth is encourageed.
good,"Most of the work days are busy with customers.  "
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and great team members. A typical day at work was servicing existing clients which included answering e-mails, taking phone calls, preparing financial spreadsheets and reviewing documents."
good,"No two days are the same at Wells Fargo. Every day offers a new challenge and always some new to learn. I developed my career, learned a lot of new technologies and had a chance to meet a lot of great minds. The management is always approachable and friendly."
good,"Great place to work just takes awhile to move up management is great and team is too. Do get great benefits and stock options, managers are great and the hours are nice paid holidays and etc"
good,"If you don't mind sitting for 8 hrs a day and answering calls from customers all day long, the this is the job for you. It's not hard work, though there is a lot to learn. Friendly environment."
good,"I worked with a great team of managers, bankers, and tellers. The sales were sometimes difficult but for the most  part if you apply your training and natural customer service you will be successful at the sales and you will get great pay for your meeting your goals. when you a develop a family type work environment with your co workers and customers it makes your job a lot easier."
good,"i loved working with wells fargo, it is a fun and safe enviroment.  the customers are amazing.  The managers are great and help out so much.  I learned so much working there."
good,"They offer all of the training you will need to be successful. There is a career plan you can develop with your direct manager, Follow the plan and the sky is the limit."
good,"It was rewarding to meet with customers that had global needs and to be able to offer them solutions."
good,I truly liked my job at Wells Fargo.  I was given the tools and training to do a great job.  I would have continued working for Wells Fargo had I not moved.

good,I liked working for Wells Fargo.  I gave me opportunities to excel and advance.  I started from a low level sales job to a higher ranking position in commercial finance.
good,"Wells Fargo in Carlsbad, CA in the early 2000’s was a great place to work. We had such a positive atmosphere despite how busy we were. If could travel in time then I would like to re-live my time in that office and in that position."
good,"I loved my job i worked in disaster and it was very challenging and really hard work but rewarding. Training was a bit short and at times we did not have all the knowledge needed for success but we found a way as a team to help our customers. 100 call inbound when busy , lots of multi tasking and adhearance and QA are very strict."
good,"I worked for Wells Fargo Auto. Loved my job, great pay, great vacation and health care. The only reason why I  left, is because they closed in my area.  I would still be there if they were still open."
good,Wells Fargo was a great employee. worker there for 27 years. The department I worked for last was outsource. Therefore the whole department was closed. And I lost my job
good,"The only reason I left is because there was no room for advancement for me. I was being passed up on getting my SAR/LApp due to management.that is also no longer there. If it wasn't for that, I would still be there"
good,"Approved loans base on, income, credit history, debt ratios and savings or assets."
good,"The work is fulfilling; however, the pay for the skill set I have is low. Management style is very relaxed and it is a very collaborative environment.  The benefits are very good."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was a joy. I loved the people i worked with and felt that i was part of the family to my managers and co-team members. I loved the activities that were planned annually, really makes people feel special."
good,It was hard to achieve the goals set by the company so I was all about the customer and their needs. Fun volunteer events that focused on helping the community.
good,"Training, Benefits,There are many really knowable and communicating Upper Management. Some departments enjoy work life balance Wells Fargo Consumer Credit Training / Customer service training HR department is very helpful and all the resources are easy access"
good,"Even though Wells Fargo has been in the news, it is still one of the most honest financial institutions i've worked at.  The entire insurance industry is less ethical than Wells Fargo."
good,Great place to work with tons of potential. Reviews are given and they pay well. Great place for a single person to work and not the greatest with family life. Now that they don’t have quotas to work on I would go back.
good,"Great place to work.  Great manager.  Very professional group, lots of team building .  A relaxed work environment with a good feeling of knowing you are adding to the value of the company and helping customers."
good,"I've been extremely satisfied with working with Wells Fargo. The company has given me many opportunities to advance and training program. I felt empowered and I enjoyed the culture they have there. "
good,If you are looking for a great company to work for this is it. If you are looking to make a high salary look elsewhere. It does not offer as high of a pay as other banks.
good,Wells Fargo gave me the opportunity to challenge myself while still being able to help y community with their financial goals. Advancement was always available and bonuses were offered based on performance as well as much acknowledgement by the company.
good,Solid company. Low stress but lower pay when compared to similar positions at other banks. Solid team leaders. Culture and climate was good. Most problems came from senior leadership
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "

They stopped letting us do fun things like committees and parties, but if they would bring that back it would be my favorite place to work and I would've stayed.

good,"I worked at Wells Fargo for more than twenty-five years, straight out of college I receive a job offer as a thirty-hour walk-up teller excelling at this position I advanced to a 30-hour safe deposit representative. My next job would be a forty hour teller promoted to a full-time vault teller. I became a senior lead for the department where I would provide assistance to all jobs as needed. I was promoted to an assistant supervisor then to manager of the research department. During my ten years as director of this office, I had the opportunity to work with various levels of management needing the assistance of the research department. When acquisitions occurred, my department would have the job of locating monies lost during the transition. My last assignment was to find over a billion dollars of monies lost of which we were able to find all except $250,000.00 which we were able to take a lost. The excitement of finding monies for my staff and I was the excitement of the day, week and month. The department receives multiple compliments for jobs well done. The last position I have with Wells Fargo was the manager of cash vault for northern California. I loved the opportunity to interact with the staff and clients but, this position in cash vault was the opposite. Being in this job for seven months helped me make the decision to resign and go back to school where I would earn my Master Degree."
good,"I did like working there a lot. All of my coworkers so nice, they loved joking around. We would always have pot lucks where we would just have food in the break room and we would just have mini parties with just us. I really did like working there."

good,"An organization that believes in their brand and building a culture that values their employees and customers.  Although a very large organization, the consistent messaging about the importance of their vision and values was everywhere.  It taught me the importance of creating strong vision and value statements, but also the importance of everyone living by these everyday.  Direct reports need to see your belief system by your actions as well.  Great place to work with great people and a strong culture."

Every day was a challenge and new, that is what made it exhilarating. Management and team members were top notch. It was a family business within a corporate environment."
good,I would say this was one of the most satisfying companies and job positions.  I was in charge of all the HARP loan files and took care of processing all the acceptance and denial folders.  I would make sure all loans where prices at the right APR.  I would create folders for all the processors in the company and take all client calls.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up on all the loans coming through and making the proper files for people to review.  Overall this company and experience allowed me to open up my prospective.
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to work for. I learned a lot from this company. Management and workplace culture at my site and department was animated. Lack of support.The most important part of my job was to see my reps succeed.
good,With the right branch manager your career can be great.  Otherwise you are limited.  I have worked for both kind of managers and I yearn to be fair with all team members.
good,I am quite involved in activities outside of my day to day work function and must say this is a company where Senior Management truly cares about the success of its employees.  WFS certainly rewards those who work hard.

One of the best management teams I've had the opportunity to work with. All of the co-workers were nice and helpful as well. If there was a question to be asked, they were right there to assist with anything. I would say the most challenging part of the job was letting the customers leave. With my customer service experience I built a work-based relationship with my customers, as did everyone else that worked at the branch where I was employed. That would have to be my most enjoyable moments as well."

good,"Working for Wells Fargo has been a joy, the only draw back is it is only a Long Term Temp Assignment and it is coming to a close.  The management is caring and compassionate.  The Temporary and Permanent employees work well together as a team,  The Permanent employees treat the Temporary employees like family. Management is quick to show appreciation at every possible opportunity.  The only downfall is Wells Fargo isn't looking to hire permanently but we are welcome to reapply six months after we leave.  A position isn't guaranteed, but if there are open positions at that time, and you were a good employee the first time, its highly likely you'll get rehired."

good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo would be focusing on queue management ensuring I made phone calls to my past due account that were affecting my numbers. I handled an average of 40-60 inbound calls per day as well as making outbound calls to the accounts in my queue. I learned that it takes building a rapport with customers especially when calling about collecting money. Management made the work atmosphere fun, from games to scavenger hunts to free lunches, all the activities they provided made it a great place to work. My co-workers also made the environment a very nice place to come to for 8 hours per day. The hardest part of my job was taking on customer's issues especially if they could not make payment on their loans. I was deemed as being a little to compassionate, however at the end of the call I maintained account resolution. The most enjoyable part of the job was month end bonus! All the hard work put forth during the month paid off with a nice hefty bonus at the end of the next month."

I learned a lot about identity theft and how to prevent it. The only thing I can think of that was the hardest part of my job was the commute, 2 hours one way on the train, 4 hours total a day. The part I enjoyed the most was the satisfaction I felt when I was able to help someone resolve their problems successfully."
good,First time to ever work in a bank.  From my childhood days I always wanted to work in a bank.  I learned how to make all kinds of transactions for the customers and how the banking business really worked.  My co workers were excellent and were really good at helping and explaining when I first started. The hardest part for me was speaking on the speaker at the drive thru when I first started.
good,I absolutely love working for this bank.  i love the people and helping customers and solving their issues.  I love making their day better if I can.  A typical day at the bank is coming in by 8-815 and working until 530-6 without lunch or breaks most days.  The days go by so fast but i am also very busy.  Multi-tasking is a must in management.  I love the tellers I have hired and every day they seem to get a little better with sales and service.  The hardest part of my job is having to say no because I have exhausted my options when it comes to making sure my team is happy and making sure it is possible to make them happy to.  I can usually work it out and will if I can.  The most enjoyable part of my day is when a customer says I made their day better and turned something crazy for them into something so simple.
good,"Although it was a temporary position, I loved all the aspects of working at Wachovia. I was placed in Human Resources when first employed there, and stayed in that department until the transition was over.

good,My typical day at I helped customers internally and external to make sure there documents are correct and complete and to assist by getting the document to them and explain so that the customer understands what is needed in and that we need it returned in a  timely manner. Sometimes the customers can become difficult because they do not understand so helping them understand and return the document can be difficult and I may need to offer them an incentive to get the document returned or sometimes the customer just needs to vent and I listen so they fill validated. But on the other hand the customers can be very understanding and thankful for my assistance which makes me feel appreciated.

Each department I had the pleasure of working in, the people and management were professional, personable, and genuinely cared about individual people and their success with the company."
good,"the work load  always fluctuated peeks and valleys but we all came together to get things done, We had a great team and we all got along very well and management seldom had to be involved. We had some timely deadlines that were always met"

I was a contractor and searched out opportunities hard before departing. Despite having an excellent record and many references, there was no jobs offered, and barely any interviews. Disappointed, as I felt I was taking a lot of knowledge and experience with me."

good,"This team is comprised of many members across multiple locations. They are a strong, supportive team who work well together. I learned more about the art of project management at the hands of my immediate manager. The challenging part of the position is trying to interpret upper management's desires with limited details. I truly enjoyed working for my immediate manager and would do almost anything for her."
good,Overall I love the learning experiences that i have received at Wells Fargo some people at my job make it very frustrating to work with and management don't help out much. Don't want to go over my manager head about the person because I like and respect my manger.  The lifting is getting to me.

They offer great benefits that include paid time off to volunteer in the community and short/long term disability. The management for the most part was great. There were one or two supervisors that were your typical arrogant egotistical jerks, but every company has at least one or two. They switch around the teams and supervisor/team leads pretty often so you aren't stuck forever if you happen to not care for your supervisor. The pay I thought was fair, getting a raise every 6 months for the first 3 years then annually after that.  And raises are based on performance. I got a 16% raise with my first 6 month review. My only complaint was the shift/hours.  You are required to work either Sunday-Thursday or Tuesday-Saturday and you had to be there a long time and have seniority to get any sort of morning shift. Most shifts are 11am-8pm or 12pm-9pm so makes it hard if you are a parent.  They do try to compensate with a shift differential so you earn more money per hour for any hours worked 4pm and later but you have to work a 4 hour block to get that so there is a catch.  If you worked 4-7pm you lose that extra money. At least that was how it was at the time I left in 2013, not sure if it is the same still.  Overall I learned a lot and had some of the best supervisors I've ever had at Wells Fargo and would definitely recommend them."

Instead, I found the experience to be very pleasant and comfortable, team members made me feel as if I was a part of the family. Another impressive feat about Wells Fargo advisors is their diversity and inclusion programs that they have for all different types of people. The diversity and inclusion programs are to ensure that you are comfortable the day you step foot on campus and that you can have a support system with individuals that are just like you. As it is currently going I can confidently say, my first corporate experience has been a success. I have learned the importance of networking along with so many other tangible and intangible skills that I can use to propel me in other jobs, making me a more attractive candidate over length of my career."

They work so much in trying to train us to regain our customers trust.  They are the most military friendly company I've ever heard of . I got alot of my soldiers to work here because they were amazed on how well I was treated. As i was over seas they still paid me, for a whole year , and any trainings I have to do , I still get paid .

good,"Big banks are a wonderful place to take an entry level job and work your way up into a variety of available positions.  A teller could get into IT.

good,"Good place to work for, they focused heavily on team member engagement and training. I found with a few positions that I had that my managers were working against my advancement, since there's no benefit for them to lose top producers. Tough goals in every department, but they're obtainable- top producers move up into next positions, and they weight advancement heavily on production in lower-tier jobs since that is verifyable"
good,Overall this was a great company to work. Training was above average as well as compensation. The only disappointment was downsizing as well as a decrease in positions in the area.
good,"I joined at the wrong time.  But the people are excellent.  I could have stayed if they are not downsizing.  Highly technical, smart lead. But system has been built and they dont need more people."

good,"Wells Fargo was the best place I ever worked. The, and it’s Cultura are are just at all time high. The only reason I left was because I was in high school and was involved in sports teams"
good,"I would get into work and start looking at emails and then process transfers that I had to complete until the new set of transfer paperwork came in, then I would have those processed. I absolutely loved what I was doing. But the manager told me that I could not advance anymore on my current job and I had to go to another team, but that team was not busy at all. I think when I go to work, I am getting paid to work not sit and do nothing."

good,Loved my coworkers and management was fair.. Pretty routine each day come into work log into the dialer shoot to hit your metrics everyday while you’re on the phone and do the same thing the next day.
good,Working at Wells Fargo was a good place to work.  The only down side to it is that the weekend manager didn't allow you to get up as much to stretch your legs and take a break.  The sitting for a long time was not comfortable and the weekend manager didn't allow you to have fun.

good,Wells Fargo offered great training and an opportunity to advance in various roles.  I enjoyed the working with both customers and other employees.  Enjoyed the freedom to get my job accomplished.
good,A  typical day was filled with scheduled reporting and analysis.  There were always ad-hoc requests as well.  I learned to use the Microsoft platform of products.  I also learned how and why a bank works.  The management was very competent and willing to teach.
good,wells fargo is a great company i loved working there until so many changed started hapening to the point where i could no longer take it.... over all great place
good,"A typical day at work was going to work clocking in, getting the vacuum to clean the carpets. That was pretty much it. What i learned from the Wells Fargo Center. I learned to hold your tongue no matter what. There was a hard part about the job. The most enjoyable part about the job was 15 minute break.."
good,It is an excellent place to work and i loved my job there it was my career and loved the culture there. Family atmosphere management and really not a hard part due to the extensive training of the job in which you get to help people everyday and chance to grown relationships.
good,"Although most days at work are busy because of the location of the branch I always have a great day at work, I love the diverse environment and I'm so happy to say my manager is my best friend. The hardest part about my job is time management, being as though I am also a student. So it's like having two jobs."
good,It was a great place to work. The training was really good detailed. I love how they intertwined the training with actual going out on the floor. Overall I had a great experience there.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo has a great culture with people that have diverse backgrounds. The environment at Wells Fargo was my favorite thing working there. Settling in first thing on the morning and attending to overnight emails and returning phone calls. Setting up the appropriate CRM's to get the day started. Most difficult part of this role was not enough upper management to train newer personnel. Great rapport with team members.
good,Wels fargo was very stresseful job but it went fast depending on what location your located at. You can get great bonus and great medical. just management was very poorly.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. I have no complaints. Good benefits, diverse group of workers and job advancement opportunities. I would recommend this company to anyone."
good,"It is a great place to work, for working mothers. Real family orientated"
good,fun if you get the right branch and coworkers. New CEO seems like he will be taking that bank in the right path to success. Old CEO was not so caring about the customers
good,Enjoyed my time working at Wells Fargo. I would highly recommend to others interested in workking in the insure industry. They pay fairly and have an excellent team.
good,"Great benefits and atmosphere, very flexible, excellent work life balance. Good start for young adults to get their food in the door. Although only one of the departments have had advancement opportunities."
good,"good place to work,  during my time with Wells Fargo it felt like a family working with mortgage loans it can be stressful....  a good management team"
good,"the team is amazing great management everyone works together,hardest part of the job to look carefully for high risk items during a short time.Hours are great,"
good,"Amazing benefits and decent pay for those with minimal job experience. 18 paid days off which is great, however they give them to you all at once rather than as you earn them which can result in you owing your employer money if you use them and go on a medical leave. Overall, one of the absolute best places I've worked, but I do feel as if the friendly work culture I once loved is slowly deteriorating as time goes on."
good,"great job atmosphere, always competing  against the  prior day ,month, year on goals. Management keep you  busy, motivated."
good,"Work life balance was the highly appreciated factor of Wells Fargo."
good,"Working as a teller was enjoyable and stressful at the same time.  I learned how important teamwork is and there is no I in team. Also, I learn how important time management and how important it is to complete your task correctly and to listen to your customers, co-workers and management. Management at Wachovia was great.  They encourage you to do the best of your ability and to work towards your goals as well as there.  They offers excellent opportunity for advancement in the company. The hardest part of my job was selling the different company  products to our customers. However, after learning the right approach and believing in myself help me to achieve my goals and beyond.  The most enjoyable part of my job was customer service. Beside doing your job as a teller/teller supervisor selling products to our customer was  suppose to be at the front of every transaction that I did for my customer."
good,Management was not plesent didn’t help me in situation where I needed help and I was really uncomfortable in order to transfer you have to apply for the position to work at another branch witch is stupid
good,Loved working for Wachovia!  Company was very employee oriented.  The company cared for their employees and showed it by incentive programs and monetary awards.
good,"good company to work for"
good,Really enjoyed the clients and team.  Very stressful at times but also very rewarding.  There was always something new to learn no deal was the same so it took a lot of communication with both the client and the loan underwriter and processor.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I've worked for a great number of managers over the years, and the managers at Wells Fargo are some of my favorites.  They also have some of the most talented employees I've worked with."
good,"Overall I really like working for Wells Fargo, they give you great benefits right off the bat including 3 and a half weeks of paid vacation plus 14 days of paid holidays even for part-time employees. Health, dental, and vision insurance as well as 401k are available to all employees. 16 weeks PAID maternity and paternity leave is available to most employees and they don't give you a hard time for taking that much time off. Pay is competitive with other big banks. My only complaint is that your experience can really vary depending on your manager. I have worked with some that make me want to quit because they make the job miserable I have also worked with many that do a great job.  Luckily the good outnumber the bad at least in my area. The job used to be more stressful before the Wells Fargo sales practice scandal but since then the environment has been really laid back, Though the quarterly bonuses are not what they used to be."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was fun, stressful, challenging and the best work experience I've had.  The work is balanced with home life.  The best part of the job was the coworkers."
good,Working for wells fargo was the most amazing experience I did what I loved the most which was work with people and help with their financial needs. Worked with team
good,great company to work for. great benefits and plenty of opportunity to network and move into different roles. I was held to a production standard but otherwise was not micromanaged on a major level.
good,"It is very hard to pursue job advancement within Wells Fargo.  This company dwells on who you know and not what you know.  If applying here, please make sure you have some in-network connections."
good,Although we all do the same job every branch is ran differently depending on the branch manager or service manager. The branches I work in I have been surrounded by very knowledgable and caring people. They really help you work your way up if that is what your interest is. I've learned many things at this job that I will carry with myself throughout my work experience.
good,This place had a great working environment. it was a great pleasure to be working there. We had a great team and everyone was very supportive. Finished work on time and we all enjoyed it.
good,"The FDIC was a good place to work. It had challenges, rewards and training. The government work was straight forward and well thought out. Management was thoughtful and helpful."
good,"The environment is very supportive and team oriented. Communication was important and facilitated via group meetings and one on one meetings."
good,A typical day at Wells Fargo Dealer Services consisted of a lot of inbound and outbound calls to customers with the task of helping them with their auto loans. Helped those who where delinquent bring their accounts back to good standing.
good,Nice place to work with team effort and developmental opportunities. Good working spirit and motivation. Coaching and development......................
good,The time I'd worked for Wells Fargo Bank was the time I truly enjoyed since I had a chance to interact with so many different people and to help them out with the best services that I was able to provide to them. I did not find it stressful at all despite working 8 hours nonstop but rather being happy since this country was pretty much new to me at that time.
good,You have to be prepared for correcting mistakes at all times. Be well prepared to carry heavy loads and understand the procedures. Being organized and being on top of things helps out a lot.
good,Co-Workers were very friendly. Supervisors were nice. Very nice atmosphere. They didnt micro manage you. The motto is take care of your business and do your job.
good,"Wells Fargo is an extraordinary organization to work at. It's quick paced, focused, continually evolving. The way of life is the thing that makes this organization and is charming. The drawback is the hours should have been fruitful, work/life adjust."
good,customers come first and management works very hard to keep everyone I enjoyed my time there and would go back if the opportunity presented itself everyone is always happy and willing to help.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work.  Unfortunately, I was displaced thru no fault of mine.  The management and the benefits were unbelievable.  I enjoyed it."
good,It was a great place to work. We have both personal and work life balance. The management is very flexible and very supportive.I would suggest everybody who is planning to work in this company to go forward without any doubt and it is really a fun place to work.
good,A very good organization to work with. Goal oriented and treats all the employees well. Good hikes and user-friendly campus. Good hikes and bi-yearly appraisals.
good,Mainly on the phones providing customer service in a fun culture and great peers. They take care of you on appreciating your work by providing lunches from time to time and flavored water.
good,One of the best company to work with. I am only thinking to move out is for career growth and financial increment. I learned a lot here and keep continuing to learn every day.
good,"It was really good to work at wellsFargo."
good,"great work life balance, good benefits, banker hours, management is okay. Cool work parties. paid travel. really not a bad stepping stone for a career."
good,Wells Fargo has a great culture.  Wells Fargo offers all the tools to make each employee successful.  The pay is great.  Benefits are outstanding.  Advancement opportunity is endless.
good,"Great place to work, Manager is the best I have had in my personal career.  They are very customer and employee focused.  I enjoy the people I work with and the work environment."
good,Great place to work the only issues that I had here were moral issues with giving people who did not need any more debt more debt and sinking them into a hole that  we knew from the get go that they would not be climbing out of. We prayed on the middle credit class and consolidated everything into mortgage loans to give them as much cash out as possibloe and then watched as they could not afford to pay these loans and took everything that they owned as a penalty and didnt look back at them as we ran off with the loot!!
good,"Good company to work for. Competitive atmosphere, great team mentality, and you earn as much as you want. Happy I earned the opportunity to work for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage"
good,Love working here they have an amazing culture and really care about their employees. However I want to get into HR field so that is why I want to leave.
good,I worked for Wells Fargo for five years and I was promoted from within and I enjoyed working for this company until I was laid off from work and dislocated.
good,"Maintaining 401k accounts,money transfers."
good,"A professional environment where all team members partner to make the best out of it, everyone is willing to give the best of the customer experience to every customer, look for personal and company benefits from every interaction with customers. fun environment, good energy, share experiences and recognize the good work from our partners and teammates."
good,Work life is balanced and used to work as a test coordinator . Coordinating on a day to day basis with different teams in enhancing good quality of the product for the end user or stakeholders.
good,"Excellent company to work for. Great benefits, diversity, work life balance.  Career advancement opportunities along with professional and personal development resources."
good,The days at work go by quickly.  Many accounts to be reviewed for receipt of income documents for borrower's looking to modify their loans.  Work close with attorneys and the court system following bankruptcy guidelines.  Every account is unique and required strategic thinking to provide value and excellent service.  The process taught me to listen and read messages to be sure I provided the correct information.  Most difficult part is telling a borrower you don't have attorney consent and unable to speak account specifics.  In the end helping customers stay in the home is very rewarding.
good,The company is a great place to work. I felt valued and engaged. There was always a sense of growth and achievement.  Always incouraging associates to work for change and progress.
good,"I have been working at Wells Fargo full-time (More than 5 years)"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Overall a great company to work for because of it's stability and solid compensation benefits however the ability to move up does seem to depend greatly on who you know unless you're in sales otherwise it's very heavy sales driven and depends solely on that.
good,"5 start enterprise. This was my contribution to it: Gain the segment of Latin American customers and local entrepreneurs, as well as the relationship with the local government.  Opened accounts for consumers and companies, offered complementary services and products. Present several innovation projects. I enjoyed the time with every customer. The best leaders ever."
good,"Wells Fargo was a good place to work. The learning curve is a steep one, but once you master your base skills the company is very helpful in advancement. The team members are very supportive. The work place can be fast paced and stressful but also fun and engaging. A good place to work if you are looking for a career in the finance world."
good,"Show up to work, do the best  you can do to your ability and no one will ever bother you about your job. Meeting expectations are realistic as well as they will always train you more on the areas that need improvement. Great culture."
good,"Customer service was my main role at Wells Fargo Private Banking. I was the first and main point of contact for clients and co-workers, it was a fun environment but management unfortunately changed after I was there for close to 2- years and even though I signed a contract to be committed without looking for any employment outside the company for a 12 month period in order to advance but since management changed they wanted to leave me in the same position indefinitely. It was fun working there, I created office memos, I sent emails with any work news and updates and answered as well as routed calls from a massive switchboard console."
good,"I loved working for Wells Fargo it was a good company to actually work for even though i didn't agree on some of the stuff that they were doing like the whole lawsuit from last year, other that it was a good, Management care about you a lot, they want to see you succeed, and they give you a lot of helpful information i can't say a bad thing about them. Hardest part of the job is denying people who wanted their money back especially if they are going threw some tough times. This is a company i would want to work for again and maybe i will someday soon."
good,"The overall benefits at Wells Fargo are great, but the health insurance is not the best on the market and I feel with such a large company, they could do better. However, the paid time off, holidays, and volunteer days are great. Also, depending on your department, you may be able to enjoy extra curricular activities while at work. Wells Fargo truly does want you to have a good life/work balance."
good,Make collection calls and help bring customers current . work schedule Monday - Friday and maybe some Saturdays . Pay is nice with the bonus structure.
good,"Amazing company...last several yrs some apparent Leaders clearly lost Company Core Values focus. In all my years combined (over 13+ yrs) I only had 1 negative experience with a single Manager. All other Leaders and Managers were exceptional people."
good,"Wells Fargo was my first exposure to working for a money center bank from start to finish (previous regional bank employer was acquired by money center bank, Citibank).  There was an adjustment period as a result of this.  Like JPM Chase, I enjoyed being exposed to the many industry innovations my employer was always one of the first to deploy.  I was quickly promoted to the bank's Middle Market Group and enjoyed working on larger clients.  The challenge to that, however, was a limited number of those sized clients in my market after a couple of industry segments were moved to another department in the bank.  This in combination with the challenge of trying to implement Wells Fargo's business model in a market that was almost 80% controlled by locally owned banks that were able to be more nimble and provide a full suite of services from the same department (silo).  The most enjoyable part of the job was winning business in an arena of other competitors when my employer was able to provide a superior product or service structure.  I also took great pleasure in helping my customers achieve market dominance, profitable operations and sustained growth.  A typical day at work was 40% marketing, 35% underwriting and analysis and 25%  administrative. I also enjoyed interacting with my co-workers, watching them win and grow into productive bankers."
good,"Wells Fargo is the best place to work. Professional colleagues, management and well planned projects."
good,Great and safe place to work.  Upper Management goals were unrealistic for the size of our Branch.  You were given a number of requirements to sell (products or services) per week. You ended up repeating the same lines to the few customers that entered our branch.  Managers were pushed to their limits to acquire new accounts.
good,"Consult and provide successful implementation planning, solution, and preparation of initiatives that are the more high complex and strategic in nature."
good,"I loved working for Wells Fargo and honesty it opened a lot of door to my professional growth. I worked as a part-time teller more than 3 years. I knew that I could rely on my managers for advice and I felt value and acknowledge. Benefits are great, and offered almost a month for PTO."
good,When i worked there we took a lot of phone calls and were required to sell something to the customers on every call. So it was a little stressful but the pay was great for what it was. Plus they would always do things for the staff such as pizza parties and things like that. I guess the little things they did made it epic.
good,I really enjoy Wells Fargo but I am looking to advance to a higher paying position. With recent changes to the company I am looking for more job security.
good,I made a lot of great friends while working here. Your team mates become like family. There quota structure has changed since I last worked here and I have heard great things about it.
good,Learned a lot - enjoyed what I did. Worked with good people and even better clients.  Good partnerships throughout the company.  Enjoyed the ability to focus on client needs.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I know what is expected of me, and I'm given the freedom to accomplish my responsibilities as I see fit.  Management is always accessible and willing to listen to my input."
good,"No negative comments, other than I was laid off twice from Wells Fargo.  The second time was a surprise as my business unit was told we dd not have anything to worry about and the next week most were laid off."
good,"I loved working for Wells Fargo Bank, and would do so again, if the money's right. I had some of the best managers and coworkers, and the greatest customers I could have hoped for."
good,"I love working here, there are many advancement opportunities and a great place to build a sold career foundation. You will not be disappointment in the benefits either."

good,"Wells Fargo allows you to build relationships and feel connected to the Wells Fargo's mission and purpose. It has built a culture where you are able to take initiative, build self awareness and apply what you have learned on a daily basis."
good,"It is an easy job to move up in the company. Fair pay, great benefits, and more. I loved my job because co-workers are great, if I had bad co-workers I wouldn't like the job. Customers can be very rude though."
good,"Great culture, great people and great lending philosophy. Have thoroughly enjoyed working here, but am looking for a change after so many years."
good,Very much enjoyed the reading mentors and partnership with the Museum. So thankful to be able to collaborate with their professional crew. Thier dedication to student achievment was self-less.
good,Too stressful and the pay was not that good could be better. The raises were not fair. Other than that the supervisors and managers were very nice. Too stressful though.
good,This is a great place to work. The overall culture is something to be desired by other companies. Everyone is so helpful catching up to speed. Great place to work.
good,"Print reports daily, go into the field and capture business or educate dealers on the program. I learned most of what I know about the banking side of auto lending here. Management was fair, fun and very helpful. Culture was really fun with a serious side. The hardest part was changing the habits of dealers on where they send business. The best part was working with all different kinds of people and helping them make money, which made you money."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to begin a career. There is a lot of opportunity to move up within the company. If you decide to become licensed and purse a career through that stream of Wells Fargo its a lot of money to be made, other than that management is a great route, Business Banking is decent although I feel the company don't appreciate the business bankers as much as they should."
good,"everyday was the same thing being a rendering specialist, but that's normal for that job. great employee's, and management. the incentive program was amazing."
good,"If the town I lived in was bigger , we still would of had a bank , but upper management decided to close the doors and we all had to seek new employment. I would of still been employed by Wells fargo but the nearest one was 65 miles away!!"
good,I am working in a Custody Corporate Action Team where we process Corporate Action on our Client Accounts as per the payments received from Clearing Corporation.
good,Wells Fargo really cares about their employees. Everybody at Wells Fargo is incredibly nice even when it gets busy. Wells Fargo as a whole is constantly changing and growing and the same can be said about the culture for technology.The benefits and pay are really great and there is always room for career growth.
good,"All good at work. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "

good,It has beautiful and the elite work place providing the people a calm and the dignified work environment. People here are so generous and easily mingling..
good,"Simply loved working for Wells Fargo, management was reachable, co workers great, paid well. Still touch bases with former employees. Managers made this work experience a awesome experience."
good,I have been with Wells Fargo for about 9 months now. They work with your schedule offering part-time and full-time positions. It is also great that they offer job advancements for current employees first before they reach out externally.
good,"great company amazing people and management is great, has great opportunities and job is secured cannot go wrong working for wells fargo and able to move up"
good,"We are taking our own break and lunch break. We also allow to listen to music during working, but only listen music throught a head-phone. Very flexible breaks and lunch breaks."

good,working at wells I have learn a lot in the escrow department. management has taught me well in the department I'm in and working with Business partners was a wonderful experience.
good,There's always something to do. Best days are the busiest days. Hard work pays off. Many options to get promoted and many options of different positions.

good,"A great place to work, with amazing wokplace culture"
good,"I've never been in an office where everyone was actually friends, we socialize goof around, help each other, and genuinely care about one another. The work is simple and consistent, and allows for time to breath as long as you are maintaining standards"
good,Your day starts off  reading your email alerts and checking for your schedule to see if there is any updates to it for training. You then log in and proceed to answer calls to help customers with their bank accounts. You learn a lot from banking regulations to fraud and scams that happen as well as ways to save money. Management really want you to advance and take a lot of time to prepare you for the next step if you like.
good,Loved the atmosphere at Wachovia.  Teams functioned well between communities. They were very customer service based and overall just a really good place to work.  Management was always supportive and eager to help.
good,"Senior individual contributor was directly accountable for strategic business development in high-impact internal business segments.  Developed, planned and executed a strategic plan that optimized the efforts to grow segment specific sales/revenue/market share while ensuring a better customer experience and compliance regulations.

good,Wells Fargo was a great place to work and the pay was adequate for the job. The only reason I left was because the company outsourced our entire department.
good,Excellent company to work for. I was part of a wonderful team. We worked together like family. Branch manager was grateful for our commitment and was always willing to assist
good,A multicultural environment that I looked forward to going to work everyday.  Management was very fair as to how they treated their employees.  The hardest part of the job was leaving.

good,I love to work with Wells Fargo. It is one of the best work place in my carrier. Job culture is really great and fun. Wells Fargo all ways supports its employs in a great manner.
good,"Enjoyed the work.  Team was a bit clickish."
good,"Benefits Good"
good,"Great work environment that sometimes offered free food, it was a job that offered great pay. however it had nothing much as in to accommodating its employees"
good,Relaxed work environment in which those who work hard reap the benefits.  A recent change in structure for the position makes it a much less desirable of a place to work.
good,This company provides you with the tools and guidance to advance your career. Your only obstacle is yourself. You just have to work hard.
good,"I loved my stay with the company. They pay really well for a light load job. However, I've struggled everyday just to get to work on time due to the location and the stagnant traffic. Management refused to change my schedule just so that I could make it to work on time. Bad on them. But no bitterness held back"
good,"great company, I had a great experience!"
good,Wachovia was a fantastic company to work for. They valued their employees and customers and didn't force products upon them like Wells Fargo did when they took over. It was a shame to see such a good company get taken over by Wells.
good,"I worked in Online banking, assisting customers with their online accounts. Online banking consisted of setting customers up to use online banking, and also helping them use their personal financial manager tools, such as Quicken, QuickBooks and Money. I assisted with online billpay using multiple platforms for delivering payments.The most enjoyable part of this job was learning the different ways to use online banking and billpay that would best suite each individual."
good,"Great atmosphere, quality people. I was extremely lucky to be placed with an excellent team. Management was fantastic. I would highly recommend."

good,I love working for Wells Fargo and how helpful my colleagues are. There is a lot of room for growth in this company. Helping people has always been something I have always wanted to do. Being able to provide financial help and meeting new clients daily. So far I love it and how much Wells Fargo caress for their clients.

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Co-workers are very friendly and nice environment to work."
good,"Every day is very straight forward with all resources available. Depending on the day of week the call volume could be very high or pretty low. On average about 100 calls get answered by each person each day. As long as you keep your calls at about 220 seconds on average, you will continue to reach all goals. Everyone is willing to help and supervisors are willing to tell you how to reach your answers. The hardest part of the job is making sure you aren't taking what customers say personal and keep moving forward. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to end each call knowing you helped someone in need."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work."
good,When you come in you are immediately greeted by staff. As in any call center it's tough far as the customers who call in you can't control them or the call volume but the work environment is phenomenal just wish I was getting paid more money. We are always having potlucks and winning prizes. It's like we are family and ther is always a open door policy with no fear of reprisal. Overall I can't complain about the work environment just the calls we get.
good,"Wells Fargo has taken a lot of backlash lately, but the branch I was lucky enough to work at was very enjoyable and educating. We weren't extremely busy, but we did normally stay at a steady speed. My managers and co-workers taught me so many helpful skills and lessons. The hardest part of my job would be when I truly wanted to find a way to help a customer, and I just couldn't because of certain regulations or my position! The best part of my job, was getting to know my customers to the point of them being a regular for me! I will always be thankful for the roll my branch and co-workers played in helping me grow as a professional employee."
good,"This place used to be a very good place to work, there used to be a very good management, very good benefits and the best salaries in florida. Management they were always open to listen to employees."
good,Great teamwork and work ethic.  Management is fair and communicates well with all associates. I have worked 2 contracts with Wells Fargo since 2010 and would absolutely go back.
good,"I learned a lot when I was employed there. The different personalities, structures, growth availability, learning and teaching all was a new world. I met people that I stayed in contact with after it was over which was the hardest part."
good,"My time with this company was heavily based on hitting a set number of dials each day and was overseen by a outstandingly difficult manager who is no longer with the company, but was the catalyst for myself and many others to seek employment elsewhere."
good,"Great Team Orientated company with great career opportunities, strive and drive for success while making our customer succeed financially. Company goal is ""together we go far"", which make is more customer orientated while enjoying team working environment.

Nonetheless, I continue to respect and love the company."
good,"Day to day consisted of providing support to the branch manager. overseeing a team of 5 bankers and asking for commitments, performing mid-session reviews. I was expected to perform and ensure that bankers were performing. I conducted daily huddles, A&D meetings weekly and manage the lobby to ensure customers were directed to the right place. Management was very supportive and constantly coached me to success. The hardest part was  unable to take lunch on time and overtime due to customer traffic for a very busy branch in North Sacramento.The most enjoyable part was my team. I worked for a manager who cared and a team that was fully engaged every day."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "

good,"The company is has many great leaders and values that align with my personal own."
good,I entered Wells Fargo knowing nothing about banking and now just 3 1/2 years later I am a Manager where I can help team members move up in the company while educating them at the same time.
good,"My typical day is in the office by 8:00am. I would typically work till 5:30pm. For as large a company they strive to make the right, educated decision by getting input from several experts. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Dream job.  I love sports and this position was my dream job.  Unfortunately the women's league faded and I was laid off.  Otherwise I would still be with the WNBA/NBA

good,"Good Work place."
good,"My day starts by following up with customers, thanking them for being a part of our family, and helping customers walking in or appointments set for that day. I learned how to become financially successful and use my knowledge and product knowledge to help my customers become financially successful as well. Management is great everyone is understanding and very professional. My co workers are like family helping each other out everyday, working as a team in any situation. The hardest part of my job is using time efficiently so work doesn't pile up, and doing everything I need to take care of so the next day flows smoothly. The most enjoyable part of my job is opening new accounts and explaining and teaching them how Wells Fargo is such a great bank and how using the knowledge I share with them helps them throughout there entire life."
good,I really enjoy working for Wells Fargo overall. Upper level has hi sale expectation for slower markets. The company just recently rolled out a new bonus incentive for employees. Hopefully this will motivate employees

good,"Managed and grew the Roseville and Sacramento offices."
good,wells fargo is a great place to work if you do not plan on growing within the company and dont mind the cubical life. some of the supervisors were great and pushed you to do more and to try to get ahead but others just were worried about themselves. Over all its a simple job and a good pay but not worth your time if your looking for a career.

good,"very fast pace, diversity, and multiple tasks need to be completed for great incentive, the company has close Milwaukee site"
good,"I was at this company for a very long time. For a product manager, it was wonderful working at this company when they were a regional bank. As a large bank, their product needs changed. If you are someone that likes the chaotic atmosphere of a start up, you would have enjoyed this company 15 or so years ago. They were innovative and were small enough to make changes quickly. Their product teams were responsible for the whole business so a product manager's responsibility was wide spread. "
good,"Lots of friendly people, for the most part. Wells Fargo almost lived up to my expectations of a friendly environment. I had a failed project due to a supervisor which raised my concern for my job security, and when I received the sheet to sign for the failed project, I did not mention them (Didn't want to throw anybody under the bus) but overall its an excellent place to build your foundation on. There's the occasionally person who's in a bad mood and acts rude but I learned how to just kill them with kindness. At the end of the day you feel better about not respond negatively. The people are really bubbly and outgoing. The hardest thing I thought about the job was Training, because of all the info we have to take in and memorize before hitting the floor."
good,"Wells is a good company, the people are kind and just want to get the job done right. The atmosphere is both Professional and laid back."

good,"Start my day by monitoring and following up on  my clients, do reports and making orders."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "

good,Great company to work for. There are lots of resources for development but not always the opportunity. The benifits are great.
good,I most recently worked for Wells Fargo Bank NA as a mortgage lender.  It is a great company to work for with excellent management.  I was kept very busy with business coming from bank referrals and realtors.

good,"Wonderful company to work for. Treats employees with respect, great atmosphere, always room for growth, wonderful work relationships."
good,"Ours days would start with a review of what we did the previous day. This information helped us to construct a plan for success to meet or exceed our daily goals. I learned that the work you put in is what you will get out of a given project. Having strict sales goals for various metrics was self-motivating and conditioned me to keep an eye out to identify and address the needs of our customers. I learned a great deal simply from the act of reiterating company policies and banking concepts with terms and examples more easily understood by our clients. Management proactively helped me answer questions customers asked and did a great deal to make my customers aware they were in good hands. Working under constant sales pressure could be difficult at times, but the results this atmosphere yielded made the experience worth it. What I enjoyed most would have to be the positive energy the company had towards its employees. This positivity was very empowering, even infectious."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Fun place to work with a great group of coworkers. Heavy emphasis on meeting personal goals and branch goals. Management promised promotions but rarely followed through.
good,"A typical work day involves heavy calendar management, meeting planning and arranging travel. I love my job and working for my company because every day presents a new challenge and an opportunity to learn something new. The senior management team is great to work with and the organization provides an overall pleasant and friendly work environment."
good,loved my job! and enjoyed all of the people I got to work with. but it was very sales orientated. pressured to sell products like crazy!
good,I was fortunate to be part of a temporary team assigned to Wachovia's Anti-money laundering investigations.  From day one the training and management were well organized and a welcoming environment.  You always knew what you were to do on a daily basis and the team work was like a well oiled machine.
good,"In my current role, I review the work other Wells Fargo employees conduct directly with customers who have financial hardships. I mitigate risk by reviewing communication, both verbal and written between the customer and our employee and identify potential issues to remain compliant with internal company requirements. I also ensure that those identified risks are well documented, communicated and resolved in a timely manner."
good,There is no limit within this organization. Plenty of room to grow and move up in the corporate ladder given the size of the company. The culture makes Wells Fargo an even better place to work. Everyone within the company is extremely kind and are willing to help out.
good,"There is no typical day as a personal banker.  You handle accounts and issues from the blue collar, no collar to the white collar.  Management always offer opportunities for growth and positive reinforcement.  Co-workers are goal driven however approachable. The hardest part of the job usually entails not having the ability to help those who due to the economy cannot become financially independent.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting very interesting individual from the community."

good,"During my times of working with Wells Fargo I have learned a lot and enjoyed my work environment. Wells is  a busy place and has expectations,  but what company does not.  Their focus on customer service is first and foremost as much as the focus on employee retention and work/ family balance.  Wells does a lot of extras for their employees and that's a plus to me. The managers I was under in both West Des Moines and Minneapolis area were phenomenal"

good,Great opportunity for advancement from within.  This was an inbound and outbound call center.  All mortgage related department were located here.  The compensation was excellent.
good,"Wells Fargo offers a very generous benefits package with competitive pay. However, monthly goals are not easy to meet and, one month doesn't carry you to the other. One struggle will override any accomplishment. Professional environment that requires a lot of time outside of the 9-5 norm. High stress and highly competitive environment."
good,"Wells Fargo has a family oriented atmosphere, but is strict on accuracy and productivity to mitigate financial risk and to ensure compliance with all jurisdictional laws."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. They have amazing health care benefits and financial benefits as well (401k, savings plans, etc). The only down side to Wells Fargo is the strict attendance requirements. When you have kids and no help in child care it can get difficult with the occurrence base they use. They really do take care of their employees and will try to work with you the best they can. The center manager for phoenix, Arizona is the best manager i have ever come in contact. He is very understanding and flexible."
good,Wells Fargo as a whole is a great company to work for. They care about their people and really care about the customer. I have learned a great deal about change and how to manage change. WIth an ever changing economy we have to be able to adjust.

good,"Most days are filled with meeting deadlines, complying with industry rules and regulations, and exceeding quality and productivity standards in service excellence. I learned that no matter how well planned my day was, something unexpected would arise, which took priority over everything else I was working on. I really enjoy working in a fast paced office environment where I can provide guidance and support to internal/external customers and team members. The most enjoyable part of my job, was knowing that I made a difference for my customers. They were always my number one focus and exceeding their expectations was/is always my goal."
good,"My responsibility was to answer inbound calls assisting customers with questions about there accounts. Also to review the account and make recommendations on product that could fit there business needs. I learned to overcome objections in order to make my sales goal. The managers that I had there were terrific, it felt like they wanted you to succeed. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers. When dealing with someone's business and there money things sometimes would get a little personal. the most enjoyable part was those angry customers that called but ended the call happy."

However, sometimes there can be an intense pressure of an micromanagement approach towards the employees, and constant reports analyzing data in order to be able to exceed pass daily goals and tasks, that can cause a great amount of stress and pressure on everyone.  For this bank, there is no guarantee job security if you lay foot in the mortgage division of the company, as there are always phases of lay-offs based on the economical trends of the time."
good,"A day at work was one to remember, I alway felt that I would be taken care of on this Job."

Throughout the day I was to ensure that every customer that would walk in would have a perfect customer service experience. Coaching the team throughout the day was essential to succeeding in our customer service reflection and our sales goals.

I was in the #1 market of the entire company and in my first quarter as a Manager I was giving the opportunity to change a Branch that was ranked second to last in the entire SF Market, consisting of 159 Store locations, and ended up achieving #2 in that region with an audit score of 99% out of 100%.
