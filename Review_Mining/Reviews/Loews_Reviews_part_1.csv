bad,Abusive upper management who hate change - very strange culture. Fired me a week before I would have got a bonus without any reason. Company says they are open to change; but most are very regressive.
bad,Very old school organization that struggles to keep up.  Financially stable but not at all engaging. Far too many very long term employees that do as little as possible to get by.
good,The head of the department liked to micro manage the whole process. The teams do not socialize at all they just sit in cubicles all-day barely interacting. Not open to new hires.
good,"Project Consulting- no benefits, competitive environment.Had an injury, so hardest part of the job was getting around. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility to my schedule."
good,"The Company has been on a downward trajectory since they spun off Lorillard Tobacco and purchased HighMount.  The new generation does not bring a lot to the company.  The capital alligators are not investing in Technology, either for the businesses or as investments.  No where to go but up here."
good,"Great company to be hired under in terms of office perks. Very boring work environment but yet seems to be dramatic with all the office gossip."
good,"Great tech set up as most everyone has at least two or three monitors.   2nd generation management is great but 3rd generation is a good 10-15 years away from being ready to take on the challenge.  Most people stick to normal 9-5 M-F.  Overtime is generally frowned upon and must be approved in advance.  Smart employees get in early.  Dress is business casual year round.  Ties as necessary when meeting outsiders.   Very difficult to get to know co-workers without their pictures in the online directory, and not every cube or office has a name plate.  Hardly any interaction with other departments except for the occasional IT people passing through.  Didn't even know there were 300 people in the NY office until we all met at the annual holiday party where everybody had name tags. Global Address Book is alphabetized by first names!  Many employees have been there for years and years.  Low turnover, few promotions, and minimal improvements to existing practices.  Company seems very set in their ways and not interested in making changes.  Don't go in there thinking you will change how they function.  They've been very successful this way.  Don't rock the boat."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work. Everyday is different, one day you'll be "
good,"Loews Company is one of the fortune 500 companies.  They sold Bulova in 2008.  Hotel chain accounting department was relocated to Nashville, therefore the accounting department was reduced dramatically resulting in a major layoff.  I learned a lot. Loews offers good benefits."

good,"Fun workplace, enjoyed my time there. During my 11 years at Loews I learned alot and made alot of friends that I will keep outside of Loews."
good,"tend to micro manage and can discourage productivity indirectly."
good,"A very productive, safe and friendly workplace that provides social engagement through Mixers, programs, and activities that promote Wellness.  There's always an opportunity to grow."
good,"Loews has been an exceptional company to work for, a family owned Conglomerate that values its employees as much as any corporation can. Most people at Loews have been with the corporation for 10 + years and that speaks for itself these days. The environment is definitely conservative compared to many of its competitors but that is primarily the reason for its continued success."
good,"Bulova/Lowes corporation is a good place to work for. The co-workers are what we called ""lifers"". Most of them have been there for many years. The day to day tasks involved pricing and purchasing of mostly Bulova watch parts as well as general office purchases."
good,I was very happy working at Loews Corporation.  The department was very friendly and cooperative to all of the co-workers. A consistent atmosphere and very friendly.
good,Loews was a wonderful place to be for 16 years.  Days varied but were exciting and they kept up with the ever evolving world.  Management and culture were excellent.  The hardest part of the job was leaving.
good,"Working at this conglomerate was the best work experience years for an incoming Programmer Analyst.  The manager of the team was a mentor and his style of managing produced positive results.  Everyone wanted to work for him.  I missed that company and my colleagues, but there comes a time, when one has to ""fly the coop""."
