rating,review
bad,The lack of management. They are not enough team players. I've been promised a full time position and have yet to get one. There are many employees that don't like helping.
bad,Management isn't up to par. Favoritism plays a big part. Breaks and lunch breaks are shorten. Dress code only applies for few. Management stay on the floor with workers more than doing their roles.
bad,Είναι το πρώτο εργοστάσιο που δούλεψα και άντεξα οχτώ μήνες με όλα αυτά που γίνονται εκεί μέσα!!!!
bad,people need to look inside of this business expressly in Rockhampton. There is a lot that goes on behind the seems that is not made known to people when they first start.

bad,"Having grand opening parties, with several people under you but not making much profit."
bad,"management had constant turn over and got worse each time. poor leadership, no direction, ungrateful and just generally clueless. would not recommend applying for a job here."
bad,Fino a pochi anni fa era una grande azienda gestita in modo perfetto ora si è trasformata in caos totale.
bad,"Not an easy job. Very competitive. You work on your own leads. Leaders above you can stab you in the back very fast, they can lie to you and take your leads if you don't watch yourself"
bad,"Quien ganaba era la distribución, y tenías que invertir mucho de tu propio dinero."
bad,"selling tupperware containers juice bottle ,,we just buy and  sell product ,,its also challenging job because there have target to meet at the end of the month to see how much commisioin you got"
bad,"el dia era rutinario,aprendi a cargar remitos manejar el autoelevador y a recibir proveedores.con los jefes y encargados el trato era muy bueno,se trabajo en conjunto. la parte mas dificil era que no sentirse respaldado por la empresa, lo q mas me gusto fue el grupo de trabajo."
bad,Its a productive company it develops its employees i could go back if im given a chance coz i enjoy injection moulding its challenging and i love challenges
bad,Animatrice culinaire depuis février et c est un désastre aucun sérieux dans le suivi des animatrices beaucoup de soucis également dans la réception des commandes pour les hôtesses et la réactivité du dépot  zéro expérience plus que négative je termine les réunions déjà planifiées et stop je tourne la page .les seuls points positifs sont les cadeaux quand on les reçoit et la rémunération
bad,"""bouche trou"" nettoyer d'un coter piétiner de l'autre aucun respect"
bad,"j'ai apprécié travailler, faire de nouvelles rencontres"
bad,While working with Tupperware I built and managed my own business. With this company I learned quality sales skills and handled all my own accounting. I also learned to deal with customers on a first hand basis.
bad,"Ottima azienda , ho avuto problemi causati dai concessionari"
bad,Learned that sales representative jobs are not for me. I couldn't gain enough parties to be able to make any money in this business. I found that this business is too competitive.
bad,"When I work for the company temporarily the manager I worked for was very condescending. I always felt like everything I did was never enough, and I was always given very little direction on a task to perform."
bad,"Schlechter Umgang mit Mitarbeitern."
bad,No security on this job. Forever closing when the work is caught up.
bad,"nous sommes utilisés comme des pions."
bad,"Very busy and a lot of work."
bad,It is a lovely place to work although it demands a lot from you but it gets better as you grow into it I enjoyed my experience there I learned a lot of things
bad,"Worked in the warehouse at ferntree gully for 4 years, very archaic working conditions, worked the employees into the ground, management was so self absorbed and were really only interested in the full time employees...work force was 2 casual workers to 1 full time, lower management were very disrespectful of employees and not compassionate about employees needs and wants....don't be fooled by all the nice fluffy comments from managers/distributors etc don't see the full story of Tupperware"
bad,travail tres agreable mais peu mais cela permet d'avoir un petit plus au niveau experience et financier
bad,"Vente à domicile, difficile de trouver des rendez vous pour programmer des ventes ou alors en activité complémentaire."
bad,"Need to change over the upper management to a model where employees are empowered and not micromanaged.  Instead of letting go a poor performer, HR moves them to a new role, creating a headache for the new manager."
bad,Beaucoup de pression au sein de cette entreprise. Cela prend le dessus sur le côté agréable de la relation avec la clientèle
bad,"ambiente collaborativo, stimolante, aumenta la voglia di relazionarsi con la gente"
bad,"Activité qui demande d'avoir beaucoup de réseau"
bad,"es una empresa que te da la oportunidad en ventas y ganar premios dependiendo tus ventas, creces con dificultad."

bad,"encadrer une equipe ,faire de nouvelle rencontre avec differentes personnes plus ou moins agreable et positive ."
bad,"Great job for consultants and managers, positive environment to work in.  Head Office are short staffed and therefore structures, processes and policies are insufficient in some areas"
bad,a law suit waiting to happen... when they think they can break the rules of contractors vs employees.  Regionals directors are not well educated in business practices...
bad,"If you are able to play the game and stay in the good graces of members of management, you will do well. If not, your reputation and credibility will be ruined."
bad,The pay was too low and there were no advancement opportunities.  It was who you know and not what you know.   The 12 hour shifts were very inconvenient.
bad,"Tout le monde à sa chance !! Pas d'entretien d'embauche !"
bad,il faut être très ouvert et flexible envers les clients. il faut avoir de large
bad,typical day is big sale
bad,Aucun respect des réseaux clients des démonstratrices au sein d'une même équipe. Progression très difficile voire au final arrêt complet de l'activité
bad,el ambiente de trabajo es genial y el auto empleo que ofrecen alos consumidores es bueno. solo deberian de respetar el horario de sus trabajadores.
bad,In this kind of work we can monitor our own time because you will not spend too much in promoting the product because tupperware is a well-known direct selling company.I learned a lot because it improve my communication skill. The hardest part of the job is when people cannot pay the product they order and as a responsible my own money will be the advance payment. The most enjoyable part is i have a money and I reward my self like for example buying at the tupperware a lipstick for my own use.
good,"Not enough personal life time,Leave is always a problem to take."
good,"A great company to work for overall. However, the way things are run within certain departments is a mess. Always seeking ways to cut back on spending in which, you get the short end of the stick by not providing with the necessary tools to do your job effectively. Many people have been their for so long and don't care for change so much. Therefore things stay the same while everything in the workforce is constantly changing. Very disorganized within certain departments, required to do more work then willing to pay. No training in the area in which you are required to work is not properly provided or reference guides to refer to regarding the job ."
good,"Its fun dealing with the customers and the management. "
good,faire des réunions chez les clientes et présenter les produits et prendre d'autre réunions

good,"libre de ses journées, que l'on organise nous même, quand on a notre clientèles appropriée"
good,Longstanding and fast pace work place. I felt I was underpaid for the work I was temp worker. The hardest part standing for long period of time. I enjoy the work I am a warehouse worker who love to work.
good,"I learnt about sales and  product's"
good,e uma empresa mais ou menos sem folgas tinha ótimas pessoas em um bom ambiente de trabalho mais muita carga horaria e quase não tinha folgas
good,Typical day was like you inspect item to be shipped. You worked on a machine all day. It was not enjoyable at all and it didn't work with my outside life.
good,"travail en toute autonomie suivant un planning de production, gérer les stocks,les entrées et sorties, réceptionner les imports avec un ERP"
good,I unfortunately had to move from Florida but overall Tupperware was a great company.  The workplace culture was great and have the opportunity to grow.
good,leuke job maar met weinig respect van de direcktie naar het personeel op vlak van iemand vast aan te werven! en dat werkt wel demotiverend op de werkvloer
good,"Tupperware Brands Philippines Inc. helps me to meet to different people in the society,to adapt with the work environment, it gives me the opportunity to enhance my interpersonal skills."

good,Demonstrating the Tupperware products at the host's home working to help the host get as much free product possible putting in orders and making deliveries
good,"O ambiente e o trabalho são bons.O problema está,na forma como é conduzida a empresa.A gerencia não é das melhores,e as oportunidades são dadas sem critério algum.Exemplo : Um bom funcionário,que trabalha a 3 anos na empresa,curso técnico concluído,espera uma oportunidade.Eles dão essa oportunidade a um funcionário recém contratado que ainda está cursando um curso técnico."
good,"A typical day at work; fast paced, tight deadlines, expert change agent and always think two steps down the road."
good,"Liberté du temps de travail "
good,Je n'aimes pas l'injustice.  Une entreprise qui donne des congés des fêtes payés aux américains et aux québécois 0 congé et aucun supplément de salaire. Pourtant on nous appelle tous des associés mais traités différemment.

good,"Me parece una empresa muy buena para trabajar "
good,Empresa onde os gestores se envolvem com funcionários/tem grupinhos onde os benefícia desmotivando o restante da equipe
good,"Je hebt voornamelijk heel wisselend werk en je inkomsten worden bepaald naar mate hoeveel je hebt verkocht. Dit betekend hoe meer je verkoopt hoe meer je verdient, maar in vlagen is de werkdruk wel heel erg hoog. Je moet in principe elke week actief zijn en 'party's' gepland hebben staan wil je er wat leuks aan over houden. Fijn als bijbaan maar niet om van te leven."
good,"Toujours à la recherche de nouveaux clients "
good,A typical day at work would be fun and interaction taking place via learning and meeting new demonstrators each day.i have learnt that team work makes the dream work in most circumstances. The hardest part of the job was having to recruit new demostrators to join my team. The most enjoyable part of the job would be when i would have reached targets demanded to me and my team of demostrators.
good,Good culture and offer possibility to grow up for all that worked several hours by day.

good,Pour completer un salaire ce travail est parfait mais pas en salaire seul
good,"Starts my day in preparing a plan to hit your key indicators and provide flawless execution.  Influence your staff & dealers to support your plans, programs & activities.  One tough thing that I learned in my job is for you to have a heart in order for the people to follow their leader.  You really need to understand them and for you to become successful you must turn your people to a great one.  But the hardest part of the job is that when there's  a disconnection among you and your people with regards to your plans and the manner of execcution.  While the most enjoyuable part is that when you see your people move-up and when you see a lot of people change lives because of your influence."
good,"Trabalhar é bom mais vai depender com quem vamos nos dar dentro da empresa, com a força de vontade vou querer aprender um pouco de tudo e o melhor dia que eu acho pra trabalhar é três dias segunda,quarta, e sexta. Procurar aprender e atender mais a direção ou gerência, a parte mais difícil é você não se entender e não querer aprender com ninguém, e parte é quando você pega aquele amor pelo que faz."

good,There is a lot more to selling Tupperware then what most people think. this not a part time position even if you are looking for part time! Do your research before signing up.
good,C'est un métier très attrayant mais il est peu pratique si nous n'avons pas de moyen de locomotion. Ce métier permet de prendre de l’aisance à l'oral.
good,ne souhaite pas donner son avis sur cette entreprise
good,"Buenos compañeros, buen ambiente de trabajo, buena ubicación."
good,I was experince working for Tupperware manufacture. I got promoted from a machine operator to a machine mechanic. I didn't speak good English back then but I was treated alright.
good,"Small company in terms of total number of employees"
good,"A empresa Tupperware era uma empresa agradavel, tinha um bom convivio la, tanto com os outros funcionarios como eu, quanto os acima de mim. Sai de la, pois era somente temporario, e eles nao efetivaram nenhum dos que foram contratados na mesma epoca em que eu fui."
good,On commence conseillère de vente à domicile et on peut évoluer en dirigeant une équipe de vendeurs. Les opportunités sont nombreuses.

good,"Mon expérience chez Tupperware a certes été courte mais enrichissante. Elle m'a permis de créer un premier contact dans le domaine de la vente. Mais également enrichir ma personne, d'un point de vue relationnel."
good,"Je travaillais  au rythme que je voulais. Des assemblées ont lieu toutes les semaines, on y va si on peut étant donné que beaucoup de personnes cumulent ce travail avec un autre. Une commission se fait sur les ventes personnelles et nous dépendons d'un moniteur ou monitrice."
good,Pues salario deberia ser mas elevado por las cosas que llevas acabo en la empresa eso seria mi mayor evaluacion
good,"Learn many things"
good,"В этой конторой заведует муж и жена, если бы я сразу узнал что фирмой владеет семья я бы туда работать не пошёл, сотрудники хорошие, работы было много и мало."

In quality I like to check the product that was scanned and placed in boxes for shipping. I enjoyed my co-workers and managers. The hardest part about this job was standing up for long hours. The most enjoyable part about this job was working with the different people. It allow me to gain teamwork and leadership skills
good,Oportunidade de trabalho em várias áreas da empresa.
good,Een dynamische job voor jonge mensen.
good,"Tupperware has been a factory located in my community for over 30 years. When i came to work there in 2009, i found people from my church community as well as other familiar faces, so it gave me a much more comfortable atmosphere, which made tupperware much better despite the fast assembly line and everyone worked as a team. The supervisor was always making sure we worked in the right position from day to day, which made the day go by faster and easier."

good,"Flexibilidade no horário"
good,"lavorare per quest'azienda prevede fare consulenza al cliente finalizzata alla vendita del prodotto; si lavora principalmente tramite le dimostrazioni serali ma anche andando a fare assistenza dopo vendita alle clienti (solitamente pomeriggio e mattina). Quando si gestisce un gruppo le mattine e i pomeriggi vengono utilizzate per affiancare le nuove reclute nei primi passi di quest'attività, aiutandole a fissarsi appuntamenti, accompagnandole alle prime dimostrazioni e organizzando incontri pomeridiani per la spiegazione di dettagli tecnici, formazione, addestramento e riconoscimento del lavoro svolto."
good,"A typical day at work can be a long day but it flies by quickly as you are so busy.  It is a great place to learn about the direct-selling channel and business.  You are close to senior level management, which can be good and bad, depending on how you look at it, but I think that this is a plus.  You have the opportunity to work with many highly talented and passionate professionals.  You do wear many different hats and play a role in many different parts of the business, which is both a challenge as well as a great opportunity to learn."

good,I love working with the sales force but the Corporation has become very demanding on company owners  You're appreciated when you're in growth and as soon as you hit a rough spot with growth they start to micromanage you. This is a new trend.

good,"Travail fortement enrichissant, dans une ambiance très américaine basé sur le show"
good,Sales can be done at your own pace however you have to reach targets. Money is earned through commission. There are also benefits such as gifts for teaching certain targets.

After so many years and realizing he really cared less about me than the money I brought into the company, it was time for me to go.

good,"Selling Tupperware has been a passion since a teenager. I enjoy teaching people new ways to make better use of their time, money and space within their homes.

Giving others more opportunity to free up time to spend with family and friends, Tupperware can make life easier."
good,"I was new to this country and didn't know any one. So to make friends I thought I needed to offer something to talk to next door neighbor. So I started this job to meet people and make friends. I was self employed. If i sale more I make more. So it help me to drive to do better. So every day goal was to pick up the phone and letting customer know about new products and new hostess gift help to set up the party. I learned good customer relation- by phone or face to face, how to Demo of new products, managing my time to make it best profitable to me and satisfy customers. The hardest part of the job was when customer didn't pay me in time to pay of my bills- took advantage of pay later after they received the orders. The most enjoyable part of the job- I made good friends, learned to keep good customer relations, work as a team- with manager, other sales rep. I also started selling Avon Product same time - as most of my customers were using both products. I made good connections in the town. I got opportunities to attend good encouraging sales meetings which helped me to do better in my self employed business. I loved it."

My subordinate was very approachable and friendly, she would sometimes treat us with snacks and lunch outs with the whole team. Culture is a bit serious, since the company is always planning ahead of time on which to sell and dispose from inventory. It was tiring but a very fulfilling job even for a small time. Hardest part would be the deadlines, hard but enjoyable. the most enjoyable are number of brands the company holds, I thought they only carry Tupperware but they also carry Hanes, Wonderbra and other patented clothing and non clothing brands.
