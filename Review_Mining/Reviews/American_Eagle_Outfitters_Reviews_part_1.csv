bad,"They only give four to eight hours a week. Nothing but favoritism there. All management likes to do is gossip about other managers and associates. When there’s an altercation, management doesn’t do their job to solve the problem and expect others to do their work. Although they give pretty good discounts, it’s not worth working here."
bad,"I HIGHLY recommend you DO NOT work at this location. The management overall is awful. One of the managers has clear favorites and they’re normally the employees who suck up to her, and try to get on her good side. She shows no appreciation or recognition for the hard work expected and put in by the associates. She also sets unrealistic goals for the store team and often puts down associates if the goals are not met. Another manager abuses her management power, abuses the policies (decides when she wants to follow the policies), does whatever she wants, and makes the associates do all of the hard work. She does not recognize her own responsibility as a manager which puts a great deal of pressure on associates. The management also talks down on you, even if you are doing your job well. "
bad,"The managers are very unprofessional, biased and mistreats the employees. There's often a shortage in hours, resulting to employees not having a stable work schedule."
bad,"I applied as a part-time sales associate and was treated as a seasonal worker. I received one 4 hour shift a week when I had open availability and requested a minimum of 25 hours a week. During holiday season, the most days I would get a week is three. The managers pick and chose who to give the majority of the hours to and coworkers are rude and stuck up. After bringing my concerns up to my manager, instead of increasing my hours they decided to terminate me. Overall job position is simple."
bad,"Wost  place I have ever worked  so un professional,  they don't care about their employees, or how hard they work.  Manager was very rude and racist.  Their store was do messy all the clothes  where  everywhere in stock they didn't  know where any items  are."
bad,American Eagle was fun to work for until you get into management.  Higher ups care more about a lawsuit than they care about their staff or who they are as people.
bad,"The company is bad. They took away our lunches, started making all AE employees work over time every weekend. Alot of discrimanation happens. Alot of favoritism happens here. The supervisors try to bully employees. It bad there fast. The supervisors tell you if you dont like what they are doing then go find another job. Supervisors will stalk you on the floor."
bad,There is know sense  of worth the people are 90% Spanish it's just a very uncomfortable  place to work. If you are caucasian the steel from you and treat you very mk disrespectful
bad,"Working at American Eagle Outfitters in the Charleston Town Center, is a negative work environment as a whole. The management is terrible, there is no professionalism within this company. The management and corporate supervisors pick and choose how to treat their employees and which employees will be compensated and treated fairly.The hardest part of this job is going to work everyday and feeling like you're never treated fairly or compensated for your hard work. Be prepared to be paid for doing one job, even when the managers want you to pick up other associates slack because they quit. A typical work day isn't very difficult at all, just depends on your management and what your job is. Most definitely would not recommend working for this company at any location."
bad,"American Eagle Outfitters has been in a slow decline over the past few years, all thanks to hiring an inexperienced workforce while paying them the lowest wages in the sector. It is worth noting that they expect you to change availability on a whim, even when availability has been set at other jobs (in which you have to work due to no hours). The managers constantly talk down to the associates and HR is beyond useless when it comes to addressing any concerns."
bad,"Goals are unrealistic at the Paramus store.. $10,000 in 2 minutes LOL I was racially targeted all the time by the head manager and it was overall a horrible experience. I really got offended when I wore the lil Wayne merch and she pressed me asking if I paid for it until another manager defended me because she rang me out for it .. She let the suburban kids go to Starbucks in the middle of their shift when everyone else wouldn’t get their break and would end up cleaning after everyone else’s mess."
bad,"I have been with AE since January and to this day my manager does not pronounce my name fully, despite it being addressed multiple times. Management does not value their associates or respect their availability; I often was scheduled outside of my availability in the morning, and kept well past 10pm during closing shifts. When I first started, I received a lot of pressure to work overnight floor sets, as if having open availability for mornings, afternoons, and evenings was not sufficient. Despite being scheduled for shifts that lasted anywhere between 4hrs-8hrs, I was often denied a break and was never sent home on time, and would even be asked to come in multiple hours ahead of time. I was promoted from associate to lead cashier and never given a raise, then soon after began receiving pressure to move into a stock associate position for no raise, while working outside of my availability and for longer periods of time. The management team often degrades its members behind their backs and blames the associate team for everything in the store, so there is no accountability on their own errors. Anyone that would move onto a better opportunity would be degraded upon leaving and was always to blame for any toxicity in the store. During my shifts, I would often be the only associate on the floor, leaving me to handle cash, fitting, sales floor, telephone calls, etc. all at once with no support. I rarely had shifts with other associates members and enjoyed it when I did, even though we shared the same frustrations. We did receive great discounts in the beginning, but AE has changed"
bad,"was seasonal at Aerie "
bad,"Clothes are made by 10 year old kids in a foreign country and they have to go through all these things that are still out of control,, so just watch out,, way over priced for what they pay to make them"
bad,When I first started things were great. Good management team and a hardworking staff. As time went on people were leaving and the store turned to chaos. No room for advancement even though I was experienced and no recognition. The pay was not good for a member of management. Overall the employees themselves were great and I owe all my positive experiences to them but upper management was lacking.
bad,"You’re expected to perform at level way beyond your pay. You only get $7.25 an hour. They also would frown on you taking 10 minute breaks during your shift. The discount is the only reason to get this job. You’re lucky to get more than 8 hours a week. Really, really pushy with sales goals. You have to constantly explain why you didn’t reach your goals (even when only 3 people come in the store on a weekday within an hour). Worst retail job I have ever had. I will not even shop at any AE anymore after working there. Run from this place and go to another store in the mall."
bad,Working at American eagle wasn't a big part of my life I was only there for 2 months for season and unfortunately I want one of the few seasonal employees they kept
bad,Needs improvements and lacks support for the employees needs plus the managers needs more intense training. needs better pay rate and benifits and paid sick days and benifits plus paid vacation time.
bad,Not many hours are given. I would consider this job as a part time. They dont really like to keep it employees in there longer than 6 months unless your getting them a bunch of credit cards
bad,"store manager has emotional issues and arrogance problem, store manager has favoritisms of employees, bad management, bad hours. No effect of work culture."
bad,An awful place to work. No work life balance. There is poor leadership.  The company is trying to reinvent the wheel. Not all stores fit their cookie cutter platform.  Your ideas are never going to be heard.
bad,"Management was absolutely rude and awful. Never worked with my school schedule, but then i got in trouble for not showing up even if i was in class. Had to give my manger my availability 3 different times because she would never go by it. Was also told I had to ask the customer at least 4 times if they wanted a credit card, even if they said no to me. - super uncomfortable situation, which mostly led them to getting mad at me... manger was never organized and was in mid 30s still talking badly about other workers. Even mad a 18 year old cry. PATHETIC. avoid that place at all cost."
bad,"They do not value employees at this workplace and will easily just take shifts away from you. Management is poor but the staff is great. They are overstaffed which results in no hours for employees, managers get the hours."
bad,"The only thing positive about working here was that the discounts were amazing.  Management was unprofessional, the environment was toxic.  Pay was horrible, they make you work in stressful situations without help and as long as money was coming in, they didn’t care how horrible their employees felt."
bad,"As a aerie Associate, Times Square location has had many employees leave because of very poor aerie management, poor pay, unfair raises, and rude Human Resources. It was hard for any of my workmates to stay there past a year. HR tries to hire the most people to look good for the company, but with unfair 4 hour shifts 2 days a week, Low pay."
bad,Δεν αξίζει καν. Ελάχιστα τα χρήματα. Προτείνεται μόνο για φοιτητές που χρειάζονται τα λεφτά ώστε να μπορούν να βγάζουν τα βασικά. Εργασία 6 μέρες την εβδομάδα. Υπερωρίες δεν πληρώνονται σχεδόν ποτέ. Το κλίμα με τα υπόλοιπα παιδιά σχετικα καλό. Οι ανώτεροι απλά ασκούν πίεση και λένε τα δικα τους. Χαλάει η ψυχική σου ηρεμία εκεί μέσα. Οι παραιτήσεις έπεφταν βροχή όσο καιρό έμεινα εκεί μέσα. Και λογικό είναι. Συνέχεια νέα πρόσωπα. Νέα θύματα θα ελεγα εγώ. Να σε απολύσουν δύσκολο μιας και με τα χίλια ζόρια βρίσκουν υπαλλήλους.
bad,This company rather to employ a lot of people and give short hours to each person. They also believe you are replaceable. Not a good place to work if you want to make money or be treated with respect.
bad,I hated working here! They always gave excuses about hours and lie about not having your work availability sheet. Always rushed you to clock out. Workers were kinda shady and the manager. Didn’t really want to give out the employee discounts.
bad,American Eagle is the worst place to work in my opinion. They have awful management and your job is never guaranteed. They all of the sudden stopped scheduling me without telling me anything. I went in shopping and they had a bunch of new employees and the managers acted as if they didn't even know me. Terrible place to work.
bad,"Everything in the store has to be perfect before you leave which is not the problem. The problem is the poor management. Also if you are a college student fund a different job other than this, it’s not going to pay you well and you only work 4-5 hour shifts... Thats a literal joke to me."
bad,"Simply not a fun job, management is awful besides a few of them. You can never call out of work even if you're sick or else you'll lose hours. Closing is awful you'll have to re fold every single thing in the store and if it's not perfect you'll have to re do it. You'll stay into the night and they don't care if you have school the next day. Just be ready to commit your life to AE if you decide to work here or else you would get any hours. Co-workers are cool tho."
bad,Awful management none of the managers communicated calling out was frown upon even when in a car accident emergency room or food poised they threaten to take you off the schedule couldn’t afford pay roll with the people they already had but hired new people. Couldn’t communicate about the schedule it’s when they want you to work not when YOU can. Never provide you with help when needed. Also was underpaid
bad,I personally think American eagle is a job for a young teen and I think American eagle is fair for the pay rate they give. I enjoyed the job but wouldn't recommend to someone who has to support more than one person in there family.
bad,"Extremely inflexible company with long hour work days.  They will require you to stay until 9pm most days in the Warrendale IT department. If you try to advance within the company they will sabotage your applications and terminate you.within the month.  The higher up positions are granted either by nepotism or having the stars allign.  If you consider American Eagle be cognizant of the immobility within the company and be satisfied with your current position for long term periods."
bad,"This place is a complete joke to work at would not recommend it to anyone! The management is horrible it’s just a bunch of 20 something year olds who think they control everything and everyone! Not considerate of anyone’s feelings besides their own! I have worked retail for 3 years so I understand that payroll can be slim but understand I’m supposed to have a leadership position and I get 4 hours a week if that, and no my schedule isn’t complicated I have open availability that’s where the pettiness and what feels like high school drama comes in because they pick and choose who they want to work it doesn’t matter if you’re hard working or not they don’t like you then you won’t be scheduled! Over all the location I worked at was very unprofessional and unorganized!"
bad,"management is super unorganized and immature, you’re guaranteed maybe 10 hours a week if you’re lucky. management has favorites. they don’t appreciate good work."
bad,"AE offers a fast paced work environment where you often are called on to recruit and train young associates, merchandise the store and offer exceptional customer service.  The company pushes aggressive customer service and demands exceptional results.  Frequent leadership changes and tight payroll have driven high turnover rates in the past year."
bad,"Working at American Eagle was a stressful job and it was only part time. Being on call every day was not ideal and it interfered with my personal life not knowing when I was going to be called in to work. The environment was unorganized, the employees were rude and the hours were not the best. I have worked in retail for many years and that was one of the worst experiences I've had."
bad,"this is not a good job for working mothers who live on there own trying to make ends meet. the pay can be better but there not willing to compromise, if your not a people person dont work here"
bad,"-Poor management and poor workers"
bad,"American Eagle was a steady job, ands kept me busy for 2 years. The management team was alright could work on people skills. Coworkers were amazing. It was an okay job"
bad,You don't get to work where you want. Only some people get to work in certain positions. Rude managers all of them. Bad experience working there as a student.Very stressful.
bad,"The worst job I have ever worked at and it was my very first one, sadly. Management and upper management are manipulative and spiteful to one another. They make you feel bad for taking (REQUIRED) ten minute breaks and lunches. They made you work overtime without additional breaks. They would talk down on you and belittle you (because you are just a 16-20 year old working for them, not an actual person in their eyes). They scream at you in front of customers and treat you with complete disrespect. I request every one to stay away from a job environment like this one. You do not need to settle, there are plenty of other jobs that treat you like an actual human being."
bad,Worked there for only a day and was never scheduled again. I tried to contact the manager about my schedule and was never contacted back. Many past employees say the store lacked proper management. I also was never paid for my hours I worked.
bad,"your work is never good enough nasty people to work with "
bad,The people are snobby and could care less about being honest with the customers. They just want the money. They also keep hiring new people instead of giving employees more hours and better pay.
bad,My shifts are always cut every week. They would give me 20 hours then call saying their business are slow so don’t come in. Horrible place to work for
bad,Negative environment and not worth the pay at all. Also can’t tell management anything confidential. And they are also unreliable.  Not a place I would recommend
bad,Schedule was changed constantly and they never told you when they changed it so you got in trouble for not showing up for a shift that you didn't even know about and you could work all week and they'll call right before you show up and say they don't need you.
bad,They give no warning on when you will be laid off. You just go in one day and you dont have a job anymore and are stuck trying to find a new job before bills and rent is due.
bad,"During my last few months working as a selling manager, so many company changes were made and we were expected to make a complete 360 also immediately. On top of not having support from my district manager when it came to issues with other managers on my team, my store manager left and we didn't get a new one until almost a month later, so the store was complete chaos! By the time we finally did get a new store manager, I was completely burnt out and the issues on the management team did not get solved, so I had to walk away despite building strong relationships with my other staff members. WORST COMPANY TO BE A MANAGER FOR!!!!!"
bad,"I received no training after being hired, I didn't even get an employee handbook. Despite that I was still expected to do things perfectly or else I got reprimanded. Manager plays favorite and I was expected to do most of the work while my coworkers stood around chatting and drinking Starbucks. My coworkers are super snobby and act like they own the store. Even though I worked stock I was still expected to be out working on the sales floor with no training. They didn't give me any directions either.."
bad,I didn’t lie to work here cause the company had their policies but they weren’t follow by their leaders if you don’t have a grid who’s in power then you would never advance as individual
bad,"The store is run like your in high school, its a joke. You can go from working 16 hours in a week to not working for 3 weeks.The schedule set up is a joke, you find out what your shift is a day before. Unless you have nothing going on and looking for for 25 hours a month. Move on."
bad,I finally quit this store because it was a negative environment and not good to be around. I really liked working there in the beginning when I started but I was in high school then and now it’s way too negative. Most of the associates want to quit and many of them finally am. I like my new job it’s chill and I get commission which I didn’t get their even though they push you so hard to sell and I did. I would not romecomend anyone work there in this location.
bad,this was my worst experience in regards to management and upper management. They train you well in how to treat customers but they are very berating to their own employees and it was largely due to the stores location in Manhattan.
bad,"the managers were snooty PEOPLE and it was boring. they didn't accommodate with scheduling and there was never anything to do. bALKJDkjhygbvdc,kJHBSDFKJbnf"
bad,You will start off with less than 15 hours a week getting paid minimum wage. Your shifts as a new hire will consist of only four hours and most likely closing. Don't really care about their employees only care about making money and getting loyalty { rewards and credit cards}. Not really room from growing in the company. There's better retail and better paying jobs out there for people with no job experience. Managers never communicate with each other right. Expect too much for minimum wage.
bad,"I applied for a FULL TIME sales associate position. I was called for an interview. I, along with 6 other girls showed up for the interview. We were all a interviewed at the same time, which I thought was very weird. I was hired, but so were ALL the other girls, which I found out when I went for my first day orientation when all of us were there. Then I found out that this would be part time for now and may the best girl win for the full time position. "
bad,"If you want to feel like you're back in highschool than work here, everything is very clique-ish. But overall its a decent job if you want money fast so if you are a student this is perfect for you!"
bad,"Junky cramped workspace, Managers yelling and pressing for more sales. It was very stressful and very junky. No training provided except for watching someone make phone calls."
bad,"They're rude, start off nice but totally unprofessional. When management doesn't like you for whatever reason, your whole work atmosphere changes.  Workers are nice though."
bad,Was only schedule to work 3 days a week for 5 hours. Then manager hired significant other and I would be lucky to get scheduled once a week. Overall worst experience ever will not return to even shop.
bad,"american eagle is yet another company who does nothing for its employees. If you want to work for a company who does not give you flexible hours, demanding sales quotas etc, american eagle is the place for you"
bad,They do not hire with in. Training in minimal. management was terrible. the DM also did not care about huge violations of ethics. The company tries to portray itself as very accepting and fun but does not act the same way with their employees. Do not expect hours january- july because they really only want people for the holiday and then they will stop scheduling people instead of letting them go.
bad,"During a Saturday it gets quite busy however the managers need to learn how to manege their stress and not lash it out on the employees. Constantly screaming and saying things in such a bad way to their employees as they talk to costumers is not professional."
bad,"Every time I would go in for work, I was miserable. All the managers do is stand at the counter staring at paper work while they give orders to the employees, not willing to help. When I was hired I was told that I would work between 15-20 hours per week, which was what I was looking for, but in reality it was almost 40 every week. They would STILL call me on my days off to come in even though they knew I was a full time student. And I know that almost every other employee was experiencing the same thing. They were always under staffed because the hiring manager is incapable of doing his job well but he is somehow still employed even though he has done multiple things that one should be fired for. The only perks of this job is that the other sales employees were awesome and the discounts were really good."
bad,My manager made me pretend to work when there wasnt anything to do. i would fold the same pile of shirts for four hours some days. And when someone i knew came in shopping i wasnt allowed to sell to them even though it would be a gauranteed sale of 100+ vs. the 50 dollars theyd spend buying from a stranger.
bad,"Barely got scheduled for shifts, only called in for backroom work in which i was only needed for when not enough people were there, minimum wage not motivating"
bad,I have never seen such a horrific situation as in the store I am at in Sudbury. It’s falling apart- figuratively and literally. Time for a new store to take over.
bad,"Not a good company to work for, unorganized, lack of employees, hard to move up in the company, but it's a fast paced environment which keeps the daying going by."
bad,you get free clothes when they put out a new layout. you get hours and they work with school schedule if youre in school. you can work part time or full time
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend working there to anyone. The employees, including management, are not welcoming to new employees and are not willing to help new employees learn how to do the job. They also don’t give enough hours to even to veteran employees."
bad,"American eagle as a company has to be the worst. It was the orst job i ever had, never been so stressed in my life during that time period in my life. Every check i received bounced back, management never trained or asked how are you doing, unfriendly staff. It was extremely high paced with no direction."
bad,very clique filled. If you were not in the certain crows you did not get scheduled and you did not have a good time working there. I never got hours and rarely worked past four hours a day
bad,I was scheduled only 4 hours a week. I did not want to work for gas money and needed more hours. The managers did not work with you and were not friendly.
bad,Did not work with my school schedule even though they told me they would when I was hired. Poor management and office staff. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,American Eagle was not really a job. Ever shift that was given was called and cancelled because not enough customers were coming. I only worked about 2 hours every other week. Managers never knew names or what was going on. The team wasn't helpful and expected you to know everything that needed to be done.
bad,"Not a good company to work for, no work life balance. Wages didn't come close to meeting cost of living wages. "
bad,Working here was cool for maybe the first day. Working at the mall is boring. You see people shopping and they ask for an opinion but how do you give an honest opinion without hurting someone's feelings? The managers were very flamboyant and lazy.
bad,"The management staff was rude and unwilling to help out anyone with a tough situation."
bad,Work was normally busy because it was around the hoilday time when i got hired. Management wasn't the best.  Work place was fairly diverse. The only part I enjoyed was the discount.
bad,"Very rude coworkers, breaks were OK, didn't give any hours, manager is careless, very unorganized, only pros are the discounts offered, favoritism, lack of communication"
bad,"The staff has such a large turnover rate because the store manager promises 25 hours a week or more and often lies about pay rate. No one ever the hours they were promised, they also lie to associates and managers about raises and promotions to try to get people to stay or come back from school to help them. The managers also  stand around and talk on their phones all day and expect the staff to do everything. The store manager also keeps everyone in fear on if they will be fired so that you will do what she wants."
bad,Manager body shamed me and made me feel bad so I reported her to corporate. I had to leave for awhile and the other manager was suppose to send me my new schedule but he never did. I asked 3 times and missed my shifts that week. Very horrible people to work with. No management skills.
bad,If your a High School Kid that looks to go and get money just because you'r bored at home AE is the right place to go. You'll be working 5 hours max a day and getting 18 hours lucky in the week and paid with the minimum
bad,"Typical day was trying to figure out how to work computers and find things on your own. I learned to ask for more and come to an agreement, rather then getting run over and payed way less then most. Management was non existent, I still have no idea who is in charge. The hardest part of the job was going back the next day. The most enjoyable part was seeing people i knew come in to the store to buy something."
bad,Working at American Eagle Warehouse Was an eye opener being a minority your are treated like one poor management lousy staff and honestly not enough hours guaranteed.
bad,Unless you are one of the supervisor or managers favorites you will not get anywhere with this company. Don't waste your time here. You will regret it.
bad,"I thought this job was going to be ok, but I was wrong and it was absolutely the biggest waste of my time I've ever experienced. I only got 12 hours a week and sometimes only 8 hours a week. This place is extremely sexist, I was one of two only guys working there. And the managers are rude and the stock lead was a complete B****."
bad,"The hours were given depending on sales and the number of credit card applications at the end of the day. The management at the time was very strict and did not do well with tardiness, laziness and excuses."
bad,i was just a seasonal worker they didn't even tell me i was one they just over hired and they just let me go when i was barley working there and didn't try to help me
bad,"Compensation was ok. Benefits were ok."
bad,"Do not work for this company as management can vary. Does not appreciate employees  and  avoid if possible, managers will over sell the company worth."
bad,"Didn't really enjoy it. Not a friendship atmosphere like they want to promote. The store manger was nice, & sweet. Can't say the same for other employees."
bad,while working at the company I did not enjoy having the managers being rude to me and other employees. everything had to be perfect or they would not let you go home after your scheduled shift.
bad,They care about numbers more than their actual workers who are there to make the numbers for them. Managers sit in the back while you work the floor on your own because they don't schedule more than one associate at a time causing stress and discomfort in the workplace.
bad,"This job is suppose to be for high school/college students yet most of the people that work there use it as a lifetime career! They are arrogant, take all the hours, they don't give the new employees anytime. I worked there for 3 months and each week i would only get a maximum of 10 hours! I quit because it was just basically paying for gas to get there and working for free! The manager acts like its life and death if you talk or interact with you other employees."
bad,Hopefully you don't mind folding jeans all day. It was a very lousy company to work for. Terrible management and organization. Training was very bad also.
bad,not terrible good part time gob for a kid/student. Easy tasks and good way to gain customer service skills. Average 4 hour shifts so it goes by quick.
bad,"This workplace was far from easy. I worked dressing rooms (when I got lucky enough to have more than ten hours) and it was a load. I had to get everyones names and number of items, fold thier clothes, and put them all back."
bad,Managers are always spying on you. Always need to pretend like there is something to do even if there isn't. Coworkers have cliques and work experience is just overall pathetic.
bad,"they treat employees like slaves, this job isn't worth it at all. The management is terrible, nothing is organized everyone's just blind if doing their own thing"
bad,Management was awful. I was never able to get hours because of over employment. The manager was younger which could have influenced my experience. I haven't shopped here since quitting.
bad,"we are customer first company, but the pay we receive is not enough for the job we do. we are always expected to be on top of customer, to always make sure they are happy with their purchase, and to always sale. the manager are all fake and bipolar, they treat you like if you are a child. they don't treat you with respect and the co workers act like children."
bad,"This company is terrible.  They do not train the employees, they are always looking for flaws in the employees so they can fire you.  Super pretentious company who only cares about sales."
bad,Its a great place to work while your in school. Very flexible with one's schedule.The managers and staff are amazing to work with. The hours arent half bad.
bad,Most times there was not any truth told to future employees as it was done thru staffing that was less than honorable. I worked my tail off for that full time job but only was able to train others who was hired from under me.
bad,"no hours , little pay. always called into work and you never had a reliable schedule. Wouldn't recommend anyone considering the position unless it was for extra cash."
bad,"As my first job working here was fun in the beginning, but than I started to get my hours cut and i didnt like it. Most of the managers were un-organized and sloppy, they were also very rude."
bad,They treat you like a family early on. However after awhile they judge you. Then they give your hours to someone else. I'd avoid this place at all cost.
bad,"I did not have a good experience here, the people were not kind. I was never scheduled to work, and they were really bad at communicating things to me."
bad,"I enjoyed working at American Eagle. I would print out shipping orders, find the orders, package and ship them out. I would work on the sales floor. I would work the cash register and wait on customers.  I learned a lot of different things working here. My coworkers were good to work with. The hardest part of my job was the fluctuating schedule. I did not have a steady schedule.  I would be on the schedule and did not get the hours I was scheduled for, The most enjoyed part of the my job was shipping and working with the customers."
bad,"it was horrible I hated it everything about it, the managers were disrespectful. They were not understanding of tuff circumstances."
bad,They give very few hours to sales associates and force sales promotions. It was not a very nice place to work. I would not recommend or work here again if given the opportunity.
bad,working for american eagle was not the best experience at all. From the managers with horrible attitudes to coworkers that wanted to correct my actions but ended up getting corrected by the manager for telling me wrong information. everything was a complete mess.
bad,"I hated working at AEO, everyone was negative, no one was helpful, there was always a drama, lazy people and a lot of complaints, they would even force me to stay over time or else I would get fired! would never want to work here ever!"
bad,I been working for this company for three weeks and only worked 10 hours what a waste of time and effort to have to go in and get my schedule since I can't call in and get it just to get told I'm not going to be working this week.
bad,"If you need a real job, this is not the place for you."
bad,"This job was terrible! No breaks! They call you when they have work that is available, which was hardly ever!! You stand on your feet all day in the same spot! Crazy long hours in a day and not enough time for lunch! No breaks!"
bad,"Sale, go back, cashier, changing room, and customer service. management was not a good as i thought it was. i felt like i was in a competition so get more sales and customers."
bad,"worked at the Miromar outlets in estero! managers were horrible. They were my age, and they thought they could talk to me any kind of way. I had to set them straight a couple of times. They paid okay. you got paid every two weeks. always busy. I quit because they told me that i would be working 30+ hours and that was a LIE (in my Muary voice). i couldn't tell you about the co workers because we barely even interacted due to how busy the store was. Lunch breaks were thirty mins which was fine because all through out the mall was food. I loveee the discounts Up to 60% (its varys) I learned how to sell clothes, and how to get people to buy other items. I loved how we had goals to met every time you work, because it really gave you something to do, you had no reason to not be busy."
bad,"Its okay, I wouldn't reccomend it to people to work here because management is really mean and don't care if your sick or not feeling well."
bad,"worst job, horrible management. The upper management is not behind their stores and the employees who worked in my specific store were very unpleasant and unwelcoming"
bad,This company could use some restructure towards its cultural. The management team overall isn't proactive with or about there staff.
bad,Management is not all that great. The girls act like High School mean girls. When you do not do so well selling credit cards that means no hours for you. A company i will never work for again especially in Tannersville.
bad,"a typical day at work consisted of preparing and making sure the store was presentable. I learned how to properly fold their jeans and tops, other than that I wasn't really trained which was the downfall. Management seemed fine during the interview process, but when I started they weren't welcoming at all. they never seemed to have time to properly train me. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping people pick out outfits that made them feel beautiful."
bad,"The management team was not a team. The structure overall was horrible. The store was always a mess. None of the associates respected the management team. The associates would talk bad about other associates as well as customers, on the sales floor and in front of other customers. It was a bad work experience."
bad,The Management sucks. There very rude to their workers epsically behind closed doors. i would not work there if i were applying for a job. be someplace that not only pays good (which they don't and 4 hours a week is not somewhere you want to apply) but you can be respected by customers and management
bad,"The most unprofessional and unorganized work place I have been to. The way this particular store runs is a joke and tarnishes the name of the company that it represents. The American Eagle store manager in Grand Junction, CO is a disgrace that mistreats employees and will never properly fill the management position."
bad,"American Eagle was a laid back job that consisted of working with customers on a regular basis. It was a great job to work, especially as a teenager, and the working culture was shaped in such a way that it enabled me to really learn how to approach and interact with people."
bad,"This is a job that's good if your in school not one you can live off of. My day consisted of a very uptight boss who treated me terribly and overworked me for no hours or pay. Never made more than $100, was only hired because i knew Spanish and was fired he minute i did one mistake. I personally do not recommend working here if you are Latino, its a predominately white store and i was discriminated for being Hispanic."
bad,"sales, stock, merch, floor set, customer service, etc. sales, customer service ."
bad,Management had extremely distorted expectations on absolutely no resources.  Upper field did not have a clear mindset or goal and the disconnect between stores and corporate was vast.
bad,i didnt like this company at all and i didnt feel like going in everyday to work for this company.
bad,A typical day consist of folding the jean walls and keeping the tee shirts clean and neat. while greeting guest entering and exiting the store.
bad,"they never give you any work hours and has ,way too many employees."
bad,very poor management that provide barely any hours for the employees.
bad,"always moving around, able to utilize my sales ability, help make customers days as well as learn statistics and how to produce sales and numbers. Learned management skills and assisted in training new hires."
bad,they didn't give me enough hours i was working 2days out of week which im far more quilifated for certain positions 
bad,"i opened and closed store, trained new hires, did visuals . also scheduling and ordering. kept up with sales, helped to promote staff."
bad,Was a good job but I am not interested in folding and processing clothing all day long.
bad,it was really confusing at first but it became very easy to adapt
bad,"The management is very low in people skills, there is no advancements at all"
bad,Was terminated because of my military obligated and had to take legal action.
bad,Someone with a degree and plenty of qualified skills this is not the job to take up as a part time job while finishing school. Store #535 is best for a highschool student who wants a temp job versus part time.
bad,"very separated work environment the team leaders and the supervisors do not appreciate any employee nor do they hold any value to the work that is completed by any employee whether it be a permanent employee or an temporary employee that has come to work for thru an external hiring company "
bad,"Management is very poor in this place. Favoritism is very big . If your not liked good luck moving up or even just keeping your job. Hard workers are not cared for , while lazy ones get credit and moved up. Job itself is easy and I honestly loved the actual work but this place acts like a high school."
bad,"Just a terrible place, wanted such extreme expectations, sales standards but it was you and 2 other sales associate, who are not going to make it their career, required to make sales and store pretty. On the weekends we'll have more. Floorsets would be long overnighters well into the morning on the next day. And were never compensated in pay. Scolded if we worked a long day to get the job done and shortened our next shift. I once came in for a 3 hour shift,  just to close the store due to a shortenedshift"
bad,"I am not sure if this was just my location or if it represents AEO in general, but my experience was awful. The managers were incredibly passive aggressive and hostile—just bullies. Myself and the girls i got hired with left our first 2 shifts in tears and I almost quit. Not because it was hard but because of the other staff. It was like working with a bunch of high school mean girls. They would yell at us over nothing while we were learning, insult us, randomly cut our hours..even though we had 4 hr shifts only twice a week and earned minimum wage. The only thing i liked was the discounts, thats it. Honestly the worst job i have ever had!"
bad,"Our store does not Have a SM and everything is such a mess, the associates have access as a manager and they try there best to make the store as good as they can"
bad,"You barely get any work hours working at the American Eagle on Fulton Street in Brooklyn unless you're  a close friend to the manager, so good luck with 15 or less or even no hours a week sometimes. Even though minimum wage has gone up to $15 an hour now in nyc with low amount of hours given its not even worth your time to go there. Plus they push you to borederline harass the customers into getting a rewards card or credit card knowing that most of the customers are foreigners that don't want a card in a foreign country they barely visit  to a store they barely go to. Or young people that already have rewards cards, but don't want to potentially fall into or dig themselves deeper into more debit with an American Eagle credit card."
bad,The management is either composed of young kids who don't know what they're doing or older people who constantly micromanage and bully the employees because they think we don't know what we're doing.
bad,This company is leaning towards to the ‘top corporate for its own good’ level. They used to be a leader in retail. Now their brand has diminished into a sad shell of what it used to be. Would not recommend if you’re looking for work/life balance and decent pay. Management turnover is high.
bad,The management is not helpful and they make it hard to work. Never give you breaks or care that you have a life outside of work. If you don’t care about life then this is a great place to work. They are never willing to listen to you or your issues and don’t care if you don’t get it they just hire again and fire you.
bad,"The expectations the managers have for you is too high for how much you get paid. The pay is horrible, I hardly ever got pay checks over $100. The managers speak down to you like you are not intelligent and have no respect for you. They aren't flexible at all when working with your schedule."
bad,"walk in,  greeting from management sometimes, fill out todays pointless sales goal card, that management does not follow up on, learned to ask a casher lead for help, because manager is no help. workplace culture is okay, management is professional sometimes. associates are amazing and do all the work, and manager gets all the rewards. hardest part of the job? is having to deal with an ignorant STORE MANAGER who refuses to learn and makes everybody else do her job for her. most enjoyable is the discount, and working with your fellow coworkers, they make it fun, and worth while, thats probably the reason i stayed so long."
bad,My location the managers do very little while associates are left expected to do everything else. We also get very FEW hours sometimes 4 hours a week.
bad,"To advance you need to be popular and kiss major manager booty. The manager's act full of themselves and rude and demeaning to their employees and we are hardly recognized or given appropriate compensation for our extended efforts. My manager was completely disrespectful to me upon my departure from the store, completely unsolicited."
bad,"Horrible, started of great and fun, turned into the worst experience of my life. Their benefits are great but there is never any advance and the pay was absolute garbage. Managers are meant to set an example for the store and that was what they didn't do. Only manager who truly cared was Alexandra L."
bad,Managers are very unfair. i didnt get to do much while working here. When it was time for me to leave i always had to do extra work that other workers did not.
bad,"The only benefit to working as a sales associate is the discounts they give you for their products. However, the longer you work, the more hours they take off of your schedule. Without money, there's no point of their ""benefit""."
bad,"Managers were immature, yelled at your for everything, the managers would yell at you for everything. The managers would stand around on their phones and tell you to do there work so they could stay on their phones"
bad,"Pays minimum wage. "
bad,"A typical work day at American Eagle as an Sales Associate consist of organizing store not only before customers arrive but throughout the time they are there. Assisting customers with questions or concerns were the main duties of this position. At American Eagle I learned how to put customers first and associate very well with customers. I enjoyed working with co-workers, the best part of the job would be learning new things each day, I wouldn't say there is a hardest part."
bad,"I worked in the DC, and the way they treat employees is awful! Hard work will get you no where, but if you like to suck up you will get far. They have no sympathy for you if you have a death in the family. They do not care if you are injured, they will replace you, and that is how they view you. I have never worked for a company so horrible in value as them!"
bad,A typical day at American Eagle is ok. I just dont like the pay. The hours was very short. I rarely got a chance to finish my work because of the schedule time. The mangers were really young and immature. I got along very well with my co-worker.
bad,"My manager actually got mad at me for speaking to a male coworker after we closed...and we were folding jeans like we were asked to....neither of us moved any faster once we were separated. Needless to say after the seasonal probation period, he got to stay on and I did not. Also they don't give you hours unless you're a manager."
bad,"Walking into American Eagle, it seems like a fun environment. The workers are fun and likeable. They help the customers and they make everything seem lovely, but working there is a different story. Retail is a hard job, but what they don't tell you is that the management team was quite lacklustre. The managers didn't go out of their way to help the workers, and the pay was quite bad. Hours were barely given out, yet they were constantly hiring people."
bad,"Don't work here. you can go up to two weeks without being scheduled and when you are scheduled you get four-hour shifts if you are lucky, with a pay of $8.60 per hour if you're lucky. management is constantly changing bringing in worse mangers every time. the only decent thing about working at American Eagle is the 10min breaks for every 4hrs you work(if you even get scheduled for that long)."
bad,American eagle is a good company to work at if you need a flexible schedule while balancing school . You get free clothes every so often with contest. Management is horrible and do illegal things and the pay is also horrible
bad,"Very unorganized, the hours they give a week were from 4-12 hours which i found no point.The managers would forget to give you your breaks,and when you were on your break they would be on the radio telling you how many minutes you had left. When closing shift would come to an end there where times I had to leave almost 3 hours after my scheduled shift with such a short notice."
bad,"I worked a seasonal position and worked hard, i enjoyed working there and working with one of the managers. But the other managers were rude and treated you like you were less than and the store manager who i think was a DM if i remember correctly. He was extremely mean to his employees and talked to them like we were slow. I remember loving working there but hated working with the store manager and the rude managers. after the seasonal position was up everyone quit because of how mean the store manager was treating everyone and i was even asked to stay to be hired on as full time but i left due to how badly the store manager treated me and my colleagues."
bad,"In the last 7 months the culture has changed to a negative environment, where your efforts are never good enough.  Work more is the only strategy.  The change in culture is directly related to new leadership, who I find to not be in touch with the values of the work force nor very knowledgeable of day-to-day operations. “Happy to help”, but never seems to help anyone.  I believe in AE & hope they remedy this poor hire."
bad,"poor management , not the best work experience. would not work at this location again.  the training and communication by management was lacking . was not very approachable also ."
bad,"I was given poor hours as a minor, and didn't receive fair care from the managers. They treated me poorly and weren't genuine with my work ethic. They never helped me learn new skills. I would rate the job, as a first job, at a 3."
bad,"In the interview, I have informed the store mgr that though I have mgt. experience; I was new to the program they were using (Kronos) I was told that it wasn't a big deal; that I would get extensive training, & full support from the management team. I did not receive the training that I was promised. I was pushed into the role without foundation so had to adapt. When I made mistakes because I was not trained I was disciplined/written up. There was no support/professionalism from the other mgrs. when I asked for help. The work environment breeds disrespect, favoritism, no consistent training for associates to realize their potential which affects sales. The management team seems more focused on calculations, and percentages than giving their customers quality support and empowering their employees."
bad,This is not a company you want to work for if you value job security. This company does not appreciate the hard work from its employees. Upper management does nothing to address concerns and there is no support from HR. The benefits are alright and pay is average. I would only recommend this company for someone who is not looking to advance very far and is just trying to collect a pay check and call it a day.
bad,"Really enjoyed this at the start, but the the task asked of us does not match the compensation. From over night floorsets where the time we leave is just a placeholder in the system and doesn't accurately represent what is expected to such a disregard for their own created policies it easy to feel like an idiot when working there. At times you don't know when to follow a policy and when to say forget the policies. Being there is really a dismal experience after the initial shock of the discount wears off. The tag-line of the company ( ""Live Your Life at American Eagle"") really reflects more on the workers there than the customers, you really have to have your life revolve around this job and sacrifice every other aspect of your life just to benefit from being an employee. Not worth being there after a year, and the company keeps you there by keeping a dangling carrot of a promotion over your head to no avail. They've lost a worker, and a customer."
bad,Company does not care about their employees. Only care about money. Everything from promotions to shipment is ran poorly. Nothing is done correctly and is rushed. Not a good place to work at.
bad,"Manager treat you really bad, you got over pressure every minute. they micromanaging, you will be treated as you are no worth nothing making you every min stressfull they dont know how to talk to people how to deal with situations they over work you but they dont want to give you hours or pay you enough."
bad,"The store manager was always talking badly about other people to different associates and never cared to train her associates the right way. The managers talked about each other making it a hostile work environment. The management was demeaning and rude to not only the associates but to customers. The workplace was just completely unprofessional and that was one of the reasons I left. The new MIT was very ignorant and constantly broke the rules between smoking out of the back door or not being able to count the registers the right way causing us to stay almost an hour after we were scheduled, which was very frustrating. I would not recommend working here at all unless you like drama. Most of the part time staff quit because of the management team was horrendous, which in my opinion needs to be changed because American Eagle is a great place to work at, just not this location."
bad,"I don't know if it was just the specific store I worked for or what but the management was literally so bad. They trained me in nothing. They gave me jobs to do the first week of me being there and was annoyed when I asked ""how do you do that. Very, VERY poor scheduling"
bad,Just a over all bad place to work. The workers were very judgmental and did not bother to help new workers out. Instead of helping show you when you have a question they would just say that you should already know how to do it.
bad,"I have been in the retail industry for many years and working for AEO was the worst experience I had ever had.  Management poor!  No support! long hours...working in Visual long hours no breathing time in weekly schedule.   could work 5 days straight and one day off for example eventhough you just did a shift from 9pm to 9 am"
bad,"Changes in management have completely changed the dynamic of the store. Way too much drama. They don't care about their employees. You won't get hours unless you're a ""pet"" of one of the managers. (I don't understand how they can get away with giving you one day every two weeks.) I sometimes go at least a full week without one day of work, maybe a week and a half at the most. Everyone is two-faced and fake. You'll work your butt off and get nothing for it. They never get your availability right. The shifts are at the worst times. And you'll get four-hour shifts. Closing shifts are till 10PM. Sometimes you don't get out until past 10 (even though they can't do that.) And you get terrible pay for the amount of work you have to do. Please avoid. I wish I did."
bad,"The Managers were unprofessional. They did not teach employees how to do their job, and they were uncooperative with their co-workers. Stay away from employment with this company, as you are nothing to them."
bad,"Managers wont show you how to your work, you'll have to learn from other employees."
bad,"The sales associate position is not a place to start at and grow with the company. Perfect for temporary teenagers, not for anyone with bills. Hours were variable no matter the loyalty or hard work. Work you to the bone then hire a manager from outside."
bad,"A day at work there is not enjoyable, in fact, it is completely stressful. Managers do not treat employees well. I was never trained at the site. I was put out into the store on my own without even knowing anything."
bad,"Horrible work place, best suited for a teenager. The pay is low, management treats and lets you know you're expendable. Co-workers are probably the best thing about the job."
bad,This workplace is good for teenagers starting out in the working world but for me it seemed completely childish. Everyone has an attitude that works there and a lot of the customers are mean
bad,"Extremely poor and rude management. You ask for a scheduled day off, watch managers write it down on calendar. Get scheduled for that day, then are told you never asked for it off. Was often not allowed to take breaks. In the summer have to stand outside in extremely hot weather, not allowed to get water and or go to the bathroom. manager would leave to go shopping while on the clock. not allowed to speak to other employees ever, even if asking a question you'd get yelled at over the headset."
bad,"Δουλεύω στην εταιρία 5 ωρες 6 μερες"
bad,I worked there for maybe 3  months and never really enjoyed it. Not alot of room for growth. They start you off with minimum wage pay which is almost nothing.
bad,"I only worked here for about a month at a brand new aerie store. In the beginning, I worked around three days a week. I was ok with not getting a lot of hours, as I am a student. However, it did not take long for the manager to start coldly texting me two hours before my shift was meant to start that she had to ""cut my shift"". I thought, ok that's fine, it's a new store. But it continued to happen. It boiled down to me only getting scheduled for one day that week for her to cut the shift once again. I texted back asking if I could get more hours since that was my only shift, only to be ignored. She never gave me any critiques, so apparently I never did anything wrong. This was the most unprofessional experience Iv'e had in a workplace in my entire life. I also must note that she never officially fired me, but just stopped scheduling me. I texted asking if I was still employed, but of course she did not reply. Was this her way of preventing me of filling for unemployment? I don't recommend working here if you have any ounce of maturity."
bad,"A typical day at work meant doing my very best to meet the goals I had set for myself, whether it be trying to hit a sales goal or get people signed up for the rewards program. One tiny little thing that I could've possibly done wrong would lead to my employer making me feel like an idiot instead of helping me out when i asked for help. The only benefit I gained from working there was the satisfaction I'd feel after helping out a customer and making their day."
bad,"The manager that I was given gave no one training, was super rude to everyone in the store. The way the put the schedule really messed up my other work and social life even though I wasn’t given a ton of hours. Wouldn’t recommend this job for anyone."
bad,"American Eagle is a great store and a great brand.  The management team at Ross Park mall is the worst I have seen throughout all of my jobs.  They have terrible communication.  When I first started working, I had to call three times to just talk to someone about orientation.  When I finally got through to someone they never gave me a direct answer.  Then one day they called and said I was supposed to start that day and I was already late.  They schedule you outside of your availability and get mad when you can't stay late or pick up days even though you already told them your availability.  No respect for their employees."
bad,"They conveniently have all the college kids working from 12 AM to 6AM reworking the sets regardless of any exams or classes they may have. Several times I was told to stay until 2 AM or 3 AM and ended up being there much later. The best part is, I never agreed to work overnight shifts.. Also, you don't get paid overtime, ever."
bad,"Manager has little to no respect for any associates. No shifts unless you're a new hire from his former employ. However, we normally don't find out if we even have shifts until Thursday for the Sunday (3 days away) so you can't even make plans if you have the second job you need to survive. Only bright side is that the manager only spends and hour or 2 a day working on the floor. Staff cuts on the weekend make it unbearable and chaotic, he would understand if he worked more weekends and actually came to the sales floor."
bad,"Te pintan todo muy bonito al principio y después de un mes te tratan súper mal sobre todo los de rh, hay mucho favoritismo!!"
bad,"Starting off, this was a great idea. As I met with my superiors, I noticed they lacked professionalism and ultimately only cared about themselves, not the success of newcomers or customer satisfaction."
bad,"I work seasonal here and i told them that i have a full college workload as well as a father with health issues and they keep me 2+ hours past my scheduled time many nights a week and they hardly give you time off when you request it even if it’s for a medical/family issue. The managers are rude and think they can talk to you however they want, but god forbid the managers actually do any work except boss people around. They’re nice to you around customers but at closing and talking in the ear pieces it’s like a totally different person"
bad,Stressful and nonstop for the 4 hour shifts they call you in for once a week. The management is very disrespectful and the work is not worth the pay at all.
bad,"There have been constant occasions where they have messed up the scheduling and have had no one as an opener or a closer. The people working there are wonderful, but management is very poor."
bad,"You wont get very many hours, and they lack breaks. Management isn't fair. They do not treat you with respect. I've learned that not all jobs are for everyone. Working retail is not for everyone, especially for me."
bad,A typical day is none stop work. Because of the job location very much was expected of you. Very enjoyable co-workers. Most enjoyable part of the day was clocking out. Hardest part of the day was when the store got very crowded.
bad,"My typical day would start out with calling clients to remind them of their appointments for the next day. after that was normally my lunch break then i would go back in and the morning receptionist would be leaving and i would take her spot. I would then answer phone calls, and keep dr.s on there schedules with clients and fill out new client paper work. I learned better organizational skills. my managers were really strict with me, i think mainly because i was the youngest person they had ever hired. I worked by myself a lot so i didnt really get to know my co-workers. the hardest part of my job was filling out the new client paper work because most of the new clients didnt know most of the info we needed. the most enjoyable part of my job was working in the back filling papers."
bad,"I have worked for only three days, which are just busy days due to holiday season."
bad,"The retail industry is not for married people with children.  They have really long hours and some managers expect you to stay longer than you have to because it's the culture in retail.  Face it, you'll never really have a 9a-5p (unless you work in the corporate world).  It is a very unstable ""roll with the punches"" kind of industry.  Oh yea, and forget about your holidays.  I won't have dinner at thanksgiving, open presents at christmas, or enjoy my new years eve!"
bad,"Not much hours working at American eagle. wasn't a fun place to work, customers was rude."
bad,"I personally did not enjoy working here. I felt that my job was to harass and bother people into buying clothing that they didn't necessarily want. For a minimum wage job, there is a lot of pressure from the managers, who are not always the nicest."
bad,Worst job ever. SM took advantage of her position. Scheduling was unfair and unrealistic
bad,"everything about this job sucked except the sales associates. We were all on the same page about the manager and how she did not run the store properly and only cared about herself and is very rude. "
bad,I just couldn’t with this job. I was thrown into the position with a trainer who was new herself... she was given outdated material to train me. So I literally waisted 2 weeks of my time learning old policies and procedures. Her store and my store were not the same concept... completely different way of doing things... SUPER FRUSTRATING. My Dm was no help whatsoever.
bad,"I love AEO as a company, I was so excited when I first started to work there. Unfortunately I noticed rather quickly that I didn’t fit in with the other people they hired- while I worked there I felt left out, looked down on, and like I didn’t fit the image they were going for. Hours were given to people who had either been working there for longer, or to those who became apart of the “inner circle” Management was very biased towards people who had worked there for years and didn’t give new people a chance to shine."
bad,"Let me start by saying that, as a 17 year old getting her first job, I had no idea what to expect from a workplace. But looking back, this was the absolute worst job I could've started with. "
bad,"Very unprofessional, I would never work there again or recommend for anyone to work there.  They need to be realistic with their expectations, one person can’t do it alone."
bad,The company let’s the store manager abuse employees. Upper management and HR does nothing about it. People quit because of treatment by store manager.
bad,"Some of the managers at my location were the best, they were understanding when you weren't available due to emergencies or school. The other few managers at my location, however, would be rude and look down on you just because they had a management position. The other employees that made up a majority of the team was great, up until they left due to the manager ignoring their availability and also because they had a condescending attitude to the sales associates."
bad,Was only hired to stock a new location and help set up the store. One week into it's opening me and roughly 50 other employees were immediately laid off
bad,"Work environment was very stressful, Manager was disrespectful, arrogant and rude. Pay was very low for the amount of work expected. when asking for fewer hours or more pay (it was affecting my schooling) I personally received more hours and no raise in pay."
bad,"Management is absolutely horrible, they are so negative and bully not only associates but customers! If you want a happy environment then DO NOT WORK HERE!"
bad,"Poor management, unprofessional, excessive fraternizing and contributing to the delinquency of minors. Assistant managers frequently treated as sales associates with no regard to management skills and talent offered."
bad,"I went into the job thinking I would get a lot of hours out of it. I was wrong, instead I only get one day of a four hour shift. I feel that's not worth waiting around for them to tell me when I work so I'm searching for new job."
bad,"Honestly, I loved my job up until they got new assistant managers who were nothing but rude and ignorant towards the employees. "
bad,"Typical retail job. Very superficial. Managers who are immature. Little chance for advancement unless you want to waste your life selling something that people will like for a couple months and then throw away. Sometimes it's fun. Most of the time it isn't, but you have to pretend it's fun hearing the same songs over and over for months."
bad,this location was horrible. too many two-faced people. everyone talking behind backs. broken promises i was treated wrong and unfair.
bad,"i had a seasonal job here and i was hired right before black friday. i worked that night as my first night ever, and after that i wasnt scheduled at all. i went back weekly to get my schedule and it was empty every time. finally around christmas, i walked in and talked to a supervisor. i told him i havent gotten ANY hours since black friday, and i need hours. i worked two or three days after that, then i was back to no hours. i went in January to quit because i wasnt working. they are TERRIBLE AND USE YOU FOR THE BUSIEST DAY, THEN DROP YOU. DONT APPLY THERE"
bad,"Like I said in the title, only apply here if you're out of options. The favoritism within the store means that you will not get any shifts and management is very immature. Expect minimum wage, and zero room for advancement within the company. The discount is good though!"
bad,"Poor communication from the top. For a company that is all about diversity and being you they sure don’t represent that at a company level with their employees. "
bad,"-Manager doesnt care about the staff"
bad,"This is the worst place to work at, management is horrible, they don't care about you, they just want you to show up and make them money and meet their loyalty goals. They don't pay enough for everything they make you do. If you expect to work your way up, it'll take years before they even consider it. I started off as an associate and worked my way up to a lead position, it took a long time all because a certain manager didn't like me. You're wasting your time if you work for this company, hours are all over the place and they always cut and they only add if it benefits them. They don't care about their employees at all. I worked for this company for 4 years and it was mentally draining. The position I was in was not worth what I was compensated for and it's something I regret not fighting more about. Please save yourself and don't work for this company, they use and abuse you. They see what you're capable of and they take full advantage of you and it just makes you feel bad because there is nothing you can do and you keep saying yes because you need the hours! The only good thing about this company was the discounts, but even then they limited it so much from when I first started with this company. Do yourself a favor and save yourself and your time."
bad,I've worked here for about a month and have only been scheduled once. Other than that it is an easy job with simple responsibilities. The hardest part of the job is trying to work. On top of that you start with only $8/hr
bad,"The managers here were extremely rude. They like to hire younger employees so they’re easier to push around. they act like highschoolers in the sense that they’re always in everyone’s business and like to start drama. Once one manager doesn’t like you for no apperant reason, you stop being scheduled until you quit or they’ll just take you off the payroll without notice. managers are rude and immature lol. but coworkers were some of the best people i’ve met and made longterm friendships with."
bad,"Completely unorganized, threw me into unfamiliar situations without proper training. Uncooperative management and overall fake atmosphere. If you are new to sales don't work here."
bad,"This place was absolutely the worst place I've ever worked. The only benefit was the discounts but that's about it. The pay is very low and they over hire and pick the same people to work everyday. I found myself getting a 4-5 hour shift once at month! Manager was not helpful and was rude. The hours were horrible and the work was stressful. When I came in to work, they expected so much from me. And how was I supposed to gain experience if I wasn't getting called in?! Absolutely ridiculous. Never working for this company again."
bad,"Was a great place to work, but lacking culture and job work/life balance, they would tell you to do one thing, then they would want another with out giving direction."
bad,"If you are wanting to work here just to get experience under your belt then id recommend it. If you arent, don't work here. The hours they give you are nothing!! Management was unorganized. But the discounts were good!"
bad,"learned plethora of techniques for folding and selling denim"
bad,"I'm not a fan of retail. so I hated that job. "
bad,The district here is like a high school. They will stalk your Facebook to find dirt on you for no reason. They will constantly be talking behind your back instead of trying to help you. Do not work in the Indiana district!
bad,"This was my worst job experience. I was hired at AEO an they said I would get about 20 hours per week. Well after I had orientation I kept not getting scheduled, this went on for about one month, so finally I called to see why I wasn't being scheduled. Turns out they neglected to tell me I was seasonal, they never once mentioned the word seasonal. I quit on the spot because the manager said there weren't any seasonal hours to give. Also the management was horrible and rude. After this incident I got my old job back at Hollister Co which is a much better company, I would recommend them or Abercrombie & Fitch over AEO. After this experience I refuse to shop there."
bad,As a company the organizations that they partner with are great for woman. Unfortunately there work culture suckas and they don’t care to do anything to fix it. There management sits in the back all day hanging out with each other while Brand ambassadors are working the floor alone dealing with multiple customers. They don’t train you and when multiple of the employees contacted the hotline and HR about the behaviour nothing was dine by the company
bad,"a little late in the game. I worked there (if you can really say that) a couple of months. I needed something part-time to compensate for my full time job. to be fair, I couldn't really give them REAL time during the week, so I really could've only did weekends. anyways, they were accommodating to my schedule, but then a lot of the nonsense started. I had my onboading training in mid august 2018(that was a nightmare too) and didn't get a first shift until almost LATE SEPTEMBER!!!!. I can LITERALLY count on one hand how many shifts I actually worked. I worked ONE Saturday a month and they would stick me in the fitting rooms. they never ONCE attempted to train me with the register and gave me a bunch of excuses about it, and they never informed me that I was seasonal so like a week BEFORE Christmas, they stop putting me on the schedule althogether. moral of the story, if your someone who wants to work more, or if this is your ONLY JOB but jobs like this are playing with your time, SHUT IT DOWN. quit, call corporate to make sure they're aware of the operation of this particular culture of the store"
bad,"This was a terrible company/store to work at. Management had extremely poor communication. I was scheduled only 3 1/2 hours a day, so good luck trying to pay your bills on that. Also, God forbid that you have a medical emergency because they didn’t schedule me for THEEE consecutive months after I had an allergic reaction and couldn’t make my shift for ONE DAY. I returned the following day with a note from the hospital  in hand and management became decided to not schedule me for months. Then when I was finally given a shift, it was outside of my availability. I wouldn’t even let my dog work there."
bad,"Managers  were very rude and lazy,  put all of the work on you , barely did work. Managers schedule you for days that you initially said you couldn’t work way back in your interview. They talk about customers and employees over the ear piece. Literally the worst job i’ve ever had. The hours that your scheduled for? A Complete Joke."
bad,"The work ambience to work was awful, everyone is really mean, the manager at that time was just rude, not the general manager one of his assistances, besides that they were organized."
bad,"Boring retail job, folding clothes all day, customers are sometimes not nice and co- workers are sometimes lazy."
bad,It was hard to get hours because they had to have so many people on staff at all times and the people that were there longer received more hours than those just hired. Also the store was never that busy so if you were new they would often cancel what hours you did get.
bad,the managers are extremely disrespectful especially one of the managers that goes by the name russ. They really don't know how to respect their workers and how to remember that they are still people.
bad,"I started out as part time  In the beginning,  I got only one 4hr shift in 2 weeks - until the holidays came around and I got two 8hr shifts per week. Then they would send you home if it wasn’t busy. It wasn’t worth it for me. The culture and the vision were good, the environment and management weren’t. They want you to wear their clothes but you could barely afford it with the pay you receive - unless you are a favourite and get more shifts."
bad,"Alot of unfriendly people who seem to hate everyone that is different from them. Not all were like this however majority are."
bad,"As much as I love American Eagle clothing, I cannot say the same about the Job. The location I was working for saw you as nothing but a person to push around."
bad,"When I first started working at American Eagle, it was very exciting learning how to persuade customers to sign up for credit cards and it was a challenge. There were customers who feel the need to get any credit cards, but I didn't give up because there were so many refusals, I still continued to let other customers know about how signing up for credit cards could save them more money and customers soon came around. I disliked the fact that I didn't get enough credit for everything that was accomplished while working here, but I knew there would be a better job for me someplace else."
bad,"My coworkers did not value me as an employee. "
bad,Fired me after 13 years because i was put on restrictions and couldn't perform everyday activities. They also stated that i said something bad about their company.
bad,"If you are willing to work at American Eagle and you are under the age of 18, don't. They only give you 4 hour shifts with $9/hour pay and you don't work many days at all either. They only put me into work 2 days out of the week. My pay checks were depressing and flimsy. The managers will take advantage of you and basically use you as ""free labor."" Don't make the same mistake as I did."
bad,"I left my old job for this store because I was promised hours and that I was going to be there long-term. I helped prepare the store for open and only worked 3 times out of all the months that I have been with the company. I have yet to be fired but I am practically isolated by them, and never been put on the schedule since the first time I worked a shift. I contacted the person who made the schedules and was just told that ""they have to give other people an opportunity"". I do not know if every AEO store is like the one that I am currently ""employed"" by,  but my experience with this company is terrible."
bad,"Not professional , but was decent place to work. Didn’t seem to have moral value in their employees . Had medical issues occur and needed to miss work unfortunately and wasn’t let go."
bad,"Store manager constantly harassed me in the workplace, and would start making situations up that would lead to my termination. Had to document everything the store manager was doing for a report to the labour board"
bad,"strict corporate company. Managers have unrealistic expectations, they don't give promotions, the pay is bad, it's boring, and they will completely disregard your availiablity and blame you when you can't work. Only positive thing is the employee discount."
bad,"Didn't enjoy the workplace, or the managers. I was always treated very poorly, the only pro to working here was the discounts I got on the clothes in the store."
bad,This place was to strict and i never got enough hours. I was forced to buy and wear their clothes just to work there. I wasn't able to express myself .
bad,"Only worked about a week then I quit! The management was very rude and always seemed to put me down. Only one manager was nice and she was the backroom one! They barely gave me any hours. Also seemed like they were playing favorites. Seemed like they did it all on purpose to make me quit. "
bad,Very fast paced job but the company itself has its pros and cons when working for them. Nevertheless it a very vibrant job that allows you to grow within.
bad,"the management team was immature and didnt really care about their associates, its a good place to start for a first job, but even then, they mistreat their associates sometimes."
bad,"Being a stacker/organizer was not very fun, but it was a good learning experience involving retail and all of the work put into the job. Had some fun due to coworkers"
bad,Company as a whole is not great to work for. If you're looking to redo your closet cheap get a part time job at American Eagle. The discounts given to their employees are pretty amazing but the overall job is not to great. You work way to hard for very little pay. The discount is what makes the job worth it.
bad,"i wouldn't recommend working here personally. stuck in the mods all day with little to no one to talk to. drove me insane doing the same repetitive actions all day. just my personal opinion though. not everyone hated it,\"
bad,Hated it! I absolutely hated working for AEO! I don't recommend that anybody of color work for them because they are very racist. They cut my hours down to only 4 hours of workt ime per week and had me on call without pay for the rest of the week.
bad,Work was great I received a lot of hours. Great management. I learned a lot when I worked here over the years. Made great friendships.
bad,"You are expected to do a lot more htan the responsibilities outlined in the job requirements; also required to do more than what is in your scope of duty. The upper management is fairly bad at communicating with the team and each other. Rules are made up at any point in time without any written guidelines. Human resources will not get back to you in regards to calls made on the ""AEO Hotline."" Regardless of who makes the schedules they are 95% of the time NOT made on time and given to the employees."
bad,"twelve hour shifts six days a week? no thanks, there was no job / life balance. the work was tedious and taxing on the body."
bad,"I do not like working here, the co workers are nice and I enjoy them but management is tight and very rude. They micro manage and talk down to you and make you feel small."
bad,"Employees were expected to constantly monitor the sales floor and tidy up the merchandise. Our main goal was to introduce ourselves and sell jeans. The more denim sold, the more hours you were given to work. My co-workers were very stand offish and didn't introduce themselves. I on the other hand am a very shy person, but I tried my best to introduce myself and seem approachable. Majority of the job was customer interaction and making a sale. The hardest part of the job was running around and checking to see what was in and out of stock for the customers. My manager was very friendly and tried to make the work place fun, though she was always very busy. She led the store by example. the most enjoyable part about the job was working in the dressing rooms and helping each customer get situated with what merchandise they needed."
bad,definitely a job for kids in high school you are lucky if you get 2 shifts a week.
bad,No flexibility to make any floor changes based on sales.  Mangement was clueless.  Employees were expected to crawl around on the floor to fix cash registers.
bad,I helped coustomers in fitting rooms and cash wraps. i enjoyed meeting new people everyday. The most diffuclut part was rude customers.
bad,"This is by far the worst company I have ever had the pleasure of working for. The equipment is terrible, and after you decide to not work there anymore, plan to see many bills in the mail after it's been four months! Also plan on no one having an answer on what the bill is for. Very unprofessional, there is no advancement opportunities because it is very small in new york. When you go to use your flight benefits you might end up renting a car anyway, simply because you will get bumped off numerous flights because you never have a actual reserved seat, so good luck on taking vacations. You also don't get paid near enough for the type of work your doing."
bad,"I started working there during the Holidays. It was completely crazy. Also, one of managers was a complete crazy person. I quit because she told one of my co-workers/friends that she must have an attitude because she was a Jew!!!! When I went to talk to the Store manager and tell her what happened she brushed me off. So, I quit."
bad,the job is fun but it is hard labor and everything has to be perfect. People were rude at time
bad,It's funny AE constantly fires some of the hardest working people for attendance yet some people get to take off for 3 months and come back with no consequences and their not on medical leave they just have connections within the building. If that doesn't spell favoritism I'm not sure what does.
bad,"I was hired as seasonal, and my first day was Thanks Giving. No days before that. I didn't even work 10 shifts, I got two pay checks within the time I worked there; about $99 and about $88. That's how little they worked me. My contract was from hire date to about January 22nd, I wasn't scheduled past December. I was extremely unhappy with this because I could be worked for a company who needed me for the season instead of giving me only  about 15 hours of work between Thanksgiving and the end of my contract. I lost out on money I needed thanks to their poor use of associates."
bad,"sincerely, honesty and hard working must required in order to achieve the goals.in my view, if there is lack of experience doesn't mean that deeds goes wrongs but should be learnt by mistakes"
bad,"This is long I know I’m sorry but it’s a warning to not work here!!! This is for the outlets of Little Rock location!!!"
bad,There are no benefits to this position. They make you work 40 hours a week without the benefits of actually being full time (although you’re doing the work). The pay is also absolutely ridiculous for the work demanded from you.
bad,At first excited to work here but soon to be disappointed. This place does not give enough training so you're left confused for most of the time. They also give you odd hours and and then not enough hours. Don't suggest anyone to work here.
bad,"Not a career, just something to put food in your belly, and gas in your tank in between careers. Filled with good people, but no way to make a living."
bad,"A typical day at work is slow, having to do multiple things for the manager that they could help with, having to be on the register, help customers, and open fitting rooms while the manager on duty looks at how we are doing for the day."
bad,"I learned a lot on how a business should be run, and learn about the product. But the random hours, no benefits, the store drama, and poor management are the reasons I will never go back with this company."
bad,"Not much to say about this job its a part time job for high school students. "
bad,"Not enough hours"
bad,"I was very quit, not really friendly, more like a fake kind of friendly. I didn't really learn anything I was told I would be able to learn because I went to school foe photography. management was nice until the end when the lack of communication from her. I really didn't enjoy this company at all for it to be the corporation I was very unhappy."
bad,"no job security"
bad,Okay company but I had terrible management. I was told I would never be promoted even after almost 3 years of being the most reliable and best employee you can be. Management staff was cruel and rude to employees and customers.
bad,"I barely had a social life with the type of hours I kept at this company. There was negative tensions there, plus employees didn't take their jobs seriously. Lots of theft and prison atmosphere."
bad,"A typical day included helping customers with personal shopping, ringing clothes up at the register, and general upkeep of the store. I didn't have any relationship with any co-workers. Management changed about every month so it was hard to get used to anyone's management style."
bad,Top down decision making no input except by directors.  Poor communication and playing favorites.   Management doesnt know platform but makes decisions like they do
bad,"A bunch of immature highschool kids being managed by someone trying to be the ""cool mom."" Disaster. Employees would occasionally stand on counters/tables and twerk/dance. The store manager would wad up paper as a ball and use jeans as a bat, then play baseball in the store with employees. Enough said."
bad,"No room for advancement. You don't get appreciated for your hard work. Pay isn't great and they do not promote from within, they like to hire externals and externals clean house and bring in their old employees. Great discount on products but that's the only good thng."
bad,I worked at AE from august until May of 2018. It was not a very good experience. Management is terrible. I would continuously receive 4 hours a week. The manager would not promote from within and basically ran the store into the ground. If new management was brought in I would 100% recommend this place. Its usually a very fun place to work but management made it very difficult to want to actually want to come to work.
bad,"They had lots of attitude and too competitive. They didn't care about your life, they wanted you to be there 24/7. Sometimes we would be there until 4 in the morning closing out the store and we'd have to be back at 9:45 to open. It was hard and they had o consideration."
bad,"I learned how to use a cash register and developed my customer service skills. However, management was highly unprofessional. When my seasonal position was terminated I wasn't informed. I had to contact the facility to inquire about my lack of hours."
bad,"Hours were not stable at this job, I wouldn't recommend it if you were looking for stable income. Hours can be reduced at a drop of a hat. Turn over is huge even with management. Not the best for people who don't like repetitive chores. The job doesn't change much, you just need to learn all types of clothes and how they compliment the body."
bad,"management constantly always being rude to employees, work hours not enough, not flexible with associates schedules at all, making associates stay later than their schedule time for no reason, etc."
bad,"Although i was there temporarily for the holiday season, i would have wished my experience was a little better. I found such slack in the team, they did not support one another at all. What really blowed my mine was that i knew that my position was for the holiday season with a chance of an actual part time position they did not inform me of termination, i showed up to pick up m schedule and all i got was ""you no longer work here"". This just gave me a perspective on what to expect in the future when looking for jobs but thank goodness i am currently in a well situated place where at least if there is a situation or concern i would immediately get notified."
bad,They always have you on call and or will cut your shift. The company likes to string you along thinking they will promote you but never get back with an actual answer.
bad,"Management was rude to employees, would yell and swear at employees in front of other employees and customers. Management would get frustrated when a task was not understood and instead of taking the time to explain how to do what was required, would yell and swear and make employee cry.  Absoloutly  the worst place I have ever worked."
bad,"American was a great beginning experience for me since I was young at the time. Since then I have grown to know work life balance, when there is a time and a place for fun, and priorities to run a store and make that store successful."
bad,Was not an enjoyable. Management and other employees were not very friendly. They were constantly judging employees and customers.
bad,"The company had difficulties providing employees and management time off. Also, breaks were hard to take due to lack of coverage on the sales floor."
bad,"Loading manufactured rims onto the back of an eighteen wheeler was very hot and tiring. The manager was slightly difficult to understand (not very good at speaking english). Some co-workers were ok, some were reckless and troublesome. The hardest part of my job was the heavy lifting and the heat in the back of the trucks was terrible, but on the plus side, I got my forklift training certification."
bad,"When i took this job i made it known that i needed full-time and benefits. I have worked hard, taken on more tasks than originally expected and am still part-time. There are only two people on a team of 20-30ish employees that have full-time. In order to make the money i need for my family i have to work an average of 32-40 hours a week.... as a part-time employee. I was discouraged to say anything about this because the repercussions would be that i would loose hours instead of get benefits. This is how American Eagle takes care of there employees. When a full-time position opened up the job was turned from a full-time management position into two part-time management positions."
bad,"There was just worried how much they make in a day.The hours are horrible, I wouldn’t work there again. And the pay was ok. & Too many different managers."
bad,"It seems the company, American Eagle Outfitters, is a great place to work for; however, when hired as a temporary/seasonal employee, as I was, the onsite temp agency is very disorganized and uncommunicative."
bad,"Our manager was super petty and rude.  He had no idea what he was doing, but pretended that he did.  He taught every new sales associate a different ""official"" way to fold the jeans.  Later he would come back and yell about the jeans being folded wrong.  He liked to talk about his underage boyfriend and how he would provide alcohol for him.  On black Friday, over half the associates working were new hires on their first day.  A marketing rep came to inspect our store during black Friday and it was an absolute mess.  The manager got fired, and they replaced him with another guy from outside the branch instead of promoting the female assistant manager who was so much better than the previous manager."
bad,"I would not recommend working for this company whatsoever. They do not care about their employees, and they do not listen to your needs. I dreaded going to work everyday. I was in college at the same time I was working there, and I told them not to schedule me when I had class or nights. They scheduled me to work during those times. I liked some of my coworkers, so they made working there less horrendous. You barely get paid above minimum wage, and you work Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve, however, you get paid more for holidays. You also have short breaks."
bad,"I have always admired American Eagle's line of clothing, but the one thing they lack as a company is the willingness to stop investing so much into the clothing, and focusing on their own employees. During my time at AEO, I had my fun, but the fun came with a price of no salary compensation no advancement in the workplace."
bad,I believe the store manager at my store id not effectively run the store therefore there were many problems and the employees were not supported in a way they could achieve the best results.
bad,Unorganized and not that flexible. Will schedule you for days that you have asked off in advance. You either get too many hours to balance with school or you don’t get any hours
bad,"thus having worked two years at American eagle, in the beginning to show promises of a lively environment that allow us to work and gain understanding of how it is to work. but soon overtime, management begin to show their true colors giving us a very hostile environment to work with no one on our side with giving us no room to speak up for ourselves."
bad,"It's a really stressful company to work for, management is never available to you, there's no control in the stores, your schedule says your out time is something but you don't leave until 1 or 2 hours after that until your section is clear and the store is perfect for the next day. The pay is not worth it all for so much work that has to be done and all the problems you have to solve with the guests. If you are a cashier they make you clean the restrooms, which nowhere in my contract said I would be doing that."
bad,"It's a great work environment when you're looking for relaxed place to work in with friendly co-workers, and the managers do their job well for the most part."
bad,"If people didn't buy credits cards from you, you'd get no shifts. They would not properly train you. The store's managers would always give people who work there a long time all the shifts. Why hire someone if you don't need them."
bad,This company doesn't care for their employees.  I worked many years with this company but never received a raise.  The management is not all that good either.
bad,"I worked as a ""greeter"" for most of the time, and was told that if I saw someone come in that ""didn't look like they could afford the clothing"" to recognize it, and tell my co-workers. I'm a very thoughtful person, and choose not to discriminate, so this task was very hard for me. Plus, the manager was extremely stuck up."
bad,"Did not like the store policies or the management. My break was not long enough, only 10 minutes. I did not receive many hours. The only good thing was the huge discount."
bad,"This job offers very little room for improvement, very stagnant. The management shows favoritism to selective staff members. The job doesn't offer many benefits if you're a sales associate, nor will you get enough hours for benefits, because they hire new staff members constantly."
bad,"Honestly wouldn't recommend anybody to work here. I had things stolen from my purse by other employees, and the managers didn't care because it was simply, ""not their problem"" that their employee went into my locker, into my purse, and stole my items."
bad,"It's a good place to work, don't get me wrong. But hours will start to skim to almost nothing every other week if you're part time and working after holidays. Management at my specific store sucked flat out and the workers underneath was constantly put down."
bad,"management was all for favouritism and made work environment competitive. not a fun place to work. lots of pressure to make huge sales, which was not achievable."
bad,"A typical day at AEO was one that consisted of maintaining a clean environment, promoting new inventory to customers, assisting customers, working ""graveyard shifts"" to set up a new floor set for any incoming store styles, and cashing out customers while also promoting any credit cards or reward cards that AEO offers."
bad,"It was a fun working environment, a little mis communication but a hard working team, I learned how to pace myself and how to handle rush hours. The hardest part of the job was doing holidays, but I've learned over the years how to complete my job in a decent time."
bad,"Growth opportunities non-existent. A very disorganized company with "
bad,"A typical day at work is usually productive and I've learned how to deal with customers head on at on the floor or fitting room providing advice about new trends and signing customer up for reward cards and credit cards. The management is okay, some of them are young and still are learning how to deal with the role of management. The hardest part of the job is floor sets, simply because its time consuming. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the new trends."
bad,"I loved what I was doing for the company and who I worked with but towards the end management was very negative, never positive."
bad,You work every day out of the week.  If you ask for one day off they act like it is the end of the world.  You will be working from 10am-10:30pm.  Tip money is good but not worth it if you want a life.
bad,"Greet Customer, Help with finding proper sizes, assist customers on the floor looking for sizes."
bad,"Its fun because of my coworkers, otherwise I would hate working there. We work overnight for minimum wage and sometimes those shifts are listed as 8 hours when in fact we stay for 12 hours. We're almost always shorthanded which makes the store lose customers because of the wait. "
bad,When I worked there you were expected to eat live and breathe Eagle.  My DM would often call at 7am or midnight because he lost schedules or other documents.  He would also frequently call you on vacation or days off to tell you to get into the store immediately- didn't matter if you were a days travel away.  But my DM was fired shortly after I left and I have heard that the company has changed its mentality and realized the value of the hard work retail workers put in
bad,"A typical day at work, I would be greeting the customers and helping with any questions they had. I was responsible to tell all the customers about all the sales going on that day. I learned how to keep my composure dealing with customers, because some customers will give you attitude but you can not let that affect your work day. As far as the co-workers I really did not get to know them as much because I was not working there that long. The hardest part of the job was trying to work with more than one customer at a time, but I got the hang of it."
bad,"female managers are awful, very selfish and favor certain workers and give them the good hours and shifts, others they do not like as much get treated poorly. male managers are always awesome to work with, females lack professional qualities big time!!!!!"
bad,"I really enjoy the company and the product of American Eagle, however I personaly think that management is lacking a little bit. I think they have some personal issues that need to be addressed outside of the workplace. The hours were decent however they will not let you know if your hours are going to drop and will let you go without any notice, I have seen this done to many people."
bad,"Great coworkers and some talented managers, but the company seems desperate to make money. The pressure from corporate to make cash is just unrealistic. It's hard to focus on quality of the work and service, when upper management is changing strategy way too often."
bad,Great place to work if you're young or in school and are only looking for a few shifts a week. There's really no incentive for employees that aren't on the management team. The company pays minimum wage but has high expectations for associates.
bad,"Unfortunately I did not have very positive experiences while working for this company. The management do not help with training at all, and get disappointed when you don't work to standards. The other workers were awful and did not treat anybody who didn't work there as long as them with any respect. I will credit the companies inclusion to hire those with disabilities."
bad,there is not enough oppourtunity for growth and it is only good to work for if you are into style and things like that other than that it is not a company worth working for in the long run.
bad,"The management at the Nags Head, North Carolina store has extremely poor management. The managers are rude, cruel, and show extreme favoritism. I had to resign due to getting married and moving to a new area, and the management was completely cold and mean to me about this. The managers are selfish and care ONLY about employees working as many hours as possible. At the time when I was employed, I had recently been in a bad car accident. I had been been hit so hard by the opposite driver that my car was totaled, and I had to undergo months of physical therapy. While employed at AEO, I had to request off twice a week in the morning for physical therapy. Recently, the claim for my auto accident has been closed. In order to have this claim closed, I had to receive confirmation that I missed some work for physical therapy. The managers at AEO were extremely rude and did not provide me or my insurance company with any information. Because of them, I did not get to receive compensation for the hours missed at work due to physical therapy.  The managers refused to help because I was not one of the “favorite” employees while working for the company and I later had to resign due to marriage. Instead of being happy for my marriage, they made me feel guilty that I was moving on to a new chapter of life. And then when I needed a simple “yes” to the question from my insurance agent (“did this employee miss any hours at work because of physical therapy”), the managers refused to assist me in any way."
bad,"-managers did not communicate well"
bad,The manager of American Eagle gives off a nasty aura and constantly makes you feel unwanted unless she likes you. You pretty much just greet customers and fold clothes unless you are assigned something else. If you do not interact with customers you will get in trouble. It is very cliquey as well.
bad,"This job is okay as a second or third job maybe. It cannot be your main source of income or even a part time job. It's gas money. You get next to no hours. Sometimes NO hours and then if you do it's one 4 hour shift. You don't know your co-workers because you're never in there, turn over rate is very high for both regular staff and managers which looks really bad on them. It's hard to build loyalty when every time you go to work it's a different set of people. The job itself is menial and they basically don't train you, plus you don't get to work often enough to retain anything so it wouldn't make sense anyway. The managers are super annoying in terms of forcing sales goals down your throat, it's actually sickening. You walk in and they literally tell you that you better ""make them money"" or else. It's an unrealistic expectation and it comes off as very disrespectful, especially since for the most part they just sit on their high horses and expect you to do everything. They want you to do 8 things at once while they stand at the register and yell into your ear over the walkie about the fact that you're apparently doing everything wrong. Very discouraging. You're antsy the whole time because you're going to get yelled at for SOMEthing. The store is crazy slow most of the time so I guess when they do see people they feel like they have to be on them and it's annoying. There are better ways. The whole management team needs to be re-evaluated. They need to learn how to speak to employees properly and actually do their work themselves and stop being lazy. Also maybe stop hiring a"
bad,"They might pay you decent but they don’t give any hours unless you’re a favorite. Don’t fall into the trap of the good they tell you. If it seems too good to be true, run."
bad,"During my time at American Eagle, they gave very few hours. All of my friends began to search for other jobs and quit and it didn't take me long to follow suit. I simply would get paid close to nothing because the hours provided were so scarce. On top of this, management did not guide much and did not provide a feeling of closeness between them and the staff members. Overall, I would not recommend."
bad,"They ask for to much, as a new employee i was greeted with some gossip hearing in the backgroud about other employees this could be just my place location at hilsdale mall, san mateo but the fact it happens and others employees as well mentioned the hard labor and bad attitude made them feel awful, so what i say keep yours eyes open in this job if your location is fine great but once you find fishy things i HIGHLY recommend leaving it's not worth your time."
bad,"Only good thing they ever did was teach you versatility. The management was horrible to the point where the customers called them out. General manager picks favorites and takes out his/her stress on everyone. Coworkers made it fun, but man, the managers ruined it. You’re treated unfairly and have to pick up the slack for others and even then you don’t get recognition. I recommend a different location, not this one."
bad,I worked seasonally at American Eagle and around the holiday time they have very good energy. The managers and people hired are very fun and friendly.
bad,No consistency between district managers.  Store management will set you up for failure if they want you out of there.  If you don't have the AE look you are not hired.
bad,They do NOT promote from within. They think that giving a gift card to employees for working VERY hard is adequate compensation while they give you minimum wage.  The only positive thing I have received from this job was employee of the month for February 2018.
bad,"I worked at AEO for almost three years, and do to being pregnant I was, what some might call, ""temporarily let-go"". This company terminated me without so much as a phone call or email. In the peak-sale hours of the year I would say that it was a very relaxed environment considering. However, I would not recommend any of my friends to seek employment with this company. The discounts were great, but only when you worked as a full-time employee because part-time employees did make enough biweekly to enjoy/use our discounts."
bad,Fast paced. Also felt as if you are being thrown to the wolves. There really wasn’t any training. Just expected to know how to do everything. Then when you ask questions the managers would get mad and snippy with you. Made it hard to want to go to work.
bad,almost everyday was different honestly. you don't know who you are scheduled with or what job you will be doing that day. management was very focused on meeting sales goals so you are really pushed to make a connection with each and every customer.your breaks are limited and are encouraged to not take rest breaks we are legally supposed to take. the hardest part of the job is remembering where everything is located in the store. the floor set is done often and if you aren't scheduled a lot you wont be able to figure it out before it changes again. the only real benefit is the discount..
bad,"I worked for this company a few years ago and was excited to start because it would be my first job. Little did I know how unprofessional and awful the job would be."
bad,"American Eagle Outfitters is a reliable company overall, but there are many faults that I have noticed over the years. I have been with the company on and off for over 3 years. It has always been a stable fall back job, but there have been many empty promises over that span of time. I have been due for a promotion for the past 5 months to no avail."
bad,"This is a job that is most suited to teenagers looking to work less than 20 hours a week and to receive a discount on their clothes. For some reason the more money they do in a day the fewer people they schedule so busy days are stress as the stores are usually understaffed. When the store doing poorly in sales they frequently cut shifts so you probably won't get all the hours you're scheduled. If you just need extra cash this job is fine, but stay away if you're depending on it as part of your primary income."
bad,"Being a part of American Eagles team, i learned a lot. This is was first job, so i tried to take in as much tips i could. I learned how to work with slow paste and very fast pastes. Working with different people everyday was a great experience!"
bad,"American Eagle and all of its other companies are great, yet certain locations are a bit stressful to work at. Working at American Eagle and advancing at the same company has a lot to do with seniority and favoritism. Not the type of business that would be great to work for full time or without wanting to take time to grow with the business."
bad,"Not only did i get payed a low amount i got treated awful and the store manager did nothing about it. The north conway american eagle is by far the worst and the store manager is awful at his job. It was like walking into a crazy circus. No one ever knew what to do, cared, or even listened. I called corporate on this american eagle because of harrasment! So i would recommend not applying here."
bad,"They do not care about how you feel about the job. They are very rude and judge everyone that walks into the store. They have the worst customer service and the managers will go to the office and leave one person working the floor, even if they do not know how to operate the cash register or cannot leave the front room due to people stealing."
bad,"Its literally just a retail jobl. Nothing to spectacular. They werent really giving that much hours to the newbees , but an  easy job and east money to be made"
bad,"The atmosphere at AE in the Legends Outlet is one of the worst I've ever heard or been exposed to. The management is completely unacceptable, half of your fellow co-workers are guaranteed to talk behind your back, and the pay just isn't worth the stress of going into work, or asking a question and expecting a rude reply. You should not FEAR asking a manager about something."
bad,"I worked here as a temp and..."
bad,poor management. the manager was so rude with his employees.. always made ignorant comments. always had an attitude which made the work environment a bad vibe
bad,"Not everyday was bad, most of the time the fellow employees found a way to enjoy work. The management changes consistently because of the  horrible work environment that the general manager creates. The hardest part of the job is committing so much time to the store and only being paid minimum wage."
bad,"While I very much love the store itself, I wouldn't suggest working there. The managers are very incompetent and don't know what they're doing. When I was first hired they called me saying I should've been at orientation but at the time they never told me that I was hired in the first place. So very bad communication skills. The pay isn't very good which I guess is expected working in retail and the pay raise after working there for awhile is very tiny. However they do give amazing discounts up to 80% off. They over staff and are still constantly hiring making it hard to get more hours so by the time I get my paycheck it's very tiny and not enough for my college fund. If you're looking for a first time job this is a great place to start because it teaches you how to communicate with customers and understand them more but I wouldn't suggest staying too long as you wouldn't be valued or given the compensation you deserve as we are constantly at the top of our game for the stores image."
bad,Terrible place to work! The management is very annoying and the pay is very bad. I feel that they treat people as though they are not interested in them as a person.
bad,American Eagle has horrible work practices and thrives off of hiring young unskilled workers. I was given less than 20 hours a week yet the company was constantly hiring young irresponsible people to fill the schedule.
bad,The pay is not worth the hours and the required work you put in. You do not get a decent amount of hours. Employees are not treated fairly. It is based on favoritism. The job isn't worth it.
bad,"needs more space for product"
bad,"I really did not care for the job besides doing floor sets and visual merchandising. There is a lot of things that needed to be approved, especially with management."
bad,"AE Outfitters is good for people who're young, and need a first job. 40% off clothes as an employe, but if you want more hours you have to be a good sales person."
bad,"The job was fun, you got to meet new people, and lend them a hand in finding their next wardrobe additions. I did learn the typical skills from working in retail: customer service and communication. Management was more or less condescending most of the time, and they were little help. The co-workers were the best, though. Everyone liked to have fun, smile, and crack jokes, and people were very friendly. The best part of the job was working with one of my best friends (who I met while working there), and the hardest was finding hours. In my last month and a half there, they hadn't scheduled me for a single shift. It was ridiculous."
bad,"The management seems to care less about any stock workers at any job, but especially this one. With traffic and even leaving an hour early, it was still difficult to make it to work to begin with and after break. The Main company has unrealistic goals for stock teams and the times on our schedules, in the months I worked there, I never once got off work when I was scheduled to. I worked many overnight shifts and my hours never added up to the check I received-a complaint I heard from many employees."
bad,arrive and get a headset and a copy of sales goals go out to the floor co-workers converse all day over walkie-talkies. The hardest part of the day is staying inside your zone of the store and not being tempted to leave. The best part is getting pizza at the end of the day during close we always ate and stocked as we closed.
bad,"American Eagle, is in my opinion only focused on sales and doesn't really take into account their employees personal lives to give a healthy work and life balance. They don't understand that sometimes, family issues come up that affect your personal life and work, you get over worked and underpaid, and I feel there is racism shown to individuals of color for advancement and help with your personal life. Management is not there to help with solutions to in-store problems nor do they give great customer service."
bad,I learned more advantages working here. How to treat and talk to different customers and try my best to make them feel satisfied with their decisions.
bad,"American Eagle employees are extremely rude and disrespectful, I only worked with them for three months before I quit."
bad,With the current merger management has little direction and ae is being bought
bad,Company is strict and pays poorly. Wouldn't work here again. Manager quit. Assistant manager quit. District manager was awful.
bad,Very bad about micromanaging and talking mess about co workers. Very unprofessional and shows favoritism. I do not recommend working at this company.
bad,I only got to work when there was a shipment coming in. There were not alot of hours but there was an employee discount. Management was okay but there was a major lack of communication. That was the hardest part. The most enjoyable part was that I was able to work as hard and fast as I wanted. Generally I would complete under the hours alotted to that shipment.
bad,Opening:
bad,"This place was a fun place to work in college and it provided sufficiently enough as it was, but there were clear problems from top down among the staff. There were unethical managers who stole, broke many policies, and overall just lacked a moral and ethical backbone in the name of sales and self-improvement."
bad,This Job was very straight forward come in and do your job and make sure it gets done before the store opens. My co-worker where very friends and as was will to help. Management had it downfall in communication. There was no hard part for me . I enjoyed finishing my work before the expected time period.
bad,"I realize I am older now but there were other older folks there and I figured I could do it and why they hired me is a good question. I was hired as a temp, fell which i have never fallen on the job. and departed with ill feellings on the whole experience I lasted 3 weeks."
bad,When hired they'll say you can work part-time-- about 20 hours per week. They give you between 4 and 8. Very cliquey. Easy job but don't value their employees. Many are very young.
bad,"I was a stock associate that got moved around a lot. I worked there for 2 years and never got register trained, even though they kept saying they would train me. The overnight hours were awful, and management always expected you to stay later than you were scheduled  Upwards 10-12 hour shifts for three nights in a row. The only way they’d let me leave if it was for school. Hours would consistently switch each week from 9pm-2am and 5am-12pm for regular stockchours.  A lot of negativity and cliquing in the store I worked at - only the store managemer bothered to learn my bame."
bad,Hard work to make other people look good. Stressful prep for corporate visits that criticized everything. Very rare to get positive motivating feedback to grow and improve.
bad,I was not pleased with how I was treated. I was not trained properly and was not noted that I had learning disability even though I did disclose of having one. There was poor management and lack of communication there. On a positive note I did like the discounts I got but not worth it if being treated poorly.
bad,"I was not trained even after I spoke to management multiple times. Management was not professional besides the assistant manager who had that position when I left. Every single time I tried to sit down with a manager and have a serious conversation for example letting them know that I have a lot going on, I would never be taken seriously, and would be told ""you'll be okay"". I did an overnight shift one night to do a floorset change, left at 6 in the morning just to be back there in 6 hours. The job is incredibly easy, but management was incredibly disrespectful, was not considerate at all, especially with scheduling. They also gave me opposite hours of my availability, so it was a horrible work/personal life balance. I would recommend the company. I will not ever recommend the location I was at."
bad,"Where do I start? Being a late teenager, I thought American eagle would be a great place to work. However, while there are a lot of pros to it, the cons weigh out the pros. For the pros, you get a 10-minute break after 2-3 hours of being on your shift and get a 30 min lunch break after 5 hours. This was good for me because at my last job I never really had these. Cons, if you're a guy, unless you're more feminine, save yourself and don't work here unless you really need the job. I was 19 while working here and all I did was deal with 16-17-year-old high school girls who were lazy and unwilling to do certain tasks because they were ""gross"". Management was a disaster and didn't really care what employees had to say about the store itself to attract customers. I, myself as a manager would have changed a lot. I still shop there however some customers were horrible beyond belief where I wanted to quit on several occasions on the spot. I worked in an NH store and forgetting that MA min. wage is $12 while NH is stuck at the federal min. wage, I only made $9.50/hr at AE. After the holiday hours, I got 2 days maybe 3 a week if I was lucky. My boss told me several times there were no more hours to give yet kept hiring people which really ticked me off. A manager flat out said that if we don't get people to sign up for the store credit card that we won't get as many hours which I thought was completely outrageous because we're not supposed to mention the fact that the store credit card is a 28% APR, ridiculous. There was even one girl who got a raise (WHO WAS HIRED A MONTH AFTER ME), simply"
bad,"Staff would come speak to me full face in tears how management was bullying them, two young girls decided to quit, based on their mental health. I had witnessed many unprofessional acts and made complaint but nothing was ever addressed."
bad,"For a first job, it was ok.  However, American Eagle notoriously has awful hours.  I worked there for 8 months and only worked one four-hour shift a month.  They also never trained me in inventory or check-out, which they were supposed to do.  They take you out of the system if you don't work for 1 month and don't tell you, and threaten to fire anyone who discusses issues going on in the work environment."
bad,A nice and friendly place to work. Friendly people. Only con would be that the process to apply for and secure shift times is flawed and lengthy. Overall a good experience despite hiccups.
bad,Poor Management to many Big egos with management they treat there help like they are children. All new Managers not trained at their job and they always play favorite games with people. They treat people not the same.
bad,Although I moved from a Stock associate to stock lead my hours weren't as much but I got paid more. However my paycheck was the same as me being a SA because of less hours.
bad,It's was alright i will never go back to AE the hours were to much i barely had tome for myself. Customers are disrespectful at times. to much going on
bad,"The job itself was relatively easy. However, management was disrespectful and rude to employees. Fear tactics were often employed on employees to stay past their scheduled shift time. You were also forced to buy and wear their clothes. You do get a discount but it is still very expensive. The rate of pay was average. You do not recieve any formal training."
bad,"Over the course of many years, management turnover has been ridiculously high - for valid reasons unfortunately. Sales staff are never motivated as they don’t work often, when they do, they hardly know what’s happening in the store. No sales goals were ever expected to be followed through, leadership has never been an area AEO has been strong in. Training is disappointing, very little engagement with store management during training.p"
bad,"Management was hit or miss. I had good experiences with some managers, but store managers changed frequently and there was no consistency with either their personality and work approach. There were unrealistic expectations that you had to follow, or your hours and title were in jeopardy. It felt like the workers were only stats and were given hours and respect based upon how well they did with sales and how many credit cards they signed people up for. Workers were expected to put their own lives on hold for the sake of the company, regardless of if they were part-time or managerial."
bad,"It’s better start up if you are interested in customer service . "
bad,"The company is interested in presenting a great place to work, but that is not reality.  If you align yourself to a few of the key executives you should be okay, but will need to leave your integrity and ethics at the door.  You have to experience it to understand. "
bad,"I was miserable the whole time. This loclation is connected to an Aerie store and if you work there you'll be alone for your whole shift, so good luck if you get thirsty or need the restroom, or if it's slow because you're screwed."
bad,A typical day at work would be getting bossed around by other employees and picking up random messes everywhere. in addition to the the salary is the lowest minimum wage to ever exist. 8.10 an hour. 1/5 stars i don't recommend. Mangers like to be shady and not take you seriously.
bad,"when i first started working there it was fine. sometimes you felt overwhelmed with the amount of ridiculous expectations. i felt that for the amount of work i was doing and continuous effort, i wasnt receiving any recognition so it wasn't worth the stress. coworkers were helpful and supportive while management was confusing and had ridiculous expectations."
bad,"Love the store to shop, but to work no. A&E was my very first job, the pay was only 8$. Which isn’t bad for a first job. The only thing I really had issues with was the manager. I’m a firm believer in “tear others how you want to be treated” and the managers were/are very rude to their employees. Would not recommend a&e as a workplace for anyone. Still love to shop there though!"
bad,"I would only work 4 hrs a weeks, and so were other workers. Even though this was happening management kept hiring new people. Even though I started working there August 2017 I never received training even till the last day I worked there in January 2018."
bad,"american eagle was slow paced and boring in my opinion. the pay was worth the amount of work i was doing and the hours wasn't worth it either. I did like my co workers, not necessarily my managers"
bad,"Seemingly known as a ""party"" atmosphere, far from it. Management is a my way or no way type. No collective ideas to come up with the best strategy. 0 work life balance, schedule is all over the place."
bad,"had a great time meeting new people and being able to style, and suggest new and on trend clothing. Great location, great people. it was a fun location overall."
bad,"Business not taken seriously.  Run by kids who don't seem to understand the run of a business.  Lots of call ins, dating in the store, theft, unreliable."
bad,"The management was rude and petty-- very immature for the work place. I liked the actual work, but it was very difficult to put up with the managers. Thankfully, it was only seasonal. I wouldn't recommend."
bad,"Usually I'd just do whatever they wanted me to do, even though a lot of the time it wasn't hat they scheduled me for. I sometimes 4 hours in a week, then 30 hours the next or absolutely none because they'dd forget about me completely and that was close to the end of me being there, too. Most of managers that were there when I got there I had left before I even left. I wanted to stay for managers I liked, but I knew it wasn't a good idea moving forward for me."
bad,Im still working there is a great working place is fun you learn lots of stuff and how to know different people from different areas and cultures is fun!!
bad,"favoritism which is the only way to advance. people can't advance, bad decisions; should consider to do a survey with employees to see what be improved"
bad,It depends on the days that you are there. Sometimes the day can go slow or some days it may go by fast. I learned to have patience with people. The management wasn't good it was very shady. the workplace culture was not good either. The hardest part of the job when you had to rearrange a large amount of clothes in a time period you was given. the most enjoyable part of the job was going on break
bad,"Granted the position was part time, but there were many weeks where I would receive only 3-7 hours. The manager was 100% self-absorbed- was quick to congratulate herself while pointing out flaws in everyone else's work."
bad,typical retail environment has its highs and lows with the different seasons. Company has great employee discount. but high turn over rate for managers.
bad,Was never scheduled to work even when I asked for more hours and was always scheduled to work on days I specifically requested off. The workers were not friendly
bad,"American eagle is fast paced but boring, my shifts were identical right down to what was to be said, the only thing that differed were the sales. The best part of the job was the discount by far, but as management goes it was hard to grow due to inside opinions and judgements making it hard to go too."
bad,"Typical day at work includes completing various in-store tasks in front and back.  Tasks include cleaning, folding clothes, or working the cash wrap.  Management was not very concerned with subjects not directly related with the short-term tasks assigned for completion.  Workplace culture is very isolated, so not much interaction was able to ensue.  The hardest part of the job is working during peak holiday hours.  An enjoyable part of working is the discounts and flexible hours."
bad,"The company years ago had a good culture."
bad,it was a strict job Where the managers did little to no work and left it up to the sales associate to fulfill their job duty and then get back to their own job duties. The atmosphere wasn't family orientated.
bad,"Productive, fast-paced environment with friendly associates. Managers are strict and sometimes ask for the impossible from their associates. Almost no time off unless requested."
bad,I can not tell you how many times me and other employees cried our eyes out after work because of something management had said to us. I loved working here but I hated management. If it wasn't for them I would probably still have this job!! I reported management several times and after the reports we had a work meeting where the manager told us that no matter how much we reported her she would still have this job. I just felt so belittled every time I came into work.
bad,I helped in putting this store together when they initially moved in to Tanger Outlets. In that first week I worked well over 40 hours in a PART-TIME position and receiving assistance from management was near impossible during shifts.
bad,while i had worked at american eagle i had started there from the very beginning of the store helped build the store while the new outlet was being build. while i was there the new manager was not the best one she had employes paychecks wrong giving them the wrong hours also. i am a bilingual person and was getting paid less than a non-bilingual. i wouldn't recommend working there.
bad,"management had no idea what they were doing one to another, they had no clue what to do or how to manage the people that were working for them."
bad,"worked as a packer through focus temp service Co- workers  were really great to work with and around . Focus management staff to many chiefs no communication would tell us to show up for work and then send us home some people driving a long way to come to work to be turned away and sent home when we were told there was work. No benefits , no advancement and no show up pay !!!!!"
bad,"Every step of the way we've been told by management that things will get better, but every time we see them it means that there's bad news."
bad,"Some days a re barely ok and some are bad. Employees are improperly informed as to the current goals of management which makes it difficult to envision an end result. "
bad,"All the people that I work with are great, and the management is very supportive. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping customers find exactly what they're looking for in the store. This job was perfect for me when I was still in school, but now that I've graduated my weekly paychecks don't cut it. Having hours that fluctuate from week to week is also a huge issue for me and I am now looking for something more stable. Great job for someone who is still in high school or college and looking to make some money here and there, after that the job gets very frustrating. I have worked with the company for three years and gained more and more responsibility, however and the only raise I received was when minimum wage went up each year."
bad,"i did not enjoy my time working at American Eagle, the managers are very strict and expect more than they pay you, the co workers were fine, but many times it was difficult to balance my outside life"
bad,"I worked at two American Eagle's. The first experience was fantastic; the managers were fun and caring, and the workplace was a joy to work in. My second experience was the complete opposite. Each manager was rude and incompetent in their own unique ways. They underworked almost every employee they hired and hired new people all the time. I only worked a total of 2 times during my summer job there. Lack of management is really the major issue at this retail store. I would not recommend working at this store unless you are familiar with the managers and trust that they will respect you."
bad,"Quality of clothes is remarkable; very impressed with company standards. "
bad,The most important part of my job is helping the customers that really need help. It makes all the difference between having a good day and a regular day at work.
bad,"This was just a job I took to help pay for my apartment while I attended college. It was not a completely enjoyable job because I am not a big ""fashion guy"". However I did work well and get along with my co-workers and boss. The hardest part of my job was that I had a tough time learning the ""cool looks""."
bad,Management wasn't the best but the co-workers made the day go by quicker.
bad,"The management team goes out of their way to make you feel like the most incompetent person in the room. They will chastise you for your mistakes, no matter your experience with the company (in my case two weeks), over the headset so all of your coworkers can hear, or on the sales floor so customers can over hear. Recently, they started to lock up employees personal belongings and take away the key as a consequence for not following a rule that was not only not enforced, but was never brought to anyone's attention. They also treat the customers the same way. I have had to apologize to customers for the actions of the management. Plus, scheduling hours is terrible. Every employee has a clearly written schedule on when they are available to work and when they are not. And if, which means when in this case, they schedule you when you are unable to work, it is your job to find a replacement. It was ridiculous."
bad,"I wasn't guaranteed hours even though I worked there for months, some weeks I would have a ton of hours, while the next I wouldn't have any. The co workers and management didn't really care about anybody but themselves. I did like the customers. I learned that hopefully my next job, I won't have as bad of an experience that I did here. They just didn't make me feel very welcomed."
bad,"I worked here through college because they worked around my school schedule and I didn't have to worry about finals, etc. Pay is terrible retail pay. Good discount on clothes. Managers are a joke. You will be treated poorly by customers all the time. No room for advancement when you get a higher degree or are ready to move up. They don't even have a supervisor in training type program, which is a same. As many college kids they have coming through there they are missing out on a lot of talent."
bad,Great first job but i wouldnt recommend staying for more than a year. discounts are great but management at certain locations are horrible. theres no relationship between managers and associates which makes the workplace hostile and toxic.
bad,"Hours are always being cut due to the store not making enough money. I can see why some people hate to work in clothing stores. "
bad,"A typical day at work included attending to customers, checking them out, working the fitting rooms, and cleaning the store. Some days were spent in the back with stocking. Management overall was encouraging to the employees but had no willingness with flexibility of hours and lacked in training new employees. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out what needed to be done. The most enjoyable part of the job was most of the co-workers there created a fun and encouraging work environment."
bad,"good for your first job, but overtime, they randomly giving you shifts without any explanation. they hire way too many associates and people constantly change so, don't assume that this will be a long term job. people are competitive and will try to steal your sales. managers will put pressure on associates to make goals even when no one is coming in the store."
bad,"Was very excited when I got hired. Loved the culture, meaning behind Aerie.  Then my training was confusing on what I was. also people with lack of experience telling me my lingo was wrong. Doesn’t matter how much experience you have behind you in retail, management acted like your inexperienced. And talk behind your back.  And make you feel incompetent."
bad,The company needs to hire leaders that have experience instead of hiring someone that cost the least for the company.  You get what you pay for.  Need a better work life balance for their workers.
bad,"Unbalanced workload, hours for all departments are based on sales so if one slacks off no matter what the others suffer. management gets bonuses for saving hours (common) but they will lie about how long of breaks you get or wether you get them. I was told for over a year that i didnt get a break for anything under 5 1/2hour shifts, to find out now we get 15 minute breaks for 4 hours."
bad,So many people quit because of horrible management it was a stressful place to work and you are not paid enough to deal with the customers the only good thing I can say is that the discount was nice
bad,"I think this honestly depends on your management staff. The management staff at my location was horrible. They were very degrading and made me feel like I was a child. They acted like it was a burden that I was still in school and put the blame on me for everything. I never got a raise or treated like I was valued, even though I’ve been there for a year-and-a-half now. The overall company also doesn’t value their employees whatsoever."
bad,"Incredible turnover rate and the company does not care. No benefits or recognition for staying at the company. I am the only person in my store that I started with less than 2 years ago. "
bad,Management ruined it for me honestly he was very fake and everyone seemed to hate him and he would say rude things about people who spoke Spanish when they came in and would just yell and throw fits over employees
bad,the work was really easy just a lot of repetitive work because customers would always ruin all the work that you put in. The management were very laid back but always made sure everything was always getting done.
bad,American eagle outfitters is a job that I wouldn’t recommend to almost anybody unless they were in high school or for some job experience. It doesn’t offer a livable pay unless you are a manager or higher. Hours are non negotiable once they are given to you and can only be changed when someone is willing to take them from you. Floor sets are an over night shift that can take 10- 13 hours to complete and also the only way to get a full work week in
bad,"Coworkers were the rudest I met, The location was dirty and unkempt and didn't get paid on time. Tried being friendly but the workers there were rude and unjust."
bad,Not much to say here. It was an opportunity that involved a lot of risk. Employer was not knowledgeable on the product. Requires trust between the company and customers on a more singular level than most retail jobs
bad,"The place was cool to work at at first, but you aren't guaranteed any hours. I was given a ten minute break even if I was only working for three hours which was a nice break in the shift. If you're outgoing and always ready and willing to talk to people this is the perfect job for you. If you're more reserved (and are able) I would recommend applying for the stock jobs here."
bad,Company is not American Eagle Outfitters. It was the dry van division of Frozen Food Express. Was let go 2 days after I notified them that I was going to have surgery.
bad,"Because American Eagle is so driven by policies, the work environment is productive, but way too stressful. Everything is expected to be perfect, when no one is perfect. I feel like a robot when I work there."
bad,"Depending on where you work, there is a solid chance for a lot of micro-management anywhere from other store managers or district managers. Easily leads to a lot of stress and feeling like you're not good enough for the job. Not a lot of benefits come out of working for this company as they treat you like a nobody and you're surprised if they can even remember your name."
bad,"American Eagle initially offered what looked like a good job opportunity. However, they also had unrealistic hours for meetings and store resets for students. This job would have to be your sole priority if you are to meet all of the team requirements."
bad,"only worked 7 days , never put on a full time schedule , always called at last minute to come in . i was once called to come in while i was driving to an interview"
bad,people need to work better with other here. people that work together will always get the job done and will always be ahead of others. but they can also argue and not work.
bad,"The hours are long and extend into the early morning during the holiday season. Little to no training or instruction. Every associate is responsible for customer service, loss prevention, stocking and re-stocking, front facing product, cleaning store, etc."
bad,"It was such a great experience for starters but there is no room for further improvement, the workplace is nothing but drama really which just ends up feeling the place with nothing but bad vibes."
bad,"I really enjoyed the brand culture and message, yet at that location, there were some managers that were positional leaders that had the most hierarchy, and there were other's that were production leaders that were on the lower ""ranks"""
bad,"They hire a bunch of people for a week, pick their favorites, then fire everyone else. There isn't good comradery. The managers were very serious all the time and they want you to push sales really hard."
bad,"Non-stop traffic flow. Wide customer base that included all spectrums of the community represented in the customer-base,  from tweens to parents.  "
bad,"American Eagle is a great place to shop, just not a good place to work. Management would pick favorites and work them constantly, and wouldn't work certain people like me at all because i was younger. American Eagle would only schedule me to work one day a month for three months. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"working at American eagle wasn't the best, I didn't get paid enough, the hours were in the form of 4 hour shifts, and they barely let you have time off. if you stopped to breathe then you would get in trouble."
bad,"Management was horrible. Co-workers were stuck up. If you didn't dress to their standards they would poke fun at you, if not make you go home and change. My first week I was made to do coffee runs for the managers. Discounts were nice, but not nice enough for me to stay over half a year."
bad,Your skills might not matter on this job if you do not make friends with the higher ups. They take is not what you know but who you know to the next level.
bad,"A stressful, quick paced enviorment that was difficult to advance in due to few full time positions to avoid having to pay benefits. Temporary for students."
bad,"My typical work day at American Eagle included: helping costumers find what they needed, working the register, folding clothes and running go backs.  I can now fold clothes very efficiently.  I learned how to adapt to new layouts of the store quickly and to use the complex register.  I also learned how to sell to costumers.  How to smile, greet, and offer them options so they feel valued."
bad,"The store was way too overstaffed, and as a result I was usually given less than 8 hours a week. The management was unhelpful and the customers were almost always rude."
bad,"I won't say all stores under one brand are run the same. I can only speak on the store I worked at."
bad,Worked there for a fewmonths and worked less then 10 hours throughout the span of those months.  It was a seasonal job but if the company is not going to give their employees hours then they should not hire them at all.
bad,retail is stressful as it is. but adding lack of hours and pay makes it worse. they tend to ask a lot of of their employees and managers. the task are very strenuous with constant phone calls and store visits.
bad,never was given hours management acted like they were in high school very unprofessional never steady worked overnight and never stuck to the hours never worked more than 3-4 hour shifts
bad,Over priced garbage. I only liked the discounts which made the items worth what they really are plus most stuff fades or gets stretched out. It was my first job though.
bad,I worked there 3 months and only got scheduled twice. Both times I was told I could go home early due to the store being overstaffed. I definitely learned to not work at that store again.
bad,American Eagle is a horrible company to work for. They do not value there employees. They to not properly reward them for hard work. I was not impressed by working with them.
bad,This store is no longer open and hasn't been for quite some time. But I worked for a season there as a Freshman in high school. It was a good opportunity. It taught me so much about handling customers.
bad,Unless you enjoy working in retail then there really isn't much ambition or motivation working in a retail place such as this. As far as just having a easy summer job than this might cut it for that but not for a career.
bad,They hire so many people that most of the people barely get hours. I personally worked about 4 times in 4 months. The managers were nice but if you do something wrong you're instantly on their bad side.
bad,Ever changing priorities from the top and lackluster communication make this company tough to work for.  AE fails to offer a good job work/life balance by creating harsh stipulations for time off and creating new restrictions as they go.
bad,When I started working there I thought it was going to be great well I go in and they treat me nice st first then they start treating me different asking me personal stuff. I could go all day but I'm not
bad,"working at american was very cool just learning how to sell clothes was pretty cool, you talk to its of people and i love talking to others giving a helping hand."
bad,Typical day at work was re-filling the store. Management never noticed hard work and were satisfied with their favorite employees.
bad,"learned to handle more than one task at a time. learned to speak to customers properly and help them with what they need. "
bad,"They take advantage of workers."
bad,Associates are nice you have close friendships and all. But management could improve. Their selfish and just think of themselves most of the time but not all of them are like that.
bad,"it's a lot of hours for little to no positive acknowledgement at all. You will gain good experience for the future, and there are good opportunities to move up in the company if you choose to, however, it begins to feel less and less worth it as you begin to see how much every level has to deal with..... "
bad,unproductive workplace with terrible management and unorganized system. some co-workers were rude and some were friendly. hardest part of the job was unboxing 10+ boxes in a short period of time.
bad,"There's not a lot i can say about AEO since i was seasonal. For what it's worth, it's a decent retail job, especially if you have little to no retail experience and need something to put on your resume."
bad,"Over all, the managers didn't do anything and excepted me to be every at once. The customers didn't respect me as employee at all and would leave a mess in the fitting room. The management would except me to find a replace if I requested the day off and they still worked me. Also, they were never good at giving breaks. Once on Black Friday I worked an eight hour shift and didn't get a break. Worked there for two years and never got a raise."
bad,"Typical day assisting in dressing room"
bad,during a typical day it was pretty hectic. I was definitely overwhelmed with this being my first job so it was hard to keep up with having to maintain the store and also  be compliant with the customers. Overall everyone as far as the management team and co-workers were fairly decent to work with. The management staff was a little overbearing at times but its to be expected. The most enjoyable part of the job was just being able to get a handle on engaging customers and helping them out with what they were looking for.
bad,"My typical day at work involved continuous customer service. I would fold and clean a certain zone and occasionally work the register or fitting rooms. Some of the things I learned in this job are patience with both customers and managers, delivery of the best customer service possible, and the maintenance of a desirable atmosphere for customers. My co-workers were very good at their job and would do whatever they could to help the customer. The hardest part of the job, is telling the customer that there is no more of an item in stock. However, I enjoyed the job because you get to help many people find exactly what they need. However, management is troublesome and scheduling has been a severe problem in my experience. Many times as well, customers would come to me complaining about management."
bad,My experience at American Eagle was very interesting. This was my first actual job. I learned how to communicate with customers the most. I left this job due to only getting maybe the most 12hrs a week.
bad,"I would get to work around 9pm and work till around 6am. I learned how to zone, fold jeans and shirts to industry standards, how to scan and find where an item is located, how to efficiently unbox and organize pants, underwear, shirts, hoodies, hats, belts, and glasses."
bad,"Great overal job experience, good for a kid in college or in that area."
bad,"I hated working for this company. I understand customers are priority but when you don't care nor offer employees anything besides a discount, thats a problem."
bad,"Very confused during my time there. Usually would clock in and work with customers, analyze business but training was difficult because it was not through and concise"
bad,I would dred seeing my SM for the lack of i knew he would say or do something that would offend me or just be plain rudeness comimg from his mouth. I got to get to know some wonderful people but left before a long term relationships were established because the lack of respect from management. I love the brand of American Eagle Outfitters but i would never work for ther establishment again even offered.
bad,"I enjoyed working here, but the management was lacking. I never had a ""set"" schedule. I would find out the day before what time I was going to work the following day. It was a hard work environment because nothing was organized."
bad,I only worked here for about a month than quit . hate their management and attitude  (regency)
bad,"I barely worked, because it was seasonal. All I had to do was fold clothes and greet customers. It was just a casual job, nothing exciting."
bad,"Fun coworkers, good management, hardest part of job was making sales"
bad,it's nothing more than a high school or college minimum wage job. you know exactly what you're getting into.
bad,The people I worked with were terrible and did not care about training me.
bad,A typical day at work required me to manage the entire store. I have learned how to acquire listening and managerial skills. 
bad,hardly work. 4 hour shifts. get paid every two weeks. help rude customers. rude managers and co workers. it is hard to connect with customers
bad,"typical retail job. hard work, low paying. no advancement, no full time"
bad,Hired too many people so you were lucky if you worked 3 hrs a week if that
bad,"I assisted clients with product. Assisted with picking outfits, and cashed out customers. Participated in floor sets and assisted with visuals. Processed shipment and added the product to the sales floor."
bad,Dealing with customers was not bad. The environment was overall fun. Either the management was phenomenal or extremely lacking. We had managers involved with hourly employees. They only liked to advance people that were under certain management. The pay was less than decent. The schedule was extremely flexible though.
bad,"temp paid less. They worked me for a couple months and, then tool me off for 3 weeks."
bad,"For each individual store; the workplace and worklife is what you make of it. With that said, it's a great place to be part of, but it's a lot of work. Definitely not a company where you think that all you do is fold clothes. In fact, I think they expect too much for such little wages and pay (they only give raises once a year for managers and once a year for the associates. YES, one raise one time per year). Trust me, I've been an assistant manager for years and the $$ is not worth it. Hence, why I want out. The selling part and customer service-- that's a given. You're supposed to sell clothes in a retail store. BUT, the physicality of the job and the crazy hours... (I recently worked 6pm-5am and still had to come in and work the next day). It's not worth it."
bad,"The company as a whole was excellent, however management had it favorites"
bad,Most employees were females as expected but they would gossip and Have me go work at the same time. After a couple months of this repeated behavior I’d felt fed up and left.
bad,My opinion i liked it but didn’t like it. because they barely have you any hours like 4-5 hour shifts. So i wasn’t getting a lot of money at it. Plus i didn’t like the managers because they were rude.
bad,If you value yourself and your feelings do not work here especially if you are working under the store manager she is not kind and quite manipulative she has also never run a store by herself and expects you to take the blame for things she could not do
bad,"I was a higher up in the company, and had keys to the store, as well as made decisions. The current mangers were so hard to please and work for that every time I did anything, it was never good enough. They always pointed out all the wrong in everything that I did. Also, was told that I would be given a certain number of hours because I support myself, and I have never made a paycheck that will cover the costs of living, which isn't as much as you think. I had to get a second job to cover. Communication within the team is very poor. No one is ever told anything, and shifts had been added and cut and the person was not notified. So, long story short, you are expected to be 100% perfect at everything you do, and they still won't give you the pay or hours you deserve."
bad,I would not recommend American Eagle as a great place to work. Manager would change your schedule without notifying you of it first. Workplace gossip was a huge downfall of this store. You always had someone talking about other employees.
bad,"A typical day at the job can be anything. Restocking shelves, open boxes, assist customer with fitting room duties, and cleaning and organizing merchandise and signage. Only thing I left was there weren't many hours off season. I was only getting around 10-15 hours every month, not enough to make ends meet."
bad,I found myself bored a lot of the time there. It didn't give me much freedom to think for myself or come up with creative solutions. The people worked with mostly complained about everything all the time.
bad,"A typical day at American Eagle was to greet the customers, making sure the floor is cleaned and organized. After i would work the fitting rooms for awhile then work on back stock which was always a mess."
bad,Honestly the location I was at had poor management. Also they were very childish. If they don't want you to work there anymore they stop scheduling you. They push credit wayyy too much considering teenagers shop there not the parents....
bad,I learned that the management only make decisions to better themselves and even stoop low enough to take credit for the associates work. Don't follow proper work hour procedures.
bad,"To preface this review, i would like to mention that i LOVED all of my fellow associates. I felt as if everyone was super inviting and welcoming and to this day still have so many friends from this job. BUT my experience with the managers outweighed my love for my associates and pushed me to leave. I loved 2 of the managers, one i was indifferent on, and the other two i could not stand. They were rude, unprofessional and honestly should not be able to run a business the way they do. One managers action stood out to not only me, but my peers as well."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was constantly trying to keep the clothes shoppable (neat) while attending to customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping a client put an outfit together, whether they bough it or not, of course more so if they bought it."
bad,"The problem is not the job, the problem is the people who manage it. At least is how I feel with the 2040 store.  If they were more organize and stopped giving power positions to incompetent friends the store would be better."
bad,American eagle is an overall average company. their clothes aren't that awesome anymore. Management tends to be somewhat unprofessional. Could use a higher wage.
bad,"I felt as though I had been thrown into the deep end of the pool without ever having seen water before. The manager took an exorbitant amount of time getting my paperwork together before I could start. And it was done, all they did was show me how to fold a shirt before putting me on the floor. When customers asked me questions, I honestly knew as little as they did. I would never work there again."
bad,"The leadership team has shown favoritism and lack of trying to get to know their recent employees. They schedule outside of your availability, and the schedule maker became rude when asking for a schedule adjustment. They don't explain anything to recent employees after teaching them the basics, they leave them out of morning goals, etc. I was recently told the jean goal for the day only because someone from district may be visiting. And they allow employees with seniority to be rude to new employees. The atmosphere of the store is very boring, and lacks communication between employees. I would not recommend this job to anyone, nor do I wish to give business to this location."
bad,"My time at AE was a mixed bag.. I loved my coworkers, but management was a disaster. We were constantly yelled at, talked down to, treated like children, etc."
bad,usually getting there one manager would tell me to do something then another would assign me to a different job. Management would usually just bossy associates around and just stand there and laugh with each other. Associates are overworked and underpaid. The most enjoyable part would be the discounts
bad,"Working here if fine, but the Manager is a jerk, always yelling at employees, even customers. I've watched him on many occasions acuse people of stealing, who clearly were not stealing. People don't want to shop here because he's rude."
bad,"Everything about the work environment is very unprofessional. Management included. They don’t give time off, complain if you ask for help with a task, and are unwilling to properly train their employees. Only pros of the job is the employee discount 40%-80% off, and they always honor breaks."
bad,"Your typical clothing retail job. Very low pay, only minimum wage for sales associates. No matter how good you were, there was no wiggle room for raises. Management pay now is under 30K for assistant. I was lucky to get 30K to start. Very little support from corporate. Plenty of other retailers that pay more and have less stress."
bad,"The company itself and its policies are great. The management however is very poor and lacks the care or respect to withhold those policies. A new assistant manager was hired in March and everything went downhill. This manager does not care about the store or the associates. After showing up unreasonably late every day, she sits in the back over two thirds of her shift. When I work with her i know my shift will be cut, I will run the store by myself because she is MIA, and she will bad mouth the only manager that tries to help associates. The store manager turns a blind eye to everything she does because they are friends and the sales lead has followed suit.  She treats everyone so badly, especially the manager directly below her, that I recommend anyone pursuing a job at this location to think again."
bad,"Working there was an extra experience under the belt, but the management didn't know what being professional was. Even for the process of starting to work there was a nightmare itself. Their behavior was very unethical and they talk about caring/ being considerate towards their employees and they're not. Nothing against the company, but they should re-evaluate who they hire and have in their management team. I do however recommend working there, but the experience I had with poor management makes it completely sour. At last, I had the decency to defend myself as a former employee."
bad,"American eagle is a very fun but unorganized place. The hours that are given to each person, are horrible. The people and service are great but the organization is crucial. There could be more being done."
bad,"American eagle was great at first, I would get a lot of hours which meant pay was good but then that stopped after store wasn't making the month. So it was incosistent, managers would only refer close friends of theirs to be promoted."
bad,"It was fun, discounts were great however I didn't like the management. They were very rude and not helpful at all with any questions that I may have had."
bad,"I was recently hired as a sales associate but they have given me 2 shifts in 2 weeks. The shifts are only 3 hours long. Something needs to be fixed. I love the discount the store gives its employees, but you can only use it in the store you work in. I wish I could get more hours so that I can make some money this summer."
bad,"Being the youngest employee here at the time was quite intimidating. I was a seasonal worker, too. The managers were obnoxious and very judgemental to the customers who walked in and who walked passed the store. They never put me on the schedule especially when I called to ask for my schedule, but every time I walked into the store to shop for myself, the manager would approach me and ask me if I wanted to work today. When it was time for me to leave work, the assistant manager would always try to shoo me out of the store."
bad,"After the first three months, all of the pleasure from working for this company is gone. It s a particularly ephemeral job and half of the management had left their position. Also no one really cares about this job, and they're just their for the paycheck."
bad,"Didn't learn too much, Low energy place. Not much communication with co workers. Didn't receive adequate training for the cash register. Could improve."
bad,A typical work day consists of helping customers and recovering the store. Learned the proper ways to fold clothing and ways to style outfits. The best part of the job was becoming close with the other employees and building those relationships.
bad,"My first ever job. It taught me customer service skills. Not a great job for teenager due to stress and a lot in your plate. If desperate and don't mind finding clothes every minute of the day, go for it."
bad,it was seasonal wasn't scheduled much. So i cant really tell you much. But typically you would clock in get your walkie and work in your area for the entire shift and thats about it
bad,I worked at American Eagle Outfitters in December – June 2016. I enjoyed my time working there.  My skills were demonstrated by ensuring high levels of customer satisfaction through excellent sales service. Also assessing customer’s needs and providing assistance and information on product features by asking open ending questions.
bad,"Unpredictable hours, stressful closings. Good discounts management could be better.No breaks only unpaid lunches. Dont respond to vacation requests submitted months in advance which makes it difficult to plan any kind of social life. Even after giving months notice of upcoming vacation was told to find someone to cover shifts assigned though I requested the week off two months in advance through official paperwork."
bad,communication between employees and supervisors is little to none breaks are ok but should have another one it is a very boring job
bad,"Over all it was a fun and relaxing environment. They did not issue out many hours to me. Customers were nice and easy to get along with,"
bad,"Mangers expected you to pressure people to buy, and if you couldn't convince them to buy, you are quickly replaced. Not too much to do when it isn't busy. Co-workers, depending on who was working that day, could either be friendly or just kinda prude."
bad,"This company doesn't hire base on talent or what strength you can bring to there business but they hire according to looks . Walk into anyone of there store and look at the managers and test them on basic retail skills and they don't know nothing , don't wast your time applying or working for this company ."
bad,you work long hours on your feet in a warehouse. Management is horrible especially about playing favorites and giving more hours to friends and family. Fairly simple work but rather mundane. biggest issue is they never think you work fast enough but often run out of work and send people home early.
bad,"I was a basic retail associate, I was expected to come in on time, follow whatever schedule had been sent from corporate and be as profitable as possible."
bad,"working for American eagle was my first experience with customer service and retail. I actually liked working here when I first started because I was in love with the brand. I learned a lot while working here. I learned everything from how to fold a shirt properly, to code names for different work departments. I liked the management team because you were always recognized for every little thing you did. They did a great job at praising their employees. The hardest part of the job was when we had a large amount of customers in the store at a time and we were short staffed. I really enjoyed the ensemble that the store had because we would always work together to get everything done at a much faster pace."
bad,"Its only four hour shifts, but you have to constantly be working and moving for only minimum wage. But it is what comes with working in a retail environment"
bad,Overall this was not a great place to work management played favorites with employees.
bad,"Poor management, high employee turnover, erratic schedules. Main responsibilities include folding clothing, unlocking dressing rooms, ringing up customers, and working on floor displays."
bad,"A typical day at work is usually slow, but the company of my co-workers makes up for it."
bad,The scheduling was HORRIBLE!! I would work a entire week and they gave me the complete next week off!! 2 out of the 3 managers were disrespectful and rude 75% of the time and I felt like I was paid to harass the customers in the store which I don't feel comfortable in doing.
bad,Did'nt give me enough hours or money for the time that i spent there. It was like i was working for free basically!
bad,Pay is not worth the hours.... Lots of standing and late night floor sets until 2 or 3 in the morning.... lots of work during holidays season and no benefits... only good thing was a small discount which you dont even get paid enough to use haha. co-workers were fun... management was ok one girl was a little rude on a daily basis but she is gone now.
bad,Ser mas directos con en empleado y darle apoyo al empleado.
bad,I personally was not a big fan of the management or workplace. Things were very unorganized as far as the workplace and management and my time was not very appreciated or respected. All you deal with is certainly not worth working there for the amount of money you actually make as an employee.
bad,"I worked at AEO for about three months and never worked a full shift. I was trained, then wasn't scheduled for almost two months after I informed them I had to start working a second job. After that, I was only scheduled on days I repeatedly told them I couldn't do. They always emphasized we were guaranteed a minimum of four hours a week, and I only got that in the last two weeks I was employed there. Most of the communication was with the manager(s) over text, but they only responded when it was to ask why I didn't show up for my scheduled shift (that I told them I couldn't do several times in advanced with no response). "
bad,"the managers were horrible and treated their employees like garbage. it is a very slow job, folding the exact same shirt 700 times before my shift was over was too boring for me. my coworkers also weren’t great, they gossiped too much and weren’t friendly to new people ( less than a year )"
bad,I wouldn’t recommend this job if you don’t like being stationary. It’s a very slow paced job and the managers aren’t exactly the nicest. However the pay is extremely well & the hiring/interview/on-boarding process was extremely smooth.
bad,I received little training and was unsure of what my role would entail. The low level manager seemed to run the store rather than the General Manager. Management played favorites and schedules were made according to what the loudest employees wanted. Discount was excellent and sales incentives were amazing! I hardly ever paid for anything because they gave it to us for free!
bad,I did not learn much other than how to work hard. A day at work was slow but fun somedays. workplace culture was fair. hardest part of the job was overnights. most enjoyable part of the job was people I worked with.
bad,Very poor management. Every new manager was not trained well enough to handle the job or the employees. Picked favorites and made it hard to come to work. Discounts made it somewhat worth it.
bad,"Typical day at work is kind of fast paced , i learned that you should communicate with your customers. My workplace culture is average. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customers are happy when they leave."
bad,You would typically get 1-2 shifts a week for four hours. Sometimes I wouldn't get any shifts. Pretty ridiculous scheduling. My store was way too overstaffed but the managers didn't seem to care. The work was fun sometimes but it was close to impossible to move up  if you never got shifted.
bad,Ως εργαζόμενος της ΑΕΟ εχω να πω πως πρόκειται για ευκαιρία καριέρας για κάποιον που δεν έχει εμπειρία. Αποκτά αρκετές γνώσεις που μπορούν να τον βοηθήσουν για την μετέπειτα καριέρα του και δουλεύει σε ένα πολύ ευχάριστο περιβάλλον! Ας πάμε ομως στα αρνητικά. Διοικείται από εντελώς αχρηστα και ανάξια για τις θέσεις άτομα που δεν έχουν τις στοιχειώδεις γνώσεις για τον τομέα της αγοράς. Οι μισθοί επίσης είναι για γέλια και δουλεύεις 6 ημέρες τη βδομαδα χωρίς ρεπό. Να απολυθείς δύσκολο αλλά και να εξελιχθείς εκει μέσα εξίσου δύσκολο. Αν δεν ήταν το ευχάριστο κλίμα της δουλειάς και η τρομερή store manager μας θα ήταν για γέλια.
bad,.i wouldn’t recommend someone with kids to work here st this location . Management chsnged and it isn’t a pleasure working here any more due to changes
bad,"I was a seasonal employee, as a cashier id check customers in, mention coupons, and sales going on in the sore to promote sales, and stock merchandise."
bad,"Minimal hours in ratio to availability"
bad,"I loved the store before working there, but spending 8 hours (you  should not expect to receive more than 10 hours every week) there every week for almost a year was awful. Minimum wage was not enough for what we were doing. The employees seemed to do nothing but talk amongst themselves and the managers and forced the work on the new employees. The managers had nasty attitudes and the atmosphere was appalling. would not recommend working here!"
bad,District management is horrible. Store is fun during busy season but off season and week days it is very boring. Unrealistic sales quotas. Standards are not the same store to store
bad,Loved working here but no benefits and minimum wage killed it just a simple starter job. But thd discounts for employee are amazing and we all work together like a team
bad,"Engaging and fast paced work environment,"
bad,"I have been with this company for 2 years and have not advanced at all, despite constant praise and being employee of the month several times. I truly believe its because I don't fit their ""image"" of an American Eagle girl employee. The management is iffy, the store manager doesn't really help advance people but rather goes to other managers and talks about the employees that they feel need improvement while never talking to those employees to help them improve."
bad,"Overall, the people I worked alongside were great, however, the management was very unorganized and barely got me any hours when I wanted them, but gave me hours that didn't work in my schedule. Low pay."
bad,"The benefits of this job very good, but management and higher ups were constantly caring too much about end results and not about their employees. The turnover rate is also pretty high."
bad,I dreaded coming in to work everyday. I disliked the management and the monotonous work. None of the management seemed as if they cared for the staff and there was no attempt to motivate sales associates. The manager had no qualms about berating an associate in the presence of other associates and treated certain staff terribly. The most enjoyable part of my day was clocking out.
bad,I enjoyed working at American Eagle. I liked how there was a set time to start and stop. I recieved a 15 minute break every 5ish hours. I enjoyed working with the other employees.
bad,Im glad i had the opportunity to work at a retail job and get a new experience. In my opinion i didn't like it very much but looked at it as a great working place but wouldn't go back to it.
bad,"It was pretty rare to get hours when I worked here. When I did however, I was woking almost all over. It was difficult at first, being this was my first job. It's very fast paced, and sort of expected that you're capable of taking care of your situation independently."
bad,Ive learned a lot in the last 10 years. It is a great place to learn.  The work life balance is really not there.  It is definitely all about business.
bad,"I was a sales associate for 6 years with this company, and had my share of good and bad management. The pay and hours were low, however it was a great place to make friends. Moving up in the company is nearly impossible though. I was finally promoted last year, as an assistant manager. The expectations are extremely unrealistic and I have been mistreated by both the store manager and the other assistant. I was actually cursed out by the store manager in front of my sales associates. There is way too much drama working for this company, which is why I will be leaving. I would not recommend American Eagle as a career for anyone."
bad,"good work/life balance"
bad,"American Eagle runs on a store by store basis, which consists of A team of manger's who oversee a staff of about 100."
bad,"very clicky, highschool setting atomsphere."
bad,"A typical work day consists of customer service, cleaning and folding"
bad,"AEO is a wonderful company to work for because they provide a lot of great ""perks"" including early out Fridays during the summer, a discount at their stores and online, and a young fun crowd of co-workers. With that being said they do not offer a lot of advancement within the company. I have been here for almost two years and have had a lot of fresh college students come in behind me only to be enrolled in their assistant buyer program and become my boss. I have expressed interest in a few areas only to be told something will open in the summer and now that it is summer they have decided to get rid of the position I have been preparing for since September. I have finally had enough and am moving on!"
bad,Poorly organized with very little concern for employees' work/life balance.
bad,"I was excited to start working there, was one of my favorite stores. Though I should’ve noticed a couple red flags when I had started. There were about five employees leaving the workplace, some said due to the management and the others for a better job opportunity. Over time, I noticed more and more people quitting and that management was poor. Some co workers were favored and others were talked down upon. Not so professional if you ask me. The store manager was another story. A lot of people, including myself weren’t fond of the way she would single people out in front of others and try to talk to us like we’re children. She was somewhat professional, but lowkey rude as well. Going to other AEOs around the island and asking about one of the managers, having people sigh and roll their eyes at the name, says a lot. Co workers would even opt out of mass texts to cover shifts just to avoid certain people at work. The only pros I would say are the benefits and flexibility. Good start for retail too"
bad,Always on your feet always interacting with customers and others always re-folding clothes helping with customers clean store and keep an eye on the store
bad,Lack of management and communication channels; all departments work separately and there is not enough communication to meet very tight deadlines. Well-intentioned practices in theory but the execution is unrealistic
bad,"This is a good place to work when you are in school. There are not many opportunities to grow and you will barely get any hours. Management have their favorites and if you are not a favorite, there may be no career advancements available to you"
bad,American Eagle scarred me from wanting to work for retail ever again very stressful and unfair treatment. As a young teen i felt intimidated from the other employers and it pushed me away from the job.
bad,This environment was a little more stressful than the usual American Eagle store. Unfortunately at most retail places there will always be problems with asset protection but at this store it was a little more high.
bad,Working here was a lot different than working in fast food. I learned a lot of different skills  started to come out of my shell. I was responsible for many tasks and I had a good time doing it.
bad,"I liked AEO for what it was. From the point of view of management, daily goals of products and credit cards falls heavily upon your shoulders. Even when sales were met and exceeded, not making product goal or opening a certain number of credit cards meant defeat anyway. Good gateway into other career options."
bad,"There is no workplace culture and you don't really do much in a typical day except greet customers as they come in, assist them with dressing rooms, and check them out. Pretty tedious"
bad,"Each store is different, but expect a heavy work, low life balance in management.  Hours can be pretty random, but the culture is great.  They have a great future as a company, and you have to make the most out of the opportunity."
bad,This is my only job I feel so left out. I wish I would get more hours but I am young. I have to start supporting myself and this isn't cutting it I have no money.
bad,"Although I actually enjoyed working at American Eagle, hours were extremely short. There were about 6 different managers managing 70+ employees. Yes, 70 plus workers for a normal sized store at Metrotown. Shifts were no longer than 4 hours and you may expect 2-3 shifts a week max with a full availability. Had to leave because $80 a week could only cover the cost of my weekly meals."
bad,They do not pay their managers what they are worth. DM doesn't train managers but expects them to know everything. The hours are terrible. You only sometimes get one weekend off a month IF the DM approves it.
bad,I worked for american eagle for roughly 2 months in that time i had only 3 shifts that were meant to be 4 hour all turned into 8 hour-10 hour shifts. besides that the discounts were amazing!
bad,"although i was only there seasonal, some of the managers were kind of mean and intense. the pay was terrible and the hours are crazy, it was pretty fast paced. there were no benefits unless you were a manger."
bad,"I loved this brand, was a very loyal customer and decided it might be a good idea to work at AE. Unfortunately it wasn't what I anticipated. The pay was low and expected, but I was hoping for more hours, Unfortunately my job schedule was extremely random. The only part of this job I like was customer service; being able to getting to know customers and help them in any way I could."
bad,"Greet customers and determine their wants and needs. Describe quality, number and type of the merchandise. Recommend merchandise that would work for customers. Explain deals and prices to each customer. Also assist the dressing room and cash & wrap."
bad,"i started at the same time as a CEO transition, the transition was not smooth and the CEO did not stay long with company."
bad,put up freight all day on a timely basis had to meet time lines
bad,"American Eagle is a tough company to work with in my experience. As far as I can recall, it was an error in judgment to work for such a corporation/"
bad,"Since I worked seasonal, I usually worked at night. I would have get there during the day and have to fold all the clothes again, do put-backs, and stay at night until at least one in the morning. I learned how to be really patient. Management was way too strict about things, but my co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part was to make sure I did not get too frustrated with everything, but I really liked being able to meet new people on the job."
bad,More of a job than a career move... I enjoyed my time with AE. It was a good opportunity to learn the in's and out's of management in a retail store.
bad,"the job would be great if the store manager would balance out the duties between managers but does not. The store is left for only the assistant manger and keyholder while the store manager does nothing,"
bad,At this job I worked about one day a week and for only about 5 hours a shift. That was only 20 hours in a month. This was just a seasonal job. This was maybe the worst job I had.
bad,Do not give you the tools to be successful. Very clicky work environment.
bad,Some managers go over and beyond on trying to make their sales which is very understandable but there is always that one manager that pushes it too hard and if you don't make the sale then he gets really angry.
bad,American eagle was an  exciting place  you always  busy  they make sure you have something  to do .They have good since of style .It's a very popular place
bad,"Promoting within the company is not common.  Many times new managers/leads are brought in from other companies, often with no past experience working with American Eagle.  Work can be stressful and a lot is expected of part-time employees with not many benefits and often no raises."
bad,"The store manager is unprofessional at times. Acts on personally feelings towards a person, is extremely passive aggressive and rude. "
bad,A typical day at american eagle warehouse consisted of filling boxes with merchandise to be shipped out. I learned how to multitask and work hard. The work place culture was great.
bad,"The worst thing about this place was the pressure to get sales for the month and how uncomfortable it was to get the credit cards, or rewards card. If you weren't extremely persuasive you would be scolded, which made me not like management and caused me to leave."
bad,They never give you time to learn and if you mess up one time then they don’t try to help you with it or help you learn they just won’t let you work again and you barely get any hours.
bad,"Working here was uncomfortable. The hours they put in for my schedule were different from the actual hours I was working. I was asked to stay longer many times and did because I needed the job and the money. The management was poor and so was the organization of the store. Fitting rooms were a mess, and the sales floor was decently organized. It's a fast paced environment and it's entertaining sometimes to work with my co-workers, however the managers were quite rude and would even lecture me for helping my co-workers. I only helped my co-workers with simple issues such as going back to the main screen, coupon codes, and how to do other basic things they may have forgotten while the managers were actually BUSY doing other tasks. I was trying to help my managers but I guess that wasn't working for them. The pay was not worth it. Many co-workers told me that they had not recevied any pay raise even though they worked there for 3+ years. Managers would nag associates to overreach credit card and reward card goals, sometimes setting some impossible goals to reach. The only good benefit was maybe the 40% off discount that they gave us but it didn't really help much when most the clothes cost around an average of $50-60. It's not worth it to work somewhere here unless you get paid like $8-9/hr."
bad,At the beginning it was great! Wonderful coworkers and a great discount. But soon learned you hardly ever work and when you do its only for a few hours. Definitely not worth the gas to drive just to work for 4 hours and only 1 day out of the week at that. Its overall a stressful job and the management is no help at all.
bad,"I personally wouldn't recommend this job if you are looking for excitement or something more fun and energetic. Typically you fold clothes and greet and help customers. This store wasn't that busy, only when it was certain sales. I learned how to deal with all types of customers from all over and help them out."
bad,Never was scheduled to work that much. Pay was terrible. No one tried to teach new employers on what to do exactly. Management was terrible. The manager ended up getting. Always asked to work over time but not get paid for it.
bad,Stock room was a cool place to work. Really don't have anyone micromanaging you which gives you more focus to get your work done right and in a timely fashion. Overall good experience.
bad,Where can I get American Eagle is a good first job but not for a long-term. It's very fast-paced in time demanding and very strict and they do not appreciate all the work that you do I am currently the credit Captain I get more credit than anybody there because you have to get a certain number amount of credit cards a day and I still don't get anything for all my hard work
bad,"Working here has been a mistake but it helps me pay the bills. The managers tend to not communicate with each other and the schedule will become an entire mess with working on day offs, or not being scheduled an entire week and then they beg you to come in. Its not a good place to work, or maybe its just not my type of work, the pay is not worth the work."
bad,"Work in an environment where lab associates are exposed to the culture and industry of retail on all levels.  This includes behind the scenes of shipment, pricing and marketing and how it effects the product of the company."
bad,"It was an ok place to work. -- just that. Childish associates. The only good thing about being here is being apart of a fabulous brand. You don't get a permanent or set schedule. "
bad,Over worked and  under appreciated staff. We worked hard long hours for minimal pay . They have floor sets which required us to stay after mall hours until early morning hours to change the floor plan. Then would have to come in at least two to three hours that same day. It was very hard to move up in the company. Aside from that I worked with great people who made the work day enjoyable and all were helpful.
bad,"The most fulfilling part of your job is helping people develop their own personal style. Most of your customers are there because they love the jeans and want to branch out and helping them develop is a great feeling. Unfortunately working their has downsides. While scheduling is flexible, they schedule Sunday to Saturday, and do not post the next week's schedule until the Wednesday or Thursday before. You will be pressured to get as many people as humanly possible to sign up for the company credit card. It feels almost predatory and it hurts to watch people get declined, or worse plunge people into debt. The company pays the bare minimum it has to, and management almost tricks employees (mostly kids) into giving up their rights to certain employment laws. Your life revolves around the store and customers are often nasty."
bad,You make barely minimum wage and work so much including over night shifts that you don’t get paid extra for. Not a terrible place to start but we definitely worked hard enough to make more money then we did
bad,"For such a huge company that’s thriving within the retail world I believe it cares so little about its employees from lower pay low removing discounts it once offered to its high stressful demands on the management with little resources or solutions to which the company or dm in this With zero to little work balance, was astounded with such a huge company and what happens within its walls."
bad,"I was very thankful for an opportunity with American Eagle and it's a great stepping stone but the hours were terrible, the management was sub-par and the pay was not sufficient for me as a college student."
bad,Its decent if your just looking for a little bit of money and few hours. I feel as though a person of such a stature would be highly intrigued by this work opportunity.
bad,"The company is fantastic, but there are many flaws in the system including poor management, very poor communication, and very poor scheduling. Overall it frustrates everyone involved does not help anyone."
bad,I worked hard and felt very underappreciated at this job. I hope the management team improved since I was there. The job was not hard. I did learn a lot about how to run a register when I wasn't cleaning up the store. I became a jeans expert and know a lot about that topic. That was the only part that I missed when I left. My co workers were nice while I was there.
bad,"Managers are very lenient. Typical day at work can vary depending on how bust/slow the day is. Workplace is fun if you make it fun vice versa. Hardest part of the time is how busy it gets during the holidays, It can become overwhelming. Night shifts can depends, when closing it can be a headache depends on how messy the store is."
bad,For someone who likes fashion and to work in retail then this might be a good first job but besides that there isnt much to entice someone to work here.
bad,What can you say about any retail company?  They pay their employees the smallest amount possible while working them as hard as possible.  There's little to no motivation for doing exceptionally well.  The customer is always right is the standard.  Even if the customer is abusive.
bad,"They pay you nothing because the discount is so high. You start getting a 60% discount then you can boost it to 80% if you get promoted. Thats nice and all, but when youre spending all your earnings at your own store you arent making any money."
bad,"I should have realized they were desperate for employees when I was hired without any kind of interview process. As a young adult I was excited to work there to be apart of a cool brand. When I was hired there wasn't any communication about what hours they needed covered, how many hours I could expect to work a week, what pay would be like, etc. Because of the bad management and click-y atmosphere people are hired and leave within a matter of months, including me. They ask you to work weird shifts, and I don't think I EVER worked an 8 hr day. I ended up working 4 hour shifts twice a week, and that was not what I thought I was sining up for. I would not recommend this job."
bad,"I worked at American Eagle for a short amount of time, and typically got scheduled once every two weeks for 4 hours. Super fast paced, and a lot of gossip with managers and co-workers about other workers. However, the discounts were a definite bonus."
bad,Did not enjoy the management style or store polices on pushing for credit cards. Only pays min wage. Opportunities to move up were mentioned before taking the job but brushed over later.
bad,"if you like making money, then you shouldnt work here. my paychecks were never more than $100... paycheck was $38 for TWO WEEKS multiple times. expect a very light schedule."
bad,"working there is great, very comfortable and fun, great group of people. Easily and light task and 10-30 minute breaks. Understanding to needs of taking off work"
bad,Seems that the people in this place that work the hardest get treated poorly and the people that don't do anything get further ahead. While working here I noticed most of the superiors don't take their jobs seriously and everything seems to be a joke to them. The rates are too high and extremely unrealistic for any normal person to make. The management and HR knows this but seems to ignore it. They are also aware of all the people that don't do their jobs and continue to do nothing about it. If you're looking for a fair work place this is not it.
bad,"Did not get the proper training I should have. They employ a lot of younger kids, which is great, but sometimes unreliable. Pay for associates is very low."
bad,"I was only hired for the winter season so I really do not know much about American eagle employment, but the people I did meet were very funny and nice people."
bad,Great you get to interact with a lot of new people by working at the mall a great place to start off working everyday could be different which is a good thing
bad,"Not great, but good experience as my first job within retail.  The manager was excellent which trickled down through the staff.  Like any job of this nature, a lot of the review has to do with the single store itself and experience varies."
bad,"This place was a joke. Always pushing credit cards and rewards cards. Unless you are a manager, there are no hours to be used. Was forced to hire people who we could never give shifts to."
bad,"Worked random inconsistent hours. Unwelcoming co workers. "
bad,American eagle was my part time job for a couple years. The management is a big issue there. The flow of the workplace is off because the management is not that great.
bad,not to bad of a place. decent pay worked hard but it was just temp work. i liked doing the 4 10s and overtime if you wanted it but it was just temp work
bad,"I worked in American Eagle for about 4 months. The first two months I was given 12 hours a week, but the rest of the time there they would give me 0 hours a week. Hardly gained any experience which sucked because I was really excited to work at this job."
bad,"This job was fun but could be very overwhelming at times, especially working at the flagship store. The hardest part about the job was getting customers to apply for the American Eagle Credit Card. Although getting American Eagle Cards was bit overwhelming, taking on this task helped build my confidence and selling skills."
bad,Just overall rude employees only 2 out of the 7 working would actually awnser questions being made and help customers that needed help. Things were out of order. No security at all and no privacy
bad,"My co-workers are always a pleasure to be around but management is poor. There are alot of kids working there while thye prepare to go to college so managers tend to treat all of their associates as kids even if you are much older then them. Thats another thing the managers are mostly teenagers still and act on personal judgement rather then acting professionally. The store focus way to much on getting customers to apply for credit cards or sign up for rewards then actually providing great customer service. Now the discounts are amazing. You can get up to 80 percent off on all American eagle products and its easy to obtain titles like Jean Expert and Stylist. Those are how you get your 80's discounts but their normal employee discounts are just as good since its 60 percent off of 12 American merchandise items and limitless 40 percent off, the 40's you can use on family."
bad,They never scheduled me hours. Said I needed to improve on the register but did not take time to train me. Honestly there was no real training at all they just threw you to the sharks and expected for you to swim.
bad,this place was not organized in scheduling hours. But a place to gain  customer service. i did not enjoy the environment here.
bad,"It's not a horrible job, everyone is friendly and fun to work with. It's just not the field I need to be in. Not enough money or hours. You can't have a full time job there unless you're a manager."
bad,"*Cashier"
bad,"Easy high school job. great for someone looking for a first job, but management somewhat sucks"
bad,"Consisted of a lot of merchandising and organizational tasks."
bad,The company is a wonderful company. It unfortunately does not have enough to offer someone who needs to provide for their family.  
bad,It is an ok place to get started into retail. Getting to meet and talk to people all day was a plus.
bad,"Working at American Eagle was a lot different than I thought it would be. A typical day at work would be working on the floor and helping customers. We also have floorsets where we restock the store and get it ready for the new seasons. I haven't really learned much and the management is not the best. The co-workers are nice, but they change a lot because they tend to leave quickly."
bad,"I have an extensive retail management background and had alway heard really great things about working for American Eagle. However, much to my dissapointment, once I got there that's not how it worked out for me. Poor management, lack of training, and high staff turnovers were just a few of the negative things I experienced. There are very high expectations and if you happen make a mistake...don't expect it to be taken lightly. It could very well end your employment."
bad,American Eagle is a good place to work at. The employees are nice and full of energy. They have very good discounts the only thing you have to wort about is management. The managers do not do their jobs the right way. They are nice to you at first but when you work there for awhile they will treat you how they want to which isn’t right.
bad,"Energetic, lively people who enjoyed coming to work. Learned a lot about customer service and what makes a stellar employee/sales associate. Loved my managers."
bad,"I work almost everyday, each day only working 4/5hrs a day. I have nothing but on call shifts that 80% of the time they use, but I never have can make plans wondering whether I do work or not."
bad,"A typical day being a retail clothing store front door security guard consist of patrolling, securing and monitoring the outlet premises, sometimes with the aid of closed circuit television (CCTV), and supervising at the door. Prevent theft and damage by maintaining a professional standard. Provide a highly visible security presence to help deter criminal activity. Performed other duties as assigned. I've learn that you cant judge a book by it's cover and that people who steal come in all ages, nationality and sizes.The management was great! there was a lose prevention (L.P) on site most of the day and he was the first person that show me how to use the (CCTV). He didn't have to, but he did and to this day I thank him for showed me the ropes. He builded the foundation to most of my security knowledge. My co-worker ranged from teenagers to adults. With that being said there was diverse outlooks on opinions and situations. Most of the teens that work there was just looking for a pay check. The hardest part of the job was standing in one area for hours at a time. Being this was my first security guard front door post my leg had to get use to me stand for hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting so many good people. Retail is a job not really a career to most people and throughout that year i seen employees come & go. Some for good reason and some for bad."
bad,"In my interview, I was blown away by the kindness, compassion, and love my interviewer had for her job.  "
bad,I found it very hard to enjoy working here. The store was only busy during the holidays so they would very often cut your hours. Three hour shifts twice a week isn't enough money to live off of. Luckily I had another job.
bad,"	Greeted customers upon entering store,  responded to questions as needed, deactivated security tags and assisted with merchandise returns"
good,Poor Management. My store manager was decent but took u for her managers when her managers were rude to the employees. After I had surgery the management was rude to me when I wasn't able to lift certain things.
good,"I wanted to work for this company for a while, when I did get the job there wasn't any hours available for me.They didn't give me no hours really They paid me well but no hours so it really didn't pay off in the end.So I left the company"
good,"There is no room for growth. Full time positions are limited, and advancement is not placed from within. This is good for someone who looking to take a step into retail."
good,it wasnt too bad but the coworkers were. they would gosip and talk about others. some managers were rude. i never got hours and credit card numbers determine hours
good,I would not recommend working for a retail store. We had rude customers and the managers played favorites and gave more hours to the people they liked the best.
good,"Started out as a great job, but ended up being extremely overwhelming because there weren't enough advisors to handle the call volume. They hired temp workers during the holidays, but even then it was constantly slammed and everyone was burnt out and left."
good,My experience working at American Eagle was alright.  I was always on my feet doing more than one thing at a time. They didn't give me good hours for a seasonal though.  I worked 1 day for black Friday then i was let go.
good,Being a young mother trying to support her household with 2 jobs this job just did not suffice. I personally did not agree with their culture and beliefs which made it difficult for me to work for them. Great job opportunity for college kids or high school kids.
good,During the holiday season there is never a dull moment. I was a temp hire for extra help during Christmas. There was always something to do and lots of energy in the store.
good,hours are terrible as well as pay. better for college or high school students.
good,"Go to work to make money. Stay away from everyone to stay focus, especially if you're not their nationality. I've experienced racism. I noticed people who are their same nationality stick with one another, it's ridiculously diversified. Get the required headphones n focus on u. You will not get a break on any rule broken. In the end you're alone. Management system needs n team leaders need to be trained or retrained. If u don't know the rules you'll get screwed. I also always have an issue with my paycheck. There's always 40% of it missing. I do get it once I claim. Not a good feeling at all. Other than that it's a job that u can pass n get a start."
good,"The pay is low, but the store is managed well and it is good for high school students who want a little extra money. Great for learning time management and customer service skills."
good,It is a very fun place to work! Unfortunately the current manager and work place are very cliquey. They talk badly about other management in the building and create a hostile work environment for everybody.
good,"When I started nursing school and couldn't work weekends they fired me. They said if I couldn't work weekends they couldn't use me, even though I had worked there for 3 years."
good,While working at American Eagle I leaned god customer service and cash handling. A typical day at American Eagle would be helping customers with any concerns and cashing them out afterwards.
good,We had to stay really late just to clean the store. The store closed at 9:00p and we would not get out of there until 12-1a. I wouldn't recommend working here during the evening shift...the day shift was better.
good,"would not give me more hours, were not flexible with schedules, always late giving out schedules, and stopped giving out hours and schedules to me. Lack of hours and not working for weeks to a month at a time forced me to find a better job."
good,"This place was OK. Nothing great or exciting about it, low sense of enthusiasm, lack of benefits, soggy atmosphere, please don't make this your final destination, do better. Good Luck! :)"
good,"slow paced, fun to work at but poor sales hurt hours the hardest part was to clean after closing and sending out the online orders management was poor."
good,Terrible pay and hours= a decent first job. If you work at a slow mall then the hours will suck. The management was awful. They work you into the ground but offer very little pay.
good,"The management at the location I worked at was very unprofessional and unorganized. I didn't like working there at all. The salary was minimum wage, and for the amount of work we did we should have made a lot more."
good,"All-in-all I just didn't enjoy my time with this company. That is the reason why I only spent 2 months with them. I worked maybe 4-12 hours every pay period, which is every other week."
good,"the company is truly a place one can enjoy going to work, unfortunately their management is horrible to the point where you can not even get a hold of HR, problem in the work place are reported through an outside company"
good,"speak with customers"
good,"I started at AE as a sales associate and quickly got promoted to a Visual Lead. I got paid a little over minimum wage and was functioning as a manger in my lead role. I was responsible for executing all visual changes and presentations communicated by corporate, along with planning, mapping, zoning and executing floor sets through team members, on-boarding all new hires and coaching to back of house and sales floor standards. Most of the managers were unprofessional in their coaching approach and tough on the associates. It was an overwhelming and stressful experience for me but once I learned the ropes and became a pro, it all helped build me into the leader I am today."
good,"Great product, Great Store management teams."
good,Job is easy and simple. The Management isn't very friendly and has poor communication with the associates also major favoritism with hours scheduled.  Great discounts for clothes.
good,"They change between too many ideas on what a person's job should be.  Nothing is regulated or followed once new rules are put in place.  People work over each other, making it hard to stay team focused."
good,Management would always be in the break room talking and not working. It did not seem like they cared about the customers or making sales to hit the daily quota.
good,"My experience was not great,too much paper work ridiculous,,not team work, really very stressfull time in there ,I was treat very bad by two of the managers there and I left happily ..."
good,A good place but to advance is hard. You would have to hangout with upper management just so you can get a raise or promotion in the professional setting. If you dont open up and stay professional it turns to a culture and then eventually an LP issue.
good,"My first ever job. Loved the company, clothes, and discounts. Coworkers weren't always the greatest but not the worst. Management was decent. Not a place to build a career; hard to advance. Can be very stressful and annoying; especially if you were on call."
good,if you want to work here for your first job then thats okay. but they treat you like a number and could care less about you. this is not a job id reccommend.
good,"I was only hired for holiday coverage. I did get to experience all aspects of working there. I would assist customers if needed or assigned to the dressing rooms. When working as cashier I would work the register, credit card machine, take money and give change when needed. When we would be changing the store around it would have to be done after hours. Taking out walls and hard wear and restocking all the clothes. "
good,"I personally didn't have a good retail experience. I didn't receive any training and the managers weren't too helpful, but on the other hand, it taught me self-sufficiency."
good,"It was a very chill place to work at, but they didn't give me enough hours on top of the fat they was paying me little to begin with. Didn't like the disorganization."
good,This is a fun twmp job. They only give you a little bit of hours for seasonal but it a good job for kids in school that want a summer or vacation job.
good,American Eagle is a great clothing company but the one in Cordova mall is hardly productive and can or cannot be nice. The management there is not very observant of what goes on nor does she care much.
good,"I loved working here, except didn't get many hours. The co workers were very friendly and the customers were great. I most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers"
good,I completed floorsets once a month. I took part in helping create a clean neat and nice visual presentation for shoppers.
good,"Steady job, but unreliable hours. Poor benefits for top of the line customer service."
good,"The management team is amazing they are super fun and very good teachers, the only problem is we took about a month in a half to set up the new store in Lehi at Traverse Mountain, and now it has been almost 6 months since I have worked. The only people really working are managers which is not very fun for anyone else employed there."
good,"I found worK at American Eagle rewarding in the beginning when I was learning about how to interact with the customers. There were many college students that worked there at the same time as me so it allowed for good relationships to form quickly. A typical day at work was folding clothes and engaging with the customers, seeing if they needed any help with clothes or otherwise. My managers were nice enough, but I just really enjoyed talking with the customers and helping them pick out items, thats what got me through the 6 hour shifts. The hardest part of retail work is when there is no one around and you feel like your idle the entire shift, which is just a waste of time."
good,American Eagle is a very well structured corporation. I was seasonal help for this position. During my three months of employment there I was a greeter and a cashier. I learned how to promote business and sales very well. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the Black Friday rush of people. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with so many different people.
good,The place would always be a mess because we weren't allowed to recover until the end of the night. Customers almost always complained. I learned that you had to fight just to fit in here. The manager always stayed in the back and the coworkers were friendly but not very enthused. The hardest part of the job was trying to satisfy all the customers that came in with returns and we didn't have their size in the store. The most enjoyable part was that I worked during the holidays and we got a holiday party.
good,"A day at work was very nice plenty of work to be done and goals to be met, i learned how to process shipment and do visual work, management was poor they would let personal issues get in the way of them running the store and allow it to conflict with scheduling, the hardest part of the job was putting on a happy face an working with people that was completely unprofessional, the most enjoyable part of work was the actual work i had to complete."
good,"Good discount on the product, Great place for a first job. Better for people still in school, or in high School. Not good job if your looking for good hours."
good,"This job did not last long because of the large amount of staff and seasonal position. It was my first retail experience, and provided me with further customer service experience. It was a teamwork environment. My responsibilities included greeting every customer, insuring everyone was looked after. I was required to drive sales, and verbally advertise promotions. Restocking hangers and shelves was another responsibility, as well as helping customers find the right styles they were looking for. At the end of the night, clothing must be refolded and displays must be perfect."
good,Nice place to work great people and good management however I did not get paid fairly and what I deserved for how munch dedication I had to my job. I liked my co workers and meeting and interacting with new customers is always good
good,"Absolutely the worst management team I’ve ever dealt with. Aerie is the most positive and inclusive company there is but this management team (specially the store leader) isnt. Bad attitude, gossiping, unmotivating, negative, all of them complain and whine about their problems during work, have no respect for lower positions... bi polar and two faced attitudes from the management. Absolutely life draining and caused more stress than I needed in my life. Breaks my heart that this team is ruining what aerie is about. Needs new leadership team!"
good,"American Eagle is a great job for high schoolers who need a job. If you have any sort of responsibilities or a second job this is not the place for you. All of the associates there are very young but very nice and most of them are good workers. The management is extremely rude, they talk down to you, make you work full-time but not give you the benefits. Most people get paid just minimum wage but I have been with the company for a while and worked my way up. On the Brightside, there are a bunch of different ways to move up in the company, but be warned if you move up you will receive no training, more work, not enough pay, and just be stressed all the time. Overall, American eagle would be great if we fired two of our managers and just got new management, the managers there make me hate my job."
good,The management is very poorly put together. everyone talks about everyone behind their back and everything they do just isn’t far for someone. the pay is absolutely horrible and you don’t get enough hours. but you do get good discounts tho.
good,"I learned a large amount at AEO. I learned what it meant to truly put customers first. The management was okay for the most part, but there was some major conflict with abuse of power. The hardest part of the job for me personally was doing stock by myself. The most enjoyable part was helping customers find outfits they were comfortable and happy in."
good,"One of the main parts of the job, is that you had to push rewards cards and credit cards on the floor. and they would imply that lack of cards = lack of hours because they don't have room for anyone who can't sell properly. and there at time be so many time where talk up a card to a guest and they sign up at the register, so you don't get credit for it."
good,Management can vary depending on who you work with. A lot of gossip and clicks. recommend only if your trying to get by in college. work every weekend no matter what.
good,"The people I worked with were decent. A lot of younger people so a lot of workers did not really know what they were doing, but they were all really nice. It is a chill environment, but it could use some work."
good,This review is irrelevant I have not worked at this company in many years and since the manager has been fired due to terrible personal skills and harsh temper.
good,"American Eagle was a place that I just worked at. I can't say I hated it or loved it, it was just ""meh"" for me. The employees were very clique-y and had mostly trivial and forced conversations with each other. It was easy to help a customer."
good,"In AE you learn to multi task, because if you dont , you wont survive."
good,American Eagle is not a place where you'd like to grow but it is a good start for a job. Working for American Eagle has taught me the basics and fundamental there is customer service.
good,It was not a place for me I barely got to work because they kept hiring more and more people. I quit because I used more gas to get there and back than I was getting paid to work there.
good,"no much to say. the company's culture is like cult. to me, it is weird to have tech team in tons of marketing and sales. not good support from management"
good,at this certain branch of american eagle it was annoying to work there. Youre basically forcing the rewards card or credit card on each costumer that comes up to you which loses time. theres constant buzz in your ear piece demanding you do say these scripts to each costumer.
good,"This is a nice place to work when you're working one of your very first jobs. I eventually left because I never received a raise or promotion, but the discounts are amazing!"
good,It was okay but not really. I loved my teama nd hated management. They spoke to us like animals and slave to be honest. i feel bad for anyone who stays there
good,"Worked some strange hours overnight to rearrange the store, very often. They were not very flexible and the manager was a bit hard to handle. A typical day at work would be a bit boring and when work flow picks up, communication and execution was poor."
good,Good company to begin building skills with. Career pathing and development is limited as well as their investment in talent retention. Company has decent benefits package and culture.
good,Lack of attention and help for seasonal workers. Organized but over worked there current long term workers. I learned how to communicate with customers effectively and up sale.
good,"Working at American Eagle can be fun at times but it's mostly stressful and not worth the near to nothing pay they give. I've been promised a raise that I have still yet to receive even though I've taken on the roll of said job, just without the pay...."
good,"Didn't really like the hours that much because I worked weekends.. managers were ok, people were ok.. had enough breaks.. just had to move for better opportunity"
good,"The average shift hours for regular associates are 4 hour shifts, what is that? Limited opportunity to advance lack of positions available. The job is very easy as long as your a peoples person and don't let small things get to you like people unfolding shirts that's visible and just throwing it back down, or leaving a bunch of clothes in the fitting room a mess."
good,"A typical day at American Eagle is a slow day, but even though it may be slow paced the work load is still heavy.  What I learned from the experience is that not everyone has the same respect for your job as you may have."
good,I enjoy doing the customer service of this job but I do not enjoy the management. We have never had a very good manager who knows what they are doing and treats the employees how they should be treated.
good,I loved working for AE.  The company had a lot to offer.  Our district manager however impeded the success of those who wised to advance. Little support was offered for those who desired to be more than a sales associate.
good,"Hours were hard to get, since management hired more than they could supply with. Work ethic is great there, no bonuses, no guaranteed hours. The employees are all great people."
good,Job is great but would be better if they gave more then 10 hours a week.  It is a good job if you have a busy schedule because the hours that are given are short.
good,Management was great but for the amount of work you put in and the money you earn it's not enough. it was fun to learn sales competition but thats about it... great discout.
good,No movement within the store level. Wherever you start is where you will end. Not much transferring to improve your career. They are just care about having there stores staffed. Corporate throws stuff at you at the last second and expect you to adjust.
good,"I was a lot younger, I started in Delaware, there I learned basic customer service skills and the register. I worked closely with the managers so I was able to see the manager side of the company. I transferred to New York, and there it was pretty much the same."
good,"I was a seasonal sales associate at American Eagle so i didn't get the whole entire experience working there. Did get to try different jobs, like greeter, working the fitting rooms with another employee, or general working one of the parts of the store and helping keep the store clean and organized. The supervisor was ok but was hard to find someone sometimes if you had a question you didn't have the answer too. Also, you were given barely any hours."
good,"One manager really challenged me to be the best in any task I do, one manager completely forgot to schedule any employees for shipping"
good,"Good for a starting out job, because you don't get a lot of hours. Shipment is the hardest part of the job, because you only have so many hours to get it done and you need to share those hours with other people."
good,Management was ok. Wish they offered new opportunities. Space for growth was very limited. Employees sometimes got overwhelmed with the high demand.
good,"The managers were always arguing with the other staff about orders, which would slow the time it took to get meals out. The managers were very demeaning and had a hard time to get the staff to work together. The biggest thing I learned was patience, not everyone can keep up with the orders coming in and rushing was worst thing to do. "
good,"I really didn't find this job too exciting. They treat their employees like slaves. I am a college student who has very demanding hours but American Eagle wasn't very understanding of that. They would schedule me to a certain time and demand that we stay there past the time on the schedule. For someone who has a very tight schedule, this is not the job you want. They barely promote anyone and barely raise your pay. This is a perfect job for highschoolers. The only good thing about working here is the discount you get on clothes."
good,"This is place where you must know the product in order to do well in, you have to know the way every pair of jeans fit and how they will look on just about every body type. The co-workers are easy to get a long with."
good,"every day was something different, the training team was not very informative or supportive."
good,"A typical day at work for myself is started by logging in, and checking to make sure I know all the the sales and discounts that are applicable to that day. Then I scan the store to make sure everything is easy to see for customers and accessible as well as neat. I must also replace any items that are low in stock. After this is check the change rooms to make sure they are clean. While doing all of this I must keep one eye on the cash register for line-ups. The change rooms abide by this rule as well. The number one rule of retail work is the customer needs come first, this is my main focus."
good,"Worked with a lot of customers, very busy because it was during the holiday season."
good,"A typical day at work involves stocking shelves with extra clothing and cashing out customers. I learned about the company and how to better serve customers with the best service possible, allowing them to leave as happy as they came in. Management is split between three people and is handled very well. My co-workers are all great as well and we work very well together. The hardest part of my job is being able to rely on it for income. I barely get any hours because we are constantly hiring new people every week, even though we don't need them at all. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers I get to interact with everyday. I get to use my fashion sense and style them in something they never had ever thought of trying on, they love it and leave happy. "
good,"hours and schedule varied often. a lot of work compared to compensation, almost no rrom for advancement."
good,"the job was fun, it was a pleasure of getting up in the morning and happily go to work.it was passionate and the management team was exceptional. great co-workers."
good,"It was an good place to work at, people were kind of rude but that shouldn't effect how you work, and it didn't. But you would greet people, fold clothes, and sell people items in the store."
good,"A typical day at American Eagle as an associate was working with customers and selling the latest fashion to the customers. The management team was always engaging and helping the associates find where there potential is within the company. Management at AEO would change on a regular basis, but was easy to adapt to within the environment."
good,Im pretty sure American Eagle outfitters has a great enviroment or otherwise good workplace. However when i worked there no one really cared to much about there jobs and played around half the time but that just my own opinion.
good,A typical day at American eagle was hanging shirts up and running around helping costumers. I loved my coworkers but the management was chaotic. No one was ever on the same page so it made tasks messy that were assigned. The hardest part of my job was trying to be comfortable I always felt like I was on constant watch. My favorite part of the job was seeing all my coworkers.
good,I’ve been working here for about 3 months and in the beginning they were scheduling me 3-4 days a week yet little b/y little they starting taking my shifts away. For the past 3 weeks I haven’t been scheduled and when I asked about it they just ignore my questions. Also they tend to lie a lot. Also be prepared to get texts telling you not to show up for your shift bc they're “over hours”. Overall at first it’s pretty cool and fun but then it’s goes down hill.
good,"Have been put into a position hire than mine for more than 3-5 months at a time and never got compensated, a raise for succeeding or a promotion. I’m still doing more work than what they are paying me. I’m overworked and taken advantage of. The hours are far from consistent as are my days off/weekends I’m supposed to have. Inconsiderate of the serious injuries I’ve endured this past year."
good,Overall the company is very intense. Management often cares about what customers think vs what might make employees comfortable. However very flexible for someone working in school and a good learning experience
good,"Working for AEO was somewhat not as I expected. There was not enough training provided, also the schedule was based on the necessities of management. If the day sales are not good they will cancel your shift. Also there was little room for growth inside the company."
good,"This was my first job and I have little else to say for this place. The management did not aid their new employees to grow into self-sufficient workers. I literally only got scheduled 4 days post-training, and was never payed. Tried talking about my availability and always got shot down, ended up quitting."
good,The people are wonderful and the work environment is great. The only thing is the management there is poor. Of the management improved everything would be so much better.
good,The managers were very rude and picked favorites. They only helped benefit those who were very clingy to them and lacked equality. It’s a job and position I would dread going to and waiting minute by minute to leave.
good,"This was one of my first jobs I started working at when i was 17 years old, part time whilst attending high school. Offered the right amount of experience for a sales job."
good,"Management is not good. No hours guaranteed. Very unrewarding environment. "
good,"Not an enjoyable place to work, inconsistent schedules, not enough pay. I came to work sick one day, crying because I was not feeling well, and the manager told me to have more energy and smile for the customers! this happened twice before I got to go home that day."
good,American Eagle is a tough place to work. There is either nothing to do or so much to do. There is no in between. There is no work-life balance. Benefits are severely lacking.
good,I learned what kind of employee I was here and they attempt to create a community for the employees to exist in. They were able to find the best position for me after I had started out as a sales associate. I left because they couldn't promote me to full time in the position that I wanted. I could not afford to live on the amount they had offered me which was more than what they usually paid someone in my position.
good,Very cheap company. Never want to do what's best for their employees. Raises and promotions are difficult and severely underpay management positions. Similar to slavery!!
good,Tending to customers and helping the sales numbers increase throughout the shift. Management was changing constantly and nothing was ever consistent. Hardest part of the job was constantly running back and forth but the coworkers and discounts made it enjoyable.
good,American Eagle was a great job! It allowed me to expand my merchandising skills along with me leadership skills. I recommend American Eagle as a place to work!
good,I worked there since they opened the store and I still made a little over minimum wage. People that came in after me made more than I did. Got only 3 hours a week unless it was floorset weeks and got maybe 16 hours but those would be the only days I worked.
good,being on register is ok but when your on the floor theyre constantly nagging at you about conversion and sales as if you are not trying and its youre fault they are down in numbers. they expect you to make the company your life which is not possible when you are working a part time position and all you do is fold clothes all day which literally can drive you crazy.
good,Not much help was given in advancing your career. I was always stuck learning things on my own i didn’t quite understand. The managers were too fast paced when you first start there.
good,"It was just a bunch of drama all the time between the management and they never gave hours, but they kept hiring people and if I was given hours, it was only 4 hours, 1 a week. That's the reason why I decided to quit."
good,For the work done here the associates are very underpaid and some operations held at the store are unplanned and much too difficult to accomplish efficiently.
good,"If you are looking to make money, don’t apply. It’s a fun teen job or even a college job especially if you are looking for a job with not a lot of hours."
good,"Being a sales associate at American Eagle is a job & that is all it can be defined as. They tell you there is opportunity for advancement, however that is only if you are favored. I was there for 9 months with associates who were there for 2+ years & those associates only made about a couple of cents to $1 more than I did & were in the same exact position as myself. They hound you to hound the customers almost to the point of trying to "" force "" the customers into needing your help. The hours varied a lot which could be very annoying & unstable if you're not a teenager whose only responsibility is working this job. One week I could have 35 hours & the next week I would have 12. Overall just not really a pleasant place to work at"
good,The male supervisors are female crazy and give everything to the more attractive associates. it is very hard to attain a higher position due to the favoritism in the building across all shifts.
good,"Great company, just very very poor upper management in my location. Company does create a cut throat culture causing managers to throw other managers under the bus and not focus on store success as a team"
good,The Job had fairly cooperative co-workers assisting you. The customers added life to the store. The environment had felt very welcoming and encouraging.
good,I worked with all girls and they were all very sweet. I didn't stay for long only because it was seasonal. Retail in my opinion is great when building customer service knowledge.
good,"Everything was unorganized from the scheduling, to the stock room. Favoritism and seniority played a very large role in treatment. Unprofessionalism is common."
good,Fast paced area that is solely based on customer service and how much one can get the customer to spend. It is a very friendly environment but only has part time spots available with no incentive to really move up.
good,I had a fun and easy time here. It was a part time job while I was in high school. It's a good first job for any young person to get experience with customer service.
good,"you don't get to really communicate with managers. over employed. not so many hours. has awesome discount. okay job overall, not so good but not so bad"
good,"In the three years I have worked there, i have experienced a lot. My development has been overall mediocre. It's a fun working environment, just not the right location meant for me."
good,"Just like most retail shops- this requires you to be on the sales floor, helping customers and promoting the store's latest sales."
good,This experience was a good one to have because it showed me what I do not want in a company. The management was disorganized the scheduling was a disaster the only good thing about the job was the coworkers.
good,"American Eagle Outfitters itself is a great company to work for, the discounts are amazing and you tend to meet good people along the way. But, as with all jobs you reach multiple bumps in the road. With working retail you face many hardships but thats to be expected. The best part was seeing the satisfied look on a customers face after you have assisted them."
good,"Love the people and the company.. the management at store level are very disorganized and moving up in the store level is complicated and they are not honest with you during the process. But if your new to retail of just want a sales job , it is great."
good,A lot of organizing is done here. Things have to be done under a certain time and when said by management. Hardest part of the job was offering the credit bonus points to customers.
good,"It was a great experience. I am glad to say I worked for American Eagle but it was a college job while I was in school and living on campus. I enjoyed the fast paced atmosphere however, it lacked advancement. It was tough to have work-life balance especially during the holiday and back to school season."
good,"Considering this was the first place to let me into the working force it was a decent experience. The manager who hired me left shortly after I began, management afterwards thought it was a bootcamp and didn't know how to speak to her employees"
good,"Most people are very nice and open and helpful. A lot of favoritism which is normal but gives very little chance to move up in company. The most enjoyable part is my coworkers , styling, and costumers find what fits their lifestyle."
good,It was a good job but they didn't offer a lot of hours. Only got to work 4 hours a week. Had to many employees that everyone had few hours.
good,"•	Maintain flow of merchandise and upkeep of the brand and company integrity through a consistently replenished, easily accessible, visually appealing stock for customers."
good,Management towards employees was quite awful in the sense that superiors were generally unapproachable and did not give you much say in your hours or positions.
good,"Dairy Queen isn't a bad job by any means but I really don't like working fast food, you come home stinking like the place and eventually you stop eating there because you see how the food is cooked, so that plus the 7.25 an hour for only 4 hours during the school year wasn't really my favorite thing. The best part of working there is that a lot of my friends worked there so we always had a good time, when there were no customers of course."
good,Great and friendly environment. Flexibility in hours. Very busy enviorment
good,Working retail is a job everyone should experience at some point in life. I worked very hard and a lot of hours and have made a lot of friends from this job. This is a job that pushed me to go to school and get a degree so I would be able to get a better job. It was a good job for me while I was in high school so I was able to save some money for college.
good,Fast-paced and constant changing environment.  The atmosphere constant changes. Always aware of change fashions.
good,"No one cares about work/life balance"
good,a stepping stone place to work. Not a place to stay. Fun to work when your on the schedule which is not often
good,When I started at AE it was a smaller store and everyone was friends with each other and the managers were all close with each other but since the store got larger the managers changed literally because an incident happened and we lost two managers. I've been there three years and haven't moved to a leadership position and the pay is not great at all.
good,"slow.. no money coming into store."
good,"I worked here several years ago and didn't like it all. First of all, the only people that get hours are the managers. For retail associates to get hours, you have to get customers to sign up for credit cards. Sorry, but I don't like hassling customers to sign up for stuff. Second, you have to work on floorsets late at night until the early morning which was no fun at all. One of the only good things about working at AE is the discount. You get 40% off regular-priced clothing and 25% off clearance."
good,"I loved the clothing lines that they had and the discounts, but did not like working with high school students."
good,It had it moments.. Overrall it'll rate them 50/50. My biggest issues was getting off late and being stranded.
good,"Process all shipments, process and display, complete store remodel, clean/ organize store, stock room, fitiing rooms, stylist, cash register, etc. Great co-workers but was hard to stay in touch with managers as they always had store meetings. This was holing me back from learning or progressing any further so I decided to get another job."
good,"A typical day at work was basically clocking in and going straight to the back to start unloading trucks (boxs). Censoring and tagging everything. Hanging it all up and eventually when im done id go and stock everything in its right place. If I finished everything I just made sure everything was neat and in order. Right before I left to go home I had to clean and sweep everywhere. Most of my co-workers were very nice and helpful, but some were very demanding and angry most of the time. I really enjoyed working with my hands and doing labor work. Overall i liked working there."
good,"I like my team and co workers, the company has it up's and down's just like every company does."
good,Only work for the back don't try to get to know NOBODY they're all fake people except a lucky few just chase the bag bro/sis period. The managers are some what childish only because they have no experience.
good,"I helped organize and made sure the store was organized during the Christmas holiday season. I had never worked in retail however, it was definitely an interesting experience."
good,There's room to grow within the company. In less than a year I moved up from part time to full time and into a management position. Each store is different though.
good,HR sucks. They don't care about the employee's. All about the numbers. Strict point system. HR never in there office to help or talk. Don't care what you have to say. They're just there for a paycheck
good,Overnight Shift was a drag. The technology they had was terrible. I had been working there for nearly 3 weeks and after talking to the manager on multiple occasions my direct deposit was never set up. The stock room was an utter mess too. Good luck finding what you need in a timely matter. I worked from around 10 pm-4 am and made about $9.50/hr.
good,Well I believe my time was great even tho I have witnessed many unprofessional things within the work place. For my first job it was nice but it doesn’t help when managers cut hours just because they are not making money because they are not help the customers shopping experience better
good,"you spend a lot of time on you feet for a very short lunch break. not ideal if you get tired quickly. depending on management , meeting quotas can be extremely hard due to how much they expect."
good,"American Eagle was an amazing place to work for a long time. However, recently they have taken away the benefits that make being an AE manager great. We no longer have a comparable bonus structure, or reward system to other retailers. There is no incentive to driving sales. They have taken away the associate contests famous for free items and the associate bonuses. They have taken away the two 80% off items. Leaving no reward for developing yourself in new roles or"
good,I worked their since 2016. I loved it until they got new management and that messed up the whole store. It use too be a fun place too work and and receive a lot of free stuff but little by little the got rid of amazing managers and the environment wasn’t fun anymore. The people you meet make it enjoyable and they have an amazing 60 percent discount
good,"Management was very organized and enforced policies well. Was a good, positive environment to work in, which is why I stayed for almost 3 years, but minimum wage is not enough to live on."
good,American Eagle is a very fast paced environment that demands a lot.  I have learned how to manage and cope under varying situations which I believe gave me that edge in becoming the Manager I am today.  The hardest part of my job is the overnight shifts followed by a day shift immediately after.  I enjoy the training and development of the associates and the satisfaction of meeting goals.
good,I didn't realize how much I didn't enjoy working here until I got another job. The work is mostly mindless busy work and you are forced to constantly promote their rewards program which their customers either don't want or don't have considering they've had the program for years now. There are no employee relationships and I felt like I was reliving high school each shift.
good,"It's not as friendly as they make it seems when you first apply, secondly if you bend over to the company you are good, but don't have a brain for yourself it's over."
good,Th company is very nice to work for. Although in some cases favoritism is placed which is not the best. Good employees do at times get taken advantage of for the skills that they offer. They do all in all feel like a family to work for and get to be comfortable and loving to be around. It is a good start in retail if that is the route you would like to be in.
good,"This job was fast paced and nonstop which was exactly what I was looking for. However, the long hours in a job that requires a ton of customer service leads to burnout from the employees. My hours were too long and too many during the week. They could not correctly accommodate to my busy school schedule. We stayed many late nights closing past the hours we were scheduled."
good,"working at aeo was fun to work at, but the management cared very little about the employees concerns and would never find a way to resolve issues and played favoritism."
good,"It was a nice place to shop, but I was not happy working there. I rarely got hours and a lot of my coworkers treated me different and were rude to me. I would recommend people there if they can handle not getting much money."
good,"overall, the company is wonderful to work at. The store that i worked at just had poor management and could use improvement but would suggest company to other people"
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work for a part time job. Management was not the greatest, no raises, etc. At times, only getting 3 hours a week - hard to survive on that."
good,"Overall American Eagle is a great company to work for. You receive an amazing discount and for the most part you get to meet some great people. However, I have noticed that a lot of stores become cliquey, so if your not one for drama, this company is not for you."
good,My experience really prepared me for the current competitive work environments but as a first job hard to build confidence in self and a little too competitive for my taste.
good,"My first year of college I worked here and it was a good start to give me experience but it was not managed well, the company asked too much of their employees, and the pay was not great four years ago (not sure what it is now) to deal with the type of customers we were expected to deal with each day"
good,"Luckily I was only working here as a part time job (through college), but I wouldn't recommend anyone work here unless they want very part time. Hours get cut, the pay isn't good and they have pushed people out that loved being there."
good,"Ameircan Eage is a good place for high school seniors and college age people to work. There is more benefit to working there if you are pursuing a degreee in business, sales, fashion, or marketing."
good,I had a great time at American Eagle but sadly I just wasn’t making enough money and I had leave but it was great time many memories made mangment want too bad
good,"It was good for what I needed at the time. "
good,The management doesn't care about associates and plays favorites.  Doesn't really attempted to work on personal growth as well. Fun environment to work in.
good,Never a down time always working on a very demanding calendar. Worked with very talented production team. AEO knows what they want and knows how to work to grow there company.
good,"I liked working for this job okay, except the management was a nightmare. The first couple managers were really good, but then there was this guy that was clearly doing drugs in the backroom all the time. He stole a bunch of money and disappeared one day. An outside hire."
good,"The overall typical work day was not that bad, what made the day worse was the management. Getting paid minimum, working all night for floor set, and doing your best with customer service wasn't enough. It was a difficult place to work and not that enjoyable."
good,You work hard and deal with ok customers. Some Management was good others were awful. Hardly any constructive criticism and felt like a constant battle to meet daily requirements.
good,"In the Woodlands, TX location, American Eagle was a very hard job to keep unfortunately. The customers were great, however, the staff is struggling which makes it stressful for the other employees. The discounts are nice, but working 8-10 hour days every day and then being called in on your days off to cover other people's shifts made it a high stress environment. I have worked through the company in other locations and it is much more highly organized and the staff is much nicer and it is a less stressful work environment which in turn gives you more of a work life balance."
good,My manager at the time didn't have as much communication with the new employees than with the full time. I didn't know what I was suppose to do most of the time. Before I knew it the store was closing down.
good,From this opportunity I learned a great deal about customer service and retail experience. The other staff were typically kind with the exception of some managers who were less than constructive.
good,"Depending where you are located, it is not a bad first job. But after a while they start having expectations on sales that may not be achievable in the day. Putting stress on yourself and your team. Or having coworkers who couldn't care less about the job meaning you have to pick up the slack. And the hours are not the best, usually you will get 4 hours for a day, afternoon or night shift."
good,"Retail department store daily operations, Managing 20+ sales associates, merchandising, controlling payroll, scheduling for success, hiring and developing quality staff to run a successful business. Controlling inventory levels. Effective leadership while encouraging team concepts. Maintained a solid reputation for upholding high ethical standards and exceeding corporate goals and objectives."
good,Working at AE was okay most of the time but some disorganization and overall was just the kind of work for me to stay in but was an okay part time job while I was in school
good,"If you hated high school, this is not the job for you because as soon as you start working the drama is almost equivalent to high school. Very laid back atmosphere and the discount was amazing. Manager at this location is TERRIBLE. Very and makes you feel like you can not talk to them about issues. Things said in secret are told to other assistant managers and employees. Made unfair choices and picked favorites often. Manager was very unprofessional and would act as a friend more than a manager telling about her personal life which was wildly unprofessional. Employees were like family which was a plus. No room for advancement and many were promised raises but were not. Made 13 cents raise in the two years I was there"
good,"Overall the company was not a bad company, however the upper management wasn't the greatest. If you are looking for stability and advancement,continue"
good,"great company to work for, the staff is friendly and respectful. everyone work great with each other and help each other to resolve and fix any issue that the company gets"
good,"The management is the worst part of the company. Managers would be mean, condescending, and would get annoyed when needed. Just my experience however."
good,Fun and easy place to work with great people. Hours were cut constantly and eventually got down to less than 20 hours a week. decent management and good discounts on clothes.
good,When you first clock in you review what needs to be done for the day and start from there. I learned immaturity has no age limit and neither does jealousy. Mangagers are a dime a dozen. Hardest part of my job was just getting through the 80 boxes of inventory by yourself with very limited hours.
good,"My manager was poor at communicating. She'd ask me if I wanted more hours, I'd say yes, then she wouldn't give them to me. I worked floorset so I only was in there a few days out of the month and I'd forget how to do a few things and all of my co workers would look down on me."
good,"Working at American Eagle, I learned so much. Being there for so so long though and only being promoted once ruins the atmosphere. Especially when you're a loyal hard working individual. A typical day a work consists of dealing and associating with customers and giving them the service for them to leave the store happy. I learned a lot from selling, to folding, to organizing, and detailed information about articles of clothing and whatnot. Management is a completely different story. When you are working harder than the manager is, there is definitely a problem with the workplace. Many of the managers are lazy and lost. They are constantly running to the break room ""to finish work"", but end up going to eat or drink and talk with other managers or associates. The workplace culture is pretty nice because its divided with different cultures that you work with. You meet new people and learn new things about them. The hardest part of the job is when you have lazy managers giving you tasks that they were supposed to do so they can stand around and do nothing all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is going in and meeting new people, whether its customers or employees and growing a relationship with them as you work. It isn't a dull environment at all."
good,American Eagle is not a good place to work at if you're looking for part time work or a work schedule that can work around your school schedule. It's still a cool and fun job for appearral junkies though!
good,"Workplace is always hectic"
good,I learned a lot i was a sales associate moved up to cashier lead learned how to handle money and marketing numbers learned customer service and was also a stylist
good,"Overall, a fun company to work for. Being a sales associate can definitely be hard at times. The company has high expectations of its sales associates but provides great perks and discounts."
good,"This was my first job and was a good first start"
good,Fast paced environment.  Does not focus too much on costumer service.  This is a good ideal for someone who is looking for a part-time job or as something temporary.
good,"You would come in and if you're busy jump right in. You never really stop until your shift is up, and even then it may be required that you stay late. I learned how to properly fold a shirt seven different ways and how to inventory an entire store of merchandise. The management was slightly mean, they were all women, so there was almost always drama, and someone in a terrible mood, myself included sometimes. The girls I worked with were all my age and we were all going through rough holiday shopping, and tax free weekends, and everyone was more involved with their own personal issues and tasks. This store was always more interested in looking good than being friendly and creating a fun work environment. The hardest part of the job was inventory or floor set, which consisted of setting out the new merchandise on the floor, usually for 6+ hours. The best part was undoubtedly getting discounts on the clothing."
good,I used to love working for the company until I transferred to a different location with wishy washy management and terrible communication skills which for higher team members and other managers lead to a toxic work environment.
good,"Hours changed weekly, management was ok feeling of dissoragnization amongst coworkers, not much room to grow or improve, customers were often not polite"
good,"Great employees, management isn't very professional, playlist is up to date and the over all environment is pretty good."
good,Nice place to work. Very very little hours not very good training. Good place to get you started in sales. Everybody is nice but don't really help you.
good,"It is a fun working environment. But as a person wanting to grow it takes years to advance in this type of work field. Thanks to American Eagle, I've strengthen my communication skills along with learning how to be a team player and leader as well."
good,"I like the job. Some of the customers are rude, but it's you're always going to have to deal with those people while working with the general public. The pay is minimum wage, maybe a little more if you're lucky, but that's normal for a job like this. There is only one good manager and he's amazing. The other girls never have time to answer even the simplest question whether it's an associate or different manager asking them. Their answer is simply ""I can't."" Not even associate full statement  they just can't apparently. It rained associated people were falling when they came in the store since we have no rug or wet floor sign and none of the managers cared. A little girl fell and hurt herself and they still didn't care. Not what I would call good managers. But the lawsuit they get someday will get them fired."
good,"Provide Customer Service to promote sales of the store and provide the simplest and most enjoyable shopping experience. Cashier, check out customers and promote loyalty via credit cards and store cards to the store quickly and efficiently. Most of  my coworkers are very friendly and socialize with each other. Hardest part is picking up slack of other workers who don't work as hard, heaving the work load onto others. Enjoy meeting new people, making new friends and the discount."
good,"I went in everyday to watch a 10 minute video, write a summary, report my summary, then begin folding and re-organizing. I learned how to talk to people, fashion, and how retail really works. My managers rarely got along. My co-workers were very nice, but no one lasted long. The hardest part of the job was dealing with my manger. My most enjoyable part was talking with the customers and helping them with there services."
good,"As a teenager, I didn't have very many options for work. American eagle was a great place to work. However, management was always switched out, employees were hired all the time and it cut everyone else's hours. The job was tedious and very redundant. The most enjoyable part of the job was shopping for people when they needed help."
good,"American Eagle can be a fun place to work, where you meet a lot of interesting people. However, management seems to play favorites and I do not like this."
good,"While working with customers was wonderful and having many hours was a plus to this job. The store manager was very rude and disrespectful, she would hit me in the back while I would be working register to tell me I was not doing what she expected from me. She would make it out like I was nothing and just like she did not like me period. I did not enjoy working with many of the employees because they were so rude and disrespectful, although, some employees were nice as can be. My schedule was all out of order, the manager would schedule me to work 3 nights, 2 mornings, and 2 afternoons every week just about. I hardly ever had a day off when I worked there, but I made more money and got to learn a lot more on how to work with the public so those were the benefits from the scheduling they gave me."
good,"It was a fun job, I liked it a lot. The management was kind of a drag at the time. The manager wanted to be a kid and act like a kid at the time, it was very unprofessional."
good,"Typical mail shop environment, used buskro 1500 to print for customers from a received amiling list.."
good,"Personally, the management did not treat me with much respect. Any time I would call in to check schedules, the response I would receive would be rude. The work itself was manageable, but the management could have been much better."
good,"American Eagle is a great place to work but, the training is not very good. There is a high turn over rate for the management teams"
good,People and management very friendly and easy to work with. Stocking and cashier
good,it was a great place to work. It was a place to get me started in management
good,This was a energetic and fun working environment. Was manageable with school.
good,"	Duties included weekly scheduling of personnel, processing weekly payroll, ensuring that personnel were able to take scheduled breaks and lunches.

Prepared reports such as inventory, sales, payroll etc. for review by the corporate offices. Traveled to various American Eagle Stores to temporarily perform managerial position for managers of vacation, sick leave etc."
good,"the job is okay but the hours are awful and if you don't push credit and loyalty to each and every customer you won't get any hours. Also, you never get out in time; if your schedule says you're there until 6, expect to stay until 8. the coverage is always awful too. i like my managers but sometimes they're a bit over the top with expectations and whatnot. be careful with how many hours you want because you won't get a lot here. the benefits are good though; you get a good discount and they offer insurance at a low cost as well."
good,"I worked here for a first job, and it was a good experience. The management was OK, and the co-workers were unfriendly, but that's how typical retail is."
good,"At American Eagle , learned different typesif jean sizes and fits. Very busy on weekends which causes a massive clean up after. i enjoyed helping customers"
good,You have little to no job security. If your seasonal they won't fire you just stop giving you hours till you quit. Pay is terrible.
good,"Management is trash, no hours to give the associates, they are unorganized... half the time they are in the back and would add they do time fraud and nothing is done about when HR was contacted by another management"
good,It was a lot of standing and doing the same thing over and over again. There wasn't much change and it got a little boring. The people there were nice but the main manager would get annoyed at me for not knowing something when they didn't do much to help me learn it. It just wasn't the right job for me.
good,"Over the years the company has changed in many ways, some for the better, and others for the worse. The company has a high and sometimes unreasonable expectation for its management teams in the sales they plan for them to make, and the amount of time given for certain workloads and tasks. I constantly feel beaten down and exhausted and like I am fighting an uphill battle to get things accomplished. Upper management doesnt seem to be truly in tune with what day to day life is like for their employees in stores, yet we get the blame for everything. Payroll cuts across the board are limiting people to show their true talent, as we can only do so much with a certain amount of hours."
good,"You bust your self a lot to meet these sales goals, and you only get gifts, or merchandise prizes. Great for part-time college work, but nothing outside of there. You can rise up, but honestly, even management didn't make much better. I was Sales Associate, Head Cashier, and Sales Leader in my three years experience. It's like getting candy instead of commission or actual income."
good,a typcial day at work was really boring and kinda strict. Even though there is always something to clean or fold we still had down time sometimes expesically when it was the rainy months or gloomy days and no one came in for a while and everything was spotless and folded we were still being told to fold some more or to comepletely rechange the wall after just completeing the task before hand.
good,"I used to love my job at American Eagle but when I moved stores I noticed how unreliable the higher ups are in times of need. My store went without a manager for 8 MONTHS. That impacts the entire store. This company as a whole is great, but you’ll definitely find a few stores that need help that they aren’t getting from the company."
good,The managers there think that everything they do is correct and the only way to do it. But when it's your chance to work they're all up on you as if you were incapable of doing the work you're assigned.
good,I learned alot about retail thru this job that I had no idea about before hand. It was a great job to have that i kept for many years. Was a fun and fast pace job during the holiday seasons.
good,Hours were really short unless you are in management. The workplace felt safe and it was fun working there. But they are overstaffed so your hours will be really really low.
good,"When I worked at American Eagle, I would work my butt off. Picking up shifts anywhere I could. I was a full-time student and still worked 30 hours a week. But somehow at the end of the season I was let off. Although, some people who didn't work nearly as hard as I had got to keep their jobs. There is definitely some type of favouritism going on in that store."
good,"A typical day at work would be going over sales goal for the day, and how you can help make those goals. Job was easy as it is retail, and does not require hard work."
good,"American eagle is a great company to work for if you shop there. The employees are gifted generous discounts, and decent pay. Although it can be a very enjoyable place to work, management can get in the way of your ability to enjoy your job."
good,"A typical day at AE can begin by assisting customers with excellent and proficient detail about the clothing displayed. I have learned a ton about clothing an I've continued to advance in the learning process with replenishment and great social skills. Management is great, but we all know that the store manager can be quite direct and controlling, so with that being said I don't necessarily have the best manager. The workplace is exciting, every time I come into work with goals to meet and new people to see its invigorating. I don't really see any hard part as a sales associate at AE, it's quite calm and chilled if that makes sense. The most enjoyable part about this company is helping customers out and having a great time with the employees."
good,"There are better places to work if you’re a student trying to find money. The managers I had were unreceptive to my requests off and were often rude to the employees, despite most of us being only teenagers. This is only my experience in one store of course, but I would keep looking for other jobs if you can."
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was that you can see people smiling in your face all day & helping people out , sometimes when you help somebody out a cute outfit to go out in they be looking cute"
good,"Store gets trashed every night, so you will be scheduled till 11pm but wont get out most nights until 1:30-2:00. Typically the last store employees to leave the mall every night of the week. Managers are okay, kind of catty and very sassy.I guess most retail jobs are like this, but I feel like this one is worse than most."
good,"If you're in college, need a part time job to get out of the house, or just want some customer service experience, this would be a great job for you. Don't expect to make a lot of money."
good,"Clocked in to do emails, and fill orders. Went up front to cashier and help as needed with customers. I am super customer service, love the public. Helped with Opening and closing of the store"
good,"At American Eagle it can be a great place to work at times. I learned more skills in customer service and how to sell items. Through this job I've become more open. They also provide good discounts but no real benefits. Although It depends on who you work with if you will have a good day at work in my experience, one manager will only talk and be friendly at times and more with other if they hangout outside of work."
good,Helped replenish the sales floor. Sorted out all merchandise in their proper order. Learned different forms of folding clothes. Prestable floor display. Better organization.
good,"IF you want to work here be ready for night and weekends. ALSO REMEMBER they primarily hire seasonal workers for their highest times of Sales. Back to school & Holidays. Expect to work when they want you to, they also have what is called ON call shifts, you have to call in before your shift to see if you can work or not. this was an amazing job for high school and college times."
good,"Great management and good coworkers, i was happy while working there and i had very little to complain about while working there. I would recommend to a friend"
good,"I worked here part time during collage and liked it because of the extra money and discounts on clothes.  I moved up to Assistant Manager and didn't like the hours and compensation well enough to stay, but it paid better than other places in the area for a recent collage grad"
good,"I was the only stock clerk for this store and it was always busy, the employees didn’t seem to like each other very much and nobody was willing to help one another."
good,"It is a fun place to work, however, there's no room for promotion or advancement. You have to be hired outside of the job in order to advance, meaning, you already have to be a manager from a different location or store, in order to grow within the company. No staff appreciation in growth."
good,"Very fast paced environment, not enough hours, learned more communication skills, organizing clothes and stock settings, great discounts and benefits when you make credit card sales and do extra training"
good,"A very busy company filled with a lot of great employees. This is a really good company to work for part-time, but hard to move up in the company.  They do mostly promote from within, but it takes a long time."
good,since the beginning of the Hazleton DC n 2014 the work culture has a really gone down hill. The best thing about this job I find is the associate. There are so many different people and you can learn so much from them because of the different ethnicities.
good,"Was always busy on the floor stocking and resetting items. I typically was the greeter and talked to the customer first. I only had worked here for about a month before I went back to school in the fall. Since I was already waitressing at the time as well, it became slightly harder to manage with scheduling availability. The culture was good and there were always nice people working. The hardest part were the late hours after closing to clean up but the best part was that I did get a longer break here to sit down and eat than I did at my waitressing job."
good,"While I am only a part time sales associate at American Eagle Outfitters, I have been working in the same store for 2 and a half years. I do feel like there is a lack of organization to the company at times and that's mostly due to lack of successful communication. However the company is very generous with giving out free items in different competitions and the discount is great."
good,American Eagle Outfitters is a very difficult company to advance in. Almost all managers are outsource hired and the managers who aren’t are young and naive. There are so many employees that were hired over holiday that we all only get 20> hours a week.
good,Fun store to work at. The coworkers are amazing and everyone is usually in a good mood. Customers can have a lot of questions and can be demanding when looking for specific outfits and styles (Demanding in a good way) so be prepared to work to exceed the customers expectations.
good,"This job is great for high school students, often times after the holidays, the managers will have no choice but to cut down the hours that are given, so it could be a problem if you want to stay long term"
good,"The store I worked for had a high turn over caused by the lack of hours that could be scheduled. I worked in the stock room, and my hours were constantly in flux because of the amount of shipment received. There was no opportunity for me to advance to management, and no opportunity for me to advance on the sales floor. My stock lead and I both asked that I go through the jeans expert and stylist programs as a stock associate, because I was one of the first people to see the new product. Every time, the idea was rejected. I would have continued to work for the company, if my store had offered some sort of advancement."
good,I enjoyed working with the people there because they were all really nice. I did not enjoy having to bother customers every five minutes and ask how they were finding everything because most of them would say they didn't need help.
good,"working overnight shift I had two managers (the daytime who hired me, and the nighttime). The nighttime just partnered me with someone and they did most of the work while I just folded and re-stocked. And the Daytime manager would get mad at me for the lack of information the nighttime manager gave me."
good,"If you don't learn well by yourself, then this is not the place for you. Management does not really teach you most of the things you should know. And the hours are also very hard to come by."
good,If you are a student or still rely on your parents for basic needs this would be a great job for you. The job put some experience on my resume and I enjoyed working with my peers but there was no career advancement or wage raise.
good,This is a job where I felt that I was competing against the other employees.  I did not feel like I was in a good work environment.  I would not recommend this job to anyone that is looking for a good retail position.
good,"Great entry level experience for anyone new to retail or new to the workplace in general. If you want to grow there is potential for growth, but you will quickly outgrow it."
good,"have to be able to meet sales quotas assigned everyday, interract with customers and create a friendly environment. not a lot of hours for being paid biweekly, but fair pay and good management."
good,"American Eagle is great place to work if you enjoy folding clothing and dealing with rude customers, but at the end of the day completely draining. Horrible management and horrible hours. It can be nice when you've helped a customer and they are actually appreciative, but I do not appreciate the work environment at all between the managers and the associates, favouritism is definitely in play at my location."
good,"A typical day at work involved me basically running around doing everything while the newer workers just sat back and folded things. Management hired a new ""manager"" and since she was hired, the morale and atmosphere of the store deteriorated. The experienced employees who had been there for years no longer wanted to work there and began to quit one by one. The discount and my coworkers were the only reason I stuck around as long as I did. The pay is horrible and the management tends to play favorites."
good,If you like clothes this is the place for you. If you don't like working many hours then this is also the place for you. Retail is a hard place to make money.
good,"At American Eagle it was a very stressful job, only becasue the DM made it stressful. Wouldn't give you the proper help you needed to run the store right"
good,They're always hiring but don't give hours to the workers they already have. Some managers pick favorites ( and give them more hours) and bash the ones that they don't like. They want you to be fast paced even though they don't get many customers. If you forget to do something they talk to you as though you're dumb and ask how long you have been working there. They do not like when you call out in advance.
good,"This can be a great place to work, especially when you have a strong and supportive management team. Employees get a great discount! Everyone is very friendly."
good,"typical work day was either dreadfully boring or chaotic and stressful. "
good,The customer aspect of the job has mostly been satisfying but the internal drama between the management team and other associates makes the workplace environment uncomfortable.
good,"Working for American Eagle Outfitters was a great way to begin a career path for myself. I really fell in love with Their clothing in high school, so being able to help others find a great fit for their person style was exciting! The environment of the whole company is one I will never forget."
good,The dm I had was terrible and forced 3 managers to quit.  A completely incompetent manager was then hired.  She drove everyone out.  Employee loyalty is not valued.  They want warm bodies.
good,"lots of customer service with rude and unhappy customers!"
good,"This place is very mismanaged between Temporary service employers and their supervisors and the American Eagle management staff, The location is not very welcoming and work opportunities are few for advancement to full-time work."
good,"Cashier, sales associate."
good,"From working at American Eagle, I engage with customers regularly and ensure customer satisfaction. I deal with sales questions and concerns. This job requires a social personality and lots of communication."
good,"very good place to work , a lot of help was offered , training was good, I learned how to better my communication skills as well as helping the customers with what they wanted"
good,Working here is great! Many opportunities to discover what you are interested in. The company has a very good identity and are very open to various lifestyles!
good,"Good coworkers, easy, hardest part of job would be stopping people from stealing from store and getting people to sign up for credit cards. Ive learned about retail and returning items and ordering items."
good,very tiring environment. Worst management and useless union. Overtime everyday and not just regular overtime but mandatory overtime
good,It is a nice to place to work at because the staff is outgoing and make you feel welcomed. It could be better in the aspect of providing more benefits for its employees and a better salary.
good,Selling clothes was a challenge and this job helped challenge me to get out my comfort zone and to sell in high performance.
good,"The environment was always engaging, which made the day go by quickly. I often was put on call most weeks rather than actually scheduled, which broke my contract."
good,"the work environment was fun, everyone would try to help each other out. shifts were cut short often and changes to the schedule were spontaneous. work was simple and easy to do, you work quickly and sometimes customers were rude but you just have to work through that."
good,"Loved the people and job. Management was not steady and rotated out a lot so overtime we would get someone we liked we ended up loosing them for someone we didn't care for. "
good,this is not really needed to fill out. you waste more of my time on this than really needed to be .no i will not. this is wasting time.
good,Typical work day consisted of following the procedure for opening or closing. At first it was new and capable of becoming something worth while and it slowly turn into something insincere/informal.
good,"I worked there during the holiday season and at the beginning i loved it. the employee discount, the people, and even management. As time went on I feel like everything changed drastically. New unnecessary rules were being made. After a while it became hard to deal with the managers. Also expect a lot of labor during holiday season otherwise it's really slow"
good,"Working at American Eagle helped built my merchandising experience and visual skills. I had a decent work relation there, I've moved forward. The management team is really young, so it all depends on who you are to succeed."
good,"When working as a seasonal, no matter what your experience level, you get paid the minimum amount like everyone else. When they train you, it is done on the floor, and explained to you while you are physically performing the tasks assigned to you by the Lead On Duty (LOD). They give you a tiny sheet to record how much you have sold throughout your shift. Depending on the manager and on how many hours you are given for that shift, they may want you to sell a large number of clothes. While I appreciate that they like having steady communication amongst everyone, the one thing they stressed over and over again is that if you wanted to get more hours, you had to convince almost every customer to sign up for a rewards card, and a credit card. "
good,I love the actual job. I love being able to help people as they shop and i actually enjoy it. It is not a career position though. It is hard to get any good hours.
good,"- provide customer service"
good,Is as good as any retail company.  Very diverse cultures. Very active work day. The advantage is dealing with customers.  Learning the qualities of different personalities.  Overall ok
good,"Management doesn't communicate, crazy hours especially during peak. Pay is alright but not enough for the amount of work you do."
good,"I started off at Union Square and really really loved it as an associate, to be moved over to 34th street and to actually love it even MORE! Lastly I was moved to time square and wasn't really a fan of it. Mangers are sloppy and don't really own up to any mistakes, also it as if everyone is out to get everyone else just to get promotions which is just bad for overall culture in the store. I did get promoted to a cash lead but honestly it was a lot of hard work and effort put into it. I did enjoy my first couple of months as cash lead but later I found myself in human resources talking to my manger or store director blaming me for something that isn't really my fault or being told ""I just hang out"" and don't do any work every other week. I think it's a okay company but avoid working in Time Square the work environment is just really awful and plays favorite on whoever they like the most."
good,The most enjoyable part of working there is the coworkers you work with throughout the day. Without them working would be boring.
good,"Working in retail is hard as it is, but when your management team is lazy and unprofessional it makes your day 10 times more difficult. You are asked to do WAY to many tasks for the BS pay and disrespect received . i was a cashier, stock, replenishment, greeter everything in one day. I did overnights remodeling the store even helped other stores and didn't even receive a thank you. They favor like crazy in my old location. Everyone doesn't get the same treatment and the favorites think its okay to act like your boss, nope we are all Sales Associates you are no better than me. If you are planning to apply to American Eagle DON'T apply to Bay Plaza location, it will be HORRIBLE ."
good,"A typical day can fluctuate based on how much traffic the store sees. I am a cashier, but when there aren't any customers making purchases or need assistance in general, I have to get on the sales floor and help customers, sell merchandise, recover the sales floor, and answer any customer concerns."
good,"Did not include vision or direction. Unorganized and did not support work life balance.  Development is stagnate, needs to look externally for growth."
good,Most my coworkers and stuff were great. When it came to management that's where the company failed. District management was awful along with our own store manager and it made it difficult to work with. they would purposely schedule you for exactly 5 hours so they didn't have to give you a break. Also management at our store would guilt employee's into signing up for a credit card or buying something if we walked in to pick up a paycheck or schedule.
good,"In Aerie of American Eagle, throughout the day you had greet customers and maintain the entire store and fitting room. Most of the management team was good but there were a few of them that were very antagonizing. All the workers were great and the teamwork was awesome."
good,"Greet customers, answer all the questions that a customer has, as well as ask a lot of questions to the customers for the best possible service."
good,"It's a decent place to work, especially if you are a high school student entering the workforce or a college student just needing some extra cash. The discount is among the best you can get working for any company. The hard part is it doesn't seem like the company has any organization when it comes to floor sets or shipment. It's frustrating when you don't have half the product you need for a floor set making it take longer than it needs to be."
good,American Eagle Outfitters is a great place to work as an teenager. but for a career only full-time position are the store managers.
good,"A typical day at work is not that great, I learned not much of anything, the mgmt is not that great, my Co-workers were are all very amazing, the hardest part of the job was folding clothes due to the high volume of customers trying on clothes and either cant fold it right or just makes a mess. As far as enjoyable, Discounts and its American Eagle, Awesome clothes selection."
good,Very vivacious place to work! You have to be able to grasp onto new concepts very quickly! Many cultures and personalities due to the location.
good,"This was the second job I ever had! I worked here and the candle factory at the same time. I loved being a receptionist because I got to present myself very well and learn the ins and outs of clerical/office environment. I loved working with people and animals. Also a very fast-paced fun environment, although there were some days that were very slow. This was a great job, unfortunately I was let go due to slow business."
good,"Lots of pressure on management to secure sometimes unrealistic goals.  Sometimes no decisions are the right decisions.  Missing sales plan, company or personal, is never overlooked.  For the fun atmosphere, the corporate side is very disconnected and serious and projects that onto management, making the reason associates wanted to move up no longer valid."
good,"A laid back atmosphere with emphasis on sales and securing customer loyalty through rewards programs and store credit card. The management team is a bit chaotic and lacks professionality. However, this is a good first job for those not looking for anything serious."
good,While working at American Eagle I built many new skills and met people who made me feel comfortable in my work environment. Everyone was very nice and helpful.
good,"easy jobs, lots of people, different jobs to choose from, ability to change internal position"
good,American Eagle outfitters has been a decent experience for me. A typical day for me at American eagle would be to write down my goals for the day. I would then either work the sales floor or get on the register. Making daily goals such as opening credit cards and reward cards. At the end of my day I would review over what I got done and analyze what I can improve on. I love working with other people but there are sometimes where I prefer to work on projects alone. I am a perfectionist so that would have to be the hardest part of my job. I mostly enjoy working with others and getting to know new people.
good,"A typical workday is coming into work clocking in 10min early, because my station is never consistent I have to go ask the floor manager where they need me to go. I have to go over the numbers for the day and set a goal on how much we need to sell while maintaining the integrity of the store (walls, shirts, denim, etc). Management is nothing to be respected because all that gets done is gossip on the floor while the associates are the ones selling to reach the numbers for the day. The co-workers are the only reason most of the employees stay, because we are a family. Which is also why its hard to quit, the money is not worth it but the people are. I'd have to say the most enjoyable part is closing because theres no goal for the night, its just you and the piles you have to fold and make presentable for the following day. Everyone gets broken up and divided into zones so it helps everyone get out faster. Overall the job is a dead end for someone like me, I'm aspiring for so much more out of life and for the headache this job causes its just not worth it."
good,"Very fast paced environment during the holidays. Constantly folding, cleaning and putting away clothes from the fitting room. When the holidays are over, however, you hardly get any hours. They hire so many seasonals that there aren't enough hours to go around. I literally haven't worked there in a month but am still scheduled for a call-in each week so they can have me as a back-up ""just in case""."
good,"I have heard they have new management, but when I worked there it was awful. They didn't care much about their employees, and always had something rude and snarky to say."
good,"fun and live place to work, just didnt pay enough. able to meet new and exciting people"
good,"I only worked here for a little bit, it was a bit boring because i didn't really have a big part in the store I was just a new girl that was folding clothes"
good,"I worked here when I was 17, I wasnt in school at the time I started here, but when I did start back they weren't very flexible with my hours changing and in turn I had to have several shifts picked up or call in for them due to being in school, which in due to that they quit scheduling me all together and just had me for ""on call"" shifts which they never needed me for. The pay was decent for it being a summer job and not really having any expenses at the time."
good,Has a lot of fun days except the hours are very small. Some day you only work for four hours
good,American Eagle was a fast a fun place to work. It was nice to be able to help with outfits and help people find what they were looking for.
good,"Long shifts but fair breaks if you're not an actual american eagle associate, you have no job security. 100s of temps come and go every single year. Basic job functions include, picking items with use of a scan gun on a conveyor belt. Items are then sent through a sorter where they are scanned and packaged for delivery."
good,Core values are only in writing......no career growth...no security...only management has security
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting coworkers who have the same aspirations as others and have a drive to work in order to succeed. Great place for any student to learn about responsibility, accountability and professionalism in a retail setting while learning to deal with an ever changing fast-paced environment, although it may not lead to advancement to managerial positions."
good,"as a sales associate your day started and ended fast paced, pushing items of horrendous cost and little quality for minimum wage. It is a great way for those entering the job market to accumulate some experience but otherwise it was a lot of work with little to show for it. Management was brusque but efficient,and very money oriented. coworkers ranged from exceptionally competent and warm, to cold and negative. Staff generally had a turnover expectancy within two years unless they were promoted or transferred. The hardest part of the job was easily selling and promoting credit cards. often thosewho would sign up for them were those who typically could not afford the outrageous 19.6% apr STARTING rate. it was ethically difficult to push this. The most enjoyable aspect was floorsets,when we would reposition and bring out new stock to the store overnight."
good,Over 80 employees. Managers act like you don't exist if you're new. Training is awful.
good,"This fun young up beat store is a fun place to work, and has alot of fun perks such as discounts and an insight on fashion trends. "
good,"8-9 hour shifts with a 30 min break. Management can make or break a store. My coworkers are amazing, have great attitudes while working hard."
good,"co-workers were the best, most challeging part is when it gets really busy and you have to manage customer service nd zone your area, but most of all I learned how to multi-task better than I have before."
good,A typical day at work consisted of assisting numerous amounts of shopping customers. Management was always encouraging and acknowledging anyone who accomplished a store goal. My co-workers are all mostly young and still in high school all with great spirits. There was not a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part was closing and re-stocking the store over night.
good,"American Eagle has a very unique work environment, and is at the same time, extremely fast-paced and profitability-oriented. The headquarter offices are very modern, great cafeteria, and luxurious lounge area. The work itself was very data-oriented, which makes sense because of how competitive the retail industry is."
good,This store was oriented towards young people and the fashion of the day. I had fun working here but ultimately i did not enjoy only selling the store brand.
good,it has been a good company to work for the last thirteen years. now it is going through a lot of changes that do not benefit the employees.
good,Shifts are usually only 3-4 hours. One week you will have 20 hours and the next week you may only have 3. I am constantly worried about money because I am currently trying to find a full time job. Most of my managers have a lower level of education than I do (I have a bachelors degree) and they tend to speak to me like I am a child. The hardest part of my job is trying to reach the expectations in which the company and managers set for associates. I do however enjoy my fellow associates and always being able to meat new people.
good,"In a typical day I greeted Customers and offered assistance, ran Register as needed and replenished and Organized stock as necessary. I learned that if the management isnt on top of things it not only affects the employees but the customers satisfaction with the service. Management was not the most organized. My co-workers were friendly and enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job was when the management was slacking and I saw how much it affected out sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing when customers were satisfied."
good,"I have neen with eagle for over 9 months and 13 people have left since ive been there. One would think they should move up on the senority list, however thats not the case, they havent hired any people, and keep pileong on the work load. Working fri sat sun and mon night is a terrible shift for a 21 year old such as myself. And the pay is terrible 15.60 including liscense and shift premiums. I will say that the flight benefits are awesome I just flew from ORD to LAS for 25.00 round trip!"
good,I will come in speak with one of the managers he'll tell me about the promotions or deals or sales that are going on for that day. Then I will get zone ready and I'll begin helping customers.
good,"Working there was kinda fun. The only thing I did not like were the hours and the pay. Sometimes I'd only work about 4 hours a week, if workers went over hours they'd make you leave early. Management was okay."
good,The staff are very helpful. Too much focus on store organizing which pulls you away from actually helping customers. The pre work videos are stupid and make feel like a child.
good,I actively sought out training and improvement but was met with almost no recognition or performance review. American Eagle paid my bills but will not be my career.
good,Safety Oriented. The Night shift is a hard shift to work and can often cause great strain on a persons personal life. There are lots of chances for in house promotions.
good,Store design is too small for this type of activity and a group of merchandising individuals.  No room to work besides sitting on the floor and/or standing for long periods of time.
good,"They don’t pay attention to your availability much, it has the potential to be a good job if the store is ran correctly. So basically it just depends on the store."
good,I found working at American Eagle to be easy and fun in the beginning. The company started changing recently and became more stressful. I think there are better jobs out there.
good,"Overall i did enjoy working at American Eagle when it came to the other employees i worked with. I transferred stores after working in Michigan for 3 years. I worked 30-40 hours and on most weeks worked 40+ hours as a sales lead and only getting paid a couple cents more than regular associates to do 10Xs more work. Again, retail is a good “part time” job to have to make some money, but when it comes to a full time position, you have to know what you are getting yourself in to"
good,"Love that job ,it is a fun job to work at meet new people possibly famous people once in a blue . You get cloths discounts . You get to  interact  With others . This job is perfect for youngins .the managers there are awesome . The employees are cool as well . Everyone in that store makes it fun to work there ."
good,"I worked there because I needed a flexible job while I’m school but they continually scheduled me to work on school nights. They stopped scheduling me because they claimed I wasn’t handling my responsibilities, but really my work was just going unnoticed. The job was seasonal so it wasn’t going to last long anyway."
good,The American eagle company is a great company which rewards its employees and is very generous with its sales associate rewards for sales targets. However not all stores follow the work ethic and attitude of the parent company so it’s important to find a store that does.
good,"I liked the customers and the product that was being sold but the management was not very strong. They were not very supportive or open about hours and or advancement. "
good,the co workers were very nice and fun we all enjoyed each others company. the store was always keep presentable. the managers were nice but also knew how set rules.
good,I typical work 4-4.5 hour shifts. I learn so much about retail and how to understand what a customer needs. The new management needs improvement with communication amongst themselves and the associates. The hardest part of the job is floor set. Floor set is when you move the new merchandise to the floor each month and it gets stressful because you are working long hours overnight. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my coworkers because they are genuinely nice people.
good,"When I was working there I was working the weekend shift which is 430 am to 430 pm and sometimes past 430. The pay for starting is 11 bucks an hour and they mess with how many hours you get alot, so some weekends you might not be working and some you might."
good,"There was no opportunity for advancement, but the discounts were nice. 60-80% off depending on what job title you held. Flexible schedule as well but the overnight shifts were terrible you definitely do not get paid enough for that."
good,"Management when I worked there was very nice and understanding, they really promoted team work."
good,"Everyday is pretty much the same from us, but I learned a lot about management and responsibility in this job. The hardest part was the commitment, the long hours at work but overall it was worth moving up."
good,"High pressure retail sales environment "
good,"My stock manager was outstanding and made the job fun, she always made sure everyone was doing ok, she kept the atmosphere friendly and let us be ourselves, and she always made sure the job was getting done. "
good,"retail just is not for me and I learned that. However, I did not mind working here. Nice people. Some of the managers were a bit rude but I did not mind in all honesty"
good,"The discounts were some of the best discounts of all retail jobs. My fellow associates were fun and helpful, but the management wasn’t too great. Of the three managers, one was good, one was decent, and one was awful. If you are scheduled till 9, be prepared to stay until 10:30 or even later. As a full time college student, and my manager knowing that, she still scheduled me 40 hours in a week, and made me stay until 1 or even 2 in the morning. They refused to hire new associates, and that’s what caused me to be scheduled more and more. Long story short, just know what you are getting yourself into. And if you suck at your job, you will still get scheduled, but you will get cut early. Soooooo suck at your job."
good,It was an ok working environment. Every now and then it was fun. really did nothing other than standing around and folding clothes. In all it wasn't anything special.
good,"It was a fun experience most of the time, but I can see where people were treated unfairly. Managers need to collaborate more often otherwise the store will go down in flames."
good,"Has good discounts for employees, easy job to have when lifes pretty busy. but it really depends on your environment, having a good management team will really make or break the store."
good,"The store I worked at was very unorganized and that’s probably the reason I had the hardest time. The managers weren’t the best , they were very stressed and not the nicest."
good,Working at American eagle has been probably my favorite job out of all my jobs. I enjoy the people I work with and never had a problem with any of my managers. There really isn't any problems with working there but the hours they give the co workers. Mostly all of us work 4-6 hours a day and like 2 or 3 times per week. Managers mostly get more hours and days to work.  I only complain about the house because I only get scheduled to work 2 times a week for 4 hours. I have complained to my managers but almost all the managers have left and there is new ones now. I love working as a cashier and in the fitting rooms. I don't find the job hard but it could be stressing if there is a lot of costumers around the store.  I learned more about sales and how to communicate with costumers and have them buy what your saling to them.
good,"Working at American Eagle was fun sometimes, but I lived 30 minutes away from the American Eagle where I worked at. I also want to point out that i would get barely any hours weekly (ex-10 hrs) They also would make a difference with employees. So basically i wasn't making any money. I decided to leave the company."
good,"A typical day includes watching a 5 minute video to keep everyone up-to-date on policies, then helping and ringing up customers, assisting with product retrieval ( for on-line or in person orders), maintaining order of dressing room ( opening available dressing rooms to customers and running unwanted products back out to the sales floor), and store clean-up to keep the sales floor looking professional."
good,"People were okay, but very immature and lack luster. The hiring process was rigorous and we had many complications both me and other hired employees.."
good,"I enjoy working in American Eagle. The team I work with are great but management can be difficult at times. It is very customer service based which I do not have a problem with. A regular day can be moments of calmness to clean everything up then random burst of people. This job has taught me how to manage people, keep track of goals, and work harder for what I want."
good,"a typical day on the job consisted of folding clothes, stocking them, assisting customers, and working the cash register. management wasn't great but the work environment was fun to be in"
good,"For other locations other than the one in Alamance Crossing its pretty fun to work. I always looked forward to going to work, getting to wear the clothes I love. But the only thing with this location is there is no business ever really, during the holidays are when you'll get the most hours. But after the holidays (after Christmas-June, and August-mid November) you'll be lucky to get 3 day a week"
good,"Working at American Eagle Outfitters Web Distribution Warehouse  was often like a grab bag, at times you never knew where in the entire process you would be for the shift and often you would change the job areas several times a shift. The one thing that was a constant was that you had to be fast and accurate for a solid 10 hours. Management personnel was fun to work with."
good,Great staff. Cool managers. Build plenty of friendships. Excellent employee discount. Pay isn’t too good. Flexible hours. Not many benefits. Makes sure breaks are taken on time.
good,"Managers and employees would have no problem swearing in front of customers which I believe is very unproffesional. Staff was not welcoming and very secretive. There were cliques among staff, and the managers were somewhat unorganized."
good,It was a good part time high school job. You have to fight for hours though. I could do nights and weekends and only got like one day a week. If I asked off one day then I didn't get anything that week.
good,"This is a fun place to work but they give short shifts and only minimum wage , for the amount of years i worked with them i didnt get to much of a raise with them . And they were consistent with my postion . They would take the manager role away for no reason"
good,This was an awesome job until I transferred. The gm at the store I transferred to cut all the hours for managers except one who didn’t do their job. The rest of us were expected to pick up after them.
good,"I got 4 - 8 hours on my 2 week schedule, they never talked to me like a normal person, strictly employee.I needed more hours and everyone I know that was hired with me only was scheduled for a few hours also."
good,Working at American Eagle the manager was very creepy and mean. People talked bad about customers in the walkie talkies. It was a fun job and was never boring.
good,"Great work life balance if your a student, Negative and competitive if you're in management. Would not recommend as a long life career but great to start off."
good,Sometimes they just cancel your shift last minute and they wouldn’t really help you with anything and there’s also so much gossip and backtalking with everyone
good,The higher level management knew nothing of working on the sales floor day to day and had unrealistic expectations for their employees. They cared most about stopping theft and blamed employees for not stopping things such as grab and runs and too tight on payroll to allow for better floor coverage. Very stressful job.
good,"It was nice & all but I did not feel as comfortable working there. They had this protocol that you had to follow and be fast-paced at all times. If you did not follow through with the rules, they would not be happy with you and would rate you based off that."
good,"Any retail business can be pretty hectic, especially if the store brand is extremely popular. The managers were not always friendly especially if something did not go the way they wanted it to. Also, sometimes even if you were a new employee, they expected you to automatically know what you were doing."
good,"Co-workers were wonderful"
good,"My first manager/The store manager is the nicest and funniest manager, but the newest manager is just so snobby, she acts as if she is entitled which she is not. Other than that it was fun, it's in the mall so."
good,"It was stressful on very busy days and often unorganized. I would get my break until an hour before my shift ended some days. Most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers. Some managers were great, some were not. Customers are hard to deal with along with every retail job, but discounts were amazing and they only reason i stayed so long."
good,"If you have never worked retail you should! It will be a humbling experience especially during high traffic seasons like ""back to school"" or holiday. "
good,Depending on your position it can either be enjoyable or terrible. Some positions are more stressful. I feel the environment and culture of the company also allows for cliques to be formed.
good,Working in American Eagle is very cut throat people are always trying to throw people under the bust. Hours constantly change base on business hours and floor set. The company has a high turn over for managers. Company does not hire consistent leaders and associates are constantly taken advantage of. Work seven years and only had one store manager who worked along side the associates to meet goals.
good,American Eagle is a good first job. Great discount on all clothing while you are an employee. Management was always friendly. Downside is lack of hours available.
good,"I enjoy helping customers at American Eagle Outfitters. I enjoy helping customers find the items they need, or just helping them with outfit ideas. When we have a busy day it's good because you are always doing something."
good,"This mall is full of teenagers, so unless you are one, I don't recommend it. The management is also extremely childish and petty, not exactly professional qualities."
good,"Poor management - poor people skills."
good,"I enjoyed working at American Eagle because I loved all my co-workers, and it was a very fun environment to work in. I enjoyed the fast pace work also but can be stressful at times with managers telling you to do 5 things at once."
good,"opening the store is always fun"
good,"Overall American Eagle was a fun store to work for. It almost felt as if I wasn't even at work half the time. My at American Eagle was cut short due to the fact that I was a seasonal worker but I wouldn,t mind going back."
good,"Working for American Eagle was an awsome experience. I was able to meet new and exciting people that came into the store everyday. My team was excellent to work with. The overhead management was very busy to notice the work of many employers. There were some employees that were overlooked many time. Some people were hired over others. safety hazards in a lot of open spaces, not conducive to the work environment or the safety of the staff."
good,"I love American Eagle Outfitters. It is always a fast paced and people oriented place to work. The Employee discount is amazing too! They are always accommodating the changing styles and making sure their employees can get their hands on them. However, not all American Eagles are created equal. The management plays a HUGE part in how you feel when you leave work. There are LODs to keep track of our goals. Some manage differently than others and it can keep you encouraged to try harder, or leave you feeling incompetent and unappreciated. Also there isn't much room to climb the ladder. There are only so many open positions for managers and a lot of times if you want to continue up the ladder you have to relocate which I feel is pretty typical for large chains like that. Overall, the values of American Eagle are something I feel like most people can get behind, but make sure you get around positive and upbeat people, it will make all the difference."
good,I've worked here too long and do not get the pay that I deserve. My fellow employees are great and I get along with Management. The store is constantly messy and payroll isn't used to the best of its ability
good,Gives you a basic understanding of a fast paced environment and ways to challenge oneself. You would rotate through every section of the store during your shift.
good,"American Eagle is an incredibly successful business. I enjoyed working with the staff and customers. However, the management at the time I worked there was very unorganized and unproductive."
good,My experience here was not terrible but there are a lot of issues with operations and definitely in the rewards infrastructure. Pulling teeth or properly paying employees is the same to this company. They never gave me my raise for my promotion. They overwork their management.
good,"Great place to work but the management at the time was completly awful, there is little room for advancement as well as pay is not the best.  The only time they will really work you is holidays and weekends."
good,"American Eagle sales associate jobs carry multiple responsibilities. Primary job duties for American Eagle sales associates include providing customer service. American Eagle Outfitters sales associates assist customers in sales, organize displays, stock shelves, and operate cash registers. Additional job duties may include cleaning store locations. The position of sales associate requires applicants to stand and work on foot for long periods of time. Training typically lasts a few days up to a week, in most cases, with a short probationary period for new employees."
good,It is a good environment as one's first customer-service job for a person who has no previous customer-service experience. The hours are not ideal for someone looking for 15 (minimum) hours a week.
good,But i would not recommend for a growing environment. The work is tiring and you definitely will not be paid enough for what you do. The job also requires being on your feet a lot
good,"Management could be definitely improve. I only got 10 minute breaks, and I barely got put on the schedule even though I am such a hard worker and I always completed all my tasks neatly and efficiently."
good,"Typical day at work; for me, is to get the store ready for opening.  I usually close 3-4 nights a week.  AEO has taught me a great deal about putting there customers first, which helped me a lot in terms of getting the customers what they needed.  I worked in 2 locations, and I have to say that the management team in the first location was all about the team.  However, in the second location, there seems to be more of a, everyone for themselves attitude.  The hardest part of the job for me is not feeling like I am part of a team.  The best part of my job is to be able to give the customer what they need."
good,"Not sure if this happens in many stores but....there are never enough hours, and most times it is just a manager and a sales associate working at a time. Shifts are 4 hours long for sales associates and you're lucky to get 2 shifts in a week (with minimum wage). Management is unorganized, and nothing is ever done on time. Shifts get stressful when you're the only one of the floor to help and a host of customers ask you for help. Managers depend on you to do everything in the front of the store while they're in the back doing a mix of work and gossip. Most enjoyable part of the job is that everyone treats each other like good friends, and there are no arguments or problems that I have heard of at all."
good,"Maybe a little too competitive. Your hours depended upon how many sales you made even though we weren't paid commission. I thought that was a terrible idea especially for the newer employees like myself. Scheduling was a nightmare when I first started because there were the new employees and the more experienced ones and the experienced employees got sales and therefore got more hours. So, sales experience recommended."
good,"a nice place and great company, also some great coworkers. but also some very judgemental people as well. and just feel stuck, and lack of hours and bad pay."
good,American Eagle caused a lot of problems for me as I was leaving even though I as only a seasonal worker. They held my last pay check and it took nearly 2 months to finally receive it.
good,Didnt get alot of hours do to payroll and alot of worker at first. Some co-worker are friendly and you could have a good time working at a retail store.
good,Really long days with plenty of overtime but really hard to juggle social life and work not a lot of benefits first starting out and really hard to get work.
good,"enjoyed the work environment, coworkers made the day go by faster, but needed better management. Overall i enjoyed the visual aspects of the job and it wasn't too difficult."
good,"Loved the people and environment but they were unorganized with too many employees to provide the hours that everyone needed.  Would recommend if just looking for a some extra cash, not anything stable."
good,"Co workers are amazing along with some of the management, the days are enjoyable and pretty simple and self explanatory."
good,"This was a fun place to work at as a high school student just looking for a paycheck, but as I grew I realized that I wanted more for myself. The typical day consisted of clocking in, checking the daily sales goals, greeting customers, checking for signs of theft, cashing out customers, and your basic retail job requirements. The management was very nice and so were my co workers. It was a very easy job, but there was not much flexibility with scheduling and little to no room for advancement"
good,I have learned many things working for this company. One of many is learning how to use a cash register. HOnestly i love the management they are amazing at their job and if i didnt have need to find a job that was more workable for school i would stay.
good,Very weak leadership in this company. Directional no involvement required to work there. Canada is at the mercy of the USA.
good,"Really enjoyed working there.  Had a great crew and was excited about work."
good,"Great employee discount"
good,this was a fun job to have but retail isn't for me. this job also taught me communication skill. this job was had for me because I don't know how to persuade people into signing up for rewards. but overall it was a good job while going to school full-time.
good,folding clothes meet and greet customers jumping on cash register if needed keeping track of inventory styling and providing wardrobe assistance
good,"Management was always changing, and there was scheduling issues.It was a good place to work, but hours were short. Overall if you if you did a good job, there was room for advancement."
good,The job is to get the customers to buy clothing and to make them happy with the choices helped by one of the team members. The environment is always kept clean for customers to shop comfortable .
good,"A typical day includes rude costumers and a disorganized stockroom. I have worked out in the store as an associate, where I encountered many rude costumers and ridiculous sales tactics, as well as in the stockroom where one must complete shipment in an impossible amount of time. This company doesn't appreciate its employees enough. The only enjoyable part of the job are the people that I work with, other than that, its a pointless job. They not only pay very little, but require constant hiring of associates thus limiting the hours available to work."
good,When you first get a job with Amercian Eagle you start off with good amount of hours and then once you have been there for a long time then you don't get enough hours and then people just start quitting.
good,Great co-workers who were motivating and encouraging with positive attitudes. Up-beat atmosphere with good music. You are on your feet the majority of your shift is the only downside.
good,"-Management was poorly ran"
good,"Greeting every customer . Interacting with a diversity of different customers . Keeping a positive attitude at all times . folding clothing  constantly making sure my zone / section was always neat and organized . Running go backs from the fitting room . Helping customers find there needs and wants ! Keeping customers updated with current promotions . Cashiering , applying customers for our in store credit card . Management was helpful , always had a good relationship with my co-workers and management . The hardest part of the job was making sure all the go backs from the fitting room were all processed , sized and properly put back where they belonged before the end of each shift . Fitting room go backs did get out of control at times but it wasn't something impossible to handle once you know what your doing . The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be in different type of contests with in the job to try and win a piece of clothing from the store , the one who sales the most wins a prize , being a confident seller i loved being involved with different challenges !"
good,"Not much to do here, but a lot of tedious work. Not for me. I like to stay busy. This place didn't quite do that for me. Just a lot of folding clothes and whatnot..."
good,"A typical day was just cleaning and watching managers go into the back for long periods of time."
good,My time working at AE was somewhat pleasant. I believe the team spent more time trying to be our friend rather than allowing us to do our job (which is okay at times). The management spends most of their time gossiping about the sales team. The coworkers were probably my favorite part of the job. They made it bearable. The team was friendly and loves to make sure everyone is having a good day. I think the worst part of the job was when they hired new workers because they hired people that didn't even show up so you had to come in on your day off.
good,"Not much to say some good some bad.  Became very boring, same stuff different day."
good,"During your shift at American Eagle, you can expect anything from an extremely slow, boring day, to a day where you consistently move throughout the store. I learned ow to multi-task, and accomplish all goals that I set during my shift. The management was acceptable, fair, and provided good feedback. The co-workers there made the job enjoyable, making a fun and competitive environment. Keeping up with customer needs would be the hardest part, knowing if you have certain products, who else has what they're looking for, and keeping the customer coming back."
good,I love giving customer service and this is definitely a place for someone who likes to do customer service.
good,"Management just makes you feel like they are better than you. you wont get many hours, it is fun if you work with friends but it is still work. there really is not a whole lot to do, fix the jean wall and clean out the dressing rooms."
good,"I would stand around for 5 hours folding clothes most of the time on weekdays the mall wasn't busy at all barely any costumers came in. On weekends got really busy that when the days seemed to go by quicker."
good,"Managers weren't acknowledging associates, and things weren't getting done. It was just a mess."
good,Long days and lots of hours. Was salary and was not paid enough.
good,"It's retail...what do you expect? lol"
good,"Perfect job for a college student looking to work part time.  But if you're making a full time career out of this, look elsewhere."
good,"While pay and compensation of benefits was suitable. The work environment is not conducive to being able to have quality of life outside of work."
good,Company seems to be a typical retailer. Works you hard and pays little.
good,Dana was the best! Didn't care for upper management. They were not the easiest to work under.
good,"At american eagle i could help clean the store, greet customers and help customers who needed help finding products around christmas time. I learned a  lot since it was my first job, i learned how to deal and work with the public, impress my boss, and help customers. My coworkers were very nice. The hardest part of the job was working on black friday and the most enjoyable was the fact it was my first job."
good,"It's a fun place to work, but be prepared not to work very many hours. "
good,Working at American Eagle taught me the basic skills of having a job and interacting with people effectively as it was my first job during high school.  
good,Learned about excellent customer service. The best part was the discount and the environment. The worst part was the management team.
good,It is a good place to work if you are in school and need money. Hours are flexible.
good,"Serving customers for the clothing needs, always trying to up-sell"
good,"I worked for two years at AE and it was okay. Sometimes the work hours were so long and time didn't go by nearly as fast working the floor or fitting rooms as it would working the cash register. The people were great, some of the managers were crazy, but it was all about selling AE apparel."
good,American eagle is a profitable company. It is a fun and energetic environment.
good,"Your typical retail position, usually busiest around the weekends and most holidays. Great discounts as a employee, and potential to gain experience in the retail field"
good,I worked for American Eagle for almost a year. My first location was chaos and a bit scrambled. Management never seemed to be on the same terms. My co-workers were a blast and the discount is good. Customer interaction is also a plus for working for the company.
good,"I enjoyed the job overall, however I felt like it wasn't a fit for me. I liked most of the employees but not the flexibility of the hours. I liked the fact that there was no real dress code, the goal was to stay in tune with styles at that moment and attempt to  sell clothes from the season."
good,People there are not too professional. I was only there for a short period of time and the hours were not good enough. Maybe the day time shifts were more organized but it felt a lot like high school gossip drama.
good,it was a really good job. if it were up to me i would still work there. the tem i worked on was great and the enviorment was really good at making for a great day
good,"You can advance quickly at this company if you work hard and are willing to put in hours, but there is constant management movement and you can never be quite sure of where the goalposts are fixed for what is expected of you."
good,While being a stock lead for America eagle I was under a lot of pressure (time wise) since you would get a huge load of shipment that needed to be processed in about 2-3 hours.
good,"Worked 12 hr shifts, learned new skills of Picker/Packing, and to do it in a speedy and timly fashion that suits your capabilities, and the wishes/demands of the customer'(s )who ordered the package, as well as your employer'(s)."
good,"American Eagle as a company is great. But there drive for money can make employees feel unappreciated. As the staffing supervisor there, I was in charge of scheduling and day to day operations. My focus was always on my people and their happiness and with that mindset we were always successful. But unfortunately, that is how I managed not the companies focus. The companies product is amazing but I continue to fall back to the people who I managed. My only statement to the company is to put your time and focus on what really matters YOUR EMPLOYEES. The rest will take care of its self"
good,Working for American Eagle Outfitters helped me grow into the working professional I am today. I gained a wealth of knowledge from so many different aspects of the business.
good,"AEO is a decent retail part time job but they often cut hours so you often cannot just rely on this one job in terms of hours. "
good,"At American Eagle, it was always about the customer. We were not able to touch a stack of clothes to fix it until every customer in the store has been helped and had at least 1 pair of jeans in their hand. A typical day at work for me was Clocking in. Checking with the LOD (Leader On Duty) and going straight to the sales floor to help customers unless I was in the fitting room. There I would open the door for the customer or do go-backs which was putting the items that customers didn't want where they went. I would also do floorset which was setting the item displays and shipment which was opening the boxes, censoring the items and putting them out. What I learned from this job was that in retail you have to have a balance between helping every customer and keeping the store presentable. Workplace culture was good most of the time. The hardest part was time. You always had to have a fast pace throughout your shift. The most enjoyable part was connecting with my coworkers as well as customers. I got to know more people every day."
good,A typical day involved assisting customers in finding cloths and outfits. Always opportunities to up sell by adding accessories. Reorganizing displays was a majority of the job; making sure that cloths looked presentable.
good,"It was alright, just felt like everyone there was fake, there were a few people whom were nice to work with. Also very stressful to get there. Just not a great job."
good,"Working here had more downs than ups, a lot of favoritism occurred durning my time there and the company made you feel stuck in the position you had with no incentive to move up. Also the pay was horrible, I would spend hours at floor sets and work overtime but wouldn’t get a raise. Worked to the bone for almost 2 years and never made more than minimum wage but was expected to only wear their clothes at work when it was super expensive. Horrible management, sloppy and disorganized"
good,"This was my first job and I’ve honestly learned, and grown a lot since starting this job, management was always friendly and accommodating, and always listened to concerns or questions. That being said, because the management team is so laid back, a lot of unprofessionalism at the job went unchecked. Associates would simply not show up for shifts and there were no repercussions. Salary was terrible for the amount of back-breaking work expected to be completed each shift, and was always short staffed."
good,I would usually work between the hours of 5 pm and 5 am. As a Stock associate hours were rough and considering the amount of work needed to be done there was never enough time for anything. Luckily our store manager was reluctant to provide us with the assistance necessary to succeed in our positions. The culture of working for American Eagle was fantastic and the other associate I worked alongside were easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see a hard days work because stocking was nothing to take lightly.
good,"Although it was easy to work with other employees and achieve general level ground, the management was performing so underwhelmingly that it was very hard to go to work."
good,"A typical day at work will consist of watching clothing videos and making sales on the women's floor. I learned patience, the management was always switching out with new people.  the hardest part of working there is not knowing how to speak Spanish."
good,"The discounts earned from working here are wonderful!!!"
good,"I really enjoyed American Eagle. The clothes, customers and peers. High standards but doable on the standard payroll matrix. Upper management not friendly or easy to relate to."
good,"-working with customers "
good,"Teamwork was only mentioned in training, almost never applied practically. The interactions between managers and employees were off from day one. Going into my first day, people were already complaining to me about how much they hated the management."
good,"2 weeks after i started working here i got in a bad car accident and was injured but they still made me come to work because my family didn’t have enough money to take me to the doctors office to get a note even though i was clearly injured. one of the managers pulled me aside and said she was going to fire me if i kept working how i was (note: i was obviously injured because i had scratches from glass and had a very bad concussion...i couldn’t focus at all, had lost some of my memory, and had a migraine) i was trying so hard to work hard but i physically couldn’t. i started crying because i absolutely didn’t know what to do. she then told me to go home and so i would be ready to come back my next shift which was literally 12 hours later. she then got mad the next morning when i wasn’t in perfect condition. i had been in a car 48 hours before that rolled 3 times. i finally took money out of my savings and took myself to the doctor so i could get a note to prove that i shouldn’t be doing anything but laying in bed. before this, i asked for a stock check and my manager got mad at me for asking when there had been many of employees that had asked for them countless times. she said i should know if we had that certain thing in stock when first off there are hundreds of items in the store and second, this was only my second day. after i got better from my accident, they started scheduling me again and then all the sudden they stopped scheduling me. i had a meeting with the manager and she mentioned that i was “seasonal”. i was NEVER told that when i had the job interview. i needed"
good,"I had a bad experience that MOST probably would never have to deal with BUT it was BAD. I was hired at the beginning of the summer in the middle of a remodel, so we were at a temporary location. NO MATTER how fast, sweaty and exhausted us girls (we were in charge of stock) were we were NEVER going fast enough for the GM (there is now a different gm since I left) and always had complaints. When we finally transferred to our newly remodelled location, the back room was so small that we couldnt fit all the back-to-school stuff so they had to rent out a different temporary location for the stock. So this is where it got BAD, this temorary location had NO A/C OR FANS! so they had us running back and forth to this location to process shipment, we sat on dirty floors sweating, and so exhausted. Only after a month or 2 of complaining the company let us get box fans.. but it was still super warm. I doubt anyone will ever go through this but this was my bad experience with AEO."
good,"I enjoyed working here, I didn't have a uniform and I got really good discounts. It was fun but as soon as I started, there was a huge job turnover and almost everyone left. We also got a new district manager who at the time didn't like me. We were always supposed to wear at least one article of clothing that was from AE. And because I chose to do that and pair it was my air maxes or maybe I dressed too Tom bou, she didn't care for me and she was the reason I left. I ask oleft because they cut my hours to like 10 and I have bills to be paid. I did move to customer service to do returns and exchanges, I became a jean expert, and I had the highest number of credit cards on Black Friday so that was cool!"
good,it was long shifts not a big fan of retail with clothing so i was typically tired always at school little rest and little pay. Other than that experience was great met and spoke with many coworkers and customers
good,"it was fun but there was always drama because the employees where mostly females. holidays were better to work, like thanksgiving and black friday. It was ok"
good,Great workplace environment but I am not receiving enough hours and its kind of Unfair and over whelming  because I am a hard worker and  I am always try my best to be on time even though public transportation can some times cause delays  and many times I get to work I am sent home or only work about 2-3 hours . I really enjoy my job but I find it difficult to stay if I  can't get enough  Hours  because I have bills to pay and need a steady income
good,"AEO is a great career during school as it overs many advantages to learning a business, working with typically fun individuals and pretty great discounts on clothes."
good,"This was a fun job at first, within time it started getting different. However, considering it was my first job, it thought me a lot. Within time I got better with selling and handling money at the register."
good,"When you a first time starter the managers really be on your back"
good,Loved it and great discounts. Its hard to move up to full time positions. Manager at time was unprofessional but the staff was great. Met a lot of associates.
good,"Working with American Eagle was a great experience, not only did I enjoy helping customers pick out gifts, outfits, and last minute items to wear out. I had friendly coworkers, great teamwork, and organized managers. The team worked like a well oiled machine each shift all while having fun!"
good,"The shifts were usually short but the managers really made use of their time with you. My job would switch daily between being on the register, folding clothes that were messed up, putting clothes back where they need to be, and working the fitting rooms. The best part of the job was the discount and the few cool coworkers."
good,"american eagle is a fun place to work at but low paying. Everyone is nice and you get to dress how you want to, but you only make minimum wage. It is a good job to start off with"
good,"Constantly changing staff of 60+ people "
good,Working at AE helped me learn how prioritize what was important as far as tasking and learning the basics of making sales by selling to those coming in the store.
good,The workplace culture was up and down. There was not much consistency or incentives to drive you. The compensation is horrendous but you will gain valuable experience at American Eagle
good,"Okay place to work, better paying options in retail field. Management team had inconsistencies and constant miscommunications. Overall some managers are good some are bad."
good,"Since I had a friend that was at the time working at American Eagle, he was trying to recruit people to work on Thanksgiving and Black Friday so I only worked for two days here and it was pretty hectic due to the holiday sales."
good,I really learned a lot working here. I was never the dressy kind of girl. I learned how to really open up and communicate while working with Aerie. Benefits were pretty good we got 40% to 50% off of most items.
good,"Too many managers or supervisors in the store who tell you to do too many things at once and contradict each other. Work itself wasnt bad, pay was cheap for the work that was done but that is why the company is so profitable.."
good,"While working at American Eagle Outfitters, I learned the makeup and environment of a retail environment, specifically in the fashion industry. A day in the life of my day consisted of folding clothes and organizing the sales floor, which became monotonous at times, but I had enjoyable interactions with customers and my coworkers."
good,"when I first started wonderful management and then a new one came to town and was horribly trained but also ruthless. Would never left a finger, treated us horrible and would often talk bad about employees to other employees."
good,"Working here is a standard retail job. The management could use A LOT of work. They are constantly forgetting about important information that sales associates will tell them and are incredibly disorganized. The people I work with are great, but again the management really pushes sales and customer interaction so much that it feels very forced onto the customers. This job is fine for a temporary job, however, there is very little room for advancement."
good,"Most days are light, productive and fun. The environment is friendly and the workers have a very welcoming vibe.  On a side note, it is hard to get hours here."
good,"I did enjoy working here for the time that I did. It wasn't too fast pace for new comers and it's easy to get the hang of. The manegers are very professional in the work place and can be very helpful. Although I did get a lot of hours, the pay isn't that good. I worked there for just over a year and was still getting paid the same that I was when I was first hired. Over all it's a good part time job for students."
good,"The people you work with are great and so is the 60% off discount, but the understaffing is horrendous and you never leave on time which becomes a nuisance."
good,There is room for growth assuming that you are eligible for growth and easy to develop. Work life balance is not great but it is a good starting job for those seeking professional experience.
good,"I enjoyed working for American Eagle Outfitters and I did learn quite a bit about retail. I enjoyed working with customers and helping them with their needs. I also enjoyed setting up and organizing merchandise when shipments arrived. A normal day is laid back, medium paced, and enjoyable. The hardest part of this job was working long hours on holidays. The management at the location where I worked was very poor and was overall the reason why I decided to leave the company. American Eagle Outfitters is a great company to work for, especially for high school and college students."
good,"American Eagle was a great first job for experience. Unfortunately, management was not very good. They stray away from the employee handbook by asking things that are not required or in the job description. If you are under 18 you can’t work more than 4 hours a day. The hours are not good, especially if you aren’t a favorite. In my experience, some managers definitely played favorites. My availability was everyday except for Tuesday’s and after I asked for more hours, I was only scheduled on Saturdays and Sundays for about the last 3 months of my working there. I made amazing friends and now know what it’s like to work retail and I learned a lot but if you’re looking for good money/hours, I would not recommend American Eagle."
good,"I was happy to go to work until they did not schedule me anymore for any days. I liked the constant chances to get free items through their reward system. I enjoyed my job at AE, I just wished it was closer to my house."
good,"Manager and Sr Manager were horrible to work for.  They have their favorites and those were the only ones to receive help, guidance and leadership.  Facilities are beautiful and very modern.  I will say they have started to do satisfaction survey and suggestions and they are working on things to make it a better place to work. But I left before anything  played out to the positive."
good,I really love my job at American Eagle but to me it just seems like there is no space for moving up in that company they would rather hire out of store for those positions.
good,"I have very minimal complaints about this job.  Though it was a fun, upbeat environment, it was only a temporary job that lasted about a month before they just stopped scheduling me."
good,It is a fine job as far as retail goes. The pay isn't anything to be excited for and hours fluctuate dramatically at times. I would recommend it to someone looking for a part time with a great discount.
good,Not much to say about this job did not have many hours. Wasn't very satified with the schedules. The help was there only if they could help you. It was either you knew what you were doing or not.
good,"Its not a bad place to be, an amazing employee discount but other then that I dont know if its best. The higher ups like above the management dont seem to care about you or the store. My manager did but the people above her just hated on all of us and didnt treat us well for all the money they make selling jeans for $60"
good,"I worked for the company for almost 3 years, I loved it all along. Recently all the managers graduated college or had to move to a different area which made the whole environment pretty stressful. Being the only one left there I decided to ask for a raise because I felt that I was putting a lot of work for the salary that I was getting."
good,American eagle is run strictly through corporate standards. There is little to no room to express individuality and to bring unique skills to the table.
good,If in management you will not have a life. There is shadiness throughout the entire company especially from store managers and DM's. The company itself is good.
good,"When I first started at this company there was an active employee culture, lots of incentives, advancement, and even great employee contests. Over the years all of this has lessened and even gone by the way side. There's a large stress put on all metrics, no room for excuses or even facts sometimes. Like many retailers before them, when they start to see a loss at the store level they dig at their employees, asking for more and giving less resources. In my experience, there are PC issues that go unaddressed and bullying from upper level managers on a personal level that is unacceptable. There's a no retaliation policy that gets pushed to the wayside. Managers are pushed out of the business if they don't comply or even hint at dissatisfaction with upper level management. While I know this may not be the case for all stores, this was the case in this district. I was greatly disappointed in my time spent within this company and the way that it ended for many of my peers. They company has adapted the new motto ""We All Can"". This motto is truly something that corporate has invested in and pushes. They need to ensure their employees embody and adapt this motto as well. I saw it within our store and even at a Regional level, but not at the District level."
good,"Really fun place to work, management was a little unstable during my last months which was not enjoyable. I learned a lot and enjoyed my time there, but after two years it was time to go."
good,Fun at first and discount is phenomenal. Pay is too low for amount of work given. Will be asked to multitask on several different duties. Management is good.
good,It was fun at first because I like american eagle clothing but I don't think retail was really for me. Also I didn't always get along with management. I guess because I wasn't as smiley and outgoing as my coworkers
good,"New employees work on the sales floor. You would approach customers, help them in any way you can, promote the store credit card and rewards card, and keep your area clean and organized. Employees are not trained to work register until being with the company for at least 3 months. Given hours depend on how many store cards or reward cards you sell. The more you can sell, the more hours you will get a week."
good,"The managers (at the time) expected the entire staff to go the extra mile to be put on the schedule , there wasn't a professional way to get enough hours. They claimed to have over hired so they wouldn't have the new employees on for weeks."
good,The management is very nice but they don't offer many hours. Most part-time employees only get 4 hours and sometimes that's all you get in a week. it can get boring because there isn't much to do
good,"A typical day at work usually consists of assisting customers and keeping the store recovered and ""5 S Certified"". I have high hopes for management at most stores because when I first started the management was amazing. But then things were realigned and people like to play favorites and put someone who is far less qualified in a position just because they felt like it. The hardest part of the job is that when you are in management, it is a lot of young adults first job and with that being said, it has frequently occurred that they just stop showing up to work without notification."
good,"been awhile since worked there but the days were long"
good,The problem with AE was not the work but the supervisors. They were changed constantly as were the employees. Some supervisors would like you and give you hours while others didn't.
good,"ultimately i cant complain much about my experience working in the environment past my own problems with co workers. it wasn't overwhelming the best job i've had, not was it the worst; the job was also not anything to write home about."
good,I would help check out guests as well as fold clothes and make sure everything was neat. My co-workers and I would switch jobs sometimes and I would be someone who helped in the dressing rooms as well. It was hard to keep up with the fast pace because the clothes would be easily messed up as well. Everyone seems very nice as well but it was unorganized and it stressed me out.
good,"It was a nice experience to work here, although it was my first job and I don't think I was ready for so much commitment at 16, so it was harder for them to see me as a serious worker when I didn't pick up as many shifts as others. Decent experience overall, just really turned me against working in retail ever again."
good,"I like that we could wear everyday clothes and feel comfortable. Management was good, kept us on our toes but I feel they could've done a little better as in equal enforcing rules and regulations and letting up on some. The hardest part of the job was over night stocking because though a lot of the associates calls in to avoid being there over night making it way harder and longer or the ones that did, the ones that didn't show never receiver write ups. i most often had to figure out what I was supposed to be ding rather than being shown that to do properly and I'm a pretty fast learner when shown what to do."
good,"While working at American eagle i did lots of customer service, stocking and cashier. I was working during Black Friday so i gain lots of experience with customer service."
good,"Not much to say. Worked in the stockroom so that I did t have to deal with people. Management was super nice though, and surprisingly the customers were as well."
good,"It was a great place to get your foot in the door for retail, but not much more. I don't think they value the employees. They can also do better with management."
good,I always wanted to work for American Eagle only because it was my favorite store to shop at. The working environment was hacked from time to time. Only because I was at one of the biggest stores in the locations. It was long hours after closing because my manger like everything to be nice and neat. I learn how to fold jeans correctly and much faster.
good,"American Eagle is a fun place to work at times; it's almost too fun. Management seemed young and fairly irresponsible. Compensation left a lot to be desired for a job that required a lot of energy. However, they have the best employee discount I've ever seen."
good,"I worked there for 10 & a half years mostly in packing department at distribution center, also floated around a couple different departments throughout the years. I unfortunately got very sick with my second pregnancy and was wrote off from doctors excuse with a High Risk Pregnancy and could not return during that time, but they still terminated me from the company, plus they ended up moving out east . So if you have a medical problem or injury or cancer they will find a way to terminate you."
good,"In my opinion retail jobs (especially at the mall) tend to suck. AE wasn't horrible I was pretty good at it so I typically got the schedule I desired. I was an associate so the pay sucked (min wage) but the 40% (to up to 60% sometimes) was great! Needless to say I shopped there a lot, which is essentially what they want. Managers were all young and blah but they weren't horrible."
good,"stocking, cleaning up what customers unfolded"
good,"Working here briefly I have nothing completely negative to say. Being productive is a must. The employee discount is amazing that is probably all that I miss about this place, working environment is okay."
good,"A very hectic environment. Good atmosphere, good music to have while working.  Somewhat organized system, time to clock out is most time an issue. Over all a good place to work if you are in high school or starting college."
good,"relationship building with the costumer and putting them first and making sure they leave with a good experience. Tasking at down time, putting out new product."
good,For a part time retail job it was probably the best. Typical days could vary between being really slow or to being quite busy.
good,"Doesn't offer a lot of hours, shifts are usually only three hours long. Although the staff is friendly and the environment is welcoming"
good,"Morning shift ; open cashes, get all paper work ready (schedule/deposits/audit the paper work from last night). "
good,People were friendly and nice environment. The workplace was space limited and too must dust and stocking. Learned new things about sales.
good,"Travailler chez AE était une très bien opportunité car, j'ai appris beaucoup sur la vente et le service à la clientèle et sur les magasins de vêtement , Mes dix moi passé la bas était plein d'aventure et expérience."
good,American Eagle is a great company to work for if you work under the right management. The company could do more for their employees.
good,"Training not long enough."
good,"I helped customers with sales and purchasing. I worked on the floor, behind the register, and in stock. I loved all the diversity I got with the job."
good,"I've had to wear many hats as an assistant manager with a day-to-day work life that is completely unpredictable. At it's core my job is to help lead an apparel based sales force by training employees how to make sales, accommodate customers, and build brand loyalty. But on any given day I have been put in charge of such varied tasks as marketing, processing shipment both through importing and exporting, budgeting, bookkeeping, tracking online sales, dealing with customer issues, writing reports, and manual labor like cleaning, store rearrangement, and even on a few occasions basic carpentry."
good,"I have been a store manager at American Eagle for about 7 months now. The training program for external managers is only 2 weeks. I do not believe that 2 weeks is enough time to properly train an external store manager on all processes of the company. If you do not have seasoned ASMs in your store when you get there you are pretty much screwed. "
good,Everyday it's lively and very up to beat. I learned more about the retail business while working there. Management was nice  very welcoming. CO-workers for the most part were cool also. The hardest part of the job was the rude customers. But the good customers were always better than the rude customers.
good,"It was a comfortable work environment and for the most part was a fun place to be around. The store itself was relatively small and would sometimes become overcrowded and it become difficult to shop or get anything done. A normal day of work would be to talk to shoppers, put away the inventory, and manage the clothes. The co-workers were very nice people and would always be willing to help anyone when they needed assistance, whether they be a customer, or a fellow employee. The hardest part of the job was being there in the afternoon, when the most people would show up, it would sometimes become hard to get anything done with so many people. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the other employees, they made the job a lot of fun."
good,"Supplying fixtures to new store locations, remodel, and relocations around the world. Managed maintenance requests, projects, and new stores. Processed invoices and worked with multiple suppliers on a daily basis."
good,It was a seasonal position and not much to say.  Organizing clothing and managment was okay.  The clothing I loved and I learned how to fold pants and put them on shelf.
good,"My General Manager is one of the best managers I know. She always offers her support and will always help you need be. The floor sets are always really late at night till early morning, so not many people are there to chit-chat."
good,A typical day of work would consist of me trying to sell clothing to customers or getting what they needed. I learned to be more sociable with customers and how to be more efficient with my time. My co-workers were really nice and I enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of my job was reorganizing piles of clothing after customers messed it up. The most enjoyable part was the reactions of customers when I got them exactly what they wanted because it made me feel good.
good,"This job had to transport parts to locations, I learned how to read a map, strap down parts. The management was helpful. Had to work on my own on this job, had a hard staying up on long road trips. Got stressful on me."
good,"My short time  working at American Eagle I had experienced a fast pace work environment.The hardest part of my job would be picking out mens clothing simply because I am un aware of the sizing difference.All my coworkers were well groomed and kept up, as well as respectful and responsible for there duties on job."
good,"The company is a great place to learn more about retail and to advance in sales experiences, but the environment can be very hostile. There is room for improvement on the Managerial side of the business."
good,Had a great time with coworkers and the atmosphere was always fun and light.
good,"Working at American was a typical day at work. Coming in assisting customers, restocking the shelves, inventory, working the dressing room and making sure they are well kept. The managers were very approachable and understanding. Co-workers were friendly and helpful to each other when the store was busy."
good,great atmosphere for anyone that is young and lives at home. Paychecks where small due to employer had lack of hours to give.
good,"I worked here during the Thanksgiving/Christmas holiday season, and it was extremely busy all the time. Very fast-paced, must be up on your toes and alert at all times. Management wasn't really that good, they kind of just expected us to know exactly what to do and how to do it. My co-workers were nice, but kind of stuck up because they've all mostly been there for a while. I feel like job wouldn't have been so hard if we would have been taught properly by management/supervisors, but it wasn't so bad. I'm sure that if I would have joined the team at a different time, it would have been better.. my first day being Black Friday probably wasn't such a good thing!"
good,"-Management was understanding and flexible"
good,"After clocking into work, we meet with whom ever is the LOD which means Leader On Duty, and they prep us for the hourly and daily goal that has to be made by the end of the day. We set goals for ourselves and explain to our manager how are are going to excel in it. Once that is said, we go to our section and start selling to our customers. If it gets super busy, the manager might ask us to jump on the register to kill the line or help out in the fitting to put away some of the clothes the costumers left behind. During down time, we use that time to recover the floor and replenish on low merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that there is fabulous support from the staff. Everyone and anyone is willing to give out a helping hand."
good,"since I was a temporary employee I wasn't able to fully experience a full work shift only working 2 days and 2 hours per day. but the time that I was there it was very fast paced- being black Friday, but I believe I handled it excellently. I helped customers pick outfits and take whatever clothes they didn't want back."
good,"I really liked the co workers, but the management was definitely lacking,"
good,"A typical day at work consists of selling on the floor, replenishing and recovering product and being customer first. I'm proud to consider myself a former employee."
good,"Normal retail environment with sales, cash handling, and a great deal of importance placed upon customer service. Improved my customer service skills to a great degree and the management team was very supportive to help improve job skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was being creative in talking to customers and helping people find their own style in your store."
good,"fast paced"
good,stand by the door and great customers with a hearty hello!..fitting room shift....tedious folding of clothes and they need to be extremely neatly stacked...loud music blasting all day and they are suppose to let you rotate sections but sometime the manager forgets you depending on your sections and sometimes they forget your breaks...i learned that american eagle has the most affordable and comfortable fit for jeans...i hated closing shift closing can be anywhere from 12am to 3am depending on how messy the store was.
good,"Shifts were short, but everyone was very lively and vocal. There was always people having fun while they worked. management and coworker were very pleasant to be around"
good,the company is great hip and great room for growth
good,"The store was pretty boring. The location is no longer there, but was very fast-paced. On slow days, the job was pretty miserable. The co-workers were great. The management was great also. I liked that you stay busy all the time."
good,"A normal day will have three or four spurts of busy work, but the rest is usually monotonous folding of clothes and returning clothes that customers or would be customers leave around."
good,A typical day at work was smooth. Time occasionally passed quickly enough but at other times it felt slower than ever. Your customer service skills become improved as you meet a variety of different people throughout different times of the day. Co-workers were always bright and optimistic. They were always there whenever you need anything. The hardest part of the job was dealing with scums of the managers. They were very unorganized and were highly favorable to others.
good,"Don't like the way when people get promoted to Management positions the lazy, helpless factor comes into effect for them. Before Management position they would go out of their way to help other co-workers, after forget it. Now it's like they are totally handicapped, while members of Management stand in the cash and wrap area they refuse to hop on a register and quickly take care of a customer,as they say ""I'm in Management that is not my job"". I guess customer service is to be provided only by hourly associates. After awhile it does gets childish and ridiculous, no professionalism at all."
good,A typical day was cleaning the store and folding clothes as well as helping customers pick out clothing. I learned a lot about the new styles and ways to sell. The management was wonderfull and very helpful and understanding. I had very friendly co workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell clothes to people who were just looking. The most enjoyable part was seeing people leave the store happy.
good,Fun environment
good,"American Eagle is recognized for its jeans and when you work there you get to know those jeans inside and out. I learned how to sell and sell effectively, while working at American Eagle and the company's after reap the benefits. The management team wasn't so wonderful, but my co-workers always needed encouragement. That taught me how to be a caring but firm manager. It also taught me how to train those to make them shine like a new penny, helping my part-timers become and feel more important made me proud but made others a little uneasy. The hardest part was facing reality about the workplace when it comes to being a manager and the differences between levels, but that was also the most enjoyable part and learning the manager that I was becoming."
good,"A typical day working for American Eagle Outfitters included customer assistance, extensive product knowledge and maintaining a upbeat attitude throughout the day. Floor management is always helpful to customers and informative, relaying daily goals and numbers, throughout the day. The hardest part of the job is the physical demand bending, climbing and stretching. With friendly co-workers and a diverse customer base the most enjoyable part of the job is working with and meeting new people."
good,"It's a good job for a high school student or if you are in college and you need money. It's a lot of work, especially during Chritmas, but I loved the Christmas season. I really did enjoy it there though."
good,"Ok. Great pay, but unstable policy and procedures. They fire people for random reasons, like having a profile on LinkedIn or being friends with co workers on Facebook."
good,Store managers and assistant managers that were employed during my time there were for the most part very good people. They were all being pushed out and most of the staff followed quickly. The ability to advance is only there if you are willing to relocate. Hardest part of the job is sitting through the computer trainings. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that I worked with.
good,American Eagle is a great place to work.
good,"Good benefits... Fun work environment BUT it depends who you are working for. Lots of unneeded politics. I'm going to work to work, not to deal with drama."
good,The company had a great culture when I started. Fun place to work and help outfit customers and sell them merchandise. Over time the company began quickly turning over managers which changes the stores atmosphere every year or less.
good,It was ok but in alot of parts can be improved. They have great contest and people that work there. Overall i liked it just needed something a little better in pay.
good,Could compensate employees who work hard better. Better opportunity for advancement
good,it was work it was only part time so i didn't really get a chance to enjoy work but i did enjoy the customer interaction and the managers were always nice
good,It’s a good company to work for if your looking for part time. You learn a lot about customer service and the retail field. I enjoyed working there. The discounts were amazing.
good,Their products are reliable as i wear them too and what makes working there so amazing is that they have their employees  wearing their products or products similar to what they sell. The atmosphere is relaxed and laidback as well as management and customers.
good,"AEO was a great first job, the discount is great and helpful. the clothes are very fashionable and as a former employee our customer service was great"
good,"Well, I am not the right person to answer"
good,Good part time job. Works with my schedule. The discount for employees is good. The job is not focused on making you sign people up for credit cards which is a huge plus.
good,The company as a whole is really amazing and has the customers interest at heart. Plus the clothes are amazing and the discount is worth it. However the management at this typical location is not the greatest. No investment done on part of newer employees and the good employees are worked to death instead of being rewarded. No matter how good you do you never get the recognition you deserve.
good,"When working here, I would make sure that the tables looked nice and that everything was folded. I would help customers to find what they are looking for as well as help them to the dressing rooms or to check out."
good,"I remember working at AEO and having a great time organizing the sales floor and helping customers. I learned how to pitch on the sales floor, how to use a cash register, how to restock, along with so many other important life skills. My favorite part of this company was the inclusion and diversity that they encouraged."
good,"This was a retail customer service job that consisted of night and weekend shifts for me. A typical shift was four hours which would consist of folding clothes, helping customers, restocking clothes, and cashiering."
good,"Wasn’t the best work, there was way too many employees and no hours, was promised position that i ended up never getting then went through 3 managers in a couple of months"
good,"American Eagle is a cool job. Customers and work schedule can be a hand full. Managers will put you to the test in order to see how good your work critic is, and it’s possible to switch positions."
good,"This job consisted of dealing with over 40 customers a day, working the cash register and the floor trying to achieve sales goals. At the end of the night making sure the store is in adequate order"
good,"American Eagle was a fun, fast-paced place to work. They care for you and want what is best for you. The headsets are a little annoying to deal with.."
good,"If you are starting out with working AEO is a good choice. they do hire seasonal people to the group, and if you have a good work ethic then they could possible make you a full fledged team member. the hours are short but worth the experience in the work force of customer service."
good,American Eagle is a great company to work for if you have the right managers. A lot of work requirements get pushed under the table and not prioritized.
good,"entrar a tiempo para en el menor tiempo posible y con la mejor actitud atender al cliente para satisfacerlo en toda manera, generar ventas y tener la tienda en orden en todo momento, así como darte cuenta de tus debilidades y fortalezas, sólo el trato gerente - empleado creo podría mejorar como si fueras otro cliente y viceversa."
good,I worked at American Eagle while I was in high school as a part time employee to make extra money. I left American Eagle because they did not give their employees enough hours.
good,"a typical day at work for the first year and a half, I would usually be a cashier and ring people up. For the last few months I did shipment and stock. The hardest part of the job was the credit card and Rewards card penetration"
good,"In the store, I worked at management scheduled people they liked/knew better rather than making it an even playing field for everyone. The training was not the best, but hands-on learning while working was the best way to learn the ins and outs anyways. The discount is great.."
good,"Working there wasn’t very hard, the customers could be rude at times but that was just something you had to deal with. The pay was there but the hours weren’t, once school started."
good,"AE treated me well overall. While some may have been overlooked for certain promotions, and while there may be some support lacking from the higher-ups to their ground floor employees, it was still a mostly positive experience."
good,It's not all of that to me and doesn't fit my needs as an adult. It's ok for younger high school or college kids who need extra money. Not for those who have bills in my opinion!
good,"Great people work here. Typically a job for someone in high school or PT college student. I liked it but they were underpaying me, thats the only reason i left. I’d work there again if they payed more."
good,A typical day at work was customer focus on the sales floor and also trying to accomplish all tasks given for the day. I learned how to have stronger multi-tasking skills and to make a very productive priority list. Also how important it is to make sure your people feel appreciated and that they all have the opportunity to grow.
good,"great team and environment to work, as i was stock room supervisor, i was hardly on the shop floor, which was great as you could listen to your own music and get on with the job."
good,"This seemed like a decent place to work and potentially build a career when I first started working.  However, as a manager a was prevented from implementing positive changes and solutions to daily/weekly/monthly/yearly problems.  AEO’s focus is selling high interest bearing credit cards to customers, not clothing.  Weekly phone calls with the district manager pertained only to issuing credit cards, not fixing the stores overall problems of staffing and business in general."
good,"The staff is very nice, i genuinely have no complaints about the staff. One thing i didn’t like about American Eagle is that their hours aren’t dependable at all. The schedules aren’t firmly made. For example, when the schedule is uploaded it’s not for sure because in the middle of the week a manager might just change someone’s days or hours completely."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company. Had many corporate and structural changes during my time of employment, some good...some not. Hard to keep a work-life balance with a family but hey, that's retail!"
good,"Through this job, I was able to gain retail experience. I have also improved my communication and sales skills. The managers and my coworkers were kind and encouraging."
good,"This was my first job which I was so grateful to have because I had no prior experience and plus I needed the pocket change. Well, everything was good at first I was working part-time and I got a GREAT discount from the job because if you shop here on the regular then you know the clothes aren't cheap so the discount was heaven sent. I felt a little hostility from one of my managers but I didn't say anything about it I just did what I was told and kept the environment friendly. At that particular time when I worked there, there was already a good amount of people working so I was only working maybe 3-4 hours a day. I got a 10-minute break since I only worked for a short amount of time, one manager in particular (can't name) did not like when employees talked to each other and would get on the mic several times throughout the day with an attitude and claim that we weren't doing enough (which was not true because other employees and myself were doing everything in our power to get the job done). she was also rude to customers sometimes and within my last few months of working there, I was literally only scheduled to work maybe 2 days out of two weeks (we got paid bi-weekly) for 3-4 hours. so every time I got paid I was bringing home between $30-40 dollars and the manager who didn't too much care for me was in charge of the schedule so I blame her for that. The managers also sent out this long paragraph saying how if we were to get caught on our phones then we would get a warning then possibly lose our job the next time around. But literally, every supervisor or manager that was"
good,"The branch I worked at in Balzac, AB has bad management. It is impossible to be given opportunities to move up in the company as the main branch manager hires her close friends instead of hard working employees."
good,pay isn’t good and the discounts just changed so they aren’t as good as they were. would be good for a high school stupid that doesn’t have real bills
good,The job had a lot of perks but it's very fast paced with so many people coming in and out of the store. Everybody is kind of just on top of you but it's a fairly easy job.
good,"I worked there while in college, was a laid back fun place to work with flexible hours and didn't have any problems with management or co workers. Not a good career job tho."
good,Overall my time at American eagle has be okay. They haven’t really given me hours to prove myself to be a good worker so when i do work or did it was a little hard for me because i only spend a little bit of time there i wasn’t very familiar with the store and where things were so that made it complicated but a few managers in there are very helpful.
good,"There were some good things about working here, but for the most part I didnt gain much from the experience. I was barely able to reach the manager, but it seemed like every other employee had her contact information but I was never given it. It’s hard to get on the schedule. My first week I only worked one day for 3 1/2 hours. Wasn’t put on the schedule for the following week. My training provided little detail about specific things."
good,"typical day at work is aiding in sales goal, folding clothes, cleaning. Workers there are helpful and friendly. Management isn't well organized and lack communication with one another. Hardest part of the job is closing late, and overworked for the time being there. Enjoyable part is learning more about customer service skills, and friendships"
good,It was a pointless job with no raises and unfair promotions. They often hired from outside the company and based hours on the number of credit cards you were able to secure for the company.
good,"A typical day at work was a  little uncomfortable, i say this because i never knew what to expect or what i would be doing. i learned how to have patience somewhat. the gentleman wasn't the best i just felt as though i never knew what to do. the hardest part of the job was the pressure i felt while doing the job it was a little pushy."
good,"they are very structured and have a good mission. all of the sales goals are reachable, it is just not a career for me it was just a in the mean time job that i enjoyed"
good,"Good energy. During peak buisness there are lots of hours, off-season not as many. People are always looking for shifts to be covered. Great discounts."
good,"Sales associate helped costumers with anything they needed to find like jeans or tops. Work is fun at times and busy on weekends, don’t get as much hours what so ever but make the best out of it."
good,"Overall, it was. fairly decent job. Not enough pay for how much work you do during a shift. I loved my manager, but the other assistant manager caused a lot of drama, which is the main reason I ended up leaving."
good,"The pay at American Eagle may not be the best for associates, but we get a great discount! Sometimes the hours are not the best, but they try not to make the schedule unbearable. Management is often changing, so how much they are liked really just depends on who the managers are at the moment."
good,The work environment is really good . The customers are great most of the time . The pay rate can be nice & the job hours are good work as much as you can .
good,"I would go in whenever they had me scheduled and usually I worked the fitting rooms, which required me to allow people in and out to try on clothes. In this position, I had to keep a careful eye out for theft. If I wasn't in the fitting rooms, I was either working the register, where I would make transactions for purchases and returns, or I would be on the floor, greeting costumers, reorganizing the clothes, or cleaning up a workspace. My manager kept me busy, but it was a boring job that required hours on my feet."
good,Working with American Eagle Outfitters was a good first retail job. However it was often extremely busy and hard to answer questions. The organization could have been better at times but I felt confident in my tasks for the most part. I am grateful for the opportunity and for being pushed to be more assertive and find ways to engage more with the customers.
good,"day starts off with manager placing you on floor and asking you the sales goal (which they already know) then goes on to tell you how to do your job after that you spend the entire day being yelled at by managers to ""connect with that customer"" even though theyve already seen you talk to that person 10x and now that customer is getting angry with you because you keep ""connecting"" aka harassing them also managers play favorites and will literally skip over you in promotions and give promotions to people who do nothing but converse with them (the managers) all day long in other words there are better jobs out there with more than 4 hour shifts"
good,"i worked 3-6 hours twice a week on average. "
good,"The work environment can be stressful, but the team work and well organized management allow for a good work environment and helps build trust between employees and management."
good,Everyone gets along with each other. Some are younger than others which is where you may see individuals who want a job but not to work and physically help to a beneficial amount.
good,"If you work more than part time there are more opportunities to advance positions, but as part-time work you stay doing the same work. Hardest part was selling and helping customers."
good,"good quality"
good,It was a overwhelming experience that was a little bit more enjoyable than the most first time I was in there and was so happy to finally be in a cool work environment
good,"The day is mostly spent assisting shoppers by alerting them of store promotions, assisting in finding their sizes or desired item of clothing, and following through until the transaction is complete. The most enjoyable part of the job is the socialization with shoppers and coworkers who all have the same general interest. The hardest part of the job is being on schedule for hours where the store is not busy with little opportunity to task or sell."
good,They offer good discounts but go through a lot of bad store managers that don't care about the employees. Most associates are friendly and willing to help each other
good,"This is a great company to work for if you're a teenager or college student but not for an Adult with real bills. The discounts are great as well, but they're contingent upon meeting your daily credit card goals."
good,"Definitely wouldn't make a career out of it but it was a pretty fun job while I was in high school. "
good,"During my orientation, I remembered there was a large amount of information about the different types of jeans sold in the store. My first day of working, one of the managers asked me about each pair of jeans sold & describe them in detail  and I honestly did not remember due to the large amount of information was given. After that it seems he looked a bit frustrated with the lack of information I provided. My confidence level went extremely down and ever since I did not enjoy working here due to the crazy amount of pressure and expectations. Managers should understand it takes TIME to LEARN and not throwing them on the spot. Lack of training was also involved as I was expected to know how the store runs...  I worked here for a short amount of time just because this one manager ruined my confidence in working for this company. The other managers on the other hand are great! same with the employees!"
good,Managers control every single thing you do minute by minute yet your expected to do things without being told. Their available work hours are very small and limited because all managers get to choose the times and days they work first then you just get thrown in the schedule wherever. and it's rare to get a break.
good,"Typical day includes merchandising, organizing back rooms and providing excellent customer service. While working I’ve learned how to interact with fellow employees on a business level"
good,"When i worked there, the management was not nice to their employees, barely gave scheduled breaks, would barely schedule you then be upset if you had a second job. Just not a very pleasant place to work for me."
good,Fast-paced work environment with barely any room to breathe. Too much pressure to make hourly sales. Always cutting hours so you have to do more than a one person job.
good,"great culture and friendly people to work with in the company, all group leads are very friendly and will to help and teach you the Job at any time..."
good,"People were great and most customers were nice, but it was boring mostly cleaning and up selling to clients. Never really worked with cash  register and never really got hours"
good,"At the time, I was working two jobs.  They did NOT coordinate with my schedule/availibility.  I would go in and write when I could get there and start, and they would schedule me WHILE I was still at my other job...."
good,My favorite part about my job is meeting new people every day and teaching 16-18 year olds all about life outside of customer service. I love how everyday brings something new.
good,I enjoyed the people that I worked with. Management was okay but changed very frequently. The retention rate was not high. I gained good customer service experience from this job.
good,I enjoyed my experience working at American Eagle. I was sad to have to leave but at the time the district manager was not being a very ethical and people became uncomfortable
good,"AEO has very flexible hours and with the majority of the staff at stores being between the ages of 18 and 30 most of the associates are students thus management is pretty flexible and will work with your class/exam schedule or if you're simply looking for a second part-time job. The discounts on the clothes are great with them renewing each month you get between 40%-80% off and the company often rewards with free items or extra discounts to the associates who help bring in large sales. No commission, so it helps everyone work as a team. No consistent pay raises are done except for the federal mandatory ones, usually you get a raise after each year you work there but honestly the policy on that is very inconsistent and seems to change as often as the seasons. The only true way to get pay raises are with promotions- which if you work hard and are available more than your peers wont be a problem getting. In terms of Management, I've had a really good team of managers supervising me during my time, however I've been with the company long enough to know it is not the case company wide. If you want to make it a career job, it will take a few years to get to a manager position and you have to show on a consistent basis why you should be, also it seems to be a work culture thing to be a ""favorite"" of your current supervisor and definitely your District Manager, otherwise I've seen people get overlooked."
good,"Great job for teenagers in high school or just starting college and does great with school schedules and was halfway decent money aswell. Travel not bad, plenty of opportunities for travel too!"
good,The work environment was not as fun as I thought it would be. Everybody took their job a lot more seriously than they should and it seems like they didn't really enjoy working there.
good,It was just a seasonal position that I did not really care about I can't really say too much about the job overall I must say that the experience did not have much to offer. MEH.
good,this job did not sharpen my skills as a man but in the sense of semantics and job place popularity contest i was tested and remained victorious among the droolers.
good,I liked this job it was inconvenient that my transportation failed because I enjoyed it a lot. great managers very helpful and the set you up to be in a successful position.
good,It was pretty fun while it lasted but I did not recieve many hours. I learned a great source of team work and how to fold. Working at american eagle seasonally I also learned that a job can be fun.
good,"this was more of a seasonal job for me. the only issue I had was that when the ""season"" was over they just stopped scheduling me there was no conversation or anything I just hadn't gotten any hours for like a month so I just resigned"
good,American Eagle Outfitters can be a great place to work for those who are willing to buy into the brand and the company mantra.  It is typical of most retailers in terms of hourly pay but what separates this company if the discounts they offer.  The schedule is flexible and they do like to promote from within the company.
good,"They kept putting me only in the fitting room for the period of time spent there even after asking to move around and do different stuff , meanwhile all the other people I got hired with(about 10 of us) had more hours and were even doing cashier!!"
good,It is a goal oriented job by conutious updates on sales. I love the people I work with management is ready to listen and want every associate to be comfortable.
good,"Overall it was a nice job to just walk into. Starting your shift is very easy & casual. It’s easy going, just make your sales & it will be okay, help people with their orders that they bring back in, make your sales for credit cards. The shift is very easy going."
good,The staff knows how to train well. They know how to make an company work well together. They train on everything from the floor to the back room. If yo I pick a certain place to work they respect it.
good,"Training Manager/Cashier/Floor Sales"
good,"Good paying job, very up paced enviroment, team player job, which you are only as strong as the team your with. Management was good as well. work culture was strong minded people that knew there tasks and completed it."
good,Its typically slow during the days but busy on weekends. The hardest part would be dealing with challenging customers. AE is always changing but its a good place to be.
good,I got hired seasonally and the environment was just messy. One of the managers was always after me and was constantly rude. It was a good learning experience in retail but I wouldn't go back.
good,"Knowing how some retail positions can be, American Eagle was not too bad. As an employee the discount was really good and the environment was rather friendly."
good,"AEO is all about customer interaction and their sales. They help build your skills in all the fields necessary to be a great associate. The managers were bad, but the discounts are crazy amazing."
good,"It was a great job. I was happy to go into work. we would clock in, write down  our goals for the day, such as sales, how many transactions per shift and how much a customer spends on each transaction. we would watch a video about the stores new arrivals and how to improve selling skills. at the end of the shift we would review the goals we set and if we achieved them with our LOD. "
good,"I started out as a regular sales associate, then a Stock Supervisor, then eventually made it as a sales lead manager.  I loved the associates I worked with.  They made the work environment fun and so did some customers.  BUT the corporate office, district manager, etc. kept giving the management busy work that needed to be done quickly and efficiently BUT there was never enough time to do it.  Most of the day-to-day work tasks definitely needed to be done in order to make the business successful, it was just too much in one day, during one shift.  I was with the company for so many years and I don't ever remember it being hard on the management team or the associates.  Associates and some management felt obligated to stay with the company, even after GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE, and having other full time jobs."
good,"Upon arriving my job I would get greeted by my manager. After clocking in, my manager would fill out a paper on my sale goal for the day and I would walk around and help any customers that are in need. I have learned the importance on sales and how important it is to be able to communicate with all customers. The managers would usually help out and hourly tell the workers whether we had made the amount of money that is needed for the day. Although getting customers sign up for an American Eagle credit card may be difficult my favorite part of my job is cleaning the rooms by folding clothes and talking to customers and helping the customers."
good,"Working at AE was fun, but the customers are a rough bunch. Being that the target demographic is teens, it's tough to manage unruly kids as customers. Staffing was generally OK, but it always seemed like we were shortstaffed. Benefits were OK, but working in a mall is not all it's cracked up to be. 30 minute lunch breaks are too short to be able to actually leave the area for lunch. Management was a mixed bag, but mostly OK. They were always very demanding, but it seemed like they cared that you personally succeeded. It wasn't just about $$$ all the time."
good,It has been a long time but from what I remember it was an enjoyable part time job would have stayed longer if the pay was better. Other than that its a good start for someone in high school or who just started college.
good,It was a fast paced environment to work at but sometimes the hours wasn't steady because they were overly staffed so your shift would be cut short sometimes. It was a nice environment to work at. I hated standing on my feet long periods of time.
good,A typical day at work consist of assisting customers in their shopping experience while collaborating with coworkers. The goal is to provide the best customer service in order to push sales.
good,My overall review is pretty good other than some of the managers are too much about themselves and they talk at instead of to customers and employees. They also play favorites of employees in the time I was working there.
good,"Fast paced, deadline driven environment. Hours depend on your position title. Must be able to collaborate, make impactful decision making, and work extended hours if needed."
good,"I started working at the soho location when I was 17. It was my first retail  job so  I did not know what to expect. Hardest part of the job was the excessive stalking of customers which basically shown your value as a ""seller"" instead of valuing the customers space and well being. Overall it was a stable job."
good,This is a successful company that is always looking to hire on new employees with a passion for retail. This job is great because it is offered in so many different areas it’s easy to transfer to another store.
good,"If you're looking for somewhere to work but not have to do a whole lot, this is where you wanna work. Plus, awesome employee discounts and ability to preview upcoming styles."
good,general warehouse duties - load and unload trucks and inspect incoming shipments for quality control - use pallet jacks and compluter systems to check in product
good,"i have been here for three years, it is a interesting place to work.i am knowledgeable in almost everything around the store. i can work cashier to floorsets."
good,"I worked there three years ago, so I cannot say whether or not the employees are the same. However, at the time the management was very rude and disorganized. There were way too many employees hired and the bare minimum of hours was given Eventually they let a lot of us go."
good,"In AEO, its all about the image. If your look is good then you can go far. Customer service was number one in my store, and an excellent shopping experience was a must for every guest. Management was hardworking and cared about their staff. Matching customers up with their right look was the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"You could get a decent discount anytime you went in. The management team was great, everyone was friendly. It would get busy sometimes, mostly around the holiday."
good,"I did not like working here. Hours were too scarce, and the customers for the most part were rude and unruly. I would not recommend working here at all."
good,"The work environment isn't terrible. Its a factory job, so you're going to need to put in some effort to make it there. The biggest downside is the management and systems they have there. They ""say"" that the systems are regularly updated, however, that's not the case. The picker/packer systems mess up quite regularly but instead of trying to fix the issue, they find it easier to blame the user instead. Overall, if you keep your head low and just do what the job requires, its a decent job to stick with."
good,"Greeting customers, censoring clothes, setting up tables with merchandise."
good,"Work is easy to comprehend and understand, but there no opportunities for advancement after becoming a group lead, You do get to learn all the ins and outs of retail production."
good,"Each day was different at American Eagle. Some days were fast paced and fun, others were not. It worked out as a job to work part time and make some money during college."
good,American Eagle is a very eager and consistent place to work. There is usually the same amount of people in the store every day I had worked. Giving my personal opinion to customers was easy to help them find what they are looking for. And cash is always easy.
good,"Typical day at work was dealing with customers concerns and questions, selling to customers using American eagle standards and to keep clothing neatly folded and tidy"
good,"The sales associates that worked at American Eagle were really great and friendly to work with but, the managers were horrible in my opinion. They were just really rude and were not understanding at all! I got into a car accident the day before my shift, I called in and told the manager that I would not be able to make it in because I was in accident the day before and wanted to go to the hospital to get my back checked since it was starting to hurt. They told me that if I cant find anyone to cover then I HAD to come into work. No one covered my shift so I was forced to coming in with horrible back pain."
good,Good first job. Sold our companies loyalty such as credit cards and rewards system. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers and working closely with the customers to help them reach their goal.
good,"If you like the clothing or fashion industry, then go for it.  It's a retail job so it can be stressful at times, but it can also be a fun atmosphere to work in."
good,During my time working at American Eagle Outfitters Distribution i found a quick paced working environment that was satisfying. The days seemed to just fly by which made for a palatable work schedule.
good,This was my first job. While it was did not pay a lot it did allow me to work on my social skills. They did not give a lot of hours. They not as understanding of my schedule as I think they should have been.
good,American eagle was a very boring company to work for. No benefits and average pay eventually made me decide to leave. I didn't like harassing customers.
good,"It's avg. I don't value benefits or pay too much as time off. You get a little of that. Can't work from home from time to time because 'meetings'."
good,I learned hard work pays off. I learned how to discipline myself every day to be a productive employee. I most enjoyed working in the shipping department.
good,I have been doing Floor set at American Eagle for a little over a year and I don't really have any complaints. The way I see it I can be sleeping or making money and I'll take money any day.
good,"The environment was sometimes over whelming. Some of the staff were not so nice, but the discount was amazing.  Pro's: Discount, pretty flexible. Con's: At times it was an uncomfortable environment. A lot of clothes to fold at the end of the shift."
good,"Started out in the stock room. Moved up to management very fast. A great place to learn about customer service, sells and marketing. Fashion opportunities gallor!"
good,"On a day to day basis, the associates can go through a set of tasks. One task is they could be a greet to every customer that walks in or they could be folding denim. If its a slow day associates could be tasked with bringing more product onto the floor or possibly cleaning up the store."
good,"Good benefits, ok pay, poor communication but nothing it can be fixed. Great opportunity to work with people from different background. Also the discounts are great."
good,I enjoyed my short time working at American Eagle for the most part. My co-workers were very nice and my managers always told me how good I was doing at my job and that I would most likely move to a Sales Associate rather than Seasonal Sales Associate. What made me leave was the fact that I was not receiving the amount of hours that I was told I would get when hired meaning I was getting paid basically nothing and I lived a good 30 to 40 minutes away which was not worth the drive and gas money I was using.
good,"working in retail is always the worst, inflexible schedule with school or other jobs and the pay is never great, however it is great experience for people who are out of high school"
good,You come in and help fold your specific section of clothes while also attending customers.  If you are working fitting room you help customer into a room and help with go backs.
good,"Working here was fine but my shifts were often cut and when they were I didn't get any kind of notification that my shifts were cut so I would up and be told ""your hours have been cut so you can go home"" which was really annoying since I live 30mins away."
good,"easy job, not too much in-depth training. Great for anyone in school but not an ideal career path. flexible hours and minimum wage Fun work environment"
good,"Fun place for part time work in college, Not ideal for career opportunities. Long Hours, weekends, night and some overnight shifts required. Employee Discount is a nice perk."
good,"Managers made sure to make staff aware that they (the managers) were not there to be friendly with coworkers and were not there to help someone learn to do their job, they simply expected the work to be done."
good,When I worked there I had a lot of fun the co-workers where nice and great to talk to. I just didn’t like aerie  was separated from American Eagel. If you worked on the Aerie said you were alone all day and didn’t see anyone all day.
good,"At times working can be fun, especially if you're friendly and outgoing, but also managers tend to stress you out when it comes to selling the product and getting customers to apply for credit cards. Not too bad but it does not feel worth it for minimum wage."
good,"I work on finding online orders for customers, packing every order and send it out. I help customers find items that they need. Management is great, every manager has been very comprehensive and easy to work with. The hardest part about the job is grumpy customers."
good,American Eagle at Jordan Creek Parkway is a very fast paced environment. Most of the employees are a joy to work with. There is always plenty to do to help your shift go by fast
good,"would definitely suggest working here"
good,"The job was great for a college student, and I enjoyed my time with the company. It could be stressful around peak (back to school and holiday), but that was to be expected."
good,Management was good. Staff was not always hired appropriately. Taught people skills and working with money. Also learned how to portray information to people in a persuasive manner.
good,"I loved working here, but it’s deifintiley a temporary job. I enjoyed everyone I worked with, however upper management, like the CEO of the company were not great to speak with."
good,"fun and motivated "
good,Like any retail store it starts out fun but then it dulls out. I was there for about 3 months until I obtained a better job. Really heavy on sales which I was not really interested in. the people I worked with were really fun though
good,"A typical day at American Eagle includes:"
good,"●	My duties consisted of providing customer service to customers, such as providing them with assistance in finding specific items in the store. what I most enjoyed was the discount we got on the clothes"
good,"Fun work environment and work life balance. Great culture and work perks."
good,"do not wish to comment. Due to the fact I work at a high pace environment, my comments will be viewed as a American Eagle employee within the corporation instead of an American Eagle employee within a NYC region"
good,"I liked working there. It's an upbeat environment, the clothes are really nice and reasonably priced, the hours weren't too crazy, when it picks up it gets really nasty as far as clothes on the cash wrap to go back onto the sales floor and also in the fitting room. For the most part, their really organized ad the stock room is well put together. I'd recommend a high student or college student work here for extra pocket money and discounted nice clothing"
good,alot of the managers are shady and its a cool job but uncomfortable environment to work. managers like to hassle you alot about the job youre supposed to be doing
good,THE only benefit as a part time employee is the discounts. Soho management was poor and shady. The gang up on employees using their title to belittle and or fire associates
good,it is a very nice place to work. A lot of fun had with my fellow employees and I enjoyed my time at that establishment. I recommend this place for a first job
good,"laid back and easy going environment of shorts and flip flops became a little to much, as I felt it represented a lack of professional that any customer would come to expect."
good,I liked the invironment I was in and I intended on staying there for some time but they weren't consistent with the hrs and they barely gave any shifts
good,"Great for teenagers"
good,"A typical day at work would be something like this. So I would go to the employee break room, put my things in the locker and grab a headset and punch in for work. I am new there so they always have me doing stock and or doing the fitting rooms. If I didn't finish a set of clothes fast enough they will call your name over the headset and ask ""why are you moving so slow"". There have been times where I would not fell good that day but I wouldn't say nothing all that much. I didn't learn much but basically fold 3 million different ways from every single person. I'm over exaggerating but that how it felt. The most enjoyable part was getting my 10 min break from being off my feet for 3 hours non-stop. There was a time where I never got my break at all."
good,"Awesome staff, work around scheduling needs. Fun place to work and the discount is definitely an upside also! Great experience for working in retail as a student."
good,"Right after punching in, the manager on duty would give a quick pep-talk and then place you in a specific zone within the store and ask that you assist the customers there and help to maintain the cleanliness of the clothing articles and other products sold within your zone. "
good,Not enough hours. The job started out well. Great hours and good pay. They over hired for the new stores opening and expected people to quit. I lived almost 20 mins away so working 1 hr shifts was not cutting it anymore
good,The work load can be stressful at times.  The company in its whole needs to practice the ape way before they judge their employees.  This company tries to be family oriented but they fall short.
good,"Fun place to work Very difficult to move up in career. Supervisors make it even a difficult place to enjoy being."
good,Pretty cool it was my first job and taught me not only a lot about retail but also refined how responsible I was as a person. The SOME mangers seemed really judgemetnal and seemed to show signs of favoritism and sometimes even resentment
good,"american eagle in beaumont is an okay place to work. just found a better job with better benefits and opportunities. I would recommend working there part-time as a second job, since the hours given for regular associates are minimal."
good,I had this job when i was a sophomore/junior in highschool. It was a little fast paced for my age at the time. I did not get paid well enough and i did not get good hours.
good,Very fun workplace indeed. Wish everything was a bit more well managed. have to deal with very rude customers as expected so no big deal. Breaks are short and not much hours are given.
good,"As a floorset employee, only going into work 2-3 times a month allowed me to work another job and balance school easily. Having this job still provides the benefits that come with working as a Sales Associate which is nice, and they work with your schedule if you do have another job."
good,"If you're good with people and folding clothes this is the job for you!"
good,"Flexible enough hours, friendly management, and a nice atmosphere.  My time there for a summer progressed into seasonal work when in town for college break."
good,"A friend referred me that's how i got the job otherwise it is very hard to get in. Management hired me on as seasonal at first and I was exceptional so they hired me permanent. Only thing is the hours are scarce. The people who've been working their have the advantage over you with the hours. Also, it can be a little discriminating sometimes. You may be stuck with harder work while others are always on the register."
good,Not a bad place for part time work many competitive ways to push employees. Management sometimes gets too competitive for a workplace that mostly employs high school students.
good,The overall experience of working at American Eagle was busy and very competitive. The busy atmosphere of it all taught me patients and hard work of keeping up with it all.
good,"American Eagle was a boring job to work at. I worked as a stock room employee and never was able to go out on the floor. I liked the people I worked with, but not the managers."
good,"The job was fun, hardworking, and had people that would help me out when I needed it. Lunch break was good amount of time but didn't have much time to eat since I went to food court to get food which took time out of my lunch break."
good,"American Eagle was good for me as a starting job while i was in high school. During the summer it was a good way to start saving for college and for other fun things teenagers like to do. Other than that, it isn't something i would suggest as a long term job."
good,"low pay but 40% clothing, so you kind of spend I all there. it was a long time ago butt they pay very low and didn't offer full time. I neverhad money"
good,"High energy - fast paced environment"
good,"too much work for low pay, great discount, a lot of tasks but not enough time. not consistent with values. customer satisfaction is number one priority."
good,"It was so strange when I started, they were having a new management so it was a bit uncomfortable since no one really knew each other. I hated my hours because they scheduled me for weekends only. It would only be 4 or 6 hours a day."
good,"The environment and relationship with coworkers and customers made the job interesting and enjoyable. A typical day was to check the day's sales and card membership goals, report to assigned section, provide customer service, push membership cards, maintain and replenish section."
good,The environment was very fun to work in and the coworkers were great. The vibe there is very laid back and the managers were always in a great mood and were very flexible with my scheduling needs.
good,I loved working for this company and I loved the managers but if you were not on the managers good side or if you didnt get credit cards they would not give you the time of day.  It is all political and if you ask for help on how to improve they ignore you.
good,The managers at American Eagle are only concerned with sales other than the well being of customers or employees. Sales associates are pushed to make sales which they are not compensated for.
good,"AE was a great place to work, friendly staff, great store, great benefits... but the particular location I was at didn't have the friendliest people coming into the store. It was hard to keep a smile on my face the whole shift."
good,"Very friendly atmosphere, employees were always stepping up and willing to help customers. Managers knew what it was they were doing, and were always on top of things that needed to be done."
good,This is a good place to work only if youre looking to not make as much money. The pay is low but the energy and vibe is great in the store. Work here only if you really want to.
good,"Going to work 4 Days a week from 8pm-5am, not ideal for students but was a really good job. Easy layouts and lots of awesome people to work with. A very Organized Company."
good,You get like 15 hours a week so if your looking for more hours you better kiss some managers butt or pick up the slack for everyone else's work so you can show them you want it. If you're new you're invisible. They talk inappropriately about customers over the headset. Petty high school environment with girls who are lazy and don't like to do work that's why they end up staying at the store until 11 o'clock at night.
good,"I absolutely hated folding shirts and jeans all day.  Helping the customers wasn't bad, but trying to get everybody to open up a credit card was annoying."
good,"the employee are friendly and good at communicating with others. The only problem i had was the hours. i didnt get enough hours, so no hours no money."
good,"I enjoyed working for American Eagle and everything it stood for however, upper management at my location was poor and unprofessional. Despite the workplace culture I was able to prosper and advance quickly, furthering my development in leadership, working with a team, and customer service skills. Through working at American Eagle I was able to learn the benefits of being apart of management but more importantly learning how to be a successful leader through building and shaping a core team. For me, the most enjoyable part of being apart of the company was the customers. Being able to make forever customers who would come in again and again and ask for me personally was rewarding. Also the opportunity to interact on a day to day basis and making meaningful connections with customers was fulfilling."
good,"Not worth all the hours you work. Barely any hours during the week.  Can sometimes be really overwhelming, with all the talking in your ears and communicating with customers."
good,"For starters, I usually provided the customer with assistance pertaining to any needs and informing them of sales and specials. Also maintaining the store’s excellent presentation and reputation.In order to do so I utilized the tools learned such as folding and blending. The most difficult aspect of the job was retaining the different sales and deals to inform them to the customers on the different deals. The most enjoyable part was the relaxed and easy going work environment, treating employees like family. In conclusion, this is a brief synopsis of my time at American Eagle."
good,"A typical day at work (if you actually get hours) is usually busy, if not you get sent home. You're told what you'll be doing that day and what's expected."
good,"every day was so different, you never knew if your on call shift would come or if you had to work hours into the early a.m. They aren't flexible and are very demanding."
good,"enjoyable environment, Team Players , safe work environment,positive employees,great customer service, "
good,"I worked at AE for the holiday season. They told me we would get around 20 hours minimum and even more during the black Friday and holiday shopping times. That wasn't the case, I got 20 hours max on a good week. But the environment was relaxed and we got good discounts on clothes and the store. It's a good part time 2nd job or if you're going to school."
good,"temporary individuals learning the ins and outs of true retail experience for future and further referrences, overnight shift stock employees with ethic"
good,I thought that the job was decent for a teenager. It wasn't very flexible and that is why I decided to leave. I thought the free clothes are pretty nice though
good,"I have worked on and off through a temp facility for 4 years and enjoyed it just long hours. It was a lot of walking up and down stairs, I never really had any problems working here or with managers."
good,"just like any other sales associate job, easy work. lots of responsiblity if management feels you're a good employee. pay same as others though. ......"
good,This company picks favorites and wont give any of employees hours. dont work for this company if you need money. discount is nice but not worth the time
good,"At American Eagle, there were many expectations that followed the job title, no matter if it were sales associate or store manager. Product knowledge was a must, which was helpful while on the sales floor."
good,i liked working there but the management isn't the best and not getting enough hours it was just a summer job that paid minimum wage and wasnt worth the hassle
good,Making sure the customers are satisfied and was helped until they walk out the store doors. The little hard part was dealing with customers that didn't speak no English at all. What i enjoyed most was interacting with different people from different places and making them feel comfortable.
good,"I only worked here as a seasonal worker, it was long days folding clothes and cleaning up the store, working at the cashier was the only thing to keep me busy."
good,"In my time working for this company it seemed as though management cared more about profit than they did about the customer or employee. There was a constant atmosphere of pushing sales at the cost of the customer or employee becoming uncomfortable-- if the customer says that they don't need help finding anything, let them be!"
good,Not all American eagles are the same. The one I worked at I didn't really get along with the management very well. I didn't like how I was treated. But overall it was fun on some days while working there.
good,"I didn't really enjoy this job very much. The one i worked at the management wasn't very good, a lot of customers spoke spanish so i wasn't able to help at all times. They weren't flexible with schedules when something comes up."
good,"insanely great employee discount, they have a great raise structure, and very hands on management team"
good,Though it was a fun environment at the time there was a severe lack of structure and no manager. This created a great deal of stress and lack of unity among coworkers.
good,"This is a good job for people going to school and looking for a temporary part time job. Doesn't really pay well but it's enough for student to get by and pay for gas, food and clothes or whatever they desire. Would not recommend this job if you have children or if you are looking for something that pays well"
good,"They didn't give enough hours."
good,"Usually my shifts at American Eagle would begin with me at the cash register, and depending on how busy it was I would float around the store customer servicing and recovering the store. Management was very nice, although disorganized at times."
good,"While working at American Eagle was a fun learning experience, managerial issues made it difficult to get a consistent schedule."
good,"Collegues are very supportive and friendy nature."
good,We were always moving. Making sure we offered the best costumer service and buyer friendly environment. we needed to ask everyone if they wanted our AE credit card.
good,"Fun place, typical day would be at the cashier if there was no one on line just go around the store helping customers or fixing the store."
good,"Nice store & good people...... lso known as sales workers or salespersons, sales associates sell retail products and goods, such as equipment, clothes, cars or car parts, etc. Sales associates work with customers to find what they want, ensure a smooth sales process and process transactions."
good,"This company is great to start with when in school, or even after. Lots of pressure from managements, but they do give you tools to work with. Some movement within the company will happen if you prove to the managers that you worth it."
good,American Eagle requires a lot of patience and commitment. It is also competitive when getting reward cards and credit cards.
good,"-great for high school and college students working part time"
good,"Fun environment, good for a high school kid. Perks of working for the company was nice. The buy-in's you could get were great! Work wasn't hard, setting up the store could be fun at times."
good,It is exactly what you would expect from a job at a midlevel retailer. I personally enjoyed the time there but would imagine experience could differ from store to store.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my experience of two years at American Eagle Outfitters. A typical day in the life of a sales/stock associate consists of a lot of moving parts; and there was always a task to be completed. Floorsets were a lot of fun, and a great way to get some good hours in! As AEO was my first real, retail job, I can walk away saying that I learned a lot about professionalism, and learning to create a work/life balance. I have learned so many skills in my work, that came as a familiar understanding to what I learning in school. After being promoted to a BOH Lead, I realized there were even more moving parts to the job I was assigned. The hardest part of the job was making sure that all bases were covered at all times, as things move extremely quickly in the fast paced environment. The environment was my favorite part of the job, as I felt comfortable and felt like I was always welcomed."
good,Fast paced office. Co-workers are great. Job entails checking patients in and out. Calling and verifying insurance companies. Should have knowledge of insurance companies.
good,"over all a droll to work at. did not see myself moving uup in this job. over all easy work, but nothing I wanted to see myself in with years behind me."
good,"A typical day at work starts with filling the floor from previous days sales, general housekeeping i.e sweeping, mopping and wiping. setting up the daily schedule, assigning lunches and breaks and job roles. accepting and processing deliveries and organising the stockrooms to keep efficiency at a high. "
good,"The management here honestly make working a fun environment as well as a productive environment. You will accomplish what they want you to accomplish as a employee, but they make it worth your while."
good,"Fun, high energy environment to work in. Highly developed training programs, with plenty of tools and resources on hand."
good,"My time at American Eagle was very brief, and that was due to it being a seasonal job."
good,"Working at American eagle was fun,but didn't get much experience because I was only temporary during Black Friday. It was very crazy during Black Friday,there was a lot of workers hired so I think a lot of people didn't get the chance to learn,we had a point a to point b directions and that was it ."
good,Fairly decent place to work.  Holiday's are tough. I think management has changed quite a bit since I have worked for the company.
good,Proven working experience as sales associate Basic understanding of sales principles and customer service practices Proficiency in English Working knowledge of customer and market dynamics and requirements Track record of over-achieving sales quota Solid communication and interpersonal skills Customer service
good,"The staff was very unfriendly, and the managers were unprofessional. However, I did learn the basics of good customer service."
good,I do not wish to enter this information for this company or any other company I have previously worked for. thank you and have a good day!
good,"Working at American Eagle was enjoyable . Working on 34st was exciting . Seeing people from different race , after working hours going shopping ."
good,"Good for retail and cares about their employees."
good,steady warehouse job and I loved working for them. I learned all the equipment that target has. Also co workers were fun to work with
good,"I usually occupy the sales floor, helping customers get clothing and/or products. I clean and organize the tables and shelves. Give advice to customers on their outfit. I can handle doing three tasks at once, ex: letting people in the fitting rooms, putting away clothes and getting another size. I move quickly to make my area organized and efficient. Employees get along well most of the time. The downfall is the hours given to me vary each week, sometimes not working a whole week."
good,Talking to people helping them with whatever they need and i make sure i get it done quick because i got to get to that cashier because i dont want people waiting in line to purchase their things.Its never really a mess though because we have great co-workers that are always on task but when it comes to those shopping seasons you got to be phsycially and mentally prepared.
good,This used to be a great company until we were dragged through bankruptcy and had our name stripped from us. I do not wish to discuss this company any further.
good,"I was a cashier, but I worked with lazy management so I had to do a lot."
good,"Not flexible with schedules, terrible management, unfair work load and would have you work as you are dying. Even pregnant women have to sacafic their appointments to work the shifts."
good,"Very challenging in any department."
good,"This is a retail company. It works like many retail companies. Your personal story is not the biggest concern to them. You are counted as a number for the most part."
good,"A day at work isn't enjoyable most times. Ive learned to better skills with customers and trying to accommodate to their liking. Management isn't okay and some should be fired or have to step down to a different shop or possibly relocate. Hardest part of my job is trying to get along with two of my managers, they are just lazy and don't do their job well enough for everyone else who works there."
good,"Store was filled with much energy and excitement. However, I did not receive many hours due to the big staff that we had. I had to seek further employment."
good,"Great place to work/shop but you will learn how to Assisted customers with merchandise selections; restocked merchandise. Greeted and directed customers to specific areas of interest. "
good,"I wanted to work for this company for a while, when I did get the job there wasn't any hours available for me.They didn't give me no hours really They paid me well but no hours so it really didn't pay off in the end.So I left the company"
good,"A typical day included watching over the dressing rooms, folding clothes, and working the register. The job was overall very fun and rarely stressful. I liked communicating with customers."
good,A typical day included customer service as well as replenishing the clothing racks. The hardest part of the job was working during the holidays.
good,"Experience at this retail store was actually okay."
good,"Manager's weren't very understanding, felt as though they had favorite employees and they showed it. It felt like they didn't care if you failed or not."
good,The most enjoyable part about this job is helping customers pick out product. Help them design a area a look. The hardest part about this job was getting promoted. I was always over looked by someone who did not work for the company.
good,"A great company to work for, where creativity is supported and encouraged in an open space work environment, and no ego tripping. In fact, the only person there with an office is the CDO."
good,"Long work hours, long standing periods."
good,"I was never put on the schedule because I was amoung he younger workers. It was more difficult to have a voice or opinion with all the initmidation, but the leadrs were supportive and tried to help as much as possible."
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Great place for learning customer service skills and how to deal in a fast paced environment.
good,"Worked there during high school, good job during my younger years. Coworkers were nice and was a good job for minimum amount of work."
good,This store is a very high demand store that requires amazing associates who are willing to work hard. Discount is really good and great quality in clothing.
good,Very fast paced environment. Dealing with different types of customers.  Need to know different areas of the store and need to handle any types of questions related to the store.
good,American Eagle is an amazing job with lots of opportunities. It is a typical retail job from 9-5 and that's why I didn't stay there. It's not always high pace but it can be- especially around holidays and back to school. Good company.
good,My two and a half years working at american eagle was a great learning experience they molded me to the employee I am today.
good,Very comfortable setting and good management. I did enjoy my work there. I never had a problem that did not go away. I had long lunches and good breaks.
good,"Typical day includes forecasting and reforecasting based on sales trends, focusing on customer loyalty and pushing product."
good,"I learn how to treat clients and look for their tastes in fashion helping then to choose what color, acessories and shoes to wear."
good,"shifts are shorter"
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Team Group oriented work environment with lots of experiences towards working with objectives and deadlines.
good,American Eagle was a fun place to work.  The floor set hours could be overnight and extremely long.  The discount was awesome and the people were awesome too.
good,"There are times where one may question the motives of the management. Aside from that, the customers and the co-workers really make the job worth it."
good,Once clocked in I would start to re-fill sales floor with merchandize that needed to be refilled. I would help out as cashier when it got really busy. I would also work in the fitting room area where I would open and clean them as necessary.
good,"Going into AE after clocking in for work, sales associates would recieve pre parties to give employees an update on current sales goal and hourly goals and store promotions by the managers. We then are given specific areas in store where we are to remain and sell until further notice.When it is time to leave employees would receive an after party evaluation based off how their day went and did they meet their goals they had set during the beginning of work.  The store gets extremely busy due to heavy tourist and regular customer visits. We are to use walkie talkies to give managers quick store updates and successful purchases. I've developed authentic customer service and a passion for dealing with people and making people happy. I've learned to think outside the box and advance my creativity. I've learned to be myself and the customer at the same time and I learned to work at a fast pace. AE is best suited for someone with a bubbly personality and a love of making people proud, which is why I felt very close to home at work. The hardest part of working in my job was dealing with managers who I didn't see eye to eye with. I love working with my co-workers but my managers were very petty. Overall I love my experience at AE."
good,cela vas faire 6 mois que je travaille pour eu est depui maintenant 2 semaine jai 0heure ses malheureux car cest une tres belle job
good,Although my time with AE was short due to being a high school student. I was given the basic tools to engage clients and drive sales. I was a sales associate so I was responsible for product knowledge. Whenever a customer needed anything I was happy to assist. The hardest part of the job was scheduling. I was not able to meet their schedule requirements so I left the company.
good,I usually worked on cashiering or just keep the store clean and the displays neat during my shift. I learned the basics of how working is but it was a high school weekend job and I needed something more demanding/rewarding. I loved my coworkers and most of the management team but it wasn't hard to say goodbye in the end
good,"American Eagle was very interesting to work at for my first retail job. Due to the store opening brand new, I was able to receive a different experience then most people in retail. My co-workers and I built the store from the ground up. Building shelves and receiving our first shipment was all very interesting. My management was challenging sometimes but for the most part they made working there bearable. I learned many things like cash, and how to sell to anyone which was pretty cool."
good,A typical day at work is fun and busy. I have learned patience and perseverance at this job. Customers will constantly undo the work/tasks you have just completed and you have to be ok with that.
good,"As a retail worker you experience freedom to interact with costumers and drive sales based upon your ability and the stores traffic. This was the case while working for American Eagle. They delivered great benefits for those that met goals, and the atmosphere was fun and energetic. However, it is retail and a part time position. This meant infrequent hours and a feeling of being disposable. The limited work hours were not the direct managements fault, but guidelines set by corporate. The employee turn over rate is very high, but the pay was above average for the area and work. Overall I learned and enjoyed it, but would like to move forward."
good,"There is nothing special about American Eagle. This is no different from any other retail store. If you have worked retail before, then you'll know what to expect."
good,It's been a long time since I have worked here but the hardest part of the job would be replenishing the clothes and shoes daily.
good,"See previous review. "
good,"I loved the people, energy, and discount on clothes but folding and refolding gets old very fast. As does dealing with inconsiderate customers."
good,The Managers were very unorganized and I had multiple problems when it came to a normal day. I was a stock lead but a large amount of days I would be working on the floor instead of doing shipment.
good,It is a fun job to have when you are 18 but gets old really quick.  I had a great time and made some great friends that I still keep in touch with over all these years.
good,"The people they hire are awesome, I met some great people there that I am still friends with now.  The goals however are outrageous and they do not support you enough to achieve them.  When you do achieve them, you are barely recognized, when you don't you are called out and made to feel horribly."
good,"While working at American Eagle I learned just how much fun a part-time job could be!"
good,"At first, working there was really fun and enjoyable. All of the associates and managers were very nice and very patient. Then as the months went by , they started hiring new people and it was like they forgot about the other employers. I haven't gotten barely any hours in the past month and this is my only job."
good,"great benefits, no place for fast advancement anymore as market has  seasoned managers. atmosphere is laid back, great place to work"
good,A typical day at work for me while I was at American Eagle Is never really the same it all depends on who is there and how many people are scheduled to work. Some days i come in and i go straight to the back room to do shipment. mark everything and put it away. otherwise I am out on the floor folding and helping customers sometimes other new co workers. Management is usually on the floor helping or in the back doing paper work. The hardest part of my job is when we don't have enough staff on the floor and it is very busy. Or when the store is just constantly busy so it takes a long time to clean up that night. A good day at work is when we have enough people out on the floor to help with everything so everything is less stressful on everyone.
good,"I loved the management at American Eagle however I did not get a lot of hours and did not making enough to support myself financially. typically i am folding clothes, cleaning the store, and interacting with the customers. I have learned great customer service and communication skills. I always got along with all of my co-workers they were very nice and respectful young men and women. The hardest part of my job was maintaining the store throughout the day. However the most enjoyable part for me was helping out the customers and just seeing the satisfaction on their face."
good,"DC-Hazleton"
good,Has taught me a lot about merchandising and expertise on stock. They are very driven on meeting a daily goal which I believe is very helpful for employees. We must all try to meet a criteria and better our skills. I think this Job gave me something I can carry with me in any work place.
good,"The job is a blast. There was no room for advancement, even after working there for two years. Pay seemed like less than the job was worth."
good,"Seasonal Sales Associate- Basically I came in, confronted the manager and asked what was I going to be doing for the day shift or night shift (depending on my schedule), and basically maintaining the station. It was a lot of customer service based. Much cleaning, folding, etc. Many of the co-workers that I met were nice, some of them were shady and distant with me. The hardest part of the job was during the holidays where everything was a mess, but the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to engage with customers and be very helpful directing them to the right sections. I am a people person and I constantly need to be working with sociable people who are passionate about helping people just like me."
good,This is my during and post college job to make a little extra. Typical retail environment.
good,"Typical retail store,  lot of long shifts and not so happy managers. Retail is the same everywhere it seems!"
good,I enjoy customer service and work well both independently and as a team.
good,i like the company  just not the management. I like the clothing .
good,"Working at American Eagle is great. Everyone gets along and works together as a team to make things fun, Especially on busy days. We work together to make sure the store is organized and neat. We make customers feel welcomed and make sure to let them know that we would love to help in anyway that we can."
good,American Eagle is a great place to work at. The environment and the energy of the store is great. Ive learned how to communicate with the different types of customers everyday how to greet and satisfy their needs making sure they leave the store happy and with what they came for.
good,Job is really fun especially if you are a high school or college student.
good,"My tasks working here were very simple. I was a cashier, i did overnight shift (changed the stores appearance), I helped the managers maintain there numbers high and I would help customers find outfits that look great on them I started working here during the holiday season and it was awesome! I had always enjoyed cleaning up at the end of the day therefore I was placed mainly into evening hours. I enjoyed working here as well!"
good,"Great person for a young person to work. Room to grow is limited with sales in the fashion industry declining rapidly. Casual environment, especially in dress is very nice."
good,"-Awesome co-workers, everyone contributes"
good,"I would clock in and check out the store goal.  I learned how th communicate with customers. I learned how team work is used. Throughout the day I walked around the store making sure it stayed clean and the clothes stayed folded. I asked customers if they needed any help. I also recommended a style. Some days I would be in charge of fitting rooms. Giving customers a room and if they needed something I would be right there. If they didn't want it, I had to fold it and put it away in the proper area. The hardest part of the job was floor set. We stayed over night and change the whole store around in three nights. And we had to make sure the store didn't look messy or the back. The part I loved most about this job was feeling appreciated by the customers and they telling me I was able to help out."
good,"At times I really loved working here, but often the higher-ups have made working for this company almost unbearable. They make our management team miserable, which negatively impacts the associates that work here. As a company, they do not like to promote from within and there is never any job progression made by anyone I have been in contact with while working for the company."
good,a typical day at work ok just standing in one spot all day looking for damages
good,"Fun, young and creative company. Difficult to advance when working in the Lab Store in the Corporate office."
good,"its alright...different cultures. good customer service, friendly cliental."
good,It's retail and a great first job! Very flexible with hours.
good,"A typical day would involve us as associates to interact with the general public in helping them find there needs and wants along with answering any distinctive questions that applied to the job. I learned great people skills along with what it took to run a corporation like American Eagle. My co-workers were extremely friendly and helpful. I wouldn't say there was a particular harder part than another at American Eagle, it seemed to space itself out quite well when it came to the workload. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the public and being able to provide them with a reliable service."
good,"A company that is very well established but looks at its workers as replaceable, they use what they can get out of you and then move on to the next."
good,"assistcustomers with purchases, worked cashier, fast pace retail"
good,It was my first job it taught me to sell items and speaking to customers. It was my first step into retail.
good,"The management was not always the nicest people to wok for; however, working with my coworkers was always wonderful!"
good,I did floorsets and restock of the shelves. I cleaned up the back room
good,"Most of the upper management are just worried about getting themselves promoted and dont really train lower management or part time associates. "
good,"A typical consisted of me stocking items out on the floor, greeting customers, and helping customers find what they were looking for. management and co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was trying to get hours to work."
good,"hard working job. with fun music and great people."
good,decent position for in between jobs.  Standing for 12 hours and work 36 hours in 3 day.
good,"Nice company"
good,"i would go to work feeling excited because of the great employees. the managers, however, were pretty favoritist. i would work and a couple employees would play around and the managers wouldn't do anything. the hardest part of the job is to cope with the fact that the managers wouldnt do anything to the employees.all in all the job is enjoyable , helping customers is the best part of it."
good,"Nice place to work.Lots of busy work inbetween customers, but very fun to work with customers, and managers gave a lot of freedom in regards to letting you help customers and create outfits."
good,"Acted as cashier, provided great customer service as a sales associate."
good,its a beginners job. Basically you sell clothes and monitor the fitting rooms and the stock room. Keeping products fully stocked. You'll work with all types of people usually around high school and college age.
good,"•	Laid out and located structural components. "
good,mi evaluación es de tres estrellas en general ya que le faltan cosas que afinar a la empresa ya que al principio todo estaba bien hasta una semana después de la apertura ya que entre jefes hubo una división y por lo cual cada quien empezó a separa a sus aliados hasta que el ambiente laboral era muy hostil
good,The environment was okay but my only problem was they would hire to many people and put most of the employees on On-Call. A typical day would be like a slow and calm day. Management was okay also wasn't the greatest but okay. The Most enjoyable part was the costumers. They made it an enjoyable day because helping them and giving the satisfaction knowing that anytime they need help a Sales Associate was their to help with finding what they need.
good,"Good job for people who want to work part time and make extra cash potentially while still in school, good discount, friendly working environment and co-workers"
good,Got to meet a lot of interesting people. Motorcycle industry is a different way of life and learned a lot while i was there
good,"Pretty laid back work environment, till around holiday time. Management will work well with you if you have another job or in school. Bad thing about this job is if revenue is low is sales hours will be cut.  The pay isn’t the greatest but you can learn good work experience here to maybe down the road advance in to management if you desire."
good,"fun place to work, great discounts on clothing. only downside is short  daily shifts"
good,"there was a lot of down time "
good,"Working here at American Eagle Outfitters is a good first job for anyone looking to gain customer service skills and also meet and greet new people. Organization and speed are mostly what you need at this job. Also listening and communication are key skills that you'll learn as the day goes by. All co-workers, managers are friendly and you shouldn't run into any issues at this job. Loved this job as I've worked there twice before during college"
good,American Eagle wasnt the job for me at all. Every single time I called they would be rude. I would come into work they would again be rude and make me run all over the place while other employers would be standing around doing nothing.
good,"Working at American Eagle was a lot of fun, you were never bored always had something to do, always kept occupied, but when I got hired it was just for seasonal and I didn't know that until after they hired me and i couldn't really work on most of the holidays because I lived in the dorms. But the few shifts that I did get to work, it was fun, I got to meet a lot of new people, all my co-workers were really nice and helpful and got to learn about what sales associate was like. The job was not very hard but it was a lot of work, cleaning, helping all the customers folding clothes, then a second later its messy again because of the customer which was fine since thats what the store was for."
good,"This job is more typical for high schoolers I believe. The staff is very young and seems to have a inner circle but I never let it change my work effort. Greeted customers and keeping sales floor looking nice got me to move to the fitting rooms to be able to interact with customers on a more personal level and help them find things they needed such as different sizes or a matching top. Co workers were friendly but also seemed to have a better ""bond"" with the employees that were not seasonal. Hardest part of the job I would say was trying to have a connection with the employees."
good,"Fun environment, nice people no room for advancement."
good,come to work eat breakfast punch in do what is most important eat lunch interact with co workers back to work finish up the remainder of work then go home
good,"outgoing staff, management lacks leadership at times."
good,"During a typical day of work I multitask between preparing paperwork for the business, managing projects, and offering excellent customer service.  In this position I learned the importance of having an urgent pace and an outgoing personality.  I managed a team by delegating tasks to the associates and making a plan for the business day.  My store manager was recently promoted to her position and is very passionate about her work, and the other manager, also a shift lead, is a brilliant asset to the team.  The associates range from ages 16-23 and I have learned how to effectively motivate a younger team.  The hardest part of the job is executing projects during the flow of a typical business day, sometimes I feel like it takes me away from the customer too much and I would rather be working with the customer and helping them find what they are looking for.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customer and making their day by finding them great outfits."
good,My typical day in retail would be to help customers and keep the store neat and clean. I learned more about the behind the scenes of the store like with floor setting and a lot of hard work goes into the displays of the stores.
good,"Working at American Eagle was basically just the same as working at any up-beat establishment. Everyone was expected to sell merchandise and also provide great customer service. Our team was full of different personalities which made the store prosper. The hardest part of my job was the travel time and the amount of hours I got, which I why I am no longer there. The most enjoyable part of my job was to get to see the smile on people's faces when we satisfied their needs."
good,ok place to work fun enviornment friendly customers I just had a issue with the schedule being done on short notice and the lack of training provided to the management team
good,Not back breaking work and the benefits are great. Great company to work for just needs an better attendance system.
good,"cashier"
good,To promote more of the products we did weekly contests where you can win gift cards. Everyone is very friendly and constantly helping each other out.
good,"Friendly Environment"
good,"Fast paced, nice people, long hours which was great, learned how to fold correctly ans find sizes more efficiently and quickly."
good," Job entails emphasizing customer service, first and foremost.  This includes finding out and fulfilling customers' needs, while being knowledgeable about the products, current promotions, and offering personal feedback on said products.  Becoming 'friends first' with each shopper allows you, as an associate, to establish a more personal connection with the customer, making the shopping/customer service process more successful (and more fun!)."
good,"I would of enjoyed working at American Eagle alot more if the enviroment was alot more positive then negative."
good,"aside from the employee discount, it was nothing special. Managers always scheduled you for times you couldn't come in and you'd be responsible for finding your own replacement, which would be hard to find especially for weekends."
good,"•	Main Cashier"
good,would come in clock in take my stuff to the back then come out to the front and started organizing and straightening up the clothing. put out stock. help customers.
good,"get up at 3:00 a.m. to get ready to sign in at 5 a.m."
good,"Gained many new skills, and had to learn to make sales in a very fast paced and diverse setting. Gained Cashier experience, and learned how to work with customers quickly and efficiently."
good,"Maintained a busy work load, and learned a great deal in customer service. Management was dependable and reliable. Co-workers were diverse and pleasant. Working long and varied hours was difficult. Enjoyed serving customers."
good,Allows the creativity of self to be expressed and encourages diversity of employees.
good,good for a job for high schools but nothing more. but very fun co workers. 
good,"It's not for everyone. I figured out the hard way. Personally, I am not the ""clothing salesman"". But, aside from that, working here was not too shabby! Enjoyable staff and easy-going management. The hours weren't very good though. Would only work about 5-10 hours a week...if I was lucky."
good,Only went through Orientation/Training. Unable to work due to personal family issues.
good,"Typical day at work: Always had something to do, which made time go by a lot faster. Mostly fold clothing, help people in/on fitting rooms/cashier."
good,"Very demanding & high turnover of sales people, it does have great potiental when fully staffed with managers."
good,"work here was fun, but very busy and employees were usually hardworking."
good,"Fun place to start getting experience, but when I was there management did not really care for their associates. If you give ideas they would tell you that they can easily find someone who does."
good,AE is a fast growing dynamic company
good,"In the beginning they may start you at the register to see how compatible you are with being social and being able to work the register. When your not at the register they will either have you as a greeter which is in front of the store welcoming customers, while others will be either in the fitting room cleaning, re-folding clothes in the back. As for third you'll also be restocking and or replenishing clothes to were any area's are getting low on clothing."
good,"they didnt have me work much, learned retail and cashiering, most of the management and co workers were nice"
good,"I enjoy working here, and my co- workers, and managers are very nice and enjoyable."
good,"When I was there the employees were very rude, not friendly to others nor customers."
good,Worked in a fast paced enviroment helping a lot of different people throughout the day
good,"Good people, fun management. The co-workers were great. The business as a whole makes it a great point to learn the new merchandise. The folding gets annoying after awhile, however the customers were a lot of fun to help."
good,Always looked forward to going into work . Staff was amazing even on our worst days we found a way to make it upbeat. Got our work done and had fun doing it.
good,Okay chance for advancement if patient
good,"Great place to work, great clothing, fun atmosphere however there is no room to grow within the company."
good,If You Do What You need to Do And Your good at It you Enjoy it . Plain And Simple
good,Fun place to work/good discount
good,Its really a nice place for people who like to work in retail.
good,i enjoyed working for american eagle i got meny discounts on clothes and store credit for my personal spending and i also enjoyed team work
good,ive been at american eagle for 2 years ive been enjoying my job but as of late ive really havent i barely get hours and and i dont have enough money to pay bills and its just really not the say place where i used to work
good,I enjoyed the money that I made working at American Eagle. I would have continued working there if it wasnt for my medical issues.
good,"cleaning and maintaining good work environment, cashier. how to work well with others. management was very friendly and made one feel wanted"
good,"Helped develop good skills as in conversing, working in a timely manner, and clean up/organization."
good,Has command of the retail world and drives to get repeat customers.
good,"Great place to work wonderful enviroment, no one is judged because there is all kind of different backgrounds, gender, sexuality and i love the friendly enviroment everyone is like a family."
good,Multi-tasking everyday to provide excellent customer service and maintain the store
good,I learned to have more patience for people from working at American Eagle and how to sell merchandise to customers with an enthusiastic and friendly manner.
good,A typical day at work is okay. i have my good days and bad days. I learn about the retail business. The management is great. I love my co-workers. hardest part of my job..not getting paid enough. The most enjoyable part is seeing my co-workers.
good,AEO has burned through three Directors of NMP in 4 years. What does that tell you?
good,Retailed. Stocked and sold merchandised. Meet new people everyday
good,Fast paced and fun is a typical day at A&E. Management is great and understanding. The hardest part is when we are under staffed during a rush period. I love when a customer leaves happy and satisfied.
good,"Is a very monogamous type of job. The store is split into zones where you are assigned to work by the manager on duty. In your clothing floor zone you are responsible for talking / helping every person who enters it. When no one is in your zone you are told to keep busy by having 'busy fingers' which means you should all be organizing your zone and making sure all of your clothes are neatly folded & edged. Edged or edging means the viewable side of a stack of folded clothes is perfectly alined (i.e. if your looking at a wall of jeans the front fold of every pair of jeans sits perfectly on top of the pair of jeans under it so that all are in perfect alinement on top of one another). The in the cashier zone, your responsible for properly completing all transactions and trying to get as many people as possible to sign-up for credit cards. This was the worst part of the job because I hated doing this, but if you didn't get credit cards you had to go back into a floor zone which I hated even more because it made the time go by so slow. Getting promoted to a cashier definitely gives you more freedom to do what you want when no one was in the store, and it also makes you more valuable to your managers because not everyone gets cashier training so your more than likely to get more hours / shifts."
good,Good work Place management is always upbeat and motivating. Hours are ok
good,co-workers ok to work with can advance with the company if you prove yourself
good,everyone was hard work and got things done efficently and accurately working there i learned how to get along well with co-workers and obtain some more good customer service the management where helpful and nice the enviroment overrall was friendly the hardest part was closing long hours everything had to be precisely done most enjoyable time was closing cause you geet to associate with your co-workers and listen to you ipod well getting work done
good,"Folded clothes, cleaned, stocked, talked to customers."
good,The team would set up displays in the store. I enjoyed the job because it was detail oriented and stayed busy while on duty.
good,"American Eagle is a good place to work if your still in school just for some extra cash. Besides the fact that they want you to perform more duties for what they're paying you. District managers and loss prevention are always nit-picking with this particular location. There isn't enough communication going around. But like I said if you want some extra cash this is the place. Employees get along fine with one another so that's not an issue. Like I said, great place besides its flaws"
good,"Great customer service, along with managing a motivated team."
good,"AEO, Inc. is full of young, fun-loving individuals that create an environment that is more far more intimate than what you would expect for a company of this size. The work is fast-paced which helps associates learn quickly and promotes hard work and innovation."
good,"first job as a teenager and as a high school graduate, which made me more responsible and independent"
good,"Typical day at work, the leadership was not intact with their employees."
good,Relaxed pace of work. Always something to do. Positive attitude is a plus.
good,Good place to work but long hours until early in the morning.
good,good up beat place to work but needs some new technology and some better processes.
good,American Eagle was a fun overall work place. I am looking for more hours and advancement in a job.
good,I wouldn’t recommend American Eagle due to the lack of pay and the struggle to get hours. When they didn’t need me anymore they would cut me off without any heads up
good,"This was my first job and I have to say that the people I worked with were some of the best I've ever met, however retail can become quite boring when it isn't busy. I decided to quit because after working there for almost a year I only got paid minimum wage. Also as somebody who deals with social anxiety, I felt uncomfortable in my position"
good,They held a lot of competition throughout the company with cool incentives which included free clothes and cool stuff like that. The hour flexibility was super nice too. They really worked around your preference.
good,Γρήγοροι ρυθμοί εργασίας αλλά χαμηλός μισθός. Πολύ καλό κλίμα συνεργασίας.
good,"At the beginning, while I was working at American Eagle, it was really good and seemed very fitting for me. After a while, I outgrew the company. Many changes have been made especially when it comes to managers and the shifts given, that after a while working there got overwhelming and stressful."
good,I have worked as a a manger then down to a sales associate and promoted again to management in the last 16 years. The company mission stays true each year
good,"They gave me the worst hours ever! Couldn’t accept I had to go to classes, and that was my top priority. Would only schedule me 12 hours weekly. They wanted me to do different things all at once (fitting room, stock and cashier). They heavily criticized when I didn’t make a customer sign up for the American eagle credit card. The more you made people sign up for, the more shifts you got. It was very stressful working here, and not worth the pay for the amount of stress."
good,Nice place to work and learn about corporate structure. The discount is great and the work is fun at times. would recommend to a hard worker who does n't mind late nights.
good,"I really liked working here, I received a lot of discounts and I definitely began to shop here a lot. I made really good friends with the employees and the management was really well obtained."
good,"When I first started working there I loved working there and picked up many shifts, as time went on I went through many managers and my shifts started to slow down sadly so I started to look for another job. I worked hard and fought for my hours because it is competitive but for some reason management didn’t see my worth for hours"
good,"I worked seasonal for AE and barely worked 4.5-9 hours every two weeks. The pay is absolute minimum as it is. Other than nonexistent hours, It was a fun environment and I enjoyed my coworkers."
good,I was able to communicate with different types of people and worked in an environment that needed to be constantly looked after. Not only did my communication skills improved but I was able to develop connections that could help in the future.
good,It was a nice job it was just going out of business in my area and wasn't really any hours like that for a lot of people so I had to look for another job
good,"Wouldn't recommend as a full time job. Great for a high school student or college student. Can't really beat the discount. After the holidays there are no hours to give, forcing employees to quit or find a second job."
good,it was fun working with the people but the managers were pretty strict and were not very friendly and would always just make you do alot of side work that wasnt really your job
good,"Management was the overall problem within the workplace with their inconsistencies, favoritism, constantly gossiping with each other and associates, etc."
good,"if you work hard enough you can ask for a promotion and even you can apply for being a jean expert and get employees discounts with it "
good,"Not good for anyone who likes to give good service, most managers can't comprehend good employee services. I'd stay clear away from American Eagle Outfitters."
good,"como marca Americana tiene una cultura y estructura laboral muy buena pero la adaptación en México con gerentes no ha sido la mas efectiva."
good,"Experience at this job largely depended on the management. I had a ton of positive learning experiences here and the discounts were a huge benefit. There was not a ton of room for progression within the company at an associate level, but I value my time here."
good,Καλο εργασιακο περιβαλλον για νεους που θελουν να κανουν ενα νεο ξεκινημα για την επαγγελματικη τους καριερα.
good,Fun place to work if you are looking for something part-time. Hard to advance if you are not willing to make your life AE. Management cares more about getting a shift covered rather than whats going on in the associates personal life.
good,"American Eagle had good benefits and took care of their employees.  A typical day would include merchandising, pricing, promotional displays and customer service."
good,"it was a fast placed store, always had to clean and be working fast. the manager and co workers made the time go by. I learned to be patient and help as many customers as I could."
good,"I was there for 3 years. There were 11-12 different managers while I was there. HUGE management turnover rate. It was an okay place to work. New management came in and I didn't get a promotion, so I left. Coworkers were the reason I stayed."
good,American Eagle is a diverse company who 100% puts the customer first. They are very clear on making sure that that mission statement is followed to a T.
good,I worked there for a seasonal job in high-school around the holidays and it was great for discounts and quick side cash. The work environment was relaxed and really nice and my managers were all super cool.
good,"American Eagle was a fun place to work. I folded clothes, organized the store, but hours were really hard to get so getting paid well was hard. Overall I had a good experience"
good,"Variety of people in the store, great co workers, management was good if a bit disconnected from employees as people. Co-workers well all easy to work with however there was a high turnover rate so there was mostly only casual interaction 2-3 times with any one individual."
good,"The company itself is great. A fun job, with good benefits. Of course, your overall experience will vary tremendously based on your specific store and the management at that location. In my time here, I found it to be laid back but also fast paced with opportunities for growth if you work hard. Training could have been better, but again, that was specific to my location."
good,"An overall great place to work for, be prepared to get your hours cut. The workplace culture was pretty relaxing but if it is not a busy day, the day goes by so slow."
good,"It's a fun place to work, and there are often contests in which you get free products.  It can be difficult to deal with the customers or the management."
good,"Typical day was go in and speak to your manager what was there to do. Either help customers up front while you organize, work the changing room, or organize the back room."
good,"I started working at AE as a seasonal employee because they needed help for the Christmas season. They hired about 20 new employees and said that they were only going to keep three at the end of the season. I was one of the three. "
good,"The discount is great, people are fun to work with but you start at minimum and the only way for advancement depended on how long you worked for the company which was frustrating."
good,American eagle was a great job. however at the time of my employment they were over staffed so it was hard to get the hours you wanted/ needed. overall its a fast pace working job for anyone.
good,"Fun environment and kind Coe workers and excellent staff. allows people to learn many new skills like consumer interacting, professionally handling unsatisfied consumers, and learning to persuade the buyer."
good,"Overall, American Eagle was a pleasant place to work. They provide snacks and drinks in their back room for employees to have on their breaks. The store is very organized, straight forward, and they know what they want. Employees have incentives for reaching their goals in sales and credit card applications. You have lots of freedom to express yourself, your style, and your individuality. Managers are approachable and personable."
good,When I do work it is typically changing around the store and is therefore a lot less of a team work atmosphere. My job is to go off a picture and be able to create that picture with the product at hand.
good,"American Eagle was an enjoyable job if you were working with the right people. I learned a lot being on the management team, from balancing multiple tasks to effectively pushing the team in a positive way. After we lost our store manager, however, things started to drastically change within the business. There was a lot of tension and unnecessary drama that blossomed, and it simply made coming to work less enjoyable. The new management was hard to work for as well but aside from any negative aspects of this job it was still one of my favorites."
good,Salary is not high but on time. Work is too many that you need to be flexible and extend hours. Teamwork is good and a happy working relationship with staff.
good,Consistently demonstrate the AEO Customer First selling standards in order to deliver a positive customer experience and achieve daily sales goals. Responsible for maximizing selling potential by ensuring the efficient and effective flow of merchandise.
good,Learned a lot about what goes into making quality clothes and what it means to work together as a team. Found out what my personal style was while working here and grew from it.
good,"I only do shipment but I still enjoy it. Get to relax and be myself and do my own thing for the most part. A lot of boxes, but that comes with the job description."
good,"I thought I would enjoy working for this company and I was proved wrong. Everyone has an attitude, only good thing is sometimes we get starbucks cards"
good,"The workers were always happy, very hard work environment to adapt to. The pace was great and I always got along with the people i worked with no matter what."
good,"Depending on the day it could be hectic and stressful or layback and relaxed. The employee discount is great. Sometimes there isnt to many hours given to you, so ask if you can work more hours top any of the managers."
good,No comments about this company at this time due to the nature of my position and confidentiality i have with this company.  There is nothing to say at this time.
good,"Environment is fast paced. Some policies are a bit ambiguous. If you are wanting to advance in the retail industry, the company provides a lot of great training tools to grow yourself as a leader."
good,It just wasn't my ideal work place. I didn't enjoy cleaning up a store and constantly having to do it again because someone messed it up. I didn't like management and I didn't like the job.
good,"good job, very interactive, attentive management, hands on, fast paced, hardest part of the job is learning it, easy job, easy to move up/move around, good company"
good,"Create an outstanding buying experience for the customer. Execute floor leadership. Own the sales floor with store manager by setting the ideal example of an exceptional Sales Associate; greeting all customers with a professional, friendly, timely manner, including answering phones and directing customer inquiries. Coach and develop Sales Associates in assessing customer needs. Work with Sales Associates to problem solve customer issues. Work with store manager in opening, closing and operating Store procedures, including but not limited to cash handling and deposits as governed by operation control standards. Complete accurate paperwork and transactions according to company policies and procedures. Assist with inventory and merchandise flow as well as maintaining store appearance and merchandising standards."
good,"While American Eagle was the job that I held for the shortest amount of time, that doesn't take away from the awesome experience that I gained. My location had amazing management who I could talk to almost whenever I felt the need."
good,Its a good place to work.. awesome co workers had an excellent experience working there and i learn a lot it was my first job i ever had and i liked it.
good,Not a family orientated company like they say. Though I learned more in 988 picking than retail packing. The people were great to get along with.  I liked that we stayed busy and had work some days were long and hard with no work.
good,"A typical day for me included cashiering(as a main cashier). I had to get a minimum of 5 people or more to sign up for the credit card to meet our goals for the day. That was probably the most frustrating part of the job. While I was great with the customers and some days I could get over 10 people to sign up, there were days that I could not get any one to sign up. The minute I was lacking in credit cards, I was booted to the fitting room and forgotten about. This is in part of why I left this job because it seemed like they would give me less hours if I didn't perform as well that day, which made it seem as if I had to fight for my job everyday I went in to work."
good,"Working in retail is fun and tough for some. A typical day included working the dressing rooms and folding a lot of clothing. It was a nice environment, all were friendly. The job was not for me."
good,Good place to work with although it could be stressful at times. Always kept me busy and made the day go by faster. Was able to get along with all my coworkers and managers.
good,great place to start for your first job but not a great place to expect much out of it besides good relationships and a below average pay check best thing about it is its great work experience to start with
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits. You get three 80% off if you are a jean expert and another 3 80% off if you are a bra expert. You also get 12 60% off just for being on the team. For employees anything that's on sale you get extra 25% off. How awsome is that.
good,"Work is very active but rewarding. Worked end of 2016 to beginning of 2017. Location was at Columbia Mall in Columbia, MD. Workers were very friendly and willing to help out. Management was pleasant and polite."
good,"I loved my coworkers and management team, but myself along with many other employees only got 1 shift a week or 4 hours of work time each work. I had to quit because obviously no one can pay for anything on a $30 paycheck"
good,A typical day at work is always moving around. Being able to use your time wisely and work at a fast pace. The hardest part of the job is being able to deal with customers. You have to be extremely friendly and always put the customer first.
good,American eagle outfitters environment is great for meeting new people due to associates consistently needing to communicate with each other on the sales floor and if you are looking for a flexible job A.E.O is a good choice.
good,"Nothing more and nothing less. You'll learn valuable customer service skills and quite a bit on fashion. "
good,"I don't know managers at American Eagle Outfitters have no communication between one another at all, everyone just talks about each other's backs!!!!! I don't know I actually don't recommend working here, I mean the discount and benefits are great and all but no communication and just a bunch of fake people working there."
good,Management is great. It's more of a 2nd job for me though. I only work (on average) 20-30 hours a month. I love getting to work with different types of people.
good,"Retail jobs are great for college students, as the work schedule can cater to their school schedule. The people are great and can be friends for life."
good,"Although the managers maintained a tight work schedule and ultimately got everything done at the end of the day, the managers were often unorganized, and didn't communicate with each other well. Further more, the managers often didn't communicate proper scheduling to the employees."
good,"They don't give sales associates enough hours. There aren't really many opportunities to move up in American Eagle. They do work with my school schedule, but they don't give me the hours I need that I can work."
good,I started as a seasonal sales associate and worked my way up to a management position. I have travelled with the company to other stores for store openings and remodels.
good,"I worked at American Eagle directly out of high school, and it provided an opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and allowed for experience in a sales environment."
good,"The job itself was rather fun, I enjoyed speaking to clients about clothing and getting the chance to help others with fashion. I always took it as a challenge to make sure I was adding on, and the management notices good employees who try hard to excel."
good,On a typical day it depends if it's going to be busy or not. If it is busy then you have to prepare to yourself for the customers. The most important thing to keep in mind is to help your customer and sometimes have a conversation with them about their day or maybe ask them where they're from. I have learned quite lot in this job and it it's my first job. I get to meet a lot of people from different countries sometimes. The things i enjoy in the job is when we have little parties like having pizza and soda in the break-room for the employees. One thing ii'm still missing out on is not being cash register trained.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping shoppers in the dressing room and in the store while upselling items and pairing outfits. I also maintained a neat and presentable section while anticipating and fulfilling any needs of different customers. My coworkers were helpful in that most of them were in tune with many of our shoppers' fashion sense, however when it was closing time, may of them took their time."
good,"Not enough wage or payroll for work that was asked to be done. Most convenient processes in any company I have ever worked for."
good,work loads are not typically heavy. It is a lot of friendly staff and the customers are great. I enjoy the positive peer coaching. Overall pretty cool job if you are only looking for part-time employment.
good,"Co-workers are fun and the job itself is basic. The hardest part of the job would be on a busy day and having to talk to everyone in the store and making sure everyone has their needs met in a timely and polite manner. Managers are tight about rules, managing the staff and keeping everyone productive."
good,"I have learned a lot, and I am still learning; however, this job is meant to be taken very lightly in terms of permanence. A typical day was usually hectic and extremely busy, and very rarely there were days were no one walked in. "
good,"Co-workers are the best part of the job. They can really get your through the day when your not having the best of days."
good,"They have their favorites. The managers in charge of scheduling, schedule the associates they like with more hours than someone they don't favor."
good,"Although American Eagle provides a great working atmosphere, they do not provide a good work/life balance. The pay is good and the company provides great incentives such as free items."
good,some partners were cool but everyone always has that one person that annoys them the usual drama. The music got annoying afer over plaing while working. Most employees had fun with thtere job and some were too serious
good,"Sell company's clothes"
good,"I loved the job, it was the lack of hours. management was good friendly and cool. love to shop their I still come by to say hi to  my old coworkers"
good,"You would sign in, and not really be told what you were going to be doing that day. There wasn't much training and they didn't inform you of promotions going on. Also it was a very judgemental environment, like if you didn't wear the right clothes you could tell that you were being judged by your manager and coworkers."
good,"A typical work day at American Eagle consists of a 4hour-8hour shift and 12 hour shift during floor sets.  In this time frame there is refolding of clothes that is done, cashiering, shipment, customer servicing, putting away clothes that customers tried on and refilling the store."
good,"Really can't say much about this job, I didn't work but only a month due to a car accident, I liked the fact it was in the fashion business, which I want to do later in life"
good,"A typical day at work would include assisting customers to enhance their shopping experience.  I am a jean expert, so showing customers what jeans will work best for them, or the person that they are shopping for, is what I am really experienced in. I also have conducted new hire orientation and have conducted employee verification.  The work environment is laid back, yet professionalism is there always.  My co-workers are great - we are a team, and work together as so. The hardest part of the job is trying to make sure that every customers that comes it, leaves the store with something in hand.  That can be difficult because customers usually come in with something specific in mind, and when we do not have it, we have to convince them that we do have something else that they will be happy with."
good,"its an okay place to wrk but my stock manager put way to much pressure. overall my co workers were chill and the work place but you realy do ""live your life at Ae"""
good,"Awesome employee discount but tough to learn the point of sale system. Transactions are not necessarily tough but returns, exchanges and sign up people for a credit card. Practice makes perfect but it is tough to practice when you only have one or two a day. The other associates are great and fun people but the managers  can be condescending and hard to please."
good,"If you can sell credit cards like a madman then go straight for this job because your hours depend on that. And be sure to keep up with the promotions because you need to be able to sell sell sell."
good,"Work was typically very fast-paced and busy. Rarely had slow days. Management was tough and very hard-hitting, but overall easy to work with. Co-workers were friendly and cooperative. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with customers and customer service requirements. The most enjoyable part was maintaining the store and the merchandise."
good,The workload was extremely manageable. There was just no room for advancement. Hours were also limited. On average one could find themselves working 1-3 days weekly.
good,"Very Nice to work in a clean enviroment. Most of Managment is"
good,"American Eagle was a fun environment, coworkers are very friendly. The store is very busy and I learned how to sell items to customers, driving out sales up. I learned the importance of a happy customer."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. Its environment is fun and energetic. I came to work and left with friends. I would definitely work for this company if you enjoy retail.
good,"A typical day involved:"
good,"I Truly loved this job, my managers were very outgoing and caring. excellent performance. a normal day at work consisted of stocking shelves, helping customers, as well as checking people out"
good,"A typical day working at American Eagle would consist of signing in then watching a video for sale tips. After the video, the manager would tell me what I needed to accomplish for the day. The tasks to complete generally included folding and reorganizing merchandise as well as assisting customers. After working at American Eagle I learned the value of money and how hard I had to work to obtain it. I also learned to further my people skills because of assisting individuals. The  co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with; however, the management seemed to not care about the availability of the workers. When business was slow, it would cause problems. We workers would have to almost push the customers to purchase merchandise and several employees would help one individual. I think that burdening the customers with more than needed help was the hardest part of this particular job. The most enjoyable part of my job nonetheless was indeed assisting customers on black friday. It was easy for me to help individuals because it was so busy and it didn't feel like I was over bearing towards the customer."
good,"A typical day at work consists of keeping the customer first, balancing the cash register, fitting rooms, cleanliness, along with the product; and it teaches me a life necessity which is patience. The management is not the best, but that does not cause the rest of the co-workers to be bad business partners.The hardest part of the job? Coming from a regular sales associate jean expert; I think that would have to be working with floor-sets. The most enjoyable part is definitely being able to shop with the best discounts."
good,American Eagle is a great place to work - if your hard working and have a high energy level then AEO is for you. AE does a lot of things old school - so you must be able to adapt quickly.
good,"Working at American Eagle is not as hard as it may seem. Throughout the day it may become a bit hectic yet the supervisors maintain good customer service and remain cordial to fellow employees. I learned a lot about how to arrange clothes, become more helpful and patient with customers, and how to interact and communicate with my employees as well. The hardest part of the job would probably be not being able to satisfy a customer who has spent most of their time looking for something that is not available. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers find clothing and accessories for either themselves or whoever they were shopping for that day."
good,I'm new at this job but so far I've had a lack of hours that were promised to be there.
good,"Although I'm not sure if retail is where I belong, this was a fun position. Plenty of young people and fun people to work with, and always doing different competitions involving selling certain items with reward incentives. Typically a boring position but the staff made it entertaining."
good,"live your life AE rock out and be party ready, a typical day at my job you have to be upbeat and positive. Managers are friendly everyones a team player . Hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers but you always keep a smile on and work it out. The most enjoyable part is being friends first with our customers."
good,Assisting customers while trying to sell and meet sales numbers. Typically busy on weekend and more relaxed during the weekday. Everyone is very friendly and easy to work with. The more Enthusiasm you have the more fun the job will be.
good,"i worked at american eagle for a short time, first job. i typically stayed in the back doing inventory or in the fitting room helping customers with clothes and measurements. Only on busy days i would be up at the cash register. i liked it alot working with a good amount of people and always having something to do."
good,"Always busy place. It's a good job if you are willing to work hard. A lot of other employees slack off, so that makes it harder. Management is great and works well with school schedules as most employees are students."
good,I learned how to approach a customer and selling a product. Management is great very friendly people. Hardest part of the job would be working over night shifts and dealing with many complains. Most enjoyable part is being able to help a people and build a conversation.
good,I have worked to AE for 7 years both as an assistant manager and store manager.  It has been mostly a positive experience and I have developed a vast knowledge of the retail industry through my training.
good,"The job is fun and I have certainly learned a lot about running a big store and tracking business. It challenges me to strategize and critically consider ways to improve business within my department. The team is mostly positively spirited. The girls I lead are wonderful young women - mostly college students. "
good,Slow mornings just Stocking shelves and checking out customers on the cash register
good,Not a bad job. Great benefits. Enjoyable atmosphere. Value employees but compensation is low and not much room for advancement.
good,I learned different values and skills working with people here. Many coworkers were from a different country and brought new values to the workplace. I learned how to work under pressure and complete deadline projects. I enjoyed promoting new merchandise to customers and helping them find exactly what they wanted.
good,I felt the managers were immature and did not reflect situations carefully. Out of the few managers on shift maybe one person would handle things rational and professional but then the other managers would take it out on other shifts. I saw a lot of employees get hired only to quite within weeks.
good,"Offer a lot for starting out employees. I was a seasonal employee so I cannot really give a decent review, however the location that hired me also hired far too many other people and as a result I was getting less than part time, and that's only due to how well I worked. Other workers didn't get hours period. "
good,"A typical work day was clocking in and reliving the associate at your section. I learned how to deal with multiple customers at once, proper inventory, and how to pitch advertisements/sales. The hardest part of the job was the lack of hours. I enjoyed the environment the most since it was very social and fast paced. The management was good but just kept a lot from the employees and were hard to talk to."
good,A typical day at work I wolud clock into work and do my pre party. The pre party consist of watching one of mulitply videos about one of the products we were sellin such as men denim. After watching the video you would write down three things you learned from watching the clip that would help you sale the product. Then you would check the white product to see what promotions they had so you can notify the customers on the deals. You have five minutes to do your pre party and check in with the manager on duty he or she will let you know where you would be at for the day such as cashier or on the floor selling. The managers were always watching to make sure yo were on task and if they had a issue or needed your help they would call you on the headset that all employees wore. The hardest part of the job was closing the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is dressing other people by sugguesting products and putting outfits together for people to try on.
good,"Moderate to fast paced environment in the heart of the city. Thousands of tourists and locals. Constant running in between sales floors, fitting rooms, register, stock rooms to service customers. Friendly & lively staff. Seeing satisfied customers and the staff acknowledging your efforts at the moment are the most enjoyable parts of the day."
good,Typical day was to monitor staff and sales floor and meeting key performance indicators
good,"A typical day at work would start by going in and clocking in on the computer. After you would put your headset on which was for contacting other employers. Multitasking was a plus because someone could of came and ask you a question while you were doing a task. ive learned a lot at this job which was multitasking, customer service, stock and clean up duties. Management was great the manager was open about themselves and very outgoing. The co-workers were great and very fun to joke around with. Hardest part about the job was remembering all protocol in the store. The most enjoyable part was the atmosphere. It was very living."
good,"A typical day at work would start by going in and washing your hands after you clocked in on the computer. After you would put your headset on which was for contacting other employers or for when someone pulled up to the drive-thru. Multitasking was a plus because someone could of pulled up to the drive-thru while your were changing the coffee filters. ive learned a lot at this job whic was multitasking, customer service, little restaurant skills in the lobby, stock and clean up duties. Management was great the manager was open about themselves and very outgoing. The co-workers were great and very fun to joke around with. Hardest part about the job was remembering all the recipes and gadgets in the store. The most enjoyable part was the atmosphere. It was very living."
good,It was a lot of mover around. Making sure the passagers had there broading pass.It was easy.
good,american eagle was a nice place to work but the store i work at didn't get much people in there store and it was verily slow working there get bored really fast
good,"If you are looking for a company that repays you for hard work American Eagle has lots of room to move up and to sharpen your skills. Atypical day is primarily focused on selling and store goals. Pretty serious focus on UPT, ADS, and Conversion."
good,"Working at American eagle was ok. I think they should let more teenagers work there for the amount they pay to you. As a grown adult 18- over there is no way you can work the  job and pay home as well unless you work 2 jobs. For example, if you working stock or shipment there a lot of things that require that job and getting paid starting at 8.47 is not enough even part time."
good,work days tend to be slow unless around the holiday season. I learned customer service. Very relaxed environment. Personally the hardest part of the job for me was learning the tils. The discounts were good and the staff are passionate about what they do.
good,It was good for experience in a retail environment. I do recommend the job if you can't find anything else. Folding jeans daily wasn't bad. I worked hard and got a couple raises.
good,Nice people. Great discounts. Staff is very nice. Management is good. Teaches things that could be used at other jobs.  Hours are a little over the place if you haven't done retail.
good,"American Eagle provides a fun environment with a great product at affordable price. "
good,This was a fun first job for me. I learned how to talk to people and contribute to a business. The only reason I left was because of the pay. My manager was great.
good,A typical day at American Eagle was repetitive. Clock in then you would go to your section fold the jeans or help the customers find what they want and get a dressing room.
good,AE is a fun place to work filled with great people who care a great deal about retail. AE needs to enhance their benefits in order to entice top talent to work for their organization.
good,You get passed up and their are favorites which there should not be. Everyone treated same they already know who they are picking . So makes you wonder why even apply
good,"I've always LOVED American Eagle clothes, despite the high prices. I usually head straight to the clearance racks in the back, because they're cheaper. Like I said, this is while shopping here. However, despite the AMAZING employee discount and the added perks of still being able to participate in the AEO rewards program; the workplace is horrible. My coworkers are extremely fake with customers, nice and seemingly genuine, but fake. They talk about not only the customers behind their back, but other coworkers. It's ridiculous. The store I came from had a smaller team, but we were like a family. My managers were like friends and still did their job and my coworkers actually spoke to me. Here at AEO, they talk about how much you've messed up, how ugly your outfit is, and again this is with both customers and coworkers, BEHIND THEIR BACKS. I love getting to work with the customers but not with my coworkers. It's not even a terribly hard job, but you'd think it was considering how much people complain. I will say the management confuses me, cutting shifts and saying we're over on payroll, then hearing our SM saying we're severely understaffed and need to hire 12 more people before summer. The only good part of this job is the discount. The pay is good, average, but just fine. I wouldn't recommend working here to anyone unless you're good at complaining and being fake."
good,Overall a very good job to have. Managers are willing to work with you. Employes are respectful and very outgoing. Pay was very good and flexible hours.
good,American Eagle is a very fun place to work. It's a fun way to earn a little extra cash. I would not consider it a longterm job. Would recommend to high school students or college students that are home for the summer.
good,"When I worked there, I was expecting to get scheduled 3 or 4 times a week so i can pay for car insurance etc. however it was 3-4 hr shifts every other week or every week."
good,"It's retail. Folding clothes, fitting rooms, customer relations. They're all the same. Working on cash was a blessing. I never had to deal with too much folding or running around finding sizes. I was there for a good time, not a long one."
good,"Easy going environment."
good,"A typical day at work consist of separating, folding, displaying clothes, and promoting sales. I learned teamwork and how to work with a diverse group of coworkers. Management was a little unprofessional and showed favoritism. The workplace culture was professional and fun sometimes depending on the manager on the shift. Sometimes its was a fun learning experience, and sometimes it was long and boring. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the online and in store promotions. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers and helping them feel good about their self esteem and confidence."
good,"very friendly place to work, pay is ok but not great, not enough hours, only work 2 days a week 3-4.5 hours a day, great place to home in on your customer service and merchandising skills"
good,"Workplace can be really stressful at times. Benefits are great, pay... not so much. Management was poor at times, and didn't assist me when I needed help."
good,"As a sales associate, I was part time and didn't receive benefits. My pay was not super high. This is a good summer job or for someone in high school."
good,"On a regular day at work, you would clock in, have a manager catch you up on all the sales/updates with the store, and give you your task (fitting rooms, straightening up, or cashier).  When I was taught the cashier, I had a 10-15 minute crash course before I was thrown in which was very nervewracking for me considering it was my first job.  However, they do help you learn along the way, and with quality practice it can be pretty easy to catch on.  The workplace was very casul which I liked, however I really did not appreciate having to close, because there were nights were I did not leave the store until 2:30 am.  That was the biggest con about this job."
good,"AEO was a great place to work, it was relaxed and there was really no pressure at all, it was a very easy job, pretty much greeting customers and folding clothes was the norm."
good,This was a fun part time job I did when I was in college. I liked being in the back processing the new incoming shipments. I would accept shipments from the postal service. Once I received the shipments I would process all of the new items and prepare them for the sales floor.
good,"Like any teenager American Eagle Outfitters is a perfect place to start working. You work with and see different people everyday, calm and fun environment and never a stressful moment. Co-workers and management were cool and I never had a hard time."
good,"- Discount is good (40-80%) + 25% off on Clearance"
good,American Eagle is a great place to work.  Ive learned that you must be a multitasked to work as a manager at American Eagle.  I enjoyed working in the different DOR's while at the store.
good,Its a retail job what more is there to really say. Its great for high school kids and college students. Not a career for somebody who is looking to succeed with the company
good,this job is great for those who are in need of a first job . this job really is a good start and gives excellent schedules and flexibilities as well as discounts for those who love shopping.
good,"A typical day of work at American Eagle Outfitters would include me checking the fitting rooms and ensuring that no clothes were left behind. I would check the system to see if there were any online orders pending from our store and I would complete that order. I would assist customers with any purchases they had or assist with styling the customer as well. If packages were brought to the store, I would assist with processing packages to the store as well."
good,They are just like any other retailer in that they drive sales and credit cards. Advancement opportunities are very small and slow to come up. You work very hard for little pay.
good,"As far as a sales associate, don't count on that place to make money. All (almost) our sales associates had other jobs bc we only give like 3, 4 hour shifts @ minimum wage. Managers are another story, but it's great if u want the discount, and only want to work a few days a wee. But, the pay is terrible (unless your a manager), and the work is demanding."
good,Worked in the stock room and was up to my ears in stock items in the fall to winter seasons.  Had only myself to tag and organize an entire stock room.  The people were great though and made the job fun especially management.  I don't think minimum wage is enough to work 14 hour days so they definitely need to allocate more money to their branches.  Sometimes I didn't even eat lunch just because I had so many boxes to get through and I wanted to get home at some point.
good,"a typical day at work usually consist of handling and knowing how to use a computer properly and specific software and apps that the computer is already program do have. The employee's work day also consist of meeting customer satisfactory, organizing and stocking items, handling money and using advanced math skills to calculate problems on a everyday basis."
good,Job is easy you get your assignment when you get in for your shift you get your schedule printed out weekly so you know when to come. Everything is simple besides when customers are being difficult.
good,"Overall American Eagle is a retailer that is currently doing well despite the tough market. It is extremely busy and teams are very lean. I've learned a great deal in the time I've been there, but there is too much work and not enough people."
good,"A fun and effective enviroment, amazing team to work with, amazing 80% discount. hours were usually rough for a part time manager, could get called in unexpectedly to run 1 am to 7 am overnights or to open 30 minutes before opening on a day off on a consistant basis. If you want a consistent and fair schedule, sales lead is not for you. Averaging 36-50 hours a week without benefits."
good,"A good job for the seasonal worker. Expect a long day considering which season you are in. Management is normally mild tempered focused on the days goals. At times u may have a store full of just browsers who may just tornado the store and not buy anything, so the recovery and customer service aspects get a little flustered."
good,There were several managers who loved what they did and there was the store manager who really just did not care to be there at all. Tons of opportunities to advance in the workplace there.
good,I love the company but the management team I had was terrible. It was an all female store and the store manager was the worst I've ever had. She doesn't care if it's not about her. She has to be the center of attention. She won't text you back if she's mad at you. It sucked beigna male employee for that location.
good,"American eagle outfitters is a great place to work. It's very easy going and they are willing to work with your schedule, however they don't always give you enough hours"
good,This would be best described as A Hipster clothing store and A Millennial Clothing store. Don't get me wrong but Working to sell people cloths Isn't the  most interesting thing in the world
good,"This job was very customer oriented."
good,Working at American Eagle Outfitters was a good job. The work was great and the association with customers was fantastic. The only issue with working there were the managers. They did not know how to correctly organise a work schedule and so there were several shifts that were cancelled as I was on my way to work.
good,"Working at American Eagle has its perks, mostly just the discounts on cute clothes. The downfall of working there is you don't get scheduled very often. I get scheduled maybe one to two days a week and get paid minimum wage ($9.30). That doesn't help paying the bills every month, even though I'm only 18. There are 40+ employees when there should only be maybe 20 or less. Overall, the employees are nice and the customers require little to no help"
good,"Honestly, it depends on your boss.  As long as he or she actually trains you to sell and do the job it's retail.  You'll like it or you won't."
good,"I didn't really like going to work, but I love the brand and still wear the clothes. A team setting felt like it was missing and I remember suggesting a team bonding activity of some sort. My manager also seemed over worked. I felt really bad at times wishing there was more I could do to help, but my position had its limits."
good,"At American Eagle, a typical day is just folding clothes and checking people out. I've learned how to be organized and efficient in what I do. The management varies. Some managers/leads are really cool and will work with you if you have trouble or questions, some will treat you badly and harass you. Coworkers (other associates) are really cool and I have made real friends out of them."
good,Worker discounts. Environment is fun and friendly sometimes it's in the mall so yea you meet a lot of people and music is always good and everyone seems nice
good,"A very fun easy going job."
good,"I've worked for the company for about a month and the most hours I've had are 12. I've had 5 years of retail experience and judging from the overall feel, I'm underutilized and it's frustrating"
good,"Given zones at work, but their is alot of favourtism. Not much advancement but a really fun and cheerful work environment. excellent employee discounts"
good,"Long hours with sometimes little recognition, homogeneous culture with management team that sometimes plays favorites based on personality/interests regardless of hard work and contribution to the team. "
good,A typical day consisted of sales and completing stock needs. I learned how to manage a stock room. During m time there management was shuffled around many times. We never had the same manager for more than 2 months. My co-works were good at their jobs and helpful. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the stock room alone. The most enjoyable part of the job was running the stock room as I seen fit.
good,Fairly easy job besides the days you get rude customers. Pay is a little lower than preferred  at 7.75/hr. Although the scheduling is pretty flexible.
good,"This job was very fun and the hours were good. Clothing is an aspect that I'm very good at and I recommend it to anyone. If you're a student, this is the type of job you will want."
good,"My co-workers were very friendly and were always available if i needed any assistance. Usually when i go in to work, i would greet customers, assist them in finding an article of clothing, assist at the cash register and stock room and fold/clean the sales floor. I learned how to communicate better and be able to use that communication to provide outstanding customer service."
good,"Doing my coop at A&E was definitely a good choice. learned so much from working their. There where times I thought they were overly using me, but at the end of the day I got a lot of experience and I'm happy about that."
good,"This company is ideal for college aged students- most days are tedious. Folding clothes and organizing clothes. "
good,I worked at American Eagle Outfitters as a Sales Associate during holidays and summer breaks away from school. It was a decent way of making money during break. I wasn't a big fan of working there because sales isn't really my forte.
good,"Full of energy and training"
good,"Helps customers by providing information; answering questions; obtaining merchandise requested; completing payment transactions; preparing merchandise for delivery."
good,"Im glad i was pushed at american eagle, it made me work hard. But it didnt wasnt quite a payoff emtionally and financially. to get ahead you become overworked and underpayed, with barely any recogntion."
good,work was easy just the folding of clothes and stocking. very laid back management team treated everyone well. learned a lot of sales techniques in regards to credit card sign ups.
good,American Eagle has a good atmosphere and is pretty good to work for if you're just looking for a first time job and want something to give you some work experience.  The hours vary greatly depending on the time of year (as PT I sometimes work 40 hrs one week and 10 hrs the next).  Trying to make a career out of your job there is generally very difficult though.  Most of the time they will hire new managers from outside of the company and rarely move people up.
good,"Being a flight attendant was a way of life.  I never was sure how others were able to balance their family life with their work life.  I was on Reserve most of my 5 years at America Eagle.  Typically I was gone 4-5 days out of a 7 day work week.  Being young, right out of college, and unmarried, it was fun most of the time!  A typical work day would be an airport report time of 5am for a 6am departure not reaching the end of my work day till 4 and 5 pm sometimes.  Occasionally, it would be hard to regulate my sleep,  I would play catch up on my days off from the work week.  I loved all my co-workers and I loved my passengers.  The most enjoyable  part of my day was getting to make someone else's!  I loved getting to know my passengers and laughing with them, sometimes crying with them.  I thought the management team was mostly approachable except a couple managers.  I don't think an employee should be afraid to come in to the office, but at times I was."
good,This position was a gift and a curse. There were no hours. It was below part-time. Although I did like the retail buisness just not the hours provided.
good,"American Eagle is very customer oriented, but also is strict about store and product standards. I learned never to make excuses. In retail, even on bad days you can control the controllable. I think management has become comfortable and no longer strive as hard as they should to succeed in their stores. The hardest part of this job is adhering to all of the operational rules while trying to make the money. The most enjoyable part of this job were long days with my co workers."
good,"An average day at American Eagle, as with any other retail store, is comprised of trying to reach sales goals by managing resources, driving key performance indicators and providing excellent customer service. You learn business operations, staffing your store and effective coaching, forecasting, and merchandising."
good,"The environment, co-workers and the managers are amazing. They're understanding and help you when you need it most. If you are a good worker then they give you the respect a good worker should receive."
good,"As a Customer Service Representative at American Eagle, I gained valuable sales experience and customer service skills. My duties included cashier, greeting guests as they enter the store, assisting guests with clothing selection and opening and closing the store."
good,"The work environment in American Eagle is very fast paced and full of energy. It is a very popular place to shop for all types of individuals. Although it can be an exciting place to be and can have an awesome staff to work with.  The expectations of the company are unrealistic. For a management staff of 4, the company requires too much to be done in too little of time. I used to think it was just our location, but found out that all AE factory stores have the same issue."
good,I enjoyed working with the management team but do better in an older working environment
good,This is a great job when there is good structured management. The way the store runs is very planned out. Helps teach good customer service. Always having contests to promote sales. Got the chance to be apart of management was the best part.
good,"A typical day at work starts with preparing the store, getting it ready for the first customer to walk into the building. Thats always the best, cause whether its a return, tourist, or purchase it allows us to decide how we are gonna start the day. I've learned that setting expectations, and follow up on those expectations is the key to developing an A player team. The hardest part of the job is the demand on holidays, due to the market, and the company's numbers there are more and more holidays that are required to work (ie Thanksgiving, Easter, etc). The most enjoyable part of the job is relating with the customers, seeing repeat customers, and building a rapport with them, giving them the best at all times."
good,a day at work for me was coming in getting ready to go out on the floor. what I usually did was run the dressing room helping people get the clothes and desired items they needed/wanted. when the was not busy I helped other costumers with questions they had or if they needed me to get something from the back. when it was slow I would refold clothes and clean the store. my co-workers were really nice if I didn't know something they were always there to help me out when I need it. there smart and they really know what there talking about. the hardest part of the job was trying to figure out how to run the register was  very complex for me and usually I can get that kind of stuff easily. the best part was just meeting all the people and helping them with what they needed
good,"As the title says, I really enjoyed working for A.E.O; however, there were weeks when I went without hours and at one point I had to hold a second job to support myself due to the fact that I was unscheduled for over a month. Other than that, I had excellent managers and would love to work for them again. Perfect for students and people who love love being social or want a part time position to keep busy."
good,"At work I would run the dressing rooms, count how many items the customer had then open up a fitting room for them. Most of the customers only spoke Spanish so it was hard to communicate but I did my best. My manager was very likeable and friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was picking out outfits for customers."
good,"American Eagle Outfitters is a great job for those who possibly can work full-time. Maybe you're in school or just need a little side job to make ends meet. Accept it as that because that will be all it is unless you get promoted to a manager. Even with that being said, you'll need to be a store manager in order to get any great benefits or incentives from working there. The hours are low and the pay is cheap."
good,"What I typically do at work is after I clock in, I operate the cash register while organizing the area or around the store, I then attend to the customers questions and concerns in a timely manner."
good,"I was a sales associate. It was my first job and I enjoyed it very much. My responsibilities consisted of the up keep of the fitting rooms, assisting customers, and being at the register. This was one of the smaller stores within the area so there was not as much traffic compared to the bigger malls."
good,"When I began working for American Eagle Outfitters, it was nothing short of fantastic. However, we had some rearrangement of management and that was a little more desirable. After the change, our company, as a whole, began to make changes without being fully prepared for the execution therefore making it rather frustrating. The company's goal of being friends first makes the customer interaction the best and most valuable part of the day."
good,Same as bath and body works. Hours only come around on holidays. Management is a little tense at times compared to bath and body works though.
good,My experience was a great. Every day was filled with new challenges. It was a very busy and exciting workplace with an extremely demanding environment.
good,Odd hours.
good,"Amazing place, that has been more than incredible to me. Not the easiest place to have a life outside of work, especially with the demands of last minute work related changes that take place FREQUENTLY!!"
good,"4 out of the 5 times I got scheduled for closing, and although the store itself closes at 10PM I would not get out of the store earlier than 12:30AM. I lived in Long Island so I would not get home until 3 to 4AM on most days. If I had been given more reasonable hours then this job would have been superb."
good,I worked the job as a high school student under college student management. I was not treated equally simply because I was not in college and still lived with my family. My hours were often reduced and I was always sent home on a slow day. I do not recommend working here as a high school student
good,"Better customer service, promoting sales, greeting customers, helping customers with fitting rooms. Everyone there was nice and respected eachother!!!"
good,"Manque de communication entre la gestion "
good,"After working with American Eagle for a short while, I can say they're okay. Managers sometimes pressure you to sell some merchandise by giving you a goal, but won't face any consequences if they're not met. The customers are usually easy to help and the only difficult part is knowing where things are."
good,"Overall it is a nice place to work. Since it was my first real job, I consider it a great place o start out. It is a relatively chill environment with cool people. I learned a lot about customer service and problem-solving."
good,"you clock in and start organizing shelves or talking to customers. after a while it can get tiresome to stand around but since the position isnt fixed, you can move around and make busy work while chatting up a customer and making some sales"
good,I enjoyed it for a first job however thee is no way to work your way up. There isn't any raises. They do have good discounts on merchandise which is great
good,There will be days where it is rough but there are some benefits. The discounts are great! You will be prone to shop a lot because of their cute clothes
good,"You get to meet great people and the workforce is always extremely friendly for one. The enjoyment I gained out of this company was great! I learned many new things especially as a Sales Leader/ Manager such as managing 30 employees, working with scheduling, troubleshooting and resolving issues by viewing many statistics such as conversion, traffic, ADT, ADS, leverage and, more."
good,Hours can become scarce but even if you got a large amount pay does not match. Management and people can be very caring and you build a connection. Good place to work as a second job
good,"Sell the products that AEO would have at the store. Customer service, help the customers if needed. Cashier. Keep the store organized. Pick up packages that would come in."
good,It was a good first job but definitely not a career there wasn’t any really opportunities to get hours to promoted and progress was rarely noted but it does give you real world experience
good,This job helped me enhance my communication skills and become more comfortable with people. Every day was a different day as far as tasks went which I enjoyed.
good,"the coworkers are nice and helpful , you can be yourself and socialize and feel comfortable . there’s usually always something to do . helping customers always feels great , and even though you’re on your feet all day, your feet usually don’t even hurt at the end of your shift . time goes by fast"
good,"Flexible work schedule, excellent employee discounts, entertaining, never a dull day, associates get along well, manager works with your schedule and is fair"
good,"Packing and picking orders"
good,"my day would vary based on the shift, sometimes i did shipment 5am. sometimes i did morning 9am, mids 2pm, or overnight 11pm. i elarned about the retail business and that was my first foot in the door and my first job. allowed me to learn the ins and outs and how to be a better cooperative  teammate. the culture was diverse and environment was fun but at the time minimum wage was low.hardest part was over worklng based on sales and events like black friday. it was the flagship store so sometimes things got crazy.being with my crew mates having fun and working hard."
good,It was very competitive because it was a seasonal position but there are a lot of good people there that you meet. The clothes are good and the discounts are okay.
good,If you are very open to not many hours and no routine then this is the job for you. They don't have a set schedule for people you just get what you get. In 2 weeks I worked 3 days and under 10 hours.
good,"After being working many months, after they gave me one week 5 days to work, they cut down my hours of work to 1 day per week, 3 hours the shift. Very sad."
good,"Greet customers ""welcome to american eagle"" and a smile as they approach, maintained cloth in order by size. Provide customer service, Management was okay. Make the customer welcomed and keep a positive persona when providing customer service. The hardest part to me was ask customers if they would like to apply for their card. The most enjoyable part was that everyone got along and that's what made the store up beat."
good,This is a big store so it may be hard to stand out as an employee here. They hired me just for a seasonal job and then didn't get me anymore shifts. Overall a good place to work though.
good,"With all the training tools made available for staff they do not give enough time to complete it. Yet, again it may be that upper management does not allocate the hours where they are needed."
good,"I only worked here seasonally. I enjoyed getting clothes that were discounted and the music selection was good. The hardest part of the job would have to be black friday, and christmas eve. That were the two busiest days of the year."
good,I loved working at American Eagle when I did. The management team was amazing and I got along with everyone. We were a huge family there. Also the company of American Eagle as a whole is amazing and treat their employees very well!
good,started out as a great job.  the management was changing during that time and it seemed there was a lot of confusion.  I do not know what it is like today.
good,"A typical day at work you're always dealing with customers, its not that bad at all. Its cool having people ask you you're opinion, even seeing people that want your opinion or your help and appreciate it."
good,"This was my first experience working in a clothing store and I was quite excited when it started. Most of my co workers were friendly, but I never had a chance to do things by myself because one manager was always checking behind me assuming that I was doing things wrong. It was really fun talking to and helping customers. I got a great discount on trendy and great quality clothes as well. However, I only got about 6 hours a week, and I was never informed of when my seasonal position was going to end and they never notified me when it did. Working at American Eagle was great I just wish I would have worked at a different location."
good,"There are some dull moments in the job, especially during the week it  can get very slow at times but overall is a great job to have."
good,"A usual day would consist of checking out customer at the cash and wrap and putting away go backs when the store is slow. We also have goals that we set to meet everyday before stepping on the sales floor. These goals include jean sales, how many items per transaction, dollar amounts in sales, and signing customers up for store cards and rewards cards. The hardest part is staying on top of go backs on really busy days. I like working in an environment where I can be friendly and provide great customer service."
good,Great team overall very smooth with their work and made work days very calm and quick without any real issues. management was good and very dedicated to their work.
good,Great work environment! Most days are fun and not a lot of hangups. Hard to advance inside the company which is not a good thing.
good,American Eagle is hardworking. They always make sure the customers are satisfied and have the best help. Their work area is always kept neat and the clothes are good quality.
good,"While I absolutely love working here, it is time to put my skills to the test! I truly enjoy assisting others and doing what I can to make their day just that much better. I have learned a lot about being detailed, social skills, and what it takes to provide great customer service. Honestly, my coworkers and management is what has really drawn me in. They are great people to work with!"
good,"I loved going into work and love the people I work with. My manager is one of the best I have ever had. Unfortunately, when I was offered the job formally, I had no idea I would be hired as a seasonal employee. I was barely given any hours...and as a college student, I really needed the hours to pay my bills. I've asked for more hours, and won't be receiving them because I'm just seasonal...so I have to move on else where."
good,Working at American Eagle was a fulfilling experience. We came to work and got our jobs done smoothly and efficient as possible.
good,Fun company to work for. Culture keeps the associates happy by creating an exciting and ever changing dynamic. slow moving growth.
good,"Beginning of work it would be busy, toward the end of week it would start to run out of work."
good,Working here taught me how to set short term sales goals and get through with them.
good,"its a great place to work but it seems that they need sum work with hours, and how many people they hire in combination with the hours other than that its a great place to work with great people."
good,"Solely responsible for the full life cycle recruitment of the Corporate IT division supporting all retail operations."
good,"Fold clothes"
good,"I enjoyed my time working with American Eagle. My old store was very fast pace during events such as Bay Fest, Holidays and Mardi Gras. There's always room for advancement within the company."
good,"There are different types of days. Some that are very task heavy and some customer service heavy. The company expects you to get all the projects done, yet not to task at all when a customer is in the store. However, you can't use the reason of helping customers as an excuse that the project didn't get done. It's conflicting. There tends to be a lot of micro managing and lack of organization regarding things such as floor sets.  I experienced a lack of training.  They have great benefits and offer pretty generous discounts. I have learned a lot, as they have rolling DOR's, so you will get to experience all different aspects of management."
good,A typical day at work would be attending customers needs with a product. i would also interact with my co-workers help each other in anyway necessary to make our day easier.
good,Great to be a sales asscioate to help customers on what clothes to wear. Provide great Customer Service to them.
good,"I worked mainly with the cash register."
good,"I learned to multitask by folding and selling at the same time.I handled all in store and online inquiries for customers.I helped clean store,do stock checks and inventory.I also did order supplies."
good,Great place to start a career in retail management. Training is very important and very involved. Advancement is limited due to the fact that there is not alot of management turnover. Those who start with the company tend to stay there.
good,Met many great people and learned the importance of customer service.
good,Great environment and super fun to work there I thoroughly enjoyed working there. Only down side is short break time and long hours on your feet. Super fun people to work with!
good,it was an ok job. I just did not get enough hours to support me and my younger sister I take care of. The pay was not the best it could have been better.
good,"Before this review starts, this is from a perspective of a part-timer."
good,The management at the time and staff were always super fun and friendly. Never any problems asking for time off. It was a great workplace besides for the lack of hours given
good,"The company does require you to be very competitive, and work at an extremely fast pace. They have lots of incentives to sell their products and move up in the ranks."
good,"familiar place to starting work experience if you not have any, I learned how to be a cashier, how bring a good customer service, was my first work experience and I'll totally recomended"
good,"A job that i would reccommend for a high school student. You dont get that many hours, the benefits arent really all that great, and you sometimes may get a free breakfast"
good,"American eagle outfitters was transitioning into a new brand when I had started. Though, it was nice to look at, there was a lot of back and forth between management, staff, and higher management that made it seem quite chaotic and stressful."
good,High volume store. Always customers in the store. Lots of folding and servicing. Good staff to work with. Caters to younger generation. Lots of physical movement bending down low shelves.
good,"A typical day would insist of; folding clothes and putting them away, helping customers, ringing out clients, opening fitting rooms... The overall environment was very upbeat and fun."
good,"I enjoyed the relaxed feeling at american eagle. I did not, however, like the lack of hours I was given. Our manager and coworkers were great to be around, and I got paid a decent amount considering my lack of experience in retail. Overall American Eagle is a nice place students."
good,"You have to know someone or be part of the ""Click"" to advance. You can do everything you can to advance but if you're not part of the ""Click"", you're just doing it for yourself, not Advancement."
good,ON a typical day they would have me putting away clothing and helping customer find what they need. It was a very busy job.
good,I learned to manage and improve on market penetration. Developing brick and mortar stores within and improving market penetration. I also learned about proper diversification in all different types of markets in the United States. Fun work environment. Fast paced and competitive.
good,Easy work day shifts were never long unfortunately. Managers were very helpful and nice. Hours were something I didn't agree with.
good,"Fun workplace, but management is not that supportive. The coworkers are nice for the most part and want you to succeed. Decent amount of red tape and politics from management."
good,"Nothing really special, the only great benefit was the discount."
good,A typical day at work would include using the register and folding clothes. Assisting customers was important and being friendly was a plus. I enjoyed working here just not for the pay.
good,"Around the holidays, this retail store can get extremely busy but after the holidays, is not busy at all. The management team there are extremely organized, which I do admire. The managers are very welcoming and create a fun workplace that has you to enjoy working there. The hardest part of the job would probably be maintaining a high energy on black Friday."
good,"Clock in by the the front desk computers and usually help around customers in finding their needs. Check in for fitting rooms and helping around cleaning up. Fold clothes making the store neat and organized. I learned the basics as for a associate. Doing the cash and handling, credits and debits. Organize the store and help around with the promotions going on and find the right sizes for customers in the fitting room. There isn't any hard part of the job. It was easy to go along and follow the rules. The most enjoyable part of the job was that the associates were great and plus the environment was just full of fun."
good,A typical day at work is coming in with a bright attitude and ready to have a fun-filled day.
good,Buena empresa muchas oportunidades de empleos! Oportunidad para los hispanos!
good,It was really good atmosphere in the work place every one was able to interact with each other and be able to help customers to the best of their ability and also help them pick out the best outfit for them self’s or friend or
good,American Eagle is a fun and energetic atmosphere. Employees were zoned well which as a result made customers feel welcomed and made for a easy shopping experience.
good,"I have more then 5 year of experience in shaya. but I work in shaya by contracting company. I can do cashier work, virtual merchandising and customer service."
good,"I worked at American Eagle for 2 years. I really enjoyed the discounts but it came to a point where the discounts were not cutting it. The countless rude customers and the pay was not enough for the work that was expected, so I left."
good,"Typical day when staffed with the managers I first started with production ran smoothly and was a fun environment. However, change of managers cause issues and lack of professionalism. However, great part-time job and has an amazing discount and is just a positive place to work!"
good,"amazing discounts for employees and pretty good starting salary as well. management is quite flexible and accommodating. very driven environment, i enjoyed it."
good,"a very team oriented workplace. the pay wasn't as good as you would expect but, nonetheless, it was a great working environment. pretty simple job with good management."
good,"The employee experience at American Eagle was beneficial for job experience, as it provided a challenging yet basic environment that is common among retail stores."
good,"It's an extremely fast pace environment, really good job for someone who is looking to achieve daily goals and be competitive. Only problem I had with it was a couple situations with one of the managers."
good,"I have been working here for a little over 4 years, Even through all the store mangers and constant changing of staff you grow to love the people to work with. However after a while they never appreciate who you are and what you bring to the table often giving others promotions instead of the people who actually deserve them. Now we follow blind leaders who don't care for their workers. In addition to every manager having their favorite worker and letting them do anything and praising them for it, again instead of workers who deserve the recognition."
good,"good as a first job. close to minimum wage, super flexible hours. extremely boring. be prepared to fold clothes for hours, but the discount is worth it."
good,I was given many opportunities to travel and train teams within the district given I put in the hard work and time that was necessary to receive these assignments. Helped shape me as a leader.
good,American Eagle Outfitters is a fun and energetic work environment. Typically you are always assisting customers with merchandise and hanging and folding merchandise.
good,"friendly workers"
good,At American Eagle it was all about selling jeans. Most co-workers at the store had a well balanced friendship with one other which made for an approachable work environment. The company is well rounded.
good,"Having to set your mind into sales, Communicate with other employees as well with customers making sure to stay on top of the daily sale goal. Learned not to hold back and speak more to customers as for what benefit them in any way. i enjoyed the sales and being able to sale our product to customers."
good,"A day at work was very laid back, but boring at the same time. I learned more customer service skills that i didnt have. The management was great. The hardest part was trying to sell merchandise to people when they didn't want it. The co-workers were great. Favorite part of the job was that it was located in a shopping mall and on my breaks I got to enjoy myself."
good,"This job was very fun to work at, it was very fast paced. Most of the time I would have to work the cashier and greet other customers at the same it. I had a great time learning new things and advancing my skills that I already had. The hardest apart of the job was trying to get customers to sign up for credit cards and rewards cards."
good,"I loved working at American Eagle, but the management there has a bad habit of taking advantage of your abilities for they're greater good. Other than that it was a very fun place to work"
good,"There's never a dull moment at American Eagle, the managers and employees are great to work with. There's nothing too hard to accomplish, it's also very rewarding."
good,"Great place to work, good discounts, don't get much hours if you are still a minor. The people and environment is very friendly as well. The work you have to do is very fun."
good,"Retail job, customers are always hanging around until the last second of operation. Lots of opportunity to get hours, they do monthly floor sets where you can work overnights and organize the new merchandise."
good,"Typical work day would be to open the store, assist customers throughout the day with new product and great deals. Offer them rewards cards and also credit cards. Check hourly status of how much we have made for the day. We also replenish the sales floor and also handle and package online orders for customers."
good,"I learn how to talk and deal with different customers. Was able to gain multiple skills such as being a trained cashier, open and closing the store. How to deal with theft etc.. The more enjoyable part of working here is just the employees and managers because they are so accommodating with everything and relaxed however know how to get the job done as in get in sales for the company. Hardest part is hours get barely any hours."
good,American Eagle is not a bad place to work. The energy amongst all staff members is awesome. I would recommend others to take an opportunity with any position within the company.
good,"My days there were okay, dealt with a lot of rudeness not only with the customers but the manger as well. I didn't really enjoy working there which is sad because I love the brand."
good,"its a fun job"
good,Ive worked at the Time Sqaure Location for a year and change. The managers want you to jump in customers faces and sell. Some of the customers like their space. Some don't speak English. But if you didn't sell anything you get yelled at as if you were a child. Some managers were down to earth and realistic. Others were bullies and abusing their authority. They want you to do so much for little pay. Not to mention they expect you to go above and beyond and not get tired but they only give you a 30 or 45 min break. Not to mention every restaurant in time square it packed so you better get your food before you go into work. 4 mins after your schedule time you're late. Not to mention you have to jump through picture taking tourist to get to work.  I got lots of hours because I did what I had to do. I wasn't really a seller I was more of a closer. So I got plenty of hours. It seems like every year they go down on the pay. Before I came they started people off at 10.00 when I started I got 9.00 and got a 18¢ raise less then 6 months of being there. Then they started people off at Minimum wage . Overall I met great people and interacted with a lot of tourist. If you aren't social this isn't for you. If you can't take the nagging managers don't do it. Trust you will be doing a lot of work at this store. GoodLuck.
good,This job was great for a part time job. I got great discounts and I was able to make great friends working here. I would recommend to anyone wanting to apply. I will warn you that you wont get that many hours. I think I got scheduled for 2 hours one week..
good,It was fun on busy days but on slow days it was almost pointless to even come into work.  The management was terrible they played favoritism among other things.  Would never be present when needed.
good,"You'll be helping lots of teens ands parents pick out clothes for more teens.... And teen hats, teen socks, you get the picture. Solid company.. if you're a teen."
good,"Fue un empleo increíble, aunque la paga y los horarios no eran buenos, y las oportunidades de crecimiento eran nulas. El ambiente de trabajo era agradable."
good,"I can't really make too much of an opinion on working because I was a seasonal worker but from when I was there to when I left, the hours were inconsistent and they didn't keep up with their employees very well."
good,Great environment to work in when you are just freshly out of high school. Awesome environment to meet new people and make friends. Could learn a few things about business.
good,"Go and sign in. Then I will ask my boss what do you want me to do, she will tell me to reorganizing the jeans or the tables. Then I would clean floors after hours."
good,"Management is childish and unprofessional. As retail employees we take enough verbal abuse from customers, we do not need the same from our superiors. You get scolded for calling in sick. Rules are barely followed. Days off must be fought for. Only ever given short closing shifts, sometimes only 3 hrs. Never day shifts. Over staffed so shifts are few, yet you can never get someone to cover your shift when needed."
good,"After being on the job for 120 days. I was informed 2.26.18 that all temp to hires before the Holiday Rush, are NOW not approved for the Temp to Hire positions."
good,"I did not enjoy management. There was not much training it was a learn as you go basis. It was a good learning experience though, it was very team based environment. They scheduled in 3.5 hour shifts so they didn't have to pay for the breaks."
good,the corporate and local leadership is so incompetent that the sales of this company is astounding. shipment is erratic and the processes are majorly flawed. the mass burden of the company is put onto the stores but the stores are not given proper tools to succeed and meet company goals. Associates are wage slaves with constant pressure to increase and build sales while making minimum wage and getting bare minimum hours. the company's greed is blatant. Every hour is projected to cost $1k even when there may be only 3 people on staff that would cost at most $40/hr. this company needs new leadership and vision.
good,I loved working at American Eagle but the management was ridiculous.  I had no chance of advancement and once they made that clear I was gone.  There is no reason to stay at a job and be going nowhere.  Its just sad because I loved the company.
good,"I would say the one thing a business needs to be is consistant and follow the very policies that they set forth for each and every employee. To not see that, and hear upper managerment not only talk down about your peers or your employees, is not very business like. I lost respect for this company very fast."
good,"A typical work day looks like, coming into work and starting with a pre party to set your goals, then cleaning and organizing, customer service and customer purchases"
good,"no experience required. You will have days full of chaos, and days where 1-2 people walk in every hour. Everyday is not like another. You will meet amazing people, and some not so much."
good,American Eagle is a great company. There is amazing people who work there and who will always help customers with anything they need. But you do not get a lot of hours working for this company.
good,It was a great company to work for in general but the management that I had during the last 6 months of employment was horrible. Would gladly work at any other branch of american eagle but had problems with the managers at my branch.
good,When you're told you will get promoted and then are not it sucks. The overall experience at this location was okay. There were ups and downs. The hotline call system is a joke.
good,"- Shipment, customer service, cashier"
good,I liked it a lot until business was got slow. I liked working with the people as well. I got along with everyone
good,"I had the opportunity to be trained by an amazing manager, I now use my skills to help train other employees and earned a promotion of lead cashier. The pay could be better, it starts at minimum wage."
good,"In order to succeed, you must be proactive, and think on your feet accordingly, as well as study your employee guidebook. Guidelines were a bit strict, however the job itself was very rewarding."
good,It’s a little draining as any retail job Particularly so for the hours you tend to get on average but they’re all about equal opportunity so they’ll give most people a shot witch is pretty nice.
good,"Welcomed customers by greeting them and offering them assistance., Advised customers by providing information on products, Helped customers make selections by offering suggestions and opinions, Processed payments by totaling purchases; processing checks, cash, and store or other credit cards, Kept clientele informed by notifying them of preferred customer sales and future merchandise of potential interest, Helped maintain store appearance by adhering to plan-o-gram provided by the corporate office, Assisted with monthly and year-end inventory processes."
good,"A typical day at  work: 11.1.17 to 2.12.18 busy"
good,The management is okay because the store changed store manager for so many times now to where the store is all over the place. The manager sometimes does not understand what customers want and does not understand employees.
good,"good job for younger kids trying to find jobs and learn from them. no benefits, minimum wage, nothing really special. I had to fight to get any kind of good hours."
good,Most employees were nice and laid back but the company does not appreciate or reward hard work. Company give many opportunities to advance and there are often issues with payroll.
good,Was a good job. Management could use some training. Management is very judgemental and harsh. Co- workers were less than pleasant at times.
good,"Filling online orders for American Eagle and its sister store Aerie customers. It is a common sense job. Matching tickets to order numbers, bagging, packing and printing shipping labels. Management worked hard I guess. I was always doing my own job. Co-workers were friendly. It is a big place, so therefore I only talked to a chosen few. The hardest part of the job was driving for an hour at 3 am to get there or driving home for an hour."
good,On a adverage day i pick up orders scan them into the computer pack them in their package and send them on the belt to be sent off to their location
good,"It's a fun , outgoing place to work with the company the only that is lacking is the growth and develop and the lack of hours."
good,Not much more to say about AE. Live your life! Once again the same thing as before. Hours and not really working. Now this is ridiculous that I have to continue writing just because I can't go on.
good,"This was a good job during the time frame that I had it. I enjoyed my management, and enjoyed working with my fellow associates. I was able to learn valuable life lessons that will carry me further in my career."
good,A day in and day out job of simple tasks. Grab a scanner to use for receiving work tasks from manning and also for scanning bags at planes. Overtime is given out quite often.
good,"My typical day of work at American Eagle was to recieve the boxes that came in each day. I had to open each box separate all piece of clothing to folding or hanging. I also had to send out damaged clothes as well."
good,"A typical day at work would partly be fustrating, due to the fact of rude criticism. I have learned to work hard, accept constructive criticism for the best, and motivate others. The management of AEO was very poor, because of the lack of concentrating or helping. Co-workers were great to work with, especially when you are in need of help. The hardest part of this job was to take in the harsh things said. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of this job was knowing I made Employee of the month, sold three hundred pairs of new jeans, and shared my testimony of clothing with others."
good,Keep up with the demands of bossy managers. people dont want your help but try to stay busy. Most work is done in the stock room and fitting areas putting out inventory
good,working with this company is easy and not to demanding. The focus they put on customer interaction is good to see in a retail experience. you really feel as though they are investing in you as an associate and not just using you for labor.
good,The company is great to work for. I work as a sale Assoicate to management team. You learn lot .its fast paced environment. I recommend not work at the White Plains Galleria Mall aeo store. The store manager have no experience in running the store. She will not teach you anything. You have to learn yourself. The sale Assoicate and manager are great. But store manager is not leader.
good,"I loved working at American Eagle but it has its issues, i was often disrespected by managers. They were also not adapting to my disability and refused to let me take breaks to eat."
good,Organizing boxes for shipment to be censored and put away in the appropriate areas. Made sure stockroom was appropriately organized and labeled according to inventory.  Most enjoyable moment was when you got finished with a huge amount of shipment in a orderly and timely matter. Hardest part of the job was dealing with shortage of space when we had a lot of product but no space to put it.
good,"For a factory, it's not a bad place to work. We now get COLA instead of a yearly raise. And due to that, everyone who had worked there from the start now gets paid the same amount as a new hire, which is $14/hr. And don't try to move up unless you plan on kissing butt. They will use every excuse in the book if they don't like you. And once you do get an advancement, you might as well kiss your personal life away. They expect you to put the company first. So if you are just looking for a job, it's not bad."
good,At the begining your just another person and the people stay away from you. But after 2 years people started to accept me and i got more and more responsibility. Now i love going to work
good,Overall the hours did not meet my expectations but the work environment was friendly and fun to work with other team members. I only worked one day a week if that and had several occasions where I did not have to come in due to over staffing.
good,"This was my first job at my fellow employees helped me through it. I did not get enough shifts, so I had to leave. It can be hard to advance in the company unless the managers really like you."
good,Working with the loyal customers that come in is rewarding. It is always great to assist that customer and have them leave feeling great about the purchase they made.
good,I would recommend the job to anyone who is just starting but definitely not a long term job. A typical day on the job is just helping people asking what they like and if you can help them.
good,"I left the company because they were closing stores. Displaced a ton of stores and associates in my area. "
good,"The company has taken a direction which I intended to follow in the best way that I can. Being able to relate with people and find them outfits for different events, or even just everyday wear."
good,"Working at American Eagle Outfitters was a great experience . I learned how to stock merchandise properly,sensor merchandise that didn't have sensors and  i also learned how to place new merchandise on the floor. i made a few new friends working at American Eagle very nice and humble people."
good,"Working there is just too stressful. Only got 4 hours every 2 weeks. My car insurance is 180 per month, there was no way I could pay it making $70 a month."
good,"This isnt a bad job if you're in high school and want an evening/weekend job. "
good,"At American Eagle, everybody got along well except that the manager had his favorites. He would give hours to the same people all the time and if you had a request he would not take it in consideration."
good,I learned how to work in the retail businesses while learning how to work a cash register. Management was very unorganized and unprofessional. Discounts were amazing. Customers were amazing. Having the highest sales was always an accomplishment.
good,The workload is not hard and responsibilities are reasonable for wage earned. Reliable weekly hours and flexible scheduling.
good,"The music helped get through a lot of days. Some days all we had were rowdy customers who only wanted to fuss about how the signs should be put in a certain manner because they don't understand how to read it."
good,"Sales"
good,"it is a very welcoming work environment, got to work with amazing co-workers as well as meet great people through customer service aspect of the job."
good,a typical work day at american eagle is pretty busy. I have learned what a 'floorset' is and how to work them productively. At the time of my employment we had a 3 managers but they always seem to get transferred and send in someone new so there was never a set staff. all of the associates were pretty cool. everyone of the associates stayed on task to get their work done. The hardest part of the job was trying to get along with the new managers because alot of them were the same age as the associates and took their job title a little bit too far. the most enjoyable were the customers. they loved to ask for me to help them find certain fits of jeans and different outfits.
good,my days here was different because of the different hours i had. Some days i worked in the Aerie department which was fun because i was able to help all the females pick out the perfect size and combinations for their choice.
good,Typical day at work would be making sure merchandise is at its fullest on the sale floor to maximize sales. Making sure that employees are fully aware of the business and how they impact the business and also making sure that training the employees to really drive sales up. Being a part of the management team has been great with a staff that is willing to work together. Most enjoyable part of working there is the fact that everyone was easy to relate to because we all shared common interest and lifestyle making the job enjoyable and definitely more productive.
good,"folded jeans all day."
good,"I loved the store manager when he was there everything ran smooth and everyone made their day, but when he was out or had to go to another store the other managers made their own rules and if you did not know that that specific manager was who you were working with then you did not know what rules were or were not being enforced that day and you would be reprimanded for the rules that they would enforce that others wouldn't this was very hard to deal with on a day to day basis"
good,"Typical day for me as a visual associate, pretty much i come to work, clock in meet with my visual manager and began working task. Most of what i needed to learn was taught during my time and AE. My co-workers are all friendly seems like one big family."
good,"i loved working at American Eagle, come in clock-in, and they kept me busy productive, i didnt have to much down time AT ALL, I felt appreciated when I worked there, the management was all awesome people, co-workers were a like 4 yrs or so younger than me and all in high-school."
good,This really can put you on the map in retail because here they were able to teach you everything that you needed to know. The management was very bad though and is always changing. Its not a very stable management environment and is very cut throat.
good,"Although the people were great to work with, on slow days it was not fun standing on your feet for long periods of time and having someone demand sales from you. If no one is in the store, its hard to be able to meet your sales target."
good,AE is a fun environment everyone gets along and you make great friends but at the end of the day. It just another retail job and it barely helped with the bills.
good,"The job Requirements and staff were great! Store manager was easy to work for even after having to relocate from tri county to east gate. Began to have sickness from pregnancy leading to financial trouble and loss of vehicle. There was tremendous understanding from store manager not so much from district manager, she was terrible."
good,Fun work environment. Fast paced with the ability to learn the trade and tweak your approach to sales. Flexible schedule but also hours can become scarce at times. Just a regular retail job.
good,You go and do a lot of work for the same pay as someone who may do nothing at a different store . The company expects so much in so little time and they’re aren’t too understanding
good,Work days were filled with helping customers feel their best and having them leave with a full bag and new self confidence and a smile.  I learned how to troubleshoot when problems came up and how to fix them.  I also learned how the stores run and how to work in customer service.  The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent hours and lack of bonuses/raises.  the best part of the job was getting to work with a diverse group of people and helping people find their confidence in any way we could.
good,I loved my fellow employees. They always made the job more fun. Worked there a year and I went through so many managers but other than that great company to work with.
good,"Friendly and fun, but not enough work hours for me, I need to earn more money.  I enjoyed the challenges that were given to me, like getting customers to enroll in a credit card for the company, which I was good at.  I got three to sign up in one nite, and received a $60 gift card for store merchandise."
good,"I will say my co workers and my bosses were nice and welcoming throughout my employment experience. However, it did not give me the opportunities to advance my career."
good,"They respect underage people, work well with customers, but you only get hours if your manager likes you. It isn't so bad, it just isn't worth $7.25/ hour"
good,"A typical work day is communicating and trained associates daily on getting credit/rewards cards ."
good,"my first job ever. easy enough from what I remember. was hired to work for the busy season of winter. management was a little complicated, never really knew who was manager or shift manager or floor manager etc..."
good,"I love the company, I've read good things about what they do. Not a huge fan of the co-workers I had. A lot of them seemed either fairly stuck up, or were high school kids who had no regard for anyone but themself. That seems to sort of be the norm. I got a job there because I look like I dress at American Eagle. I enjoyed the music! Love the clothing!"
good,The company was a great company to work for. People and the culture were fantastic and there was a lot of room to learn and grow. This company has provided many opportunities for my betterment.
good,"This company truly cares about it's employees and takes many steps to ensure a work/home life balance; however, this balance is sometimes lost at the management levels."
good,"It depended on the season and time of day but it could be extremely busy and hectic in the store as a Floor Associate or as the Back Stock Manager. It also could be real slow during weird times but during the Holidays and during the changing of seasons we always had to put up the new floor models and it became very difficult being one of the only guys overnight to actually do any heavy lifting. "
good,"Its a great place for current students, all managers try and work with your schedule. Shifts are flexible, and the employee discounts are the greatest."
good,Employees typically treated well.  Corporate runs frequent employee contests to help motivate the staff. Well built HR system for dealing in internal issues and employee concerns.
good,The company has a very good culture at least in the supply chain.Overall they are a very good company.they do provide opportunity that you may not find at other employers. The supply chain is forward looking and innovative.
good,"Little to no advancement or career growth. "
good,"Doesn't pay really much, teaches you a lot. Fast paced at times.The hardest Part was the pain in my feet after a long shift or around the holiday season. The culture was kinda like a family in the store I worked at. You meet a lot of different personalities."
good,"Great job for ""just-out-of- high school"" or college students. The job never follows you home. Hours are reasonable and scheduling is flexible. Advancement is slow. Hardest part of the job was the over night floor sets with less than optimal staffing. The most enjoyable was the team and we were always able to listen to music while we worked."
good,"There is room to move around, just slow in promotions. Very cheap when it comes to a raise. I learned the fundamentals of retail management while working there for 3 years. I was blessed to transfer from stock associate, to cashier, to sales associate, and getting a promotion as Aerie/BOH lead. Great first job experience, keeping up with the fast pace, and learning all the different styles of apparel."
good,"There's a large stress from higher-up management on running outrageously high numbers and they are hardly ever satisfied with breaking even. A typical LOD shift will have you running around the store breaking a sweat and feeling like you will not be able to come up for air. However, the payoff is nice when your number reflects your hard work. Management is tiered and, if you work in the right store, you can't tell the difference unless they tell you. The culture is pretty great though as I've met some great friends through the company and we continually hire top-knotch associates, but the hardest part of the job is working with teenagers who call off or switch shifts without warning. All in all, the most enjoyable part of the job is that it isn't food service and the employee discount is the best in the mall."
good,"good experience overall, management could be improved at least in the location that I was.  hours are not guaranteed and you would need to pick up extra shifts if you wish to make money in this store.  holidays are tough especially back to school and black Friday with the long hours"
good,"This is a good job for students looking to earn a little bit of money and get a good discount on clothes. It has a fun atmosphere and it usually fast-paced. Not a career, but a great stepping stone."
good,"Great place to work if you're a hard, fast worker! You are constantly interacting with people in and out of your community. You learn to work well with others as a coworker and a friend."
good,"Not much room for promotion. Pay was inadequate and management styles were ""unique"" and overwhelming. Many times I was asked to perform a job that was above my expectations as an associate. Usually management was too busy micromanaging to see that they had created a culture among the employees of dissent. Not all managers and supervisors created a negative experience. The problem was that those who did create this experience usually allowed it to settle into the employees even when they were not present. The pay was lower than expected and despite being ""promoted"" to cashier and performing many duties designated for the logistics crew, compensation was never awarded. The hardest part of the job was the micromanagement."
good,"A typical day at work would be sow. The managers favored certain associates over others, the coworkers were excellent. i liked working with this company, I did not like the vibe of the environment"
good,The company only pays the state's minimum wage base. The management seems to care very little about the well-being of the employees. Only a decent job if you don't actually need money.
good,"AE is great for a part time job. There are not benefits to working there.  If you are choosing sales as a career, it is a great place to start, with constant customers coming in and out."
good,"this is a job that is great for a students first job outside of school, moderately paced, but still fun. Make sure your management team actually cares for you. At my location some did while others did not."
good,"Great environment and company! "
good,"Being at American Eagle has its Pros and Cons. There's not a lot of room for growth and its difficult to move up within the company. It was a great job for me while in college to have some extra money, but if you want to move up... Don't expect it to happen unless one of the management staff leaves."
good,great job poor management. The discounts are worth the work but dislike having customers apply for credit cards. very laid back environment.
good,Great way to meet and greet customers and learn different sales techniques. Learn to multi-task and work with different people.
good,I was only seasonal but during that time I cashiered and learned how to correctly create the in store displays. Spanish is a main language where i was so not knowing the language was difficult.
good,Fun got to play dress up with people. Always on call due to being very likeable.Was able to multi-task from cashier to greeter to fitting room attednt very easliy. Long work days. No adavancement.
good,"When I worked at American Eagle a typical day was greeting customers. Providing answers to questions and stating the day's promotions. The main goal was to sign up customers with their credit card. Stocked and checked on inventory periodically throughout the shift. I used the cash register when a customer was ready to check out or return items. I learned how to speak to people in a friendly manner and sell. Co-workers were friendly and had a team mentality. The hardest part of the job was convincing customers to sign up for the credit card, since this was a basis on how many hours you would work the following week schedule. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the people I worked with."
good,"Accountable for processing cash, check, credit cards, and return sales transactions while providing superior customer service and product knowledge in working with customers."
good,"I had a few places in the store. I was a front greeter and I told customers or the sales and new products we had. Also, I worked in the back processing new products to go out on the floor. I loved my Co-workers and most of us are still good friends."
good,"You start with a ''pre-party'', where they warm you up for the day, then you help customers and clean up the store. I learned all kind of jeans. Management is great and will always help you if there is issues. The hardest part is the clean up the store after the day, what we call the Close. The most enjoyable part is to interact with people."
good,"A typical day at work was working on the cash registers and organizing the store to look presentable. I learned a lot about clothing and how it needs to be displayed a certain way. The management was overall okay but they weren't very professional, they liked to gossip about other employees a lot and I did not like that. My co-workers were nice, some definitely nicer than others. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the gossip, I didn't like the employees all talking about a certain employee. Best part of the job was the discount I would have to say."
good,"American Eagle is a great company; however, the minimum wage pay was annoying, considering the many hours that were put into the job alongside the many meticulous tasks involved."
good,"I am glad to have this job, since I am still going to college and they are very flexible with schedules and hours of working. The management is very understanding when personal life may hinder job performance. This job is only temporary, and I advise others to not go into American Eagle thinking you will move up and make good money."
good,"good customer service"
good,"The work is simple and enjoyable, and everyone is kind and easy to work with but as a Sales Associate it's hard to get more than 12 hours a week of actual working hours, usually you get call-in hours in which you are just about never called-in for."
good,"Great fun nd easy work place"
good,"i dreaded going in to work. i just found out i was pregnant and was told to take it easy. i had a rough beginning of my pregnancy and was told i needed to take a 15 minute break every couple hours to rest. this store had no a/c (it had been out for a while) and it was the dead of summer. i was always placed at the front of the store to talk to and welcome customers and tell them about our current sales because i was the most approachable associate and was loud enough for the whole store to hear our sales, in case they missed it the first or second time. i didnt feel welcome in my store and very rarely did i communicate with other associates. i ended up having to leave because they refused to give me my 15 minute breaks. just because i was pregnant doesnt mean i deserve special treatment, according to them. even with my dr's note they wouldnt allow it."
good,"I enjoyed working here when I first started, but towards the end when they started bringing new employees on a year after I had been there and started them making more money than I was, it irritated me, and then they stopped scheduling me.  Very unprofessional, if you didn't want me working there, let me go, don't keep me coming in every week to find yet again, another empty schedule."
good,"American Eagle was a lot of fun to work at. I got to meet some really interesting people and I really loved working with customers and the general public. Management at American Eagle was very professional and always had their employees' backs. The management team would host events at the store afterhours to promote team building activities, so that the employees all felt equal and a part of a team. The hardest part of the job was the hours. I enjoy working and working in retail is hard because your hours are determined on how much money is brought in each week. Most times, I did not work a lot due to lack of hours to be divided up between the managers and the few employees."
good,"I love the people i work with, they make working a fun place, which is how it should be. The only thing making me look for a new job is that my hours have been cut drastically because the Kingston Mall has not been doing good, so we do not have the hours, and there is no way i can make a living off of that. My job is easy, as long as you can convince a person to buy more clothes than they planned and to maybe even sign up for a credit card. With the economy not being good, it is a hard thing to do, but you'd be surprised what good convincing can do."
good,"I would clock in and most of my time I would go around the store fixing clothes and making sure everything was nice in neat for the most part. Greet customers coming in to shop. Sometimes I would work the dressing room and I would help customers find clothes they needed in different sizes, and put clothes back. I learned about fashion and was in. Management was good, they were very nice and help me in anything I needed. My co-workers were also nice and made new relationships. The hardest part of the job were night shifts during Christmas time everything was a mess, we would sometimes stay very late to clean up. The most enjoyable part was when I could make customers happy."
good,A typical day at american eagel is a medium work-pace with lots of different types of people looking for holiday or special upcomoing events. As time goes on the taught me how to manage cash counts ad register fuctions such as discounts and all company sells. the hardest part was at the begging; when i was still very nieve at the cashiering part of the job and families would flock by the bunddles. Once i learned everything i was so relieved all phases of the job became enjoyable.
good,I like working with the people but just not enough pay and hours.
good,A typical day at work consisted of arriving for a short shift and focusing mostly on customer service and ringing customers up. I learned a variance of customer service skills. The management team at the time didn't work very well together and conveyed a bad working enviroment to associates. Co-workers worked well together. The hardest part of the job was that it was taken on as a second job and was difficult to balance both jobs. The most enjoyable part of the job was working for a different company than i was used to.
good,"Walk into back room and grab a walkie talkie, put away stuff in lockers, check in with manager(s) to hear the reports for the day, sometimes they'll give you a specific placement but other times you just walk around and talk to customers and fold clothes. Managers come between American Eagle and Aerie and sometimes give contradicting tasks which is difficult to follow."
good,"The job itself is pretty easy, sell clothing  and customer satisfaction mainly. I loved working here until my promotion only for the main fact that they cut my sales hours after discussing that that wouldn’t happen."
good,"I’d worked for AEO on two separate occasions. The first I had an amazing GM who was wholly focused on making the store a productive  and welcoming environment not just for the customers, but the employees too. The second was after she’d been promoted and I returned to the company. The new GM didn’t feel as focused as she had always been. There were constant scheduling issues and even more. But after my first time working there and my great experience I would always be willing to return."
good,I worked at American eagle for 2 years and had a great time working there except for not being able to receive the right pay considering my role/position in the store.
good,I worked at the one at Water Tower Place and it was fun because it was in a mall environment but the AE Rewards was really important and a lot of the foreigners didn't want to or weren't able to sign up for it so it made it harder to get and keep hours.
good,"I liked worked here, but new people were hired way to often and I only received one day per week to work and that was not enough. It was a fun to place work for a short period of time."
good,"I learned very good customer skills working for American Eagle, the management was always very good and understanding. The best part of this job is the one on one relationship you grow with the customers"
good,"The hours for part-time employees can be very constraining. I had this job while I was going to school, so your mileage may vary, but I worked closing shifts for any weekday I was scheduled. Needless to say, if you have any other commitments you can kiss your social life goodbye. I mostly enjoyed my time at work because of its social nature, but there were many challenges that came with the Job. If this is your only job and you aren't in school, don't expect to make a living. Pay is usually close to minimum wage. Also, it is typical to find yourself fulfilling multiple roles at the same time if you work in a smaller location, like greeting, working a denim wall, and cleaning dressing rooms. If you can, apply to larger locations first in order to make sure that you get assigned one role for your shift instead of floating which can be more stressful."
good,A normal day at work would clocking in. Running go backs into their places while helping customers finding clothes then running and doing cashier. Management was nice
good,The pay is awesome. Great benifits. Lots of freebys and good discounts. However this is a high stress job. Management doesn’t work with your availability and requests well the job always come first. They have very high standards and expectations. This is not a good job for beginners but if you are oooking for a challenge step up to the plate.
good,It’s a fun place to work but the pay isn’t very good and there are no benefits. The discount on product is really good. Basically the best part of the job.
good,"I was a sales specialist at American Eagle. I loved selling clothes and interacting was customers everyday. Great people to work with, although management wasn't the best."
good,"I would usually open and clean fitting rooms/store. I would check people out as a cashier. It was very simple. My management was nice but there was some annoying drama, especially from my head manager who always complained about his job and how miserable it was. "
good,American Eagle is a good place for a first job. I learned the process of helping costumers to the best of my ability. Management was substantial. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people!
good,"Overall, American Eagle offers on-going opportunities to gain experience on a management level. Additionally, the company provides a stable work environment with all around supportive team member. "
good,I worked for American eagle for almost 4 years and although I enjoyed working for them their wasn’t very much room to grow and management at my store changed about 6 times while I was there so it made it even more difficult to determine how we would grow and build up a good reputation and trust with managers.
good,"Fast paced environment. Always on your feet. Crazy hours, depending on your store location. Hard to advance, they tend to hire from outside the company, at least with the stores I've worked at."
good,"Depending on the day work could be slow-paced and relaxing or fast-paced and stressful, but I always learned something new every day and even though I was only a part-time sales associate, my promotion to sales lead helped me to gain even more experience in other ways such as training new employees."
good,"I loved working at American Eagle Outfitters. I did alot of the shipment and floor sets but, it was always great. You never get bored and other employees are great to help you when needed and also so nice and understanding."
good,all employees have the best attitude. loved to welcome every customer that walked through the door. enjoyed helping customers piece outfits together for their night out.
good,Ive been there for 3 years & i have mostly stayed that long for my discount. Ive seen 4-5 store manager changes in that 3 years. One of which would single out employees for things that all the employees were doing. Assistant managers have changed just as much if not more in those 3 years. Theres hardly any consistancy.
good,I enjoy the setting and atmosphere or the job. I work very well with people so I enjoy being a sales associate. I do not get enough hours though which is the only downfall.
good,"Good balance of associate and business goals, with a balanced set of policies to operate under. Associates who understand that this is a job, have a high chance of success."
good,"AEO is a great place to get into the retail world. When I was introduced to the company, the management treated me fairly and respectfully. The workers there are great and friendly."
good,"Would clock in and have a group meeting with all oncoming employees and floor manager. Would discuss who was doing what (ie, dressing rooms, cashier, working the floor). Always had something to do unless slow during the morning hours"
good,"Management makes working there worth it. This is really a part time job for someone who wants the discount or someone in highschool. There really isn't much opportunity to ""grow"" unless you're older."
good,i am very thankful that i got the opportunity to work for american eagle it’s not everyday that you get an email from american eagle to come in for an interview . i thank them for the experience and the time that i got to spend for the amazing employees but retail unfortunately isn’t for me .
good,A great place to learn and grow. I was able to connect with many people and got to know a few of them even more. Customers and co-workers alike. A great place.
good,Helping customers look for the right style and right size to their liking. Carried in shipment boxes when drop off. Workplace culture different kinds of ethnicity. Their wasn't a hard part to the job. Being around and helping customers.
good,"This was the first job I had in retail and although it isn't necessarily for me, it is for some! My assistant manager made it very easy to talk to him about any problems in the workplace. Most of the people were very nice as well as helpful. My coworkers are probably the best part about my job here."
good,"A typical day at work consists of providing each customer with exceptional customer service whether it be throw myself directly or through our associates. I learned how to work towards a common goal in a group while also striding for personal goals. The workplace culture is very fast paced yet positive as to continuously offer a laid paid, customer oriented atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent hours while the most enjoyable part was seeing the return investment in business as a direct result of ensuring our customer needs are put first."
good,"Loved the challenge of working a room or running fitting rooms, but I was unsure whether I was ever doing a good job. They would correct me if I was doing something incorrectly, but there was very rarely praise or correction. The manager was very nice, but instead of firing me she just stopped scheduling me. The people I got to work with were definitely the best part. The entire store was filled with great employees."
good,The discount was ama omg. You got 60% off of 12 items that wasn’t on clearance. You would get a small discount if it was already on clearance but it wasn’t as big as 60%.
good,"Fun place to work, enjoyable, friendly,good memroies, good management, motivation, team work, family, a lot of bonuses, comfortable, positive, no judgement of negativity."
good,"it's a great place to work management needs a little bit of work, great employee discount also.i would recommend for a college student but this isn't something you wanna make out of a career"
good,"I don't get scheduled as much as I believe I should. I give them all day availability on Monday and haven't been scheduled in over a month. I know I am in school and it is hard to work with my schedule but I have Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday available and have not worked in over a month."
good,"I enjoyed my time at AEO, but I was only working Seasonal and it was a job my cousin got me because she was the manager. I didn't have any problems with anyone there, but it was too stressful and the customers were all stuck up for the most part. Just not an environment I want to be in."
good,Sorting through an average of 800 units of clothing per day and getting them to store standards. American Eagle is a place where one must know how to quickly accommodate to costumer needs and be able to stay within store standards.
good,I loved working at AE. It was my very first job. I stayed with the company for 2 years. The man agent was great very respectful and encouraging. They would have give away prizes too.
good,"This job is a typical teenage job, all you is keep your area clean, fold clothes and strive for good customer service. Its a fun place to work at as long as your an upbeat person."
good,This is a very fun and exciting face paced place to work. It can be a little over whelming at times but all the workers are friendly and willing to help when and if needed. I truly think it's a great place to work.
good,Managers can change the work environment completely.  Customers are the top priority and should always be addressed politely even when they might not be being polite to you.
good,"It was generally a good place to work, so long as you had a second source of income, I often got little to no hours - of course one should expect this in Retail positions, especially at malls, I wasn't opposed to it, it just isn't good enough alone. A typical day was pretty easy, I loved working with the customers and helping them find the perfect look they wanted, I learned how to stylize and how to bra fit, I learned how to spark conversation with strangers. The management was pretty reliable, the most difficult part of the job would probably be getting hours but the most enjoyable part of the job was working so close with the customers."
good,"American Eagle Outfitters is an excellent starter job for young adults looking to pay for collage, car, or just to get their first job under their belts. I have found my managers have been very accommodating when it comes to finding time to work between my class and other work schedules. My managers also know I do not want to work for American Eagle forever and support my future goals without any resistance."
good,"Cool job to work on the weekend if your going to school and don't have bills to pay. * biggest con, if your scheduled to close, your not leaving till everything is racked up ( was scheduled till 9, but dont be surprised if you leave at 12)"
good,"American Eagle Outfitters is a fun place to work, the atmosphere is lively and the people are fun. The management can be a bit unorganized at times with the scheduling. A typical day at American Eagle is putting clothes away, cleaning dressing rooms, checking customers out at registers and letting them know about promotions going on in the store."
good,"A typical day at work is usually me cleaning in the morning if I were to open as well as going along and signing bank deposit forms. "
good,Everyone was nice and the work wasn't hard at all. I was hired on the spot and had to bring documentation the next day (citadel outlets). It gets really busy from time to time especially during holidays. Even though the hours were bad I loved working here and the friendships you make.
good,Great sales and customer service experience in a segment goal driven environment. Teamwork and competition made the work environment fun. Management could have been better from SM and ASSOCMNGR. ASM and Shift lead fulfilled their jobs and encouraged team selling and healthy competition.
good,"overall it was a exciting job, as long I'm interacting w/ customers/guests I'm ok. I come w/ a free spirt, but overall the job just wasn't my cup of tea. Due to the CO-WOKRERS, I love all my jobs but co-wokers have a big impact in the work-force."
good,"Enters price changes by referring to price sheets and special sale bulletins.Discounts purchases by redeeming coupons."
good,"I loved this job, but it was beginning to become too much on me as the school work and 2 jobs.This is a very good environment to work in."
good,"At American Eagle, I learned to work as a team member with many kinds of people. It was a very fun place to work. The management were always helpful in solving problems, and the other team members had my back."
good,Helping customers on a day to day bases. Greeted customers when they walked into the business. Working with other employees that were great to work with. Retail is not all that easy of a job to do.
good,"Typical day is slow or fast paced, learned how to introduced customers into trying new AE clothing, less management after trained, co-workers supportive at times, hardest part of the job is to recover store while assisting customers, lastly, most enjoyable part of the job is folding and organizing clothes when it's slow."
good,"- learned valuable information about products"
good,"A typical day at work was a follows, I clocked in at work. Then I went into the back to secure my belongings into the lockers and watch a video for the key points and goals of the day. After the video I checked in with my manager for the over goals and what to succeed in for the day personally. I've always finished my goal in reliable time which led me to help my coworkers."
good,"A typical day at work started off by observing the sale goals for the day and understanding my goals as well. I reflected customer service when working on the sales floor, and had great knowledge of the cash register when working as a cashier."
good,"I really love my job here, it is a fun and fast paced environment with a diverse variety of individuals to be around. For the most part managers will work with you to insure you understand your daily tasks and coworkers wil assist you whenever possible."
good,"Great work culture, good management team, you're never bored. Always keeping busy."
good,American Eagle is a pretty good company to work for but in the last year or so advancements and pay raises have hard to come by because of all of the temporary store managers that come in or just end up leaving the company. Ive worked my way from being a sales associate to a stock person to a jean expert. The hardest part of working at AE is dealing with unhappy customers because a simple honest mistake of an associate. The most enjoyable part of it is having little challenges that make you team work a little harder while helping and making the company run faster and more efficiently. I feel that im too comfortable not being pushed to do more within the company.
good,"Service client, conseiller en mode, placement de marchandise, nettoyage du magasin."
good,The scheduling part of the job was not good. I was working less then 10 hours a week and it wasnt enough to help provide for my son
good,"it was a fun place to work, could be very hard as customers generally don't care if you just folded the entire table. the coworkers can be interesting and can be a fun atmosphere depending on the management."
good,"Go in for a few hours, purpose is to give customers best possible shopping experience and customer service.  I try to connect with the customers and have a good time while I'm there.  My managers are fun but could do a better job sometimes with scheduling.  The other employees are great, always love to go in and be around them, some are my great friends.  Hardest part is that I don't get much scheduling, most enjoyable part is that I get to interact with people all day and get to know people."
good,"I am a decent sales rep. I am bilingual talk great with customers and all but I was still working max 12 hrs a week. Sometimes I wouldn't work at all and most of the time I'd get 3hrs a week... which is just one day. They over-employ and give out horrible hours. I learned how to use their register, how to annoy people really well, how to organize, refold, and refold what you just folded. The hardest part is finding something to do --- it's so boring. I worked at a different job for 8 hours and never felt as bored/miserable as working at AE for 3 hours. It's not a bad environment, people or anything. It's just so boring. During the holidays you do get hours and it's not as boring so I would recommend working here during thanksgiving time. This is when they are really hiring and they might keep you like they kept me. Besides the busy holidays, this place is a cemetery that occasionally gets visitors. But yeah, not bad of a job. I liked saying I worked there."
good,Learn a lot . No so great managment desicions. Overall facilities OK. Salary is OK but could be a lot better. No so great Travel Plan
good,In a typical day I would help customers with purchases. It included showing different styles and fitting of clothing. Also would reviece and send products from the store and factory. Very friendly upbeat environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we did over night floor sets. Changing the layout of the store and restocking new products.
good,"Being a Sales/Cashier Lead at American Eagle Soho, you meet and have to know everyone because you have to supervise them. My job was to manage the sales floor and that meant knowing all the associates strength and their opportunities. I was also responsible for building their opportunities and helping them move up in the company. While doing my job I got a chance to meet some great people as far as co-workers and customers that help me grow as a person. I worked with a lot of associate one-on-one and help them improve in the company."
good,"I enjoyed being employed for American Eagle. The enviroment was friendly and uplifting. The staff were motivating and team players. Unfortunately my position was seasonal and although I learned much needed sales associate information and developed skills for the job, I did not have the ability to earn a full time position."
good,"it is a laid back environment, and the staff is relatively friendly. You do learn a lot and most of the staff will help you when you need some further instructions. Great music and great environment."
good,A typical day at working at American Eagle is very productive and busy. I learned about a lot of the items being sold to consumers and who to approach. The hardest part of the job was when the store was crowded with families and not enough associates were scheduled to help everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job were my associates.
good,The job can be tiring at times but it is overall a great company to work for. You have to work as a team majority of be time to make everything run smoothly.
good,For the most part I got minimum hours and worked during holidays. My first day felt rushed and I didn't get alot of training in. My co workers were very friendly and for the most part were good to work with. Being my first job wasn't too bad.
good,"If I could, I would go back. AEO makes training for their associates and gives very good discounts. I was well paid even though I did not had previous experience at the moment. It's very competitive; but if you get the job done, You'll be fine."
good,I learned quickly that it’s a very fast paced and fast learning job. You don’t get much training so you do have to figure somethings out for yourself. Just be quick on your feet.
good,The pay was horrible but the work environment was great. I loved the people I worked with and it was just a overall very fun place to work at. We all felt like friends instead of co-workers in my opinion. Management was very lenient understanding with scheduling.
good,The location I worked at happened to be very poorly managed but it was still a very easy job just super high paced and competitive.  I only ended up working here for two weeks due to the poor management.
good,"This is a great job if you still live at home, have no responsibilities and just want some extra cash.  "
good,"Typical retail job, help costumers, fill product, depending on the time of year determines how busy it will be.  Holiday and back to school are super busy and fun to work because there's so many people working and people are shopping for specific things making it easy to help them."
good,"Don’t expect to be paid more than minimum wage or be scheduled more than 20 hours a week, unless you’re a manager. Otherwise an overall good place to work"
good,"I enjoyed working at American Eagle for a few months, but I did not get the proper training when store had relocated. I did not get enough hours which encouraged me to leave."
good,American Eagle is a great company to work for. At this current time I feel like there is no room for internal advancement so I am seeking other opportunities.
good,"I worked here through school and love the people, along with getting to do different job duties while there. They pay you drive time if you ever have to go to another store to help out."
good,Although I was not there for long I did gain great customer service skills. And how to work well with others. I also learned how to greet and help customers
good,"The entire experience is what you decide to make out of it. If you want to learn and explore different roles within the store, you will come out of it with many valuable experiences. If you go into it lazy and disinterested, you are not going to have a good time working here. You will most likely meet and work with great people. Every manager will have their own pros and cons about them. Some are understanding and easy to work with. Others resort to acting like high school bullies, making the work environment more difficult than it needs to be. Overall, management really lacks appreciation and consideration toward their associates, especially to those still in school. They expect all of their associates to make the company their life when that is not realistic at all. Raises and promotions were also very scarce, even to top performers."
good,"It's fast paced., Management is helpful most of the time.  Use scanner to find product.  Communication could be better in some departments. Overall not a bad company."
good,A friendly environment.to make connections. The employee discount was a plus. Overtime whenever there was a new floor set to merchandise. Organizing clothes.
good,"Most people were very friendly, especially to new employees when they are still getting the hand of everything. Awesome discounts for normal employees and seasonal employees."
good,"This job provided me with a little bit of everything- customer service, register tasks, back of house tasks, cleaning, and much more.  You don't have to be worried about being bored at a work environment like this, and when you make someones day by creating the perfect outfit, it makes it all better."
good,"In a typical day at work, I help customers find sizes, outfits, and styles they are looking for. I use the cash register daily for checking people out, returns, exchanges, and much more. I have manager functions for this so I also assist others. It is very laid back, and the management is very fair. If you ask for assistance, days off, or have personal issues they are accommodating. The hardest part of the job is making sure everyone is on the same page with the goals, the best part is making sure people have a great experience!"
good,"This job was fun and you got a great discount! The worst thing about this job was probably when the managers would poorly schedule you when you specifically could not work, which is why i had to leave. Besides poor scheduling toward the end of my time there it was great."
good,"for a temporary job it was good, great team to work with, good company and learned a lot. it seemed to offer career advancement but not paid well for part timers"
good,I enjoyed American Eagle management is amazing. They are very understanding and really care for their workers. The employees are also amazing and have made so many new friends! It’s an overall great environment and first job to have.
good,depending on your position your tasks will be different. but almost everyone is trained for every job in the store. great discounts and usually get the days you ask off for.
good,Relaxing workplace and it's good workout while making money depending on the department they send you in. The managers are also good with you and help out with anything you need.
good,"My time at American eagle was really fun. They had great incentives to drive sales. Overall the environment was good. The only reason I left was because it seemed as if there was no opportunity for advancement and after a while, I felt I wasn't being challenged anymore."
good,"American Eagle is a very popular place. I worked in the Livingston Mall store and the managers are very goal focused and encouraging. They were never rude to employees and always gave advice and updated us on progress. I'd highly recommend this for someone who has a very busy schedule, they alway manage to fit you in somewhere."
good,I enjoyed building the location I worked at from the ground up. We worked together to build the display racks and shelves as well as stocking the products. I was proud to be a part of that building process.
good,Great place to work especially if looking for part-time hours with a good source to learn quick problem solving skills with customers. Enjoyed greeting people and helping find there needs.
good,"Love working here, different atmosphere, managers are friendly and helpful. Customers are nice, managers work with your schedule. Nice place overall and good benefits"
good,It was a rough job you were constantly either refolding jeans or in the dressing rooms. You were always running around. When it was slow days you were cleaning. Folding over 100 jeans a day can make you want to rip your hair out. This job takes a lot of patience
good,"Customer-based environment, managers are always looking to put customers first. Shifts are often short ( usually 4 hours) employees must show great customer service and outgoing attitude, or else they will not get shifts."
good,"Flexible hours, good work environment, friendly associates, but little opportunity for advancement. Short shifts, so depending on what you want that can be a good or bad thing."
good,"Jean experts get 3 jeans for 80% off and 3 tops for also 80% off as well if you go to other AEO you get 40% off"
good,"Difficult to meet expectations. Customers sometimes feel privacy was intruded on. Great company to work for, flexible schedule.  I was able to choose my schedule and received amazing discounts on clothing!"
good,"Hours were limited, could only get 20-30 a week when consistently asking for 35-40. Got screwed over on my raise on multiple occasions, and got promoted, only to make less than some other coworkers who were entry level. Can be busy and hectic, hours dependent on sales amounts, and no commission."
good,"ran well people knew their jobs and how to do them well, i found out that i do not like to be in the customer service busness and i had bigger plans for"
good,"its a fine place to work, but it feels very cliquey and I feel very out of place. Lots of politics within the workplace make me feel that I have to walk on eggshells with everyone"
good,"American Eagle is an amazing company to work for, for someone who is just stepping into the working world. American eagle always works well with their employees schedules and tries there hardest to be as accommodating with your schedule as possible. "
good,My review on American Eagle is nothing but good news. I came in looking for first time job opportunities  and they took me in and taught me the things I needed to know and gave me the work experience I needed .
good,Every day is something new. There's always new situations and new people to meet. Working here you learn valuable skills in customer service and communication.
good,There are a lot of incentives driving employees to do their best. Their are many competitions that employees compete in to get free or discounted items. The employee discount is also amazing and hard to beat.
good,Working with retail within the cashier and fitting room positions making more of a basics training type of job for those willing to start in the industry.
good,"Lack of communication created problems between the management and staff. but overall a great company to work for. although the pay for the staff seems to be below what average retail companies are offering these days, the company gives people many opportunities to grow as an associate and into management."
good,"Employees are very friendly. Typical day of work includes promoting store promotions to customers, edging jeans and maintaining the cleanliness of your zone. Hardest part is maintaining your zone while there are customers present. Managers are often shady with their workers in ways that can make you feel like you can't talk to them about anything. Overall, it's a somewhat positive environment to work in. Often times, managers will send their workers home if they're not making as much money as they set to have made which makes work a little stressful since they don't even give you more than 6 hours a shift so getting sent home 3 hours in is a bummer."
good,This job was my longest job for a reason being that a few of the managers were very understanding with balancing personal life and work life. It was a safe environment.
good,"Working at Americans Eagle Outfitters was a great experience overall. Before working, I knew how to speak to other but I hesitated at times. As I worked there for a longer period of time, I learned many great social skills, as well as how to break out of my comfort zone."
good,"Employees were enjoyable to work with, but the company often set unrealistic goals for employees. My specific store was usually very busy, which made it easier to reach goals, but even on slow days management will push for us to meet credit card, rewards, and jean goals that did not correlate with the traffic in our store. Management even encouraged associates to sign up for rewards without entirely explaining the program. "
good,I have only worked there for 2 days one of them being black Friday my experience is very limited; working their was not a struggle but an experience and even that has to at least amount to something.
good,"Its a fun and great experience. Not so much on scheduling days to work. I work little to 2 total days a week, if that. I would like to work more, but the company is great. They have great benefits and discounts. I love the people and the enviorment."
good,"Most enjoyable part is being able to work with nice people.                                   "
good,"Typical work day is making sure all the prices are correct and the customers are being helped to the best of their ability. "
good,"The people and management are like a big family. As for the work hours and pay, associates are most definitely overworked and underpaid. In the right location, its a good first job"
good,Working at ae is really fun but you get legit no hours if you're not the manager's favourite. The discount is really great and worth it but have a second job too to be able to use it
good,"The job was simple, i myself personally just had an unfortunate miscommunication problem between me and my managers."
good,"This job is a fun place to work at , everyone is laid back , the only thing I disliked was I didn’t get enough hours and the hourly pay wasn’t enough ."
good,Good company that is fun and the clothes are great.  Typical hourly sales associate job.  Nothing special or fun perks but everyone is young and energetic.
good,"If you like clothes, then this is a great place to work,  They offer great incentives and the discounts for employees are awesome.  They work well with you on your school schedule."
good,"American Eagle was a fun job to have. I learned many skills from working there. Talking to customers became easier, my customer service skills improved. I learned how to work a cash register and handle money. It was a good first job."
good,"I've enjoyed working at this store as it has afforded me great work experience and taught me to work hard and create a friendly environment for my coworkers.  However, the management staff were not very efficient and unpredictable, thus making working at this store difficult."
good,If you are a late teenager or younger adult and love clothes it is a great place to work. If you are looking to provide for others or have desires in life I wouldn't take this job.
good,"Great place to work for high school/college students, great discounts and most managers were pleasant. I enjoyed working with AEO bc it was very laid back and chill (except for the holidays) and my coworkers and managers were friendly and professional, aside from the occasional gossip or jokes. I would definitely consider working for AEO again. ( 80% discounts if you’re a jean or bra expert (: )"
good,"This is a typical retail job. You mainly interact with customers, sell merchandise on the floor, and maintain the floor. Intensity of day based on foot traffic."
good,"I learned a great deal about dealing with ALL types of customers. It was a laid-back atmosphere but important that you also not be idle. There was almost always something to do, and if not, you found yourself refolding the same clothes over and over."
good,"The day can get stressful, but there is a large sense of teamwork and managers are understanding if you need to call out of work/leave early. The atmosphere is a great one!"
good,"Typical day: talk to coworker. have fun with customers"
good,"Management was not organized and miscommunicated job shifts. At the time, however, there were a lot of changes happening at the store. Co workers were very friendly."
good,there are days where you have to be fast paced and make sure you are helping every customer. There are also going to be days where you encounter rude customers but you have to remain calm and collected and learn how to not let the people get to you.
good,Everyone here worked together. There was a need for constant communication which made the job run smoothly. The management was always around for questions.
good,hours here are very flexible and the managers are very accommodating to your needs. i have learned alot in the company and many skills that i will take with me through life . i help people find what they are looking for every day and make sure to make their day better. worst or hardest part about working there is that it is pretty difficult to move up in the company and hours are not reliable. but great company to work for and awesome management an staff
good,"American Eagle needs to pay its employees more, but I did enjoy working there. Floorsets were rough, and additionally need higher pay for the insane hours. I loved the people I worked with, and enjoyed helping customers. Also, the discounts were amazing."
good,"I love working for AE, I get to meet nice people and get to help customers make outfits to wear to any occasion. I also am able to move up in company as a manager and such.. There always something to and opportunities to grow."
good,American Eagle had a good team of girls who provided excellent customer service. People for the most part were good to work with and you get great benefits.
good,"Fun, team-oriented workplace. Friendly managers and co-workers, an all-around enjoyable work experience. However, they have a tendency to over hire which cuts down on individual work hours."
good,I enjoyed working there over the years. My co workers/managers have been such a joy. I’ve learned so much a long the way.  The environment has always been friendly and accepting.
good,"-How to work with others in a system"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of coming in, clocking in and going over the days goals with the manager on duty then selling to every costumer until my shift ended. I learned how to become more people oriented and how to work in a fast paced environment. The management team was okay at my store, I didn't like the fact they were my age. The workplace culture was amazing because the style of clothing American Eagle sold was exactly my style, I would find myself spending a lot of my paycheck into clothes from my store. The culture was amazing. The hardest part about the job would have to be the fact that in order to keep your hours you were told you would need to sell at least 1-2 credit cards per shift. The most enjoyable part of the job would probably be the times when we could have try on sessions and do like a mini ""fashion show"" of the new merchandise."
good,Overall a good company to work for if you like shopping and discounts. Sometimes scheduling got moved around out. good for high school or college people.
good,"Love working for this company, great work environment and people to work with also love what this company stands for, always being trained to improve your work skills"
good,"The job helped me improve my communication skills with customer s. I also learnt and built skills in sales, such as folding and keeping the store presentable."
good,American Eagle is a popular store but the job is in no way strenuous. The hardest part is filling the stockroom and even a monkey could do that. They work well with schedules and days off. There is little space for advancement because the management team is pretty much set.
good,It is working retail so you get what you would expect. Minimum wage with shorter hours. Management is great and very flexible on hours. A company with good ethics
good,"I worked here as a teenager, so it was pretty standard business. The original smaller store I worked in was decent, as far as hours and management. Moving to the Chicago store I was forced to quit due to scheduling favoritism and less than 10 hours per week."
good,When I worked at American Eagle it was my first real job and I loved working there I greeted people with a smile and my co workers helped me through all my troubles.
good,"A typical day at work, personally as a morning shift associate, would be as the following:"
good,"Very very very VERY fast paced environment that at first, could be very nerve racking but, with a little help from floor managers and a little breathing, it almost becomes second nature"
good,"I am currently looking for a new Job Due to my Current manager not giving me a chance to move up, In the company. Otherwise american eagle is a great company too work for"
good,American eagle is a decent company to work for if you're okay with making 9 dollars an hour and you enjoy their wonderful discounts.  The discounts on clothes were the best!
good,A typical day required me to receive and process shipments as well as stocking the sales floor and back storage room. worked solo in a two floor stockroom and kept a second job as well as attended college.
good,"Overall, American Eagle is a very fun and informative company to work for. They do not pay associates very much and it is not a very goals oriented job. They do not keep track of sales or performance like most retail jobs I have had in the past."
good,"Working here during high school was a fine temporary job. The manager was really nice and kind; however, a lot of the staff constantly complained and gossiped about other staff members."
good,"Considering I was a full-time student in college while being employed with AEO, it coordinated well with my lifestyle."
good,"This was a fun job, overall the employee discount was the best part of having this job and what I miss the most. I am a social person and enjoyed helping all of the people who were looking for clothes and interacting with them"
good,"A typical day at American eagle consisted of driving sales by frequently communicating with team members on a walkie. Ensuring that the cash registers were being properly handled. Partnering with other departments to drive results. I learned how to lead a team to drive results, by frequently communicating with team members and occasionally hold skill practices  to ensure that all team members were always performing to the best of their abilities. American eagle had an amazing work place culture. The hardest part of the job was the constant multi tasking while maintaining an eye for detail and leading team members to drive sales. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working in a fun fast paced environment."
good,It was a fact paced work place and you had to make a lot of sales on the floor. And make sure to greet everyone. Or atleast ask if they needed any help with any shopping or dressing rooms. Also had to refold and restock clothes
good,"Everyone working with you is around your same age, so it makes the work place fun.  It was fun opening my first flagship store location in Times Square."
good,"Only worked there for a couple months before they closed the factory and moved to Lancaster, PA. Working for the company was okay, assembly line work, filling online orders. Overnight shift and morning shifts."
good,The hardest thing is dealing with difficult customers and the most enjoyable thing is helping difficult customers. It is rewarding when you help people who claim they don't want help but you help them and give them the best experience possible.
good,Being able to wear whatever you'd like to work is always a plus. Working here helped me improve my social skills. A typical day at work consisted of checking inventory and socializing with customers to expand their knowledge of our products... which typically lead to a sale!
good,"*learned great customer service"
good,"American Eagle is an Elite retail store. They have very high costumer service standards and a well structed way of doing things from the sales floor, to the stock room, to floorsets."
good,I don't really know what to say about it. American Eagle has men's and women's clothes and accessories. I got a pretty good discount on clothes working there.
good,"This is an entry level job. Everything you do is entry level. Clean up, sort clothes, help customers, speak on the radio, make sure stock is put up in the correct spot, etc. A minimum wage job for a minimum wage work. Easy, simple and to the point."
good,I believe that this store was a great first job experience and a good working environment. The place I worked didn't provide very many hours and wasn't consistent with the hours you received.
good,Hated my boss. He was always a jerk to me. He would yell at me in front of customers and other employees. But I'm sure not all locations were like mine. Its not the worst place work. Plus the discount is pretty good.
good,"You always had to be on your toes in this workplace because there was always someone that needed help, or someone that needed to cash out. You need to be on your toes and ready for anything."
good,It is a good place to gain work experience. It is a typical retail job. You don't get regular customers. You aren ;t trying to sell things to people it is more of helping them with their needs.
good,"The American Eagle I worked at was not all that busy, but everything in the store had to look perfect because our manager expected it to be. The customers were always nice and there was always something that needed to be done around the store."
good,very busy not very well manged but does make lots of revenue does need a manager as they tend to be so swamped that the managers end up quitting but if you can really handle the management position then its a good place for you
good,The supervisors were really chill and fun to work with. They were more your peers than your bosses. When I worked there the store manager was super fun to work with and treated everyone with a great amount of respect.
good,"Working at American Eagle, I learned different skills like organization, punctuality and responsibility. These skills gave me the opportunity to create a productive and efficient workplace that allowed comfort to customers."
good,"Friendly co-workers, fair hours, fast paced environment, will be ask to multitask several times depending on how busy is the store but its a fair work for fair pay overall"
good,They had nice staff. great people to work with also good environment to be. Co-workers are really very good and well communicated and helpful in every task.
good,"good company, flat structure. most of the employees have either never worked elsewhere or come from competitors. US centric in their thinking. great people and growth"
good,"A typical day at work is to make the goal at the end of the day. So, if the store's goal is to make 5,500$ that day each hour as a associate you have to get enough customers to buy as much clothes as possible in certain areas."
good,Good place to work while needing a temporary job. It was far away but I learned a lot about clothes and with retail and the ins and outs of a clothing store.
good,"great environment, fun workplace, challenging at times, learned to manage day to day operations, great management team, supervised a team of 100 or more employees."
good,"Great company, love the co workers, enjoy the clothes, some training concerns regarding everyone being on the same page with certain policies but other than that great place to work."
good,I like the job because we all work as one team but at the same time I feel I do more work than any of the associates there and don't get paid as much as them and don't get scheduled as much
good,"Although I have worked with the company for a few months, I have enjoyed the work experience so far. The employees are friendly and easy to get along with, and the managers give constructive feedback. Plus, the employee discount is a bonus. The only downfall is that I have not received too many hours."
good,I love the people I work with. Everyone has such a positive attitude and willing to help you in any way possible. My manager has been helping me to grow in my position from part time to now full time.
good,Loved working here. All around great place to be if you want to learn and keep growing. There are always new projects and areas to dive into if you are curious.
good,"stocking, cleaning up what customers unfolded"
good,"A typical day at work consists of going around greeting and helping customers with their clothing needs. I've learned that valuing the customers needs is a vital necessity in the workplace. The management was very considering and provided a flexible schedule that works hand-in-hand with my schoolwork. The hardest yet most enjoyable part of the job were the customers. While there was some select few that tended to be a pain, the majority of the people I met were very kind and interesting."
good,Being at AE you are part of a family. The culture was always fun loving and they appreciated when a job was well done. I became best friends with many associates and would recommend as a great job to work during school.
good,I started out as a standard retail associate yet quickly learned to do many things other than selling. I currently find myself learning something new every day! I love my job and the various activities that come along with it.
good,Good Position to have a part time job. Irregular hours though. Enjoyed the perks of having employee discounts. Must be willing to close at the end of a day and early on busy days. Managers are understanding.
good,I worked at American Eagle so that I could gain experience with an environment outside of the horse world.  I worked very well with the other employees.  I did several different jobs and was given several opportunities to move to different jobs.
good,"I personally have been working at American Eagle for about a year and a half and I do not believe I am being compensated for my hard work. There are employees younger than me with less experience who are considered a ""sales lead"", in my opinion based on favoritism."
good,"A typical day would be clock in, review KPI's, check payroll, check sales for the day and then work to make sure you achieve all goals that are set for the day. As well as ensuring customer service is met at all times."
good,"Overall, the experience is quite enjoyable. The associates are very friendly. As a team everyone works very well together allowing us to accomplish many tasks. The environment can range from very slow, to very high paced. Management has gone down. Some managers tend to be lazy, however the associates know what needs to be done and take the initiative to accomplish such"
good,Your experience with AE is what you make it honestly. If you do your job and maintain a positive attitude you will like your job. Remember what you come there to do and everything will be okay.
good,"At American Eagle, I learned that I was actually incredibly skilled at greeting people and finding their style. When I applied myself, I learned that I am able to connect with people and truly make them believe that I am interested in how they feel when they leave the store, because I am!"
good,"I worked there part time a few years ago. My coworkers were very nice, and the hours were flexible. The discount offered was also a great benefit as well."
good,It's a great job for a teen where the hours are super flexible and your given adult skills you could use further in life. The employee discount was really the best part for me because the clothes there are expensive. I just wished they were more lenient with the dress code
good,"A typical day at work as a sales associate in American Eagle Outfitters retail store, I serve customers with the best attention possible and assist them with conflicts occur such as returns with no receipt, suggestions for an outfit(s) as sometimes they become frustrated when  either looking for a nice gift to someone else or even outfits for their own self. I also resolve customers' concerns through telephone calls that the store receives. My shifts at American Eagle consist mostly at the cash register which sometimes becomes hectic when there is a long line of customers who are ready to purchase and calls are coming in. Luckily, I have adapted to busy environment as I also worked at a Dental office.Additionally, I train new employees on the register and at times, I also help find, process, pack and label online orders that get picked up when UPS picks-up the shipment orders. At the end of the day if I am one of the closers, I double count the register money that gets sealed and taken to the bank the following morning.Although it is sometimes not easy working at a retail store, the staff help relieve some of the stress. The hardest part of the job is remaining calm at all times even when customers are highly disrespectful.The most enjoyable part of the job is having a great staff that work well with each other and help each other out during store hours and after store hours."
good,"I was only seasonal but they had me working long shift but maybe 2 times a week. They never really talked to new employees unless you ""pretty"". A friend of mine got told she doesn't ""look like an American eagle girl"". All you do is fold clothes you usually work your way up to cashier"
good,I had a great time in helping guest create great experiences during my time at American Eagle. I learned from many of my co-workers and built bonds with them and guests.
good,"Enjoy working here. Good hours when given shifts, but cannot rely on receiving hours. Friendly environment. Gained many customer service skills."
good,"A typical day at work looks like:"
good,"At American Eagle you walk in, clock in, watch a video on which you report to your leader of the day, and receive your assignment which you will work on up and until you either clock out or your manager reassigns you."
good,"I really liked working for AE. My coworkers were great and my managers were always fun and helpful. You get pretty limited hours, which is nice if you are in school but not great if you are relying on it as a main source of income. I ended up leaving because they hired a lot of people so I would only get maybe 8 hours a week. Some weeks I wouldn't get any hours at all."
good,"I feel it was a nice environment to work in because as I progressed as a sale associate, I was allowed to train others which made me feel good."
good,You clock in get the promotions and either stock items or you run the cash register and everyone is required to clean and fold during a work shift.
good,Very good company to work for but transferred stores due to school. New management team and new environment. Managers showed favoritism and did not appear to like when they were corrected for their wrong doing.
good,"American Eagle can be fast paced due to the popularity of the company and the amount of customers that come in but the employees are friendly and willing to help you with anything you might need. The customers are typically nice understanding people. The only big con is that you can get overwhelmed at times due to so much commotion and traffic the company brings, but it is nothing a normal person couldn't handle."
good,Representing the store in a professional and positive manner. Creating and maintaining long-term relationships with regular customers. Assisting customers with choices by providing them with information about products.
good,American Eagle is a very nice work place. Everyone is friendly and nobody is judgmental. The co-workers are super nice. I learned that working here can definitely boost your customer service skills and your confidence to communicate well with others.
good,My managers were all very constructive and knew how to teach new associates skills needed for the job. Co-workers were all also very helpful and always looked out for each other.
good,"A typical day for me was walking into the break room, finding a locker and putting all my stuff away. Walk up the employee staircase and see our sales goals, make a goal for myself. Then I would go to my MOD (Manager on Duty) and we would have our ""pre-party"" which is just an overview of sales, new products, and information we should be passing down to customers. The hardest part of my job was dealing with management when not meeting sales needs. Best part, engaging with customers."
good,"great for students, it is mostly folding cloths and helping customers and doing stock the people are nice and are hard workers. the hardest part of the job was running back and forth to find cloths that are in the back for the customers. Getting to know people would have been the best part."
good,"It's a great store to learn more skills and prepare you for the next step. Also very versatile in the task given. It's overall good to work there but the store specific i was in, had a little of negative air around me and i can't tolerate that."
good,American Eagle is a good place to work if you want to have a fun job that teaches you a lot. It has helped me with my social skills along with teaching me about good customer service. American Eagle was great at rewarding their employees.
good,"American Eagle is a very fun, relaxed and friendly work environment. Everyone gets along great and makes you feel part of the team."
good,The job was a very tranquil environment with fun and friendly staff and great customers. There were decent hours and I learned how to talk to customers and help them find what they need.
good,"American Eagle is a nice job for young teenagers who want a regular income for the summer. The managers are nice and treat everyone like family. The environment is nice and everything goes at a pretty steady pace. I enjoyed my co-workers, majority the employees are in high school. The hardest part of the job would just be keeping everything in order since the store is always busy. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the atmosphere since everyone is nice and positive for the most part."
good,"Great Co Workers, this job gave me a better understanding of the retail industry. Overall I like the job and would recommend it to someone who is in need of a job."
good,a typical day at work includes constant pressure to sell credit cards and endless repeating of the same information all day. the people you work with are usually really great people however and make working fun.
good,Overall a good place to work.....I would have liked to have stayed. I learned a lot about warehouses and appreciated all the help that everyone gave each other.
good,"Worked in various different situations including assisting customes one on one, organizing the stock room, and taking in shipment orders. "
good,"The company values their employees, has great structure, and gives a great discount. I loved my time at AE, and I would love to return to the company."
good,This is just a temporary job for me.  only part time now but really like my co-workers and management staff. The money is something I cant live off of so im looking for something else fast
good,Enjoyed working here. Good retail job. The discounts were awesome. I would recommend it to anyone looking to work in retail.
good,"A typical day at work for a seasonal sales associate at American Eagle, consisted of clocking in, and finding out what area in the store I was to cover. "
good,"Great management. Great co-workers. Answer any questions you have. Laid back atmosphere. Casual attire."
good,"All of my co-workers and managers were great! They were welcoming, understanding and considerate. Great company to work for."
good,I absolutely loved everyone I worked with. A lot of the time it was slow so it'd be boring when no was there. But we'd always try and figure out something to entertain us!
good,"typical or sorting and folding "
good,I started of in the company as a Co-op student and loved it. Then i got hired on around Christmas. I would often be doing my 4 hours of co-op have a very little break (maybe half an hour) and then have to be back to work my paid shift. They have too many staff kept on as part time so a lot of people get forgotten about and end up with no hours.
good,"This company is always changing, in the best way possible. The company is growing internally and internationally. There is always room to advance and the company prefers to promote within."
good,"Getting boxes off of a 52 foot tall truck with multiple and different sized packages. Unloading the packages and putting the clothes in the storage room."
good,"Its fun enjoyable place with different faces everyday from all over the world everyone has their story and you become a part of their story, you are able to help people find what they love and need, also many people depend on bilingual speaking people such as I and great customer oriented people such as I. My favorite part of work is helping people and meeting new people and hearing their mini adventures that they've had traveling its such an exciting realm to be in. My management team is awesome their are always their too listen and lend a helping hand as well as my co-workers their basically my other family. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with not so nice customers but I am very well with maintaining a professional attitude and customer service friendly attitude with every customer."
good,La empresa como tal es buena pero tanto como el SM como los ASM tienden a ser muy pre juiciosos y eso arruina el ambiente laboral.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to process and censor the appropriate merchandise with a steady rhythm. The hardest part of the job is after shipment has been dropped off by the specific package handling company and the boxes of shipment have to be cracked and sorted, grouping each piece of merchandise through style number, or color number. Throughout my years of working at AEO, I definitely enjoyed it."
good,"I enjoyed all aspects of this job. I feel I had the most personal growth in this job because of my opportunity to grow. The management always gave me the space and room to learn, to progress, and to manage others in a positive manner. The hardest part was disciplining those who looked to me. This also falls hand in hand with the ability to guide others - which is my most enjoyable part."
good,A typical day of work would consist of providing high quality customer service to customers and trying to upsell. All my co-workers were around the same age as myself so it was a fun environment to work in. I learned how to talk to customers and build a relationship with them in order to increase customer loyalty. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet high daily sales goals in order to get more hours due to the fact that the sales goals were ultimately high. The most enjoyable part of the job was building relationships with customers as well as with employees.
good,My work experience here has been okay. Most of my training has been self taught with the help of some coworkers. I feel as though the job is all about the numbers. I also feel that if you really like the brand that this would be the best place for you to work because you have to be the customer to really help a customer.
good,"Good company that sells quality merchandise at reasonable prices. I appreciate the strong focus on customers and maintaining store standards. Coworkers are fun to work with, and I enjoy interacting with the customers."
good,"Lots of tasking while maintaining customer interaction, keeping up with self-audits for the sales floor and stockroom, fun coworkers."
good,The most enjoyable thing about working with this company would have to be seeing others love for fashion and assisting the customers.
good,I was hired to help during the holiday season - I had a very part time schedule.  It was a great experience - very busy - heavy sales.  The staff were easy to work with.
good,"A typical day of work is assisting customers and organizing clothing .I didn't learn much because it was such a short time and I was hired in for my previous experience of customer service/ sales associate . There were more than 1 manager on shift at a time, so depending on who you worked with, your day can be easy or hard. I had a wonderful relationship with my co-workers they were really nice and helpful. There wasn't really a hard part about the job, and most wonderful part was interacting with the customers"
good,"A typical day at American Eagle for me is processing online orders, auditing clearance, doing merchandising and marketing for clearance, outfitting customers, and customer service. Working for American I learned that there is a time and place for work and a time and place for friends. I always feel like work and friendship should be kept separate. I have learned more about customer service and how to make a customer happy. What really makes a customer happy is when you take your time and focus on them only. You make sure that you get them the exact item or product that they want and try to help them get it at a good price That means offering coupons if you have any, offering a discount for opening a store credit card and rewards card. Last but not least just simply thank them for coming in and shopping or being loyal to the company and I guarantee you that they will be happy. I have also learned that management and co-workers can and will only help you so much which will help you to be more independent when it comes to work, but, everyone works hard in their own way which can make the job easy. The most enjoyable part of work is when I have to process my online orders. I have to get it done within a certain amount of time all while still receiving online orders. I love a challenge. The hardest part about the job is getting there because it is so far away from where I stay."
good,I loved working for American Eagle; I had fantastic employees and there was a true sense of a cohesive team within my four walls.  The one downside is the total lack of a work/life balance- I averaged 60 hours a week in my store.
good,was a good wrok environment i would work for them again if it was more like managament but interacting with customers and helping customers each day was awesome and made me love working with the public
good,"This company was well worth the drive, I wish I could have continued to work with them but I had to finish High School and didn't want to damaged anything. I would work with this company anywhere."
good,"Great work environment, and managers are even better. They make you feel welcome, and care about your personal needs. In high volume times, it gets very difficult to manage and ensure all customers satisfactions. Floor sets are the worst to work in"
good,"Day to day work included working with multiple co-workers and continuous customer interaction. Multi-tasking is a must in retail management and it is relied on daily. Working with staff that is very young results in high turnover due to school requirements and complicates the possibility of developing long term support. The people interaction is amazing. The type of individuals you assist on a daily basis, the situations they are in and the lives they live bring an interesting and enjoyable satisfaction to work."
good,"A salesman job is a job that i liked the most. Talking to customers, and convincing them to buy cloths or merchandise was an easy job. Customers respect my opinion, which made the job easier and more joyable."
good,"Starting out at AE, you are lucky to get 5 hours a week.  After plugging away for YEARS you may be lucky enough to get promoted.  Depending on the district, the DM can play favorites and not necessarily promote the BEST candidate."
good,Smile big and relate to every customer who walks in. Work with other associates is one of the most enjoyable aspects of this job. Important not to be late if in a busy location as these are counted against you.
good,"Working at American Eagle is so much fun. I love going to work, seeing the styles of other individuals and helping them create their own look."
good,Everyone I worked with was awesome and being that all of us were students (excluding the managers) we all had a lot in common. Shared a lot of great moments at American Eagle.
good,"nice and cool place, discount was great and everyone got along really well. Store atmosphere was upbeat and accepting."
good,The staff and management were very encouraging and flexible in work schedule. They enforced the rules and held themselves to the same standards as their employees. I loved working here and was upset when I was terminated.
good,"A merchandising lead is responsible for implementing Corporate floor sets and window displays, addressing customers questions and requests, displaying store merchandise, and maintaining inventory controls."
good,"Everyday there is a different outcome.  Somedays it can be a blast other days can become challenges.  I learned that as part of the management team, it is not only my job to make sure that tasks and the business run as flawlessly as poosible but to also inspire other associates to care just as much as the management team cares.  Some associates and some people of Management can be fantastic workers and know that if we do not work together the store would never be ready for customers, however there are those who feel that its not in their job description to do certain tasks.  It is hard to try and lead those who have a thought process like that.  However, the most enjoyable part of the job, are the experiences and satisfaction I get when tasks get done and customers are happy with what they got."
good,"I really enjoyed working at American Eagle because of the great discount we received. I was in College while working here and it definitely helped keep my attire on point. As far as long term career advancement, I would not recommend."
good,Working here taught how to organize and complete tasks quickly and efficiently. It also reinforced my theory that people respond well to a friendly greeting.
good,"Great job, only downside is only getting scheduled a few ours a week. Typical work week will be 2-3 4 hour shifts. Great co-workers and management. Hardest part of the day is transitioning to standing on your feet for 4 hours in a row. Most rewarding part of job is helping families purchase clothes."
good,When I frist arrive at work I start my day off by talking to the manager to get information about deals and the goals of the day. At American Eagle I was able to learn how to satisfy customers and how to mange inventory. The management team was great and always was helpful with any questions that staff members had. Co-workers were always enthusiastic about their job. If I had to choose one thing that was difficult about my job is having non-fixed schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help customers and be able to give them the best deal possible.
good,"A day at work includes providing customer service to those who are shopping, and a great experience within the store. I have learned how to improve my customer service skills, as well as working in a fast paced environment. My managers are very supportive and helping. They are comfortable to go to if you have any questions or concerns. My co-workers are very team oriented, we help each other out and work together to get tasks done. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you get a thank you from a customer you have helped."
good,"Overall a good place to work, the hours can be crazy but for the most part it is fine. The worst thing would have to be the floorsets, you arent required to do them but if you do plan on being there until 6 am."
good,A typical day work consists of interacting with staff members and customers. Being an employee at American Eagle Outfitters I have learned the importance of having great people and communication skills being that you will interact with various individuals throughout a shift. The management team and employees are all hard working individuals. What I enjoy the most is being able to have staff members that like to create a fun work environment.
good,"Working at American Eagle has been a great experience Ive learned a lot working here, especially for it being my first retail job."
good,This was a decent job. Normally it was folding clothes making sure the sales floor looks up to par. Customers were a nice thing because it was nice to help out with whatever style needs they had.
good,good job worked through temp service not as a regular employee inconsistant with work schedule worked with shipping and receiving work enviroment was great people were nice and helpful
good,"Great place to work. Sometimes difficult to work with the general public all day every day, but the pay is comparable to the work required. Great staff and good managers."
good,My day mostly consisted of all the shipping and receiving duties but i always did a lot of housekeeping duties (i.e. keeping the stockroom presentable). My co-workers were typically very negative and never said anything positive about each other.
good,"A typical day at work includes always on your feet greeting customers, ringing customers through the register, and working together as a team member"
good,Job was very relaxed and simple. Day tasks were the same and night tasks varied. management and coworkers were as expected of such an establishment. Was a good experience
good,Worked with incredible leaders in the retail industry at this company.
good,"fun workplace at the west field mall,come in every morning processing shipment,getting it out to the sales floor. make sure every merchandise is censored.help customer with clothes there looking for,i mostly enjoy the discounts employee has for the store.the hardest part of the job it making sure that all shipment is scanned with no broken merchandise"
good,"Some of the best experiences I have had were when I was working with American Eagle. They are upbeat, team oriented, and their goal is to help everyone become the best they can be!"
good,"The people and the clientele are great, the scheduling is all over the place. Organizing the floor and floor sets are something I enjoyed, as well as helping customers find the perfect outfit."
good,Helping the customer find outfits as well as finalizing the sales.
good,This was a fun job that focused on our selling abilities to add on items with a customers purchase.  All of the employees worked as a team based on each others specialties.
good,"Great place to work. Fast paced environment, and friendly customers. Although this job was enjoyable it was also hectic and stressful during the winter season. It is also very hard to become part of their sales team after the winter season."
good,Co-workers are all very warm welcoming and friendly. alot of team work is put to use
good,Good place for experience. Always room for growth in the company.
good,At this job you learn how to communicate directly with customers. Also you work as a team to ensure the goals of the store are met.
good,"You are either made a greeter, cashier, in the fitting room, and assigned a certain area of the store. You help customers find the right size and fit in clothing. Make sure all the clothes in your area of organized and customer ready. Management and co-workers are friendly."
good,Worked as a seasonal employee. Fast paced retail store in the mall. Training was fun.
good,I loved everything about this company except the fact that if you are promoted to Jean Expert you will not get a raise and I was not receiving more than 8 hours a week.
good,Company is a lot of fun to work for! Offers a lot of fun opportunities and creative ways to motivate employees.
good,"Loved the people and perks. The rules the company started making got a little annoying to me. I understand rules are necessary, but to a point."
good,Starter with the bosses and finished with the customers is a good experience.
good,As management with American Eagle I have learned to delegate and work more effectively in a team environment
good,I enjoyed working there for three years and made a lot of new friends.
good,"I usually work the night shifts, hardest part is staying up late and managing my other daily activities. Most my co-workers are understand which makes it easy to team work and get things done faster. M favorite part of working in AE has to be the ability I get to help other it feels great to help people even more when I could use my spanish speaking skills."
good,American Eagle provided a fun and welcoming atmosphere for work.
good,For being my first job it allowed me to use my skills at my other jobs.
good,"•	Provide a welcoming environment for customers"
good,"I have worked for American Eagle for almost 5 years.  In that time span, I have done a numerous amount of things, ranging from sales to shipment to management."
good,usually you clock in and then do a party card then see your LOD for your after party...from then you will know what side your on or if your on register. then you always check on everyone before doing go back then if no one is around fold. NEVER just stand there and do nothing
good,It is very cliquey there. I wish it wasn't like that because of course they don't keep you.
good,"Associates begin on the work floor where they just tend to customers, get fitting rooms, and fold clothing.  After a month of work experience, the managers will allow the associate to become a cashier on top of the previous responsibilities.  Socializing with people and time management are a must in the retail business.  The hardest part of my AE experience was definitely the small pay for the hard work that is put in.  I loved my workplace and the management was great but it is difficult working so many hours plus going to school, although they are willing to work around school schedules but students typically need the money as well."
good,"At American Eagle Outfitters I learned the base of my customer service knowledge and how to work successfully with lots of different people, customers and coworkers alike. I was an American eagle employee for four years, and I do loved working there. My managers were always very helpful, and fun to work with. My coworkers became my very good friends and we all had so much fun while at work together. I learned the basics of how business works while at American Eagle, and I am thankful for being able to stay there to learn as much as I did. "
good,I love the indepent team work this internship provided! I learned a lot.
good,I worked at American Eagle at Ridgmar Mall during high school. I worked there for a year and enjoyed my time there. My managers were awesome! More than willing to work around my busy schedule. My co workers were friendly and always willing to help out if I needed a shift covered. The only time it got really hectic is when corporate was going to come in but I think that's at any job. Working at the mall has the perks of you have a lot of places to choose from when you want something to eat and there's never a dull moment.
good,"This was my first job in retail, worked with great managers. Everyone was welcoming and helped me learn how to do my job."
good,simple retail. have a positive attitude and time management is crucial. American eagle is a excellent company to work for
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cleaning up, helping and selling to customers, working on cash and many other various things.  I learned many different ways to interact with different customers and how to deal with complaints and I learned how to create a positive team working environment. The management team was consistently good, but in my years there the store went through 4 managers and was very unstable.  My co-workers were always good to work with.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being on cash and constantly interacting with others.  There was not that much that was hard about the job other than on busy days when there were a lot of customers being able to stay on top of everything."
good,"What a part time job in retail should be. Nothing too strenuous, gave fair amount of hours to those ho worked for it"

good,"There are tons of little perks to this job i.e. discounts. I love the environment its always bright, happy and cheerful"
good,"Responsible for sales, stock and customer service. Worked here seasonally during college. My first real job, started groundwork here."
good,Got the opportunity to see what it was like to work with other very productive people like myself.
good,I like working here because management is amazing and the co-workers are too. Pay is not the greatest at all. Typically a job for high school students and freshman college students.
good,"I work for American eagle the company but I work in the aerie brand section my job includes a lot of responsibility  I have to Execute daily operational, day-to-day goals and priorities assigned by Store Management  Assist in the training development with my sales associates and cashiers.  Lead and inspire a customer service culture by recognizing and rewarding my  team. Motivate my team through a compelling vision and direction to encompass the core values of AE and aerie .

good,"•	Provided customer service and sold clothing and products "
good,"i pretty much just stood in the front greeting people for 4 hours a day. i liked the employees though, they were cool."
good,This job was challenging every single day. It made me work really hard.
good,I worked on the sales floor to make sales and add additional items. We worked to provide the best customer service and create relationships to ensure the return of customers. We had goals for each shift that we had to push sales to meet by the end of the shift. I learned the importance of meeting sales goals and providing excellent customer service.
good,I learned that customer service is the key to sucess at AE. Its a fun job. You work with a cool staff and management is compiled of really cool people but when the store isn't doing well they put ton of pressure on their assoicates. Work is an easy place to work all you have to do is keep ur room neat and talk to customer for a few hours.
good,"Because it is a retail job, hours are flexible yet scarce outside of the holiday/back to school season. Managers can also be demanding of time from you."
good,American Eagle was a fun place to work. Very upbeat environment and friendly co-workers.
good,"Busy and fast- paced workplace. Working with all kinds of people to find my own style as well as the customers I had helped. Managers with helpful and kind while keeping a professional attitude. I learned to adapt to different areas and paces that the store would generate. Co-workers were kind, outgoing and very helpful if need be. Hardest part of the job was to get to everyone who needed help during busy times. I thoroughly enjoyed helping the customers coming into the store and seeing them walk out with a smile on their face."
good,"I'd clock in, grab a radio and head out to the sales floor. I'd go to my designated zone and work that area and help anyone in the store that may need assistance while informing people of our current sales. While working at American Eagle I learnt better communication skills and the skills needed to make sales. Managers and co-workers we easy to get along with and fun. Very helpful when I was first starting out. The hardest part about my job was remembering all the different type of jeans there were. The most enjoyable part was being paid to hangout in a store in the mall with lots of people coming in and out, a store I usually would spend a lot of time in for free."
good,"American Eagle Outfitters was a great workplace. I learned a lot about customer service, patience, and how to talk to customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers find just exactly what they were looking for."
good,"Love this job while I was in school, perfect hours and great company!!"
good,"I love helping others and I also enjoy clothing and accessories so this job was perfect for me.  Customer service was my favorite part of the job, I liked helping others find what they were looking for or showing them other ideas and adding on items to give them the perfect look.  Also with this job I learned how to talk to people and to not come across as pushy to customers."
good,I enjoy working here. I learned how to interact with people. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably the people. The managers are amazing.
good,"Management and employees were great fun, stress free environment, no sales quotas to meet, competitions and games were held, parties occasionally, even made friends outside of work."
good,It is a good place to work if you like retail. I enjoyed the people I worked with and liked the atmosphere.
good,Was busy during the holidays and was constantly cleaning up merchandise and clothes as well as customer service.
good,"A typical night at work includes stocking and redesigning the visual aspects of the floor set.  I learned the importance of the visual appeal is clothing stores.  The staff is fun, positive and energetic.  The hardest part of the job is working overnight.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making connections with the interesting people you will work with and seeing the end result of your hard work."
good,I enjoyed working at American Eagle Outfitters for the short amount of time that I did. I left because I was promoted at the pharmacy.
good,Made the best of each work day/shift and ensured customer satisfaction through providing the best customer service. 
good,I would go in at 5am to handle the product that we were receiving for the day and then replin the floor filling it with product. I learned how to work better as a team and to do shipments. My co-workers were all great we all had fun while being serious at work. Hardest part of the job was during the holidays handling all the requests for product while replining the floor. I really enjoyed being busy throughout the day.
good,"During the weekends, American Eagle is very busy, but you have co-workers who are willing to help you. During my employment, I learned how to better communicate with individuals and customers. I am able to understand how people think and make decisions. The hardest part of this job is trying to keep everyone happy and allow for customers to leave knowing their shopping experience has been improved; however, it is not impossible if you know how to communicate effectively. Making the customer feel like you took time to really focus on them is the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,Was able to become a part of the visual team and travel around with them to recreate the AE image throughout the tri-state. Great way to learn how to work within a team.
good,"Typical work day is customer service and replenishing salesfloor."
good,Working at American Eagle was a different chain of task for each shift. 
good,i love working with the people it is fun. i enjoyed my time there
good,"A typical day at American Eagle Outfitters included a lot of cleaning, sales and stocking of the shelves. Since I worked in different parts of the store, I was responsible for sales, returns and customer service in the front of the store while also responsible for processing shipments and stocking the shelves in the back room. This job taught me how to manage my time while processing shipment and how to be a good salesperson. The managers at my store were very helpful in training me and giving me responsibilities and opportunities to grow, although they didn't always correct my mistakes constructively. My co-workers were all wonderful. We all worked together well and I had the opportunity to train the new employees when they were hired so we were all on the same page. The hardest part of this job was the constant cleaning up after the customers and the overnight floor sets. The most enjoyable part of working there was working with a bunch of friends while be able to grow my knowledge in sales and training."
good,Fun and friendly work place with a on average 10 people per shift and management is great and super friendly.
good,I loved working there while I was in school! The work environment is face paced and the employees are always fun to work with!
good,worked closely with customers. greeted them upon entry. most enjoyable part was watching a costumer leave with a smile.
good,Ten hour shifts four day work week with long weekends.
good,"Typical day consists of dealing with impatient customers with your best attitude, Stock products/clothing. Replenishing floors when products become low. Learned more customer service experience. How to handle inconvenient situations. Management was very stern/strict on appearance/personality. Co-workers were fun to deal with."
good,"A typical day at work would be assisting customers with any of their needs, providing very accurate product knowledge and making new interractions that could lead to new friendships. I've learned that no two pair of jeans are alike; each pair is hand-stitched, and that sometimes people can be very kind to you as well as very unkind. Management is very friendly, and are very easy to work with and everyone is professional. The hardest part of the job is working with all different types of personalities but it is not a huge factor if you worry about yourself and do your job to the fullest of your ability. New friendships made with other employees and customers is the most rewarding, enjoyable part of the job at American Eagle."
good,visual
good,"Work is very easy and it is a fun atmosphere, my co-workers are great and I love my boss. She is very understanding of my school schedule and I enjoy meeting people who are shopping during holiday rush."
good,Make sales.
good,"A typical day at work would be come in grab your walkie, do your AE paperwork on new releases and sales."
good,"A typical day at American Eagle would depend on our sales or when your shift was. If you worked during the morning shifts you kept busy considering more customers. What I learned from American Eagle is to never let another person's comments get you down, or their harsh sarcasm because I'm a bigger girl working at American Eagle. Nobody's perfect so why should there be discrimination because I'm not a size 4, I loved all my co-workers considering they didn't care about my size. All in all it was a great experience but I'm looking towards my future and where I belong."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer who truly appreciates the great customer service that we give.

good,"In an average day, my responsibilities consist of:"
good,There is a constant focus on keeping the sales focus around the customers' needs and how to fulfill them. I am constantly developing my management teams to take on the store manager resposibilities to keep them learning and potentially move on to a promotion at another store. The hardest part of the job is trying to connect enough with EVERY customer to find out what they are looking for.The most enjoyable is the laid back environment and the the fun that you can have getting to know customers and we help them shop.
good,stocking check out telling customers the sales and helping them with their purchases
good,"This was a side job for me for extra money, I loved the people I worked with and the awesome discount."

good,"Fun, free spirit environment and definitely a good place to work for high school students seeking advancement!"
good,"typical day of work, working the cash and wrap and floor. i get people to sign up for credit cards and rewards cards. the managment is good. the hardest part for me is not recieving little hours a week. most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with people"
good,"It depends on they time of day and what shift you were working in what you would be doing. I works many different things like cash, and dressing room, and even greeting. The managers were nice and helpful when you needed it. Co workers were also really nice and willing to cover for you if needed. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what hours you would work every week or if you would have any. I liked the people though and that is what made it enjoyable."
good,Had a blast working here. The atmosphere was completely amazing. Working with a ton of customers and a wide variety of races made this job great.
good,Each day consisted of merchandising. I learned what it takes to have great customer service. Management was amazing. The employees are family. I enjoyed the new floor-sets each season.
good,American Eagle was just a typical clothing store. I never had any problems with this store. The people were nice and the work was easy. The only reason I left was because I wasnt getting any hours.
good,This was my first job and first time interacting with customer face to face. I learned numerous of steps to increase customer service satisfaction.
good,Very welcoming environment.
good,"My role consisted of representing the company at all times by greeting the customers in a friendly manner, assisting customers in finding items they were looking for and suggesting additional items. Take customer payment, fold and bag customer purchases in a neat manner so clothing does not wrinkle."
good,"Hadr work, learned how to Handel all walks of people,management is judgmental,co workers are nice,floor set are horrible."
good,"Provide customer service, greet customers, sell merchandise, cleaned working area, organized clothing, cashier, multitasking skills"
good,"high energy level work place, loud, fast past."
good,"It was a pleasure to work at AEO. I worked at the Design Office in NY. Great people, great community. I have learned many skills and learned how to manage teams during my time at AE."
good,"It was always a fun place to work. My co-workers were awesome and supportive. The management taught me the necessary skills quickly and thoroughly. The management always pushed for better from employees in productive, positive ways."
good,"Great company to work for if you are looking for a high energy, high demand, and face paced job."
good,My goals where to recieve customer loyalty by sign up for credit cards and points cards. In addition to customer loyalty I had to have the store presentable at all times and help needy customers in their daily shopping.
good,"I enjoyed the work I was given and both the seasonal and permanent staff were amiable. A typical day involved preparing merchandise to be sent out to the floor, filling tables and organizing displays, assisting customers, and organizing the stock room. The hardest part of the job was when we kept receiving shipments for large, fluffy sweaters that no one wanted to buy and we couldn't find room for them in the stock room…and also just getting the merchandise out and ready to be put on the floor or put in the stock room. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere. Near the end of my seasonal employment, some of the staff had come to act more like a group of friends instead of just fellow employees."
good,"I am a lead cashier at AE, I started working there in the Fall of '07 and have worked there ever since. From the time that I started working there till now I have learned a lot about management skills, and about people. I know how to be assertive and I know how to coach people well, I like teaching people how to do specific things. A typical day at work for me basically doing a little bit of everything, meaning getting sizes for people, putting things away, helping people, cashiering, and selling. My co workers are people from the ages of 16 to any age really, and I like working with most of them. The only downfall is that I don't have a lot of patience so when I have to work with a difficult customer, its hard for me to sometimes stay calm and patient with them. The hardest part of my job is that I miss out on a lot with my family and friends and boyfriend. I work every weekend and don't normally get them off, I am always at work or at home. That being said, I love the people that I work with, they are all extremely nice and we all have a great time while working together."
good,"A place for the summer time, you get to work with all your friends. The discount is so worth it peers are nice. You also get first dibs on the new things that come in."
good,Working for American Eagle has been a good learning experience for retail. It's taught me that retail is not what I want my career to be though.
good,"I loved my job at American Eagle. I felt valued and appreciated, but I was never able to fully advance. I worked my harder and advanced to cash lead, but that was because there were no other options. I loved my job and felt I had a purpose, but overall I left because I felt there was no way for me to advance in my company."
good,There was 80 employees over the season which was crazy because not everyone was getting the hours that they needed. I noticed that Everyone was able to get there job completed when they were told and there were someone people who were very helpful to the people that needed helped wither they needed helped and they asked or not but they helped.
good,"My time at AEO was constantly ""playing telephone"" with other store teams. My training was very brief which resulted in many unanswered questions on important HR related issues. Each store team has a different method or answer as many of them were not fully trained as well."
good,"With the right people managing, this job can have a lot of potential and room to grow and move up. The company as a whole, takes care of their employees and offers great incentives. No drug testing hurts because many abuse this as job security because they know there are no consequences. But it does hurt the company and that's one thing that can be improved upon"
good,As a staffing supervisor you do the forecasting for the business. You are in charge of hiring of all the brand ambassadors and you are in charge of schedule making.
good,American Eagle offers a great experience in retail.  The work life balance is pretty good.  The product is easy to sell as it is good quality.  There is ample room for growth.
good,"I only worked there for my work experience course in school. They had me doing promotions: welcoming everyone who comes in and tell them every promotions that we have. It was physically and emotionally draining. Working in the fitting room was a little better, until customers start asking for sizes. You'll have to look first on the shelves and if you can't find them, you'll have to look in the computer and in the back. It's also difficult when you're closing because you have to leave the same time as everyone else even when your shift is done. That means you have to stay behind and clean as much as possible: folding clothes and arranging them."
good,there could be some changes to improve employee benefits in a total but in the end i always walk in the a warm welcome and do enjoy working with everyone.
good,"In the store, I worked at management scheduled people they liked/knew better rather than making it an even playing field for everyone. The training was not the best, but hands-on learning while working was the best way to learn the ins and outs anyways. The discount is great."
good,"I really enjoyed my time here, the only reason I quit was because the pay wasn't that great. However, the discount I got made up for the lack of pay, which is what I really enjoyed."
good,"Work here is related to a life style, a style that must be understood to get in to the mood and make all the customer experience better."
good,"A typical day at work is clock-In, talk to management about what the goals for the day. "
good,"I loved all my managers, they were all very nice people but the scheduling needed some work. they would schedule me some days and then there were two days where the removed me from schedule and failed to  inform me and I still drove to work and I do not live close"
good,If there were times that you were unavailable to work they would end up completely limiting your hours in the future. They tend to promote the people they like over the people who have more skill or have been there longer.
good,American  Eagle Outfitters was a good work experience for me. There was a lot of good communication between all of the staff. The managers attitudes were mostly always positive.
good,"The manager I had vas very attentive and very supportive. However l, I transferred to another store for winter break and it was totally different . The company also have some irealistic goals."
good,A typical day would consist of me either on the register are been assigned to an area were I was in control of laying out new wardrobe. And maintain the cleanness of my area before been rationed to the fitting room area.
good,"A typical day at work for me, would be clocking in asking managers if they need assistance on any tasks and if so i help them and if not then i make sure fitting rooms are cleared and help customers as i recover the store front to back. I have learned a lot about certain tasks and certain ways there are to do things. The most enjoyable part of the job is shopping and working lol. The hardest part of the job is mainly being responsible for 8 things at once and making sure they all get done and also communication"
good,"the company is fun. if the store manager is doing the right stuff, it flows well. I have enjoyed it, great discount, pay is great for managers........"
good,"My main issue with American Eagle was the scheduling. I was hardly ever scheduled to work, and found this inn convenient. However, working was enjoyable, and the fellow associates i found were generally kind. You were always busy doing something, and there was never a dull moment"
good,"Like any retail environment, American Eagle Outfitters compliments itself by associating itself with the most modern fashion trends. As such you are required to represent the brand by not only wreaking merchandise to represent the company overall to also encourage shoppers to make purchases based upon these trends."
good,"I just started working there and got promoted within 3 weeks of working.  The managers are cool, but the back room is a complete disaster and in need of major organization"
good,"Overall it can be a fun job at times, you're are on your feet most of the time. Most people are nice and have manners ""most"". The work space can be a bit hectic at times with many customers coming in."
good,The AE I worked at had a great team culture and everyone got along well. The holiday seasons can get very stressful but off seasons are pretty dead and mainly just involve the managers trying to keep you busy but there's not much to do.
good,"As a senior in high school, American Eagle was my job when i wasnt in school or at practice, though i hardly had shifts i learned about the sales cultrual which pulled me to want to succeed in the sales industry,"
good,everyone that worked there was very nice. it was a great atmosphere. the day seemed to fly by because you didn't feel like you were in a work environment. the management staff was always willing to work with you to make sure that your schedule worked best for you and the company needs.
good,"They said they were gonna work me, and haven’t worked me at all yet besides a total of 5 1/2 hours . They said I’d work 20-30 hours a week and they still won’t put me on the schedule, it’s been like 2-3 weeks. I wanna work, so I feel as if this isn’t the place for me"
good,"If you are looking for a temporary job, something that won't necessarily pay your bills but one that can pay for textbooks or other supplys, then AE is an okay choice."
good,it was fun working because the people there were so joyful and fun. Of course we'd work but they made cleaning and stocking clothes enjoyable. Very nice place to work.
good,The sales during the holiday are very good. They have the place well organized during that time of the year. In addition to having really good managers that know what they are doing.
good,"Working for American Eagle Outfitters has taught me so much, I have fun working with my co-workers and we bond like a family. I believe American Eagle has amazing views on the world and we accept everybody for who they are and what they aspire to be in life. The management has meetings once a week and we focus on how to make our store better. Management team always has a positive attitude and focuses on exciting our customers, and associates, with our promotions and events/campaigns we have going on I n store and ones that are coming up. We thrive in helping customers fine what they need by asking open-ended questions and focusing on their style."
good,"Very busy days, filled with customer interaction. I learned how to be a cashier and a manager. The hardest part of the job were the hours and standing on your feet all day. Most enjoyable part was meeting people and helping them pick outfits and gifts. Management was mostly wonderful, although there were a few bad seeds."
good,It's an environment that tries to be a family but it ends up like a regular job due to employes being replaceable. In order to progress and get better positions workers must give their life to the job and to always be available more than being the best employe.
good,"Great discounts, and a great place to work part time to get extra pocket money. Managers are nice and the work is easy to learn. Need social skills and an ability to work fast."
good,American Eagle has very relaxed enviornment. It was perfect for a job to help you while your in school. Hours are flexible and the pay was always fair. It also helps that American Eagle has always stayed trendy so you were always with the crowd.
good,"Typically at work I would help people in the fitting rooms (unlock the rooms, collect items and put them back on the racks) or fold jeans and other items. I learned how to fold clothing. The managers were very nice and funny. It was a faster paced environment with so many different products that it was sometimes overwhelming. The hardest part of the job was keeping track of where each item belonged. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers."
good,"If youre a young person or a high school/college student, you should work here. There are great discounts on clothing and the managers make it fun to be there. Just be cautious because with that many ""friendly"" managers and employees, people do play favorite and the drama is not worth it. Just do your job."
good,typical work day is okay. slow seasons make for long shifts. i learner to better interact with people. management could be better but over all not bad
good,While working at American Eagle I learned a little bit more patience with how some people can be so I thought that was good for me. It was nice helping people get/find what they want and/or looking for.
good,"American Eagle was my first job in retail, and was overall good experience. The sales goals and company structure were well put together, but it was minimum wage so making adequate money meant really putting in a lot of hours."
good,"It was a fun and bubbly environment. Most of the workers are really nice. I think AE prides themselves on their employees' attitude and conduct. Also, during my time there I found myself impressed with the company, in terms of social issues they take notice too and customer service standards. However, AE does uphold a standard and makes sure their managers do too. So, it requires more out of regular store associates, than at other retailers. But I found the work very satisfying on a personal fulfillment level."
good,"This place was a good first job to get good experience with customer servicing, cashier, and general retail basics. Everything was very straightforward and professionally maintained."
good,"American Eagle is a great place to work if you are looking for a part-time retail job to gain retail experience. It is a fun place to work, and there is a generous discount. However, the pay is only minimum wage and does not increase no matter how long you have worked there; you only get a raise when minimum wage goes up. There are no full-time positions available outside of management, so it is difficult to get over 20 hours per week."
good,"Overall, working in American Eagle has helped me develop my customer service skills by treating customer's the best way possible going far and beyond."
good,"Working in retail is hard for anyone who is not outgoing. I am not outgoing in the slightest, but the way the store that I work at is run, I was able to break out of my shell and succeed. Though I do not like working in retail, I am glad that my experience was with American Eagle. The people, for the most part, are all very nice, and I excel at my job and even was able to become a Jean Expert. Overall, the hours and customers are demanding, especially while balancing school and extra-curriculars and homework, but overall I would recommend working here."
good,"The discount is great it is an awesome incentive. Fun place to work, upbeat music, great co-workers. One manager is on a power trip and is terrible to work with."
good,"Was a part time job for me in college, working at cash register, answering customer questions, and also working in the stock room.  Slightly above minimum wage pay."
good,Always such a happy environment to work in as a part-time job. beneficial for students or someone just looking for a little extra work. short shifts and friendly coworkers
good,"Aside from issues with management, it is an otherwise good job. Friendly and fun environment. Days went by quickly due to fun on the job and a steady flow of work."
good,"The only thing I enjoyed about the job was my co-workers whom I worked with. It's a good job for a college student as there are many that work there of the same age. Other than that, I can't think of any other positive thing about the job. There was favoritism at my location, management was under par. I've heard of better experiences at different locations, so this is just one out of many. It's a retail job, so expect the difficulties that will come with it, such as difficult customers, etc. I would work at AEO again but never at the same location I was in."
good,"i worked as a sales associate at American Eagle and it is not the best place to be when you are a sales associate on some days. The management team pressures you way to much to sell, I understand I have to make sales but their method of selling is very uncomfortable to customers. They force their sale associates to constantly go up to customers and talk non-stop. Personally I believe is giving the customer some space to settle in, because if I constantly keep asking the customer ""do you need any help?"" customers will not feel comfortable being in the store. The company however is very family oriented and the hours are very accommodating with school. I did however learn a lot about customer service which I believe is the best part about this job."
good,"A fun place to work but there was no career advancement and pay was low. Management wasn't great but it also wasn't bad. Training was easy and supervising a small team was easy. Getting a raise every year was great but even then the raise wasn't great. Other than that, it was a good place to work and have your first retail experience."
good,"AE was full of suprises...fun work environment, you don't feel like youre at work ever! This was very customer service heavy, however, i enjoyed every moment."
good,"Love the company and always have"
good,"Had I not been a contractor, I would have loved working for this company. There was a significant divide between AE employees and holiday contractors during my time there."
good,I enjoyed having this position. I love shopping and getting a discount on my clothing tonwear to work. I also enjoyed working with customers and helping them shop.
good,"Upbeat, fast paced and never dull moment work environment. Creativity could just flow through, very mellow place to work also very rewarding in the end."
good,"Learned a lot about customer service and sales. Great place to work if you have fun coworkers. Retail managers are always terrible though, I've never had a good experience with retail managers. Discount was great too, and flexible scheduling with school"
good,"working for american eagle was a very fun time, you could work as many extra hours/holidays (time and a half pay) as you wanted, could also work florets  often. the management is helpful and easy to work for."
good,I've learned more about managing people and a workplace. The hardest part of the job was staying way past closing hours ti still clean up the store. The atmosphere was fun and my coworkers were a supportive.
good,Good discount and benefits once a full time position is reached. Advancement is slow and difficult to perpetuate. Minimal movement throughout regions.
good,Other than some personal problems with how the crew acted the job itself was a good job to have. Flexible and worth it. The managers tried to be fair and give you as many hours as possible.
good,"American eagle is a fun company to work for, very fast paced. The pay and advancement is the only downfall. Other than that I would highly recommend this business!"
good,"Enjoyment depends on management.  If they are fun, you'll have fun."
good,Good place to work when a young person. Not a job to work for your full like but makes good money for the time being. Nice people and good discounts. I love the clothing so that's always fun.
good,"American Eagle Outfitters taught me a lot about customer service, how to manage my time schedule, work as a team, have patience, and brought me some wonderful friendships."
good,Fast paced upbeat store with a diverse group of people working and shopping.   Enjoyed the professionalism and challenges of the day to day job of giving top customer service.
good,Job taught me a lot especially how to deal with customers and improve my skills. Workplace has a great environment and enjoyable customers.
good,Working at American Eagle Outfitters was quite a learning process for me. That is where I grew my love for sales & passion driving for excellence. I've learned how to build relationships with customers & how to properly drive a sale. My favorite part was spending time with some amazing people.
good,Love the people I work with.  Would like to be in more control of the hours and days I can work.  However I do like the atmosphere and customer interaction.
good,I loved working with my employees and the patrons of the store.  Everyday was something new and different.  My favorite part was the visual aspect of marketing the store.  I learned many skills that are still with me today such as time management and making deadlines.
good,"Very productive and satisfying costumers needs. I did everything from shipment to being in registers,  costumer service, floor sets and cleaning tasks such as recovering the sales floor"
good,"You must sell credit and rewards cards to every customer. Most co-workers were helpful. Closing may be hard considering folding, etc. Cool management team."
good,"its an average working places where customers must be treated ina special way to make them feel like they are part of the AEO family.  Folding ,standard and sizing is optimal when it comes to being a part of the AEO amazing Team."
good,"As an ASM, expected to drop everything in order to make the store successful. Loved the success of the store/brand. Love what AE is doing as a brand to make themselves stand out"
good,"Great work enviroment, good people, good training. Its reallly good all the way around but better if it was more hours and not seasonal."
good,American Eagle is a fine place to work as a sales associate depending on your situation.  I working there part time while I was in college and it was just right.
good,"Greet and welcome people as they enter the store, give customer service. Assist customers with clothing, options, sales, promotions and other."
good,A typical day at work consisted of keeping the store presentable and helping customers with anything. Management wasn't bad but didn't communicate all the time with the employees. I got a long with all the co-workers and never had any issues with them.
good,"This job definitely helped teach me some new people skills. Also helped me to see that I love to work with people and help people out. Although this job did not work out due to my school schedule/work schedule, I believe overall it was a nice experience."
good,"This type of job is great for young students and those in college, as it can work around the hours you need to be in class. It was a good job for me during my university years, but there is a point at which you can outgrow this position, and advancement is difficult if you don't want to be in management."
good,"The job itself was enjoyable as I love helping customers. However, the whole dynamic of the employees at AEO is unfortunate. I would love a more positive team-building attitude."
good,"I only worked at American Eagle for a short time, I was a seasonal worker. I enjoyed talking to the customers, and helping find the clothes that looked best on them. The worst part of the job was that there were a lot of people and I didn't get many shifts."
good,"Everyday was something new. I enjoyed interacting with customers in order to make there visit as comfortable and as easy as possible, so that they where able to spend money within the store. All of my co-workers made the environment easier to work in."
good,Dynamic and fast paced work environment with very Knowledgeable people working together to complete the goals for the day.
good,I thought I wouldn't like working with customers at the start but I love it and really enjoy helping customers and enjoy the appreciation when they come to me before they leave the store and thanking me for helping them. As well as doing a good job with helping and selling customer loyalty programs as well!
good,"This was one of my first jobs, as well as my first retail job. Everyone was helpful and friendly.  On a day to day basis, I refolded clothes throughout the day, managed the fitting rooms, set up new inventory, and answered questions from customers."
good,I really enjoy working at American Eagle.  I love the products we sell.  It is very fast paced and busy which I like.  The staff is great.  The home / work life balance is not very good but it seems to be getting better.
good,"I really did like working here, but as with most retail jobs, it can get a little catty. Aside from that, my co-workers were cool and nice and it was diverse. For the most part the environment was fun and you will always have something to do.  I wish I didn't have to leave when I did."
good,"i would walk the floor, making sure everything in my section looked clean and tidy, help customers find whatever they may be looking for, either being for themselves or shopping for a gift, checking for sizes, and making sure they felt welcomed within the store. i would also be in fits, helping customers with outfit choices, making sure they had the right sizes, and cleaning out the fitting room and getting the next person in line in to the room."
good,"Working at American Eagle is fun, its easy and gives you a good sense of what customer service is about. A main focus for us is to make sure that every customer is greeted as they first walk in and let them know about the current promotions going on that day. Everyone that works there is friendly they enjoy being there and working there. "
good,"Typical day at work is fun but still am on my toes because I am new. I have learned about the stock room, folding clothes and am more confident dealing with customers. Management is very helpful, fun and nice."
good,"This was a company where it was work and a family type environment.  I was trained to do the job I was hired for and I learned how to fully operate and reach sales goals daily.  I interviewed and hired associates as needed for the company to be a success.  The hardest part of the job was learning how to forecast  monthly sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer service making sure that what the customers desired I was able to supply.  A typical day make bank deposits, set sales goals and share them with the staff, provided customer service, check in freight, package and ship out freight as needed.  Over all make everyone a part of the AEO experience....."
good,"A typical day at work began with setting my daily goals, occasionally sweeping the floor, then either hopping on the register or organizing the store while conversing with costumers. I learned how to operate the cash register, how to fold clothes properly, how to properly stock a store, and how to successfully defuse uncomfortable situations with costumers. My co workers were laid back and for the most part enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell credit cards and rewards cards, which they highly encourage and base your schedule off of your success in doing so. The most enjoyable part of my job was styling people and reeking the benefits of the discounts."
good,"Hired around 50 people, only kept 3. Didin't give enough people hours and couldn't see the full potential of it's staff. Worked with different managers who all liked me and said that would keep me and never did"
good,"Greet customers and determine their needs and wants, recommend merchandise by an individuals wants and needs, assisted is display of merchandise, advised customers on the correct care for their clothing, helped maintain sales records for inventory control, answered customers questions and concerns, and is an overnight merchandise specialist, receive new merchandise in evening and displays before the store opens. Broadened my communication skills with diverse people."
good,"if you are going to be a manager at this store or at any, you need to be prepared to commit to it 24/7. it takes a lot to run a store and to make sure that you meet your numbers everyday."
good,"Meeting customer's needs"
good,"A typical day is coming in watching a video and filling out a goal card of what you expect yourself to do. I learned how to multi-task better, how to communicate with random people better, stock, and how to meet goals in an amount of time."
good,"Typical work day was a 4 hour shift that included restocking as needed, cashier duties, greeting customers, assisting customers with needs, and maintaining a clean work environment.  I learned opening and closing duties as well as restocking standards and floor set standards.  Management was always supportive and pushing the employees to do their best.  Co-workers were awesome and easy to get a long with.  The hardest part of the job was identifying the customer's needs when they would not want to speak with an associate very much.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the work environment and my co-workers."
good,"Working in a team environment where you are required to be knowledgeable of day to day activities, is the best way to keep your mind alert and your customer service skills sharp. Your co-workers become your family and are always there to help in times of uncertainty. The only downfall to working in a retail environment is the sometimes uncertainty of work hours, depending on daily sales and availability."
good,"Fast moving environment, teaches how to interact with people from other country. Management was great co workers never had a problem. the job wasn't hard i enjoyed it."
good,"On a typical day I assist customers and help them get any sizes or back stock they may need. I provide customers with fitting rooms and help them if they may need another size. I work on go backs and recovery when I am not assisting customers. The most difficult or challenging part of the job is trying to deal with customers who are not polite and doing all the floor set work for the store and changing all the promos. The best part of the job is getting genuine people who truly appreciate your help and acknowledge your effect, that is very satisfying."
good,Definitely a fun and outgoing job. The attendance policy is a killer though.
good,"The environment wasn't horrible here, but a lot of the employees refused to voice their issues and then would complain and rant after hours during floor sets when superiors weren't around. I enjoyed ability to be open with everyone, but did not like how my peers went about their problems. A typical day was mostly in the store room or after store hours and I worked 9pm to 5am for floor sets. These were the hardest times to work and caused many employees to become disgruntled but the pay was good for the time."
good,I really loved the merchandising and customer interaction while working at American Eagle. The team I worked with was always dedicated to selling and made the work environment fun!
good,I loved working at American Eagle! Coworkers were great and the managers were awesome! I love people so customer servicing was fun!
good,"Working at American Eagle was a great start to my career in retail. The management that I had been hired with made sure that they were open to changing my schedule between semesters in order not to conflict with my classes. They were very uplifting and gave me a majority of my retail experience. There, I learned proper customer servicing and a majority of my organizational and money management skills. American Eagle was a fast paced work environment built mainly on team work. I worked with a large team and it was imperative to be able to work with every single member of the team daily. Whether it was with a stock team member in assisting a customer find a size that wasn't on the floor or with a fitting room attendant in an effort to make sure the customer has a size or style of jean that they are happy with. The environment was so fun and light that I often looked forward to coming in to work and was willing to work late in order to help my fellow co-workers. My least favorite part of my job at American Eagle was the late closing hours in which I would leave most nights between 2 am to 5 am during the holiday season."
good,A lot of work to do on a day to day basis. Very demanding. Not enough training. My co-workers are dedicated and hard working and make the day go by quicker. They are the best part of the job. Customers are tough and expect a lot from you at every moment.
good,"I feel as if i learned all my customer service from A. E. I was working for american eagle for 2 yrs, i got the chance to work in stock, as a cashier, and towards the ending become key-holder."
good,"A typical day at American Eagle, was fun the costumers was nice as well as the co-worker's. What I learned is how to help others put thing together to fit there style. The management was nice helpful and fun to get alone with. My co-workers was fun and we all got long grate. The hardest part of the job was getting a lot of hours and the low pay. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you were helping people pick out products, that best fit them."
good,"I like working here, I enjoy the interaction with other people most. A typical day at work is fast past, and busy. You have to be a peoples person to be sucessful in this job.My co-workers are professional, and likeable. The hardest part of this job is probably dealing with an irate customer, which I haven't had to deal with just yet. The only things that I have a problem with is the hourly pay amount, and benifits."
good,"My experience was good, my last year working there was the most progressive and best experience and provided a good work environment."
good,"Each day I would go into work failry early to clean up the stockroom and prepare for the days shipment load. Once the shipment arrivied I would check it all in and begin unloading and organizing each box. I learned leadership and teamwork skills as well as the ability to work off of a sense of urgency. My co-workers were great and worked well with me and for me to help get the job done. The hardest part of the job was the holidays, although I loved the busy atmosphere, the overload of shipment or the lack of was a challenge. Management was great about communicating with me and giving me the opportunity to do things my way and trust that it would be done properly and efficiently. My favorite part of the job was being able to have my own designated work zone and having people to rely on me to do what I came in to do each day."
good,"My work experience here taught me many new things such as patience, attention to detail, customer service, organization, and other skills with selling and other tasks involving the retail business. Enjoying the job was mostly easy as you work with a variety of people with managers that are easy to communicate and task with. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the new standards of every new arriving manager, but it was attainable. "
good,some off the best people i have every work for. pack pack break pack lunch pack break pack go home.
good,"Each day varied, sometimes super busy and others slow. I learned more social skills, persuading costomers but not presuring them. I had fun working there because of my co-workers and the atmosphere. Hardest part for me was being thrown into a new working environment but I caught on quick."
good,Sales associate and cashier. Did all jobs required by management
good,"Early job part time, not really hard just active. helping customers and meeting new people"
good,"Compensation can be subjective, if you are ok working a graveyard shift with intense manual labor while making the same amount as another associate who only works daytime hours as a cashier then you'll do fine."
good,Learned About the different types of demin
good,The staff environment feels like a family. Management is very lenient with scheduling and understanding of various circumstances that may arise and help to cater to your needs.
good,"American Eagle isn't just a clothing store, it's a family. My co-workers and I have created a strong bond that will last a life time. This translates to how we work in the store. We do not make commission, but they do track how much profit we pull in for the company. Everyone has their own goals, but at the end of the day that goal would be successful because even if your personal goal wasn't achieved as a team it was. Team work is important to my company and important to me. Team work is the core of motivation and confidence building, and that is exactly what i've learned at American Eagle. My leadership skills have escalated, and because that I have become a mentor for any new employees. To me, money is important but not as important as seeing a customer happy. Nothing makes me more happier than to know I helped someone. I had many different customers over the years but their was one in particular that stood out. There was a Rabi that came into the store and asked me about a belt in the window. He said he has never been in this store before but was intrigued when he saw so many smiles on the workers faces'. I soon realized that he did not just come into the store to buy a belt, but to talk to someone. Usually in a sales associate job, the descriptions entails one to sell in order to make quota but that wasn't on my mind. We talked about him being a Rabi, how his beloved wife was very ill at home with a neck sprain, and his experiences in other stores. He made me walk him through the entire store and show him what we had to offer. We came back to the box of belts and he taught"
good,American Eagle got me experience with retail and how fun it is to work on the sales floor.
good,I got to learn a variety of different jobs and i loved that. It was usually busy so I never got bored which I liked.
good,"Typical day at AE is pretty easy going except for the store policy about getting work schedule requiring that the employee come in every friday to pick up even if out of town which is highly unreasonable esp if on vacation. also very unreasonable that one cant even call to check to see if a schedule is available... co workers are pretty amazing, the management at local store is a little off in the clouds with one of the managers... hardest part of job is taking un neccessary rudeness from customer, but makes one learn to just grow tough skin and get over... most enjoyable part is making cutsomers feel and look good in outfitting them and the wonderful discounts one recieves..."
good,"fast paced, enjoyable atmosphere. The quality and safety awareness is definitely at the top of the scale."
good,"I had a great manager, great discount and there is always something to do. You have daily goals to meet. You get to see a lot of familiar faces. the store was clean and organized. All the management got along well and worked together."
good,"The job was very fast-paced & interactive. I would spend the majority of my time on the sales floor, folding & folding denim jeans throughout most of the day. Helping customers find exactly what they were looking for, as far as style, sizing & design."
good,Seasonal gets 40 percent off and 60% percent only 10 use. Part time gets sick days and the same discount. The annoying thing was credit card n loyalty was heavily pressure on workers.
good,"This place restored my faith in companies that care about the people under their employment. Management was so friendly and understanding, while also being able to get the job done and keep the store running seamlessly. I learned a lot about working together with a team and being able to enjoy it in the process. The team worked together like a well oiled machine and we were able to accomplish a lot together- it was a positive and uplifting environment and I could look forward to the days I had to work."
good,The floor set up was always kept spacious and the music really set the vibe. The hardest part of the job was having a manager who was 17. The most enjoyable part to me was working the fitting rooms. It was a easy way to greet people and introduce sales.
good,If I had more experience at this job I would give more stars. Managers help provide a positive work environment to keep employees happy while also focusing on customer happiness. Breaks are perfect for the amount of time working and managers are happy to see you succeed and work.
good,"•	Negotiated conflicts with unhappy customers by providing additional ways for the customer to retrieve the item that they are searching for"
good,This is a great job for those looking to work in retail. It really helped me with my communication skills and the staff was a fun group of people. You do receive a pretty good employee discount as well.
good,"American eagle is a very good place to work when you need a good part time job with lots of hours. I personally didn't need a lot of hours because I'm a student first. but the management was friendly and associates too. the attendance policy was awful though. they don't give any leeway at all. especially for someone who as other responsibilities. but the store discounts were amazing. 40% off of regular priced items, 25% off clearance, and with every new floor set the associates get 60% off of 10 items of their choice."
good,Overall its a good place to work. I have a love and hate relationship with the store that I work for mostly for bad organization and lack of communication of management. Very grateful for the company’s policie for paying emergency hours after huracaine Maria. Its a very stressful place sometimes but it depends on the Leader On Duty.
good,I enjoyed the atmosphere and team I worked for at AE.  I was a bit surprised when they let a group of 100+ associates go.  I was taken off guard and disappointed my career at AE was over.
good,"American Eagle was most definitely one of my favorite jobs i’ve worked so far. It was such a fun environment and could be very laid back. I loved my co-workers & managers. The only thing that really sucked was the hours. I was a part-time sales associate and my shifts were 4 hours long and I was lucky if I got 2 days a week. They base your hours off of how many credit cards to get which isn’t easy to do since not alot of people want to sign up for credit cards. I recommend this job to anyone but mainly if you have another job and just need some extra hours on the side. They do have amazing discounts though!!! I got 10 60% off a month, and after those ran out I got everything 40% plus an extra 25% off clearance & tailgate items!!!"
good,Really liked this job I felt like I was getting underpaid slightly for the amount of work I was doing. And towards the end of my career there the head managers got changed and it became very confusing/ chaotic.
good,"Everyday is different. Every store is different, love my job and what I do, just never enough time to get anything done! work life balance is getting better"
good,can advance to higher position. there is definitely work and life balance. work load isnt too hard. the money is okay for a part time job. the management is fair with job duties and attendance.
good,"I’ve worked here for about 3 years, and I personally love it, but I have seen many co-workers come and go who might not say the same. The visual/merchandising aspect is very strict, with not much room for creativity. So if you are a task oriented individual who also has a close eye for detail than AE might be right for you. The company does offer upward movement, but you must have the availability and willingness to accept criticism and work hard for it."
good,this job is fun but with the new store director it makes it hard to make progress. eventually a sales associate that is valued has to work extra hard compared to the ones that get noticed one time then get promoted.
good,"AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING , the managers were great , hours were decent and my colleges were young and cool. I loved working there and it has made me some life long friends , to this very day . Just a shame they're no longer in the UK anymore."
good,Job wasn't hard and requires good people skills and customer service. If you complete your tasks and get along with everyone the job is enjoyable. Sometimes management wasn't too friendly but the workplace can be stressful especially during holidays.
good,"great floor management ideas, the coaching from this location was also great. they taught me alot of retail knowledge. especially with how many different fits of clothing their are."
good,"I worked for AE in Utah and Arizona and overall loved the feeling. The group mentality was very inclusive and we liked each other as a whole for the most part. It really does matter who you work with to make your days their easier. The employee discount was the best I have seen in retail. 60% for all employees and 80% for leads and above. The growth opportunities were plentiful if you were willing to put in the hours, and it was easy from basic sales associate to assistant manager - but good luck after that. DM manager is not possible without selling your soul to some deity."
good,"Good company, you lean a lot on the products and customer service. Organize and structure place to work. Big management team that you can count on. Employes development is really important."
good,"You will never fold so many jeans in your life! Even with the mountains of jeans, American Eagle has such a fun environment that is extremely welcoming and encouraging."
good,Cleaning and organizing the products and the store as well and helping customers look for their wants and needs. Networking with people that walk through the door as ell as co-workers.
good,Great place to work if you enjoy being social and competitive hours. Takes a long time to be promoted if you wish to further your career. Sometimes very clicky
good,Not too tough. Most days were just fixing up clothes on display that got ruined by customers. Had many questions that were hard to get answers for like how to operate the register.
good,Everyone is very friendly and customer-oriented. Meeting the customer's demands is of the utmost importance. Flexible scheduling hours and compensation for one's hard work.
good,"AE was a an okay job. The job was face paced and something was always changing, which I liked. I think, overall, this would be a good job for anyone who is starting out."
good,"i had a nice time while i worked there, i didnt do that great but i got better as i worked. I recommend working there you will gain a lot of experience."
good,"We all grew close, it was a good environment. I felt like I really became friends with my co-workers which made slow days go by fast. However, it was also easy to get to know them and that they cared about my well being."
good,When I first started I loved it until I bumped heads with a former manager and ran into some favoritism and other issues as time went on.. the pay is typical minimum wage you'll make more as a sales person on your check every two weeks but be prepared to be micro managed to sell and talk to customers.
good,"At this job I learned how to board fold, I greeted customers in a timely and respectful manner. I learned how to stock clothing items, and maintained a clean and clear work space."
good,"Easy, fun job to have while in high school, college or during the holidays. A typical day at work is ringing people up, letting them in fitting rooms, building outfits for people, getting sign ups for the ae credit card and rewards cards are pushed hard."
good,"It is an okay job to have as a student, discounts are awesome, hours are flexible. It's hard to get time off when needed and there's a lot of manager turnover."
good,"Beginning wih start up where i attended daily meeting before beginning work. Packing items per order into box, labeling orders with the correct barcode to send to shipping, scanning orders to be sent in shipping,  I feel that at this job i was very efficient and successful with every task except when their were jams in the conveyor belt.  Working with others was very pleasant because of the team work we all put in to achieve the days goals."
good,Fast paced work environment.An amazing team that works hard to accomplish goals and work together while multitasking several tasks at hand. Hardest part of the job is the work/life balance
good,you'll be walking up and down the stairs picking merchandise. Its very quiet and relaxing but boring at the same time (I highly advise you to get apple air pods your going to need music to get through the day lol). The people were really nice and cordial. I recommend a sweater to wear it does get a bit cold in the warehouse and good shoes because you'll be on your feet for 12 hours. Other than that the job is pretty cool and stress free.
good,"Working there was fun, the other staff were fun people and enjoyed being there. It's repetitive tasks set to the sound of pop music but assisting customers was easy and knowing the job was not a huge struggle."
good,"Its was fun working there but I ended up leaving for a better opportunities. Was not a fan of the "" call in"" schedule. I did love the prizes for who ever sold the most jeans or whatever the sale item was that month. It was a good source of motivation."
good,Good to work for if you're still in school full time. Managers understand; flexible hours. The hardest part is when it got very crowded and messy but everyone would usually work together to keep it organized/under control.
good,"American Eagle was at a time in my life where i was coming out of highschool with nothing to go off of. I was a new college student with no job and bills that needed to be paid. American Eagle gave me my first shot but i would not go back there. The pay was good enough at the time for me, but now almost 4 years later it is not enough."
good,"American Eagle Outfitters is a wonderful company to work for. Every day is different and the employees are great. The hardest part of the job is that there is not much room for advancement. The store only has so many higher-up positions and you have to start from the bottom, so most managers are hired externally. The pay also does not change unless you are promoted or receive the annual living and working raise, which is not very likely for all associates."
good,"Good company, great clothes, awesome discounts on clothes is probably what I miss the most. Can be a lot of work and running around the store one day I walked 10 miles in our small store. The management when I was there was amazing"
good,I was never told when I was hired that I would only be a seasonal sales associate so when I went on for my schedule and was told I wasn’t on it I was shocked and quite disappointed.
good,"I would have kept working there had the commute not been as impossible. I loved the staff and the managers, and the hours were generally good. I very much enjoyed my time with the company."
good,"Worked at AE for 4 years, great first job, but not a lot of hours unless you have a management position."
good,"This was definitely a good first job to have. It taught me what to look for in a job and what to avoid. Overall, wouldn't trade this experience for the world"
good,"American Eagle is a great place for a part-time job. The employee discounts are amazing! Overall, the people are good to work with as well as management."
good,"It was a fast pace job when the mall was busy and it was never really slow unless it was closer to opening/closing times which is expected. There was always something to do and customers to interact with. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my friends and being able to connect with customers personally. The hardest part of the job was the managerial organization, I found it to always be very disorganized and there was a lack of communication at times we needed it the most. Other wise working there was great, the job was great and the friends I made I love!"
good,"Most of the employees were teenagers/in their 20's and didn't care much about the job, but the managers were always pushing us to sell more and more which is why I say they took themselves too seriously for what they were, which is a high school job. But over, not a horrible place to work. Good discount, cute clothes, I enjoy the customers, and if I'm having a bad day, it's usually not caused by the job but caused by my own problems and only inflamed by the job."
good,"Nice job overall. Good discount, but not room for salary increases. For someone who wants a lot of hours, this is not the place for you. I received very few hours during the year."
good,"This was my first real job and I appreciated the opportunities it offered for me. Within 4 years, I had developed a lot of knowledge and was just starting to find my place in promotion opportunities. Eventually I decided to step outside of the retail industry for better paying jobs. But after getting my degree, it's possible I will return to retail and apply for the higher paying management jobs. I would absolutely consider American Eagle as one of my leading choices if I ever wanted to return to retail."
good,"AEO para mi hasta el dia de hoy es la mejor empresa en la que he laborado, te capacita, te enseña a querer saber siempre mas, te da las herramientas necesarias para efectuar tu trabajo super bien."
good,I enjoyed working for this company and I would love to return. The company made me feel welcome and the discount was a major plus. Helping chose outfits/garments for guests was my favorite part of my job.
good,"Great company to work for. I was there for about six years and I’ve learned so much about myself as a manager. I learned that I’m able to work with many different types of people, just because I worked for many different stores."
good,"Does not pay enough to live off of, but a fun place tonwork. Great part time or very first job I would say. Very little hours though, only gives 4 hour shifts."
good,I will want benefits introduced and a better management especially in the choosing of their site supervisors. Some Supervisors are there to exploit and take advantage of their position to the detriment of the team work.
good,"The most desirable aspect about working at AE are the discounts. If you are looking for a job that is flexible, AE is the place to look. Hours are given according to your availbility."
good,Nothing special about American Eagle. It's your typical retail clothing store. Management does their job well and the discounts are nice to have when you're a high school student.
good,"I had alot of different experiences at aeo. While I love the company and enjoy working there, management could be better. I think the managers as well as myself should've been trained more in being a manager."
good,A lot of people come and go. Those who stick around have options to be promoted but there is a lot of responsibility. Training for the positions could be improved.
good,"I worked at AE for a year and a half, there were times when I loved my job, and also hated it. Time went by decently fast, but on the slow days which were often it was very boring. I would find myself folding and then refolding the same piece of clothing because you have to stay busy at all times. It was hard to get full time and when you did you would get cut. During the sumer months its hard to make plans around work because AE uses ""call in hours"" which is such a pain. Totally worth the discount though I must say!"
good,"Day depended on schedule, especially as a part-timer. I learn some customer skills, how to ask open-ended questions. This job was a pretty easy job to perform nothing difficult about it. And most enjoyable part was the crew I worked with especially as a teenager."
good,"Loved my managers here, the ONLY problem I ever really had was consistently getting scheduled when I stated I was unable to work at those particular times."
good,"I loved working for American Eagle Outfitters. I loved what they stood for. Their values meant a lot to me. I was also blessed with an awesome team which may not be the case for every location, but it was for me. I had to quit last minute because of personal reasons but I would love to go back. I miss working with AEO!"
good,"Great job experience, well the experience is going to change depending on you managers, co-workers and store, I can only speak for my own experience which it wasn't bad."
good,"Enjoyable place to work. Not enough hours available for employees. Not many opportunities for advancement. Discount was really nice, If you worked overnight shifts, you got more hours but the work was not easy."
good,a typical day at work here is recovery of the sales floor and attending to customer needs.  It is asked of employees to size and complete detailed recovery of clothes which is what I learned and have applied to other retail workplaces.  Everyone I worked with was friendly and had great attitudes which made going to work enjoyable.
good,"This is a great place to work. It is a face pace environment with great training for management. "
good,"As a sales associate at American Eagle, my typical day at work would consist of speaking to customers about products and diligently working on my sales goal for the day. This improved my communication skills and the desire to reach my goals immensely. The environment was friendly and definitely made me feel like each and every co-worker can depend on each other. It has been difficult to try and reach out to customers, as many wished to simply be left alone. However, the high-spirited environment and the managers' encouragement made everyday feel like it was going to be a good one."
good,High Turn over of teenage  associates
good,wonderful work environment for a starting job for someone in school still. days seemed longer during the holiday season.  i had fun working here because the meetings were upbeat and fun.
good,You get a lot of hours in around the holidays and they train you for every position in the store. There is always work except of they days the mall isnt packed so you might have to find another part time
good,"American Eagle invests a ton of time and energy into training managers and sales associates. They truly care about their store employees. You will be set up for success for any retail, customer service or sales career after working here. You learn skills that can be easily translated into any endeavor you wish to pursue. You also learn business acumen and learn how to be strategic in running a business, which most retail stores do not put a huge emphasis on. "
good,This is a clothing store and involves helping customers and constantly folding and putting away clothes. Great for a high school or college student but not for a career.
good,American Eagle is a great place to work.  They have a fast paced family oriented environment. The supervisors are friendly and very helpful very open door company.
good,American Eagle is a very fast pace work environment. The staff also works as a team to reach company goals. My store manager was reasonable and understanding.
good,a great place to work for students as a part time associate. very flexible with hours and very good people to work around. overall a happy environment
good,What I mostly did was creating people telling them what the sails. Helping the customer where are the items located. Also organizing the clothes and restocking the clothes when there's no more of a sertin size.
good,"it was a good place to work at, especially if you like the clothes in the store. Everyone was nice as if we were all friends, no one was really rude or bossy towards you."
good,Great people and work. Was a great job to have when still in High School if you're at least just wanting a job to earn some extra money. Does pay minimum wage.
good,"Aumentar las ventas de la tienda, siempre dar buena imagen de la empresa."
good,"As a stock manager, you're constantly working and always helping with sales. It's a fun place to work at once you get used to it. Hours are giving to you and have the option to stay longer if you need to."
good,Fun job you have a lot of fun especially when it comes to contest season you can win some of the products from the store and have 60% discount in the products you buy.
good,"Hours suck, they hire on a lot of people at once and don't even give them enough time to train before they start cutting you from the schedule because they're over on payroll"
good,"I had GREAT managers but since I was a minor, it was hard getting the hours I wanted. I always had a great time at work, never any problems with changes or management. Great for a first job!!!!"
good,"good place to work, pay is not that great and you must compete with employees to get hours your shifts vary in length depending on how many sales the store makes if not enough sales you will be sent home"
good,"A great job if you do not work for money. My role as a sales associate is better suited for young adults. I did not work there long enough to determine if this could be a possible career. In short it was a ""mall job""."
good,AE was fun at times. Just like any job it comes with it's own stresses but the nice part was that I didn't have to take that stress home with me each day.
good,The store I worked in had great management. It was a safe and friendly work environment. The pay isn't great but it is made up for in the discounts on clothes you get.
good,"Corporate has different programs to keep the workers involved, unlike most retailers, but it can be stressful due to their credit cards, and floor sets."
good,"Career advancement opportunities here were terrible - which contributed to a high turnover rate with managers and other employees. However, the environment (as far as rewards for good work and communication) were wonderful"
good,"It was a great environment, I loved the people. Even when we had rude customers we still managed to be patient and poliet because our customers are always right"
good,"This is a good place to work if you just need a little extra money, because the hours are not great. Although, the work environment is very fun and almost all employees get along very well. Customer service is always the main focus so the goal was to interact with everyone who walked through the door. Management was always very flexible with schedules, so it's great for students."
good,"It was a good work environment with many other young workers, but I do not believe the work equaled what we were being paid. Despite that it is a good work experience."
good,"Busy, fast-paced, and customer service based team environment. "
good,Working at Aerie was a great experience in retail. The company promotes a great message to women about their bodies. Employees there are given great benefits with discounts for sales. A few drawbacks would be that they do not compensate their employees adequately for how much they do and how much experience they've had. Another drawback is that the management was slightly poor when it came to properly scheduling all employees.
good,Working there is good but since its retail you dont get enough hours as usual especially during the winter so dont expect to get much hours but overall it is a great place to have a learning environment
good,"Working in American Eagle Outfitters I would help any customers with whatever merchandise they wanted or they were looking for. Throughout the shift, I always had to organize the merchandise to make sure it looked presentable."
good,"good place to work while I was in school, get paid minimum wage, with no incentive to work as hard as they want you to. management is fantastic and accommodating to personal life"
good,A typical day at work can vary between busy or slow depending on the business day. I've learn to accommodate to my customer's needs as well as leading my team into driving business and sales. I'm always on my feet for the most part. I enjoy the workplace culture because the environment is very positive and upbeat. I motivate my staff and lead.
good,"Working here was always fun, The music was great and the co-workers always kept you upbeat and happy, we were always busy and being productive. It was a great experiance"
good,"fun place to work, fun people to work with and it was a great first job. It was fun being the first one to see what new clothes were coming in and getting them ready to put out on the floor."
good,"I like most of the managers. I love the discounts and getting to help customers choose outfits. It's really rewarding to see customers happy and confident with the choice of clothing that you pick for them. There's also a lot of contests for employees, so it's very motivating. Often times it is hard to find someone to cover your shift and if you are not available pretty much all the time, you don't get many hours."
good,"American Eagle is a great place to work to make a few extra bucks and to get amazing discounts as an employee, but i wouldn't recommend working here to make a living off of it. However the employees and management are amazing and i couldn't ask for a better team of people to work with. This is a very simple job, but still a very fun and enjoyable job to have."
good,"The best part of my job is helping others find the perfect outfit that they feel good in. Another great part of my job is I am always getting to teach Associates something, while I am always learning tot. I recently have been moved to A sales lead, It is a lot of fun and responsibilities. For the most part the management and other people I work with are pretty awesome. A typical day at work would be going through the management book, doing audits, doing the cash registers, and connecting with customers and other associates."
good,Holiday season is very busy so that is when you get the most hours and then you see a decrease in your hours during nonpeak season. A lot of associates have another job in order to compensate for the lack of hours.
good,It's A Happy Place Many People find Great Outfits Here Due To The Help of Great Sales Associates Many People Want. different looks So With American Eagles Style You Can Find Outfits for Different Occasions And That's The Cool Part About Working There Also Plus They Have GREAT deals With BOGO Nothing Can Go Wrong
good,This is a great company to work for. There is a lot of guide lines and rules to follow but there's a lot to learn from this company. High speed work environment you will always be busy and doing something. The most enjoyable part of working here is how detailed the floor sets are.
good,I really liked working at american eagle. it's a very nice environment and friendly people. you get rewarded for signing people up for credit cards and selling a lot of items such as free clothes if you win a game. they cater on holidays. you are recognized for your work and are appreciated. you get a great discount. you become friends with customers.
good,"Its a great job honestly. The few months that I've worked there were pretty chill. The coworkers were great the work culture is awesome. The pay in the other hand was a little low. But overall the discount is  amazing."
good,coworkers and management are very friendly and helpful. a very repetitive job that requires lots of customer satisfaction and high attention to detail
good,Long hours with a usual chance for overtime.  The benefits are amazing.  When I worked there you only had to pay the taxes for any flight that you took. You could also add a companion and your parents. I flew internationally and all over the United States with this great benefit.
good,I enjoyed working for the company. Best part of it was when at the time the whole AE team had to set up the whole store for grand opening . The environment was great I got along with everyone. I learned a lot of the AE Jean what make the them different also with Aerie how so lady's prefer Aerie then Victoria secret. The worst of the job was the poor hour and also when it came to closing.
good,"If you want to work for a lax company, this is the place for you. If you are in desperate need of cash, however, this is not the ideal job. Hours are not guaranteed."
good,"the place is always busy, and the company makes a good effort in keeping their employees up beat and always smiling. while working on the floor or in the stock room, there is no time to slack. people is very nice with each other, and friendly."
good,"Loved working at AE, being able to help customers and save them money while shopping. The team I had was great at what they did, always hard working. I would have loved to stay, if the schedule was more consistent."
good,"I excelled in their little competitions that they had for us, like getting the most sales and winning a gift card for that. I did a great job on being consistent with my sales. I loved to interact with customers and being able to relate to them every time I spoke with them and helped them."
good,"	Assisted customers fulfill their shopping needs"
good,I enjoyed the management and co-workers at both stores I worked at. I liked helping personalize outfits for many people and it made the job easy for me. I learned a lot about retail at this job and the main in and outs of it all.
good,Best part from working at American Eagle Outfitters was changing positions to merchandise management from sales. Organization skills and multitasking  skills excelled in my new environment.
good,"A typical day at American Eagle, I would come in and work as a cashier. Our goal is to give all of our customers a good experience while shopping, becoming ""friends first""."
good,Work was easy with friendly management and employees. The only issue is that they were not willing to give a lot of hours to new recruits.
good,A typical work day can be slow or too much work depending on the season. The holidays it can get very hectic but when the season is slow it is really slow.
good,"I really loved the management at my store, but the pay was not great. I think they should consider paying employees more."
good,"I tend to always stay behind the register and check-out people and assist any other employees that may be having difficulty during a transaction. I've learned that I don't know everything and that it is okay to ask someone in a higher position for help, but I've also learned that sometimes that person higher up can learn something from me too. I have great managers who love to keep us upbeat and enjoying our jobs, but they also know how to set us straight and keep us doing what we are supposed to. My co-workers are great. We all get along well and encourage each other to do better everyday. The hardest part of my job is definitely getting people to sign up for credit cards. It is very frustrating because one day I will get 7 people to sign up for a CC in 4 hours, but the next day I won't get a single CC in an 8 hour shift. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to interact with people. It's awesome to go the extra mile in everything that I do and see how much easier and better I can make a customer's day."
good,It was a great place to work at learned a lot and the boss was very laid back. Was trained well and the best part at the end of the year got to watch the Black hawks play. Aside from a few bad characters giving hard times and make it long days all in all a nice place to work.
good,"Great discounts, mostly good people, and always something to do. You probably won't be bored there. I enjoyed being on registers---made shifts go quickly and I enjoyed competitions for signing up people for rewards cards and credit cards."
good,"Typical day was 12 hours. Lesson learned its NOT always good to be fast if the job is not done with good quality. Slow down Pay attention and make sure every customer gets what they want or exactly what they ordered. Fast paced work with a lot of walking, bending, climbing stairs and standing. Hardest part was not having enough orders to pull which made for a long shift with plenty of cleaning details. Most enjoyable was having every weekend off only working M-F"
good,"This is the company in which managers trust you. "
good,I only worked here as a seasonal associate. They train you properly. Good management. Everyone was pretty much team-orientated .
good,The job is fun. You have to be very consistent with selling merchandise and giving great customer service! Management is very organized and everyone has a great attitude.
good,"Worked in the back, organized floorset. Respected by managers and helped whenever needed instructions."
good,"Daily work there was pretty much easy the atmosphere is always positive. I learned there were different pants style from slim fit to boot cut which ranges from different waist size depending on the style of pants itself. The management was great and helpful when it comes to asking questions regarding daily sales and teaching about how to suggest sales. The co-workers were awesome,funny and teaching you the ropes around the store and what to watch out for such as theft. The hardest part would be trying to stay busy while the store was slow. Overall the most enjoyable part of the job was you get to meet different types of customers who all have similar clothing styles."
good,"Good company."
good,"If I opened the store, I came in and cleaned the store top to bottom before opening time. During store hours, I was required to sale to people who walked into the store. Customer service was a main part of the job and no matter who it was, I was required to help them style an outfit and help them in the dressing rooms. I worked as a cashier as well, in which we were required to sale rewards and credit cards. If I closed the store, I was required to manage the dressing rooms and cashier table. Floorset happened every couple months where we set up a new seasonal look on the store and that was all night long. Overall I loved the people I worked with and that made the job all the more enjoyable. The hardest part was constantly being on your feet and having to deal with customers who weren't so polite. I love the atmosphere and the good vibes that the company brings. Every now and then we had competitions in sales and were rewarded with free stuff. Great place to work."
good,"Great company, hard work. Not what you think of when you hear retail. The great pay is earned! Plenty of time spent there,  but that is expected anywhere in retail. They have it together and are very organized with new procedures."
good,Working For AE was the best. Before i left i was thee oldest employee at that store. I left because there was no going up in the buisness. But the employees were great and so was the company itself. There i was a Sales Asscociate and Cash Lead. I trained new employees on the register and other tasks. I was also Credit King for always getting the most customers to apply for credit cards. Top seller at my store too.
good,"A typical day starts with me clocking in and asking my manager about bogo(our promotion). They tell me what the special is and where I'm going to be stationed for the day. I learned on being a more engaged people's person. For example, I greet them and ask them how their day has been (if its something that I can relate to then I expand the conversation). Management is great for the most part. They stay on top of me and my co-workers. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the hours get a little tricky. One week you can have 20 hours, and then the next week you can have 8 hours. The hardest part of the job is understanding people from different ethnicities. They might not be fluent in the English language or they might not know it at all. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fun atmosphere. I'm a big people's person.I love my co-workers and customers."
good,Working here was a fun and learning experience. There was always something that needed to be done. Customers were joyful about their experience which made it a more productive and pleasurable environment to work in.
good,"Our main focus is always the customer service. I can be anywhere when I go to work for example; the sales floor, the fitting room, or the stock room. The energy always remains the same wherever I am, my coworkers and managers are friendly and we tend to help each other out. We goof around as well its not always a strict area and that's why I enjoy going to work. The LOD's are calm and supportive they acknowledge that everyone plays a big role to the team in order to reach our goal in the end."
good,"I had to greet customers as they walked in and out of the store, tag, sensor and fold clothes as well as put them in the warehouse in the back of the store. Not much to tell about the store since they did not give me much of an option to work, but it is an overall great work environment."
good,I loved working in such a fashion forward store. The product was great quality as well
good,"folded and put away clothes"
good,Easygoing workplace as long as you work hard and meet your deadlines
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,Fun job if you like working in a high paced atmosphere. Always something to do
good,"Customer Service"
good,great company but the times square location is extremely time consuming
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting, assisting, and outfitting customers, cash handling as customers are rung up, opening credit, and promoting company loyalty via member's cards and acquiring email addresses. Occasionally, I am asked to replenish the product on the floor, re-merchandise products, and dress bust forms. "
good,"Will I worked for them a long time"
good,"I deal with customers on a daily basis. I am always a main ringer so i am always on register. If I close, I clean the store & double count the deposite for mistakes from the managers. All of my co-workers are hard workers but we have fun at the same time. the hardest part of the job would have to be having to deal with the customers everyday, a lot of times they expect a lot from us & ""customer is always right"" get to their head so they feel as though they can tell us anything for a lower price on a product. The most enjoyable part is seeing the trends, helping dress people & seeing the customers leave with a smile on their face knowing that they enjoyed their service & will be returning to purchase more."
good,"Great place to work for those trying to move up to management. Fun and relaxed work environment. Training was top notch to learn sales, merchandising, and how to train others. The only downside was the schedules. You never have a set schedule and don't have the opportunity to have much of a home life."
good,Enjoyed working with my co-workers and interacting with crew members.
good,The typical day is more customer base with a small amount of breaks but if you like folding cloths the this your job. The hardest part about the job is dealing with the managers.
good,"fun and engaging work place, but for some hours will be hard to come by."
good,This was my second dose of working and going to school. It taught me a lot and I became great at time management.
good,"A typical day at AE included stocking the store and making sure the clothes were kept neat and folded. I also helped customers with any questions they had. I learned how to be on time to work and how to work in a busy setting. I learned how to help customers and keep a friendly attitude and be helpful. The hardest part of the job was making sure everybody left happy that I helped that day, but helping the customers was also the most enjoyable part as well."
good,"Folding clothes, and helping customers try on clothing in the dressing room. I learned a lot more about body types, and add ons for purchases. The management was good, was good communication. The hardest part was being left alone in dressing rooms and taking over a two person job. It was a fun job though, the customers made it worth the while."
good,American Eagle is a good place to go to work if its your entry job. The more you sell the more hours you got so it always drove you to do good.
good,"A typical day involved standard cashier services, promoting the rewards and credit card for the store, customer service, cleaning out fitting rooms, stocking items throughout the store, and finding sizes for customers."
good,"Entertain customers and accurately cashed out customers.  "
good,Great place to work with a friendly environment. Stays busy especially during school or holiday season. Easy. The hardest part of the job was calling out the clothing item on the headsets to be found by the workers in the back. Making sure the customers had the size they were looking for. 
good,"American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) is where patience came to life. While working at AEO the environment was fast and sometimes slow, but there was always something to do. The managers were down to earth and bonded well with the team. My co-workers all got along and frequently hung out after work. The hardest part about working at AEO was standing and putting a smile on when life was putting a frown on your face, but everyone pushed through. I really enjoyed bonding with the customers and outfitting them for different occasions.  "
good,I loved working here seasonally! I did it for almost two years and it helped me a lot with customer service. My manager was very concerned with how customers were treated and wanted us all to make sure their experiences were great! It also helped with sales since I was on the floor a lot!
good,"The company has started going through a cultural shift over the last five years. It shows much promise, but is very demanding on top of the every day demands of running the store. The new CEO has a great vision and is extremely intelligent and listens to associates in the company."
good,Ability to have fun and interact with customers. Teaches sales skills and enhances communication.
good,"I worked on several technology improvement projects, from upgrading wireless access points, installing DSL circuits to replace dial-up ones, installing MacMinis to provide media content in retail stores, and am now upgrading the bandwith on routers. Working with the networking group has been a great experience, making the most of my CCNA and Cisco experience."
good,Typical day at work would be folding clothes and communicating with the costumers. I gained skills in communicating with people.
good,"Typically busy and fast paced, but very fun place to work at."
good,"providing excellent customer service, with a very neat and clean environment."
good,"Overall was a good place to work. every day was presented with new challenges. My responsibilities and tasks played a crucial part in the companies productivity. I learned many things while I was employed there. Felt secure at my position during my employment there, Thought I would retire from AE but it unfortunately did not turn out that way"
good,"It depends on your location but overall this is an exciting and fun place to work. I have had some amazing District Managers and one awesome Regional Manager. The value of the clothing brings in a lot of traffic and the AE store of the mall or street is generally the store with the most people in it, so you are never bored."
good,I learned a lot working for American Eagle. It' s a place of many different types of people and all of them have a different taste in style. Helping a customer find a specific look was the best part of my day.
good,It was a fun first job and I enjoyed working with all of my coworkers and managers
good,"After looking over yesterdays numbers v.s. today's plan and LY I make the shift cuts or add shifts depending on traffic and sales trends. Manage teenagers all day while keeping then entertain with tasks to promote sales. Ive learned so much ""retail talk"" and usage me retail matrix by using KPI's. Co-workers are always there to help, motivate and learn from. the hardest part of the job is fitting so much work into 40 hrs a week with minimal coverage. As a manager your able to muti-task 5 to 7 different projects with minimal help due coming in on payroll. The enjoyable part besides compensation would be the helping customers find what their looking for. Fashion, setting new trends and watching them walk out of the store excited."
good,"A typical work day consists of recieving new merchandise, processing the merchandise and placing new product on the floor. Before each shift each associate meets with management to go over the stores sales goal and what is expected of us for that day."
good,Weekends are always busy since it is a retail store in a popular shopping mall.
good,"In a typical day, individual goals are set at the beginning of each shift as well as a viewing of a short training video and ""pre-party"" with the manager and an ""after party"" at the end to go over the day. The training video's are updated each week and focus on topics such as how the number of units per transaction may seem insignificant, but make a substantial to the annual report and how to outfit a new style of shorts."
good,The hardest part of the job is keeping your cool when customers make a mess of the clothing. Keep your smile and make it easy for the customer to spend money and things will be easier on you.
good,American Eagle is a fairly excited store. Exponentially garments of a myriad of motifs are becoming crucial to the everyday lives of the American teen.
good,"I love working here I just don’t get scheduled enough. Every time I go into work I have a good time though, managers are nice and co-workers are nice too."
good,Definitely enjoy working at my store. The store is very diverse and I feel welcomed and that I have a purpose in helping customers and other Sales Associates!
good,They care about their employees are willing to work around your schedule. There is room for growth within the company if you wish. Great atmosphere and you can wear clothing you like
good,"The interview was a breeze. Continuously smiling and being yourself is the key. I was able to meet so many people and give out opinions, when asked, on customers that could not decide on certain outfits. It was a great first job!"
good,Working at American was a fun experience since it was my first time working as a Sales Associate. Everyone was friendly and helpful if I had a question or any doubt.
good,"Throughout my time at AE the company culture was great. Never was there a day that I went into work thinking it was going to be a bad day. However that would change very quickly due to my upper management and how they were acting on that specific day. Some days they had great moods and some days they were in terrible moods. This would impact the atmosphere quite heavily and would dampen the culture. Most of the time I did not speak with upper management because they had no interest in speaking with me. It is a confusing atmosphere, but overall a presently decent experience."
good,The workplace was very friendly and inviting which is the goal of American Eagle to get customers in. The goal of the day was usually met whenever I worked and some other too.
good,"Fun place to work with great people, often over staffed and was not able to get desired amount of hours per week, unless it was during holiday season."
good,At the start of every shift the associate is given its goals for the day and for the week so they know how much work needs to be done. Managers have there weekly meeting and discuss strategies to further their sales and decrease shrinkage. American Eagle strives to have excellent customer service and help every customer feel like home.
good,"Good but hours were inconsistent, and the schedule comes out rather late, on Thursday. Sundays were busy, but everyones nice there and pay is good. starting pt was 12 and hour with minimal experience needed. Overall if you need a easy job this’ll work, obviously a lot of time on your feet, and the break rooms not the coziest. Best part was the discounts and the other workers are all very cool."
good,"This was a brand new store that opened and since the beginning the instilled how the visual standards would impact the message we would send to customers and earn that sale. As a company, it is very progressive, hip and trendy and made sure associates were not only brand ambassadors but an important part of the team and the culture."
good,Excelentes utilidades y sueldo promedio si eres estudiante o tienes otro empleo o eres un nini sera una gran experiencia.
good,My experience with the company has been good. It’s a great job for someone in high school or someone just wanting something part time. There is not a lot of room for advancement in most stores though. They do have a great employee discount to make up for the low wages.
good,Great company. Especially for those new to retail. I would absolutely recommend someone transitioning into the work force from high school try AOE as I found it to be a most pleasant place
good,"First got this job when I was a junior in high school. The job offered me minimum wage. They only give minors 4-hour shifts for a couple of days out the week. Even though the pay was minimum wage, the job has an amazing discount and hosts contests frequently where you can win free merchandise. Once I turned 18, I finally got to work longer shifts. Unfortunately, the pay increased by pennies and the shifts were still far and in between if it was not a holiday season. Credit card sales goals can be unrealistic, yet the contests drove associates to try to reach them. The job was awesome for a high schooler looking for a new wardrobe and a fun work environment. As far as being an adult with responsibilities and bills, this job makes a decent secondary job."
good,This was a nice part-time job; however the hours were not great. It felt as though I rarely worked with the same people twice beside management. Most of the employees were very fun to work with.
good,If you’re about to graduate high school or just graduated this is a great job! Makes buying clothes super affordable. The people at this places usually radiate a positive energy easy to work with the people! Very chill job over all. Busy seasons can be a little stressful
good,"Es una buena oportunidad para comenzar, aunque no tiene un sueldo tan competitivo como otras tiendas"
good,"I do like working at American Eagle, but I do think the pay could be better. The day to day is not terrible and I do enjoy the management and the other employees that work there."
good,great place to work and fast pace environment competitive sales. if hard working opportunity to advance positions. American Eagle has flexible hours good for college and high school students.
good,Depending on your managers (this should be common sense for any employment) working here will either be good or bad. Being able to sell is a must and you won't really get shifts if you're not the best. But the job itself is relatively easy and the company itself has a good family culture. Shifts are short and not that often so be prepared to pick up another part time job.
good,All well paced and positive vibes only while putting in hours of hard work. Managers are very well trained and know how to handlr certain aspects and situations.
good,"When I look back on the time I worked at American eagle as a sales associate, I feel nostalgia. The managers were kind, my coworkers were friendly, and the employee discount saved me a lot on some great clothes. The only problem I could see is that I’d sometimes get off work at 12:30am on a school night during holiday hours, they put me on those shifts because I was 18. Also they said they’d keep me on after the season but barely ever gave me shifts afterwards until they just stopped."
good,I think American Eagle was an exciting retail job. There are opportunities to interact with so many different people. I was very happy to learn more about different types of jeans and styles of clothes.
good,Good place to work if you are willing to work hard. Some overnights are required here but the overall culture is good. Compensation is good and there is a lot of money to be made here.
good,"I worked at American Eagle during the holiday season, and on Black Friday. I liked it, I liked the friends I made there, and I looked forward to work. However, I had to drive 45 minutes to get there, and making $9.65 an hour didn’t seem worth it to me when I was driving 45 minutes both ways."
good,"It's retail so the amount of weekends spent here is not optimal, even once reaching a management level. Lots of managers in the region were understanding of needing time off to relax and refuel though. Compensation is good if you have the initiative to ask for it. Benefits for part time associates not that great but nice for full time associates. Managers used to go through a 1.5 year training ""program"" so a lot of the old ones know what they are doing and are good at it. There's always some questionable managers, but overall a great work environment."
good,"This company rewards quickness, and friendly efficiency. I liked being in the stockroom because I could get in a groove and really get through shipment in great time because the management have me enough freedom to be productive in ways that were slightly altered to better improve my times of processing the shipments. Getting the stock to fit into the rolling racks was challenging and I used ladders to access higher hanging bars for more storage. It was challenging and exciting to see how fast I could get my tasks completed."
good,Trabajo divertido en el que puedes platicar con cualquier persona y los jefes no te regañan mientras cumplas con el trabajo.
good,"I've only worked here for a short period of time, but everyone seems nice and happy to be working there. The managers are productive, but the training process is short and sweet..."
good,I worked in a store at the mall over the holiday season. The store was very busy during this time. The hours were long so that we could keep the store organized and clean. I loved working with my coworkers those who held management positions were great and helpful.
good,"Working there overall was a great experience, got a taste of different cultures from different customers. The management had a little trouble with keeping everything organized and communication, if need be you can personally speak to the manager on hand and your situation will be handled accordingly."
good,"The worst part is not having a CEO who is actually present. He lives in Columbus, Ohio and owns multiple billion-dollar industries. Has only been to our corporate HQ once or twice ever!!"
good,it’s overall very good and they are all very friendless and they teach you and help you but it’s like “luck of the draw” for hours some people get them and some don’t. nothing personal sometimes you just don’t get scheduled.
good,"I love this job the managers are Caring, they have been very persistent throughout my time here, I do  still plan on staying part time but I absolutely cannot get anywhere working 2-3 days a week. I’m in need of a full time job"
good,"I love woking at places where you can not only connect with the people around you but also the employees as well. This makes coming into work more interesting. I love the environment and we also get work done in a fun, respectable, and meaningful way."
good,"I think AE have a great mindset when it comes to it’s culture and values. It is a very good company to start when you want to learn about making sales and customer service. "
good,"Folding cloths, cleaning, fitting room, cash register, and helping customers find what their looking for. I love being able to talk and help the customer out."
good,An easy job if you enjoy fashion and interacting with people. Managers are very helpful and supportive. The work environment is super chill and relaxed.
good,"Just time to move on, was a great company, flexible, took care of employees and gave several oppourtunites to move up, just wanted to get out of the retail world"
good,"It was a great place to start considering the AE I was at was in a mall. The workers and managers were very friendly and fun along with the company offering various items as we met goals for the store. I did have a blast learning for the time I was there of how a workplace and it’s employers should be. Considering it was retail and not being the most experienced or best worker there, hours weren’t at all good though."
good,Got to mingle with a lot of out of towners.Learned to manage time appropriately and courteously while dealing with some impatient customers.Having a lot of down time.
good,"From my experience, AE would be missed solely on the culture around the office. It's very casual and an extremely welcoming environment. The work became repetitive, but that obviously doesn't pertain to the entire corporation."
good,The work itself is fairly simple as a stock associate. Keep yourself well time managed during tasks and the day will go by smoothly. Much of the reason I stayed was because I really liked the people I worked with.
good,"Good company to start retail, the discount is well worth it. Although my only complaints would be it is minimum wage. The coworkers are friendly and overall good atmosphere"
good,"I learned how to deal with online orders, sales, and packaging. How to sell American Eagle credit cards alongside with selling different articles of clothing and accessories in the American Eagle brand."
good,Love working here. Great way to build autonomous skills and work interdependently within a team. Most enjoyable part of the job is the team I worked with and that the workplace culture was very diverse and progressive. The worst part was how negatively returns can affect the momentum of day to day business performance.
good,"Even though we don’t get commission, they do make sure our hard work does not go unnoticed. We get rewarded with more hours so we can make more money."
good,"American Eagle is a good place to start off. It teaches you communication skills with selling and customer service, organization, time management, team work skills, and how to enjoy where you work. Every day is different in terms of if it is a busy day or slow day. This company welcomes all people to work in order to give them a learning experience. They can be flexible with your availability but they also do it based off the consideration of what is best for the company. The job can be stressful at times when it gets busy on the weekends or over holidays, but its enjoyable being able to work with fun people and the energy level"
good,great place if you're looking fro a part time job with friendly management and staff. They are very flexible with the hours that you can work and are overall a great company
good,I loved working here. You have to be diligent about maintaining work/life balance though because they will eat up every ounce of your free time if you let them.
good,"Gente jóven, excelenetes descuentos a empleados y aprendes mucho"
good,"AEO is a wonderful company who cares about all their employees - except for their admins. Admins are not treated as part of the team for many of the departments - we are outsiders who work for the teams & execs. "
good,"My personal store could be considered a mixed experience, as far as retail goes; it can be a bit overbearing. We are often trained to greet each costumer but depending on management that day... our kind greetings and helps can turn into a forced interaction which causes a stress and unhappy work day for most employees! The discounts were great but this job seemed more of a burden after a while then something you could enjoy doing... a real people person experience!"
good,"The entire company is very welcoming and helpful, the managers are always wanting to see you succeed and they help you get there. The company had employee competitions to motivate us, they really did work. Plus when you reached those goals you felt so empowered by the great work you put in that day."
good,"I had a positive experience working there, with people who helped and encouraged me to do my absolute best. The environment was both competitive and relaxing."
good,"I really liked working here, staff was easy to get along with as well as management. I learned organizational skills, as well as selling techniques. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping costumers with what they were looking for and giving fashion advice."
good,"Omni Channel distribution center"
good,Great company to work for. Looking for advancement and not available within my region right now. I enjoy the customer 1st policy. Makes working in clothing retail alot easier than having to say no all the time especially with returns. Matching online pricing to appease the customer. Whatever the better deal is.
good,This was a good experience for me.  It was my first job that I got hired for.  I met good people there.  It was fun working with everyone.  I got paid good for my first job.  I benefitted from the customer service experience there.  My manager was nice and caring.
good,"I started working at American Eagle Outfitters a week after May started. I told them that they can get me to work weekdays after school was out. After that, I started working the fitting rooms. I was organizing clothes, cleaning and opening fitting rooms, and I recently worked the cash register. Unfortunately, my schedule stayed the same after I told them the second time that they can change it to weekdays."
good,"There's always something new to look forward to, even seasonal promotions were fun. The environment was great, though stressful at times, but the energy was always positive. Though sales quotas for the staff became a little to competitive, it was always good to know that there are people who are willing to get the job done."
good,Extremely fast paced and fun. Close knit staff and many opportunities for advancement! Must be able to communicate with all types of customers and handle sticky situations in a proper manner.
good,"I liked working for this company. I received wonderful discounts on both american eagle and aerie. My pay was fine, you could almost choose your hours. Employees are friendly, always take shifts. You can take any shift you would like."
good,"American Eagle was my first retail job, and it introduced me to delegation of tasks, though it was much like a high school clique. The delegation of tasks was more like a list of chores, rather than a list of tasks to complete in a work place."
good,"We had multiple goals we had to meet every day, I gained experience in registers. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Management was vey organized. Hardest part was meeting my sales goal every day. Easiest part was dealing with the customers."
good,"American Eagle has a good job team, people there respect each other, respect all the diferents cultures."
good,"Typical Day includes answering customer questions and managing inventory control. Work Culture is what you make it, it can be competitive but there is also plenty of opportunities to collaborate. The hardest part of the job is the customer service while trying to mitigate shop lifting."
good,"Flexible hours, especially for students in high school and college. The work environment is good, the management team is organized and helpful for any situation."
good,I enjoyed my time there but $12 was not enough for the distance it was from my house. The job was simple and the people were great. I'd go back if I lived closer. On site gym and cafeteria were nice
good,Overall a very good organization with new ideas and initiatives. Management is very cooperative and provide various opportunities to all employees. Great team work.
good,Very flexible around your schedule if you are a college student. I have worked for this company for several years and the culture is great. The retail world is changing with the rise of online shopping.
good,I really enjoy working here but advancement is limited if you don't want to relocate. I'm currently enrolled in school and they work well with my class schedule. Anyone looking for a steady job that needs a little extra cash this would be a great opportunity.
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working for the company and what both American Eagle and Aerie stand for. But after working for them in two different states, the expectation of standards is not consistent."
good,Great job opportunity for high school students. Great opportunity to learn about retail and business management. Also very useful in learning important aspects of customer service.
good,I thought that the management at American Eagle was very good and the store was run smoothly and efficiently. The store was always really clean and organized and offered the customers a good shopping experience.
good,"American Eagle was truly a good company to work for. While the hours of the job aren't particularly enjoyable the staff made up for it. Working at AE was like working with a family. I learned different aspects of the business throughout my time and after 9 years I got to see the company change and grow, as I did with it. "
good,Productive and fun place to work . Collaborative environment . They work on new technology stack . Communication is streamlined with the corporate headquarters in Pittsburgh.
good,This is a very fun place to work. There are many great people that work for the company. The discounts are great. The hours are very flexible. The management team is very great to work with
good,"There were times where we would have to restock and its over night , and would take forever , but its a great company and loved the discounts that place can get explensive"
good,"Overall working at american eagle has been a great experience! You get great discounts, and get to interact with customers to help show off our new styles of the season. A typical day at work is usually pretty fast paced. You need to be able to multi task between talking to customers letting them know about sales, and finishing a task you are given. Management is also pretty well for the most part."
good,"If you're hard working and try your best, you shouldn't run into any problems working for this company. The warehouse is very modern and clean as well as safe."
good,everyone is kind and wants you to do well in order to thrive as a store. There was definitely a sense of family. Everyday coming into work was a fun experience I never dreaded going to work.
good,"Although the hours were very limited there (3hr/s a week sometimes), I've learned  many valuable lessons. I have built so much character from working here in a short time."
good,"Current staff and management are easy to get along with. Management are very encouraging of a personal touch when dealing with each individual customer, which leads to higher productivity and sales. The action of being ""friends first"" with the customer is carried over to how associates treat each other when both on and off the clock."
good,"Employer was extremely concerned about employee welfare. was very difficult to advance due to size of company, seemed very political at the time. training was the best."
good,I loved working for american eagle because they always had really great promotions that I could get in on as an employee and the staff was awesome to work with!
good,Great environment. Everybody works like a team. Nice incentives for employees. Good sales and customer services strategies. Really well trained for sales.
good,"A typical days at work would consist of helping customers and straightening the store, but the fun part was the floorsets. They were overnight and rewarding because you had time to be a perfectionist. The group of employees also became very close due to the extended overnight shifts."
good,"Worked as a part time employee. I made many firends as well as developed work skills that have helped me later in life. Had the opportunity to do many different jobs. There are different roles available for hourly associates, my favorite being able to work on floor sets."
good,A good place to work with opportunities for advancement. Fun work environment. Fast pace work place that is customer oriented. Sales driven. On the job training.
good,"A casual and easy environment to work in while in school. Job is very flexible and AEO is constantly upgrading in innovative ways. Room for growth includes small job increases, cash lead, jean, expert, stylist and more. Also room for higher jobs as well."
good,Great company culture that provides ample opportunities for advancements and cross functional work experience.  Benefits allow for a great work/life balance while still keeping the company the most competitive in the industry.
good,"I felt like there was a nice job culture and felt connected. They do offer nice benefits to employees like the employee discount. Overall, I liked working for this company and didn't feel like there were many issues."
good,"I worked anywhere in the store. I would work in the dressing rooms, the cash register or as a greater at the front entrance. learned at lot here because it was my first job. I learned how to interact with customers, especially frustrated ones. I enjoyed the people I worked with and they made the time go by faster."
good,"Hours vary depending on your availability, customers always suck but its fun to work there and the discount is AMAZING. .Depending on the store management is good."
good,"American Eagle was my first job that worked with an 8 hour shift, with that, I learned how long a normal work day was. I was mostly a greeter, so I welcomed customers with a smile and assisted them with any questions they may of had. I also helped clean the store and fold clothing when I closed."
good,"American Eagle outfitters takes great pride in making the store really clean and neat, as well as the stock room. A really cool thing is that the employees get ipads to use for checking availibility, sizes, and prices."
good,I enjoy working with the customers and getting to know them through fashion. The people I work with are now one of my closest groups of friends. The work environment itself is very encouraging and I have had a positive experience working at American Eagle Outfitters.
good,"Great culture and atmosphere with limited availability of advancement, however.  Work-life balance is valued but varies depending on which department you work in."
good,"Hours are not given unless requested multiple times, shifts are usually 4 hours long. Floorsets are fun to work, if you can stay up all night long. It gains good organization skills and decent work experience for a first time job."
good,The work place culture at AE is very interpersonal and relaxed. You're co-workers are family and it really shows when communication skills are need to do tasks well. A typical work day can be very easygoing and more about organization while other days its fast paced and extremely busy.
good,Learned a lot about management from my store manager.  Being an assistant manager at American Eagle prepared me with the skills to manage a store of my own.
good,"As an employee that had been there for so long, I had really flexible hours (if i needed to book time off etc.) "
good,It was a fun workplace. The people all got along very well. Everyone was friendly. The environment was great. The work was easy and everyone was productive.
good,"As a member of the store management team for American Eagle, a typical work day included opening store, scheduling/training/supervision of staff, inventory and merchandising, knowledge and leadership on visual displays, general housekeeping, and customer service. District and regional management were very supportive, present, and available when needed. Culture of the company encouraged hiring and developing young employees. Fun environment, yet professional. Consistently sales perks and promotions to motivate staff to sell particular featured items and/or open store credit cards. Each month, I earned prizes and/or benefits for sales. This compensated for the average salary and lack of any other benefits (401k offered to some positions)."
good,"AE is a great company overall. They take care of their employees from a compensation perspective, but also invest a lot of time into innovating new systems and tools to benefit the store team. There exists a solid work/ life balance and they offer plenty advancement opportunities within the store. Once you reach store manager there exists a natural pyramid effect and specializing within your own area of interest becomes more challenging. It is an excellent company that I would definitely recommend to any individual seeking a true retail career!"
good,Good store great clothes lots of fun. Good times. nice people. Good manager. Good employees. Made friends. Folding got boring. Was only a summer job for me.
good,A typical work day at American Eagle consisted of bringing that client experience first and teaching the clients what certain ideas mean when it comes to the clothing we sold. I learned a lot being here and the workplace culture and the diversity was something that I enjoyed the most.
good,Many of the management seemed immature. The part time staff was incredible and great incentives with regards to discounts and promotions. Overall not a bad employment.
good,"Great Place to work as an associate lead or manager.  AEO, Inc does its best to ensure its teams are treated with respect, and thanked for their hard work."
good,"J'ai bien aimé faire parti de cette équipe, J'aime le travail que je dois accomplir ainsi que la gestion d 'employés. Mon but actuel est de me trouver un emploi qui me fera vivre de nouveaux défis."
good,"Every shift I worked at American Eagle Outfitters was very enjoyable and fun. My coworkers were friendly and outgoing so it was easy to get along with people, but everyone seemed a bit clique-y. During every shift I always learned something new about the company and my coworkers. I had a lot of fun working at American Eagle Outfitters since it was my first time working in retail and being able to learn how everything works behind the scenes."
good,It is a great job and you'all have a lot of fun. Always doing something different everyday. Meeting a lot of new people everyday as well. This job has become like my second home.
good,"American Eagle was a fun, relaxed workplace to be in. The co- workers along with customers were fantastic. I learned new things everyday as well with more ways to go about sucessfully completing what I need to in a day. There was never a bad day."
good,a typical day at work would include helping customers find what they need and helping out at cash. i earned how to multi-task as multiple customers would ask me questions. the management was very good and helped out a lot. the hardest part of the job was trying to help out multiple customers at a time and ensuring they got what they needed. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with al of my friends.
good,"American Eagle was my second job i ever had i started as an associate and moved up in the company to where I am now, Manager in Training.  The company overall takes care of its people and hires within, so there is much room for growing and development.  Retail is always changing which requires you to move with it, its an amazing feeling to grow with a company."
good,Fast paced working environment.  Must be able to work alone and be a self starter.  Great benefits.  They care about their empyoyees as well as there customers.
good,Gave me as many hours as i needed and the other staff members were always helpful when i needed a shift covered. Some managers were a little rude compared to the others but overall good management.
good,Typical workday is coming in and running the store and giving associates tasks to do when they come into work. The culture is upbeat and happy. We work hard to help the customers find whatever they need.
good,"a typical day at work included providing customer service, tasking, cleaning, restocking and replenishing my area, cleaning fitting rooms, and cashiering. the management is wonderful and this is really a company who cares about its employees. they work very hard to keep their employees in a relaxed yet professional environment that always remains professional and drama free."
good,"This job is fast-paced, hands on, and revolves around customer service. It has given me great experience with merchandising and visuals. It is not the standard work schedule, sometimes working til 4 am setting the store walls and tables."
good,"I loved working for this company. Every day I was able to help people feel confident in what they wear. My co-workers were very helpful and fun to work with. The hardest part of the jobs was up keep of the store during busy days, and the most enjoyable part was seeing the customers happy when you have helped them purchase something."
good,"productive and energetic work environment. love styling customers wardrobes, and making them feel confident in what they're wearing"
good,I loved working for American Eagle Outiftters especially due to the team members I was able to work with. Great culture and opportunities available.
good,"The culture at American Eagle Outfitters is great because of the people. Good benefits, vacation policy, and pay. Very collaborative working environment."
good,"Got no hours, 10 hours a week if I was lucky. Dress code is chill and so is management. Just wish they would give more hours, but this is a good job for kids"
good,"The pace is fast, but that's great because the time flies by. Employees and customers are fun to work with. The work is not very demanding as it's all about folding, resetting and customer service, but overall it was an enjoyable retail experience."
good,"Very upbeat, fun, easy workplace. Typically I would style customers, help them pick outfits in a tasteful way. I learned how to handle shipment, little marketing, handle floor sets. Management staff are great, easy to talk to and flexible with scheduling shifts! Co-workers are energetic and always upbeat. Holidays such as Black Friday are difficult to work. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to give your input on outfits."
good,"A typical work day would include speaking to every customer and getting to know them in a short period of time to help them find the perfect size, style, and outfit. From working at this job, I have learned to be more outgoing and my communication skills have advanced, due to the fact that I have to listen and understand what the customer is looking for. I have worked at two American Eagle locations,. I would say that I had an amazing experience in my first location, but I cannot say the same for the my current location, due to the style of management. I would say the hardest part of working here would be working with the management styles at the Elmhurst location. Other than the management styles, I love working here, as I get to meet many people everyday and I get to use my creativity to style customers."
good,"I am a stock associate at American Eagle, which means while I am an integral part of the team my schedule is dictated by the amount of work that needs to be done. I love the company, and my coworkers are amazing, but my schedule is not ideal."
good,"On my work first of all i doing customer service. I am helping customers to find items what they need and what doing them happy. And its doing me happy also."
good,"from the business end the store is flawless. it is very accurate and good at reaching its goals and numbers. but their strive to reach said goals, makes the store very dry and monotone. there is no personality among the workers towards the customers, no bonds or chemistry is made in the just transactions."
good,I have't worked since boxing day 2016 because they haven't figured out that there are associates who haven't worked in forever.
good,"This company is well-rounded in regards to balancing culture, customer service, technology, other relevant brand channels, merchandising, and advancement. "
good,"A typical day at work included simply refolding and refolding clothes, I did not learn much other than organization skills because the management thought I paid attention to details well which benefited the looks of the store. Management was very nice and willing to help for the most part which was nice. The coworkers were harder to get along with and there was not as much teamwork involved within shifts which was a new experience for me after working at McDonald's. The hardest part of the job was trying to accomplish the goals because the up selling process was more different than McDonald's but it was still a relatively easy work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers figure out a nice outfit for certain occasions and seeing them glow up when they find something they feel good in."
good,"Working here was easy considering it was a mall job, the hours were straightforward and long but you don't do much else but sell, help customers fold and stock so it wasn't too bad."
good,"Meeting a lot of people was the best part, learned a lot about responsibilities to hit goals and keep things up to date and organized for the rest of the team."
good,"Good job to have when beginning your career but unless you get a lot of hours or promoted to manager, it might be hard to have for your entire life unless it's a side job."
good,"Fun people to work with, management is great and the most enjoyable part of my day is organizing and cleaning. I've learned about the buisness and daily patience."
good,"Get ready to work! The staff is friendly, but the company has standards to be respected at all times (visual, merchandising, employee behaviour, etc). Not doing so could result in a significant reduction in work hours, as AEO prioritizes efficient workers over everything else"
good,"Typical day included working with managers and co-works to meet sales goals and ensure customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. Tasks included cleaning, and organizing sales floor and store room to enhance ability to help customers."
good,American Eagle is a great retail experience for anyone starting out in the work force. The employees are great to work as well as the management team.
good,"american eagle is a fun place to work but like any retail, meeting goals on a slow day can be challenging"
good,Working at AE is fun and helps you interact with customers. Friendly co workers and mangers who help you with any problem you have during the day. The hardest part of the day is when there is a wait line in front of the fitting rooms.
good,"A good company to work for, many daily aspects to manage.  Good for advancement if you're self motivated and a hard worker."
good,AEO was a great place to work. Some long hours involved but the culture is fun and they really tried to reward the associates with periodic fun activities.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at American Eagle. The store manager was excellent, knows how to keep a job professional but also knows to have fun as well. There was never a boring day at American Eagle. The employees were fun to be around they were very easy to get along with. "
good,At first I enjoyed the job but it was just way to over done when we had to repeat promotion and remind people all the time about the promotions. The managers always had us kind of competing against each other to see who else more it wasn't for me
good,American Eagle is a great place to work while going through high school and college. The pay is reasonable for a part time position. There is opportunity for advancement based on performance.
good,American Eagle Outfitters was a fun and good place to work but if you're not a good seller or don't like to force people to buy stuff this isn't your ideal job. I was comfortable with forcing people to buy stuff or using my selling techniques.
good,"A typical day at work is reviewing sales and any goals needed to complete the day. Greeting customers and helping them outfit themselves or whomever they are purchasing items for. "
good,During my time with this company they treated their internal customer with respect and always showed appreciation for everyone's hard work! There is a lack of advancement opportunities for someone working at the store level who wishes to advance to Corporate level
good,This was a good job to have while I was in college. I really liked being a host and greeting the customers. There is also platy of room for advancement here. I loved working at the location in new york way better than the one in Texas.
good,I enjoyed working and interacting with the customers as well as my team members. The work was fast paced so I was never bored and always busy doing one task or another. The management was ok overall. the thing i enjoyed most about my job was interacting with different people daily as well as the repeat customers I got to know.
good,Great place to work. Lots of perks that you wont have at other companies. no rotating shifts. 3 or 4 day work week depending if you work weekdays or weekends. Its a shame they're relocating 250 miles away.
good,"I worked at American Eagle the summer after I graduated high school and it was truly a great experience. Being my first real job, there was a lot for me to learn but the managers and fellow sales associates really made an effort to make me feel comfortable and get the hands-on experience needed right from the start so that I would get the hand of it quickly. I was working with a lot of other people either my age or just a few years old so that enthusiasm and youthful vibe created a very pleasant work environment. At the same time, we all took our jobs seriously and there was a lot of emphasis on providing the highest quality customer service and working effectively and efficiently. Overall, this was a fantastic first job experience and I learned a great deal about having confidence, working collectively, and thinking quickly in the workplace."
good,"I was not at American Eagle for very long, but while i was I enjoyed it. The staff were great and always willing to help and the job was fairly easy."
good,"Nice job, learn a lot, meet new people everyday, outgoing job placement"
good,"I really enjoyed working for the company, the merchandise was trendy and stylish, good for all ages. They have a great management training program, and their programs for training associates especially new/young associates was very helpful and informative, made it easier for coaching reinforcement and opportunities. Had amazing co-workers, hired lots of A players."
good,"great benefits package to full time employees,"
good,Been there for only a short time since it was a seasonal position. Most of the people were awesome except not enough work hours a week was given.
good,"I've loved working for AE since I have started working here almost two years ago.  Management has always been easy to work with and super accomodating when it comes to scheduling.  The staff is always easy to get along with.  There are always rewards for performing above expectations.  I would say the only bad thing about this job is that there is no room for growth, something that I strive for when it comes to work for me."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at American Eagle. However, work place culture and work life balance really depends on who the District and Regional managers. I transitioned to Outlet and have been so happy in this branch of the company."
good,It's a good place to work.It has a great training and development program. They have many resources to learn and grow. The Upper management are very involved in your growth if that is the path you want to take.
good,"I learned to work in teams and as well I learned to be polite to people. I learned to multitask in my workplace and to pay attention to the details. My co-workers were nice I never had a problem with any of them, good communication is the key to success. The hardest part of the job may be when I cant find what the customer wants and the best part of the job its making the customer happy and provide my help being as friendly as possible."
good,"A typical day at work is coming in an watching videos on any new promotions and then jumping right on my station. I was considered a floater because I was able to do all positions. I would either do register, work on the floor straitening clothes and helping customers, or help the stock team with doing the shipment and stocking the store. All of the managers and my co-workers are very friendly and make work a fun place. The hardest part of the job is getting to know customers in a very short period of time to be able to understand what they like to point them in the right direction of style. The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting so many new people and feeling good about myself when seeing how well they look in an outfit I helped pick out and making the customers happy."
good,Enjoy interacting with many different people from all levels of the organization on a daily basis
good,"Job Training was not very detailed but along the way you would learn a lot. This job is about fast learning and customer first experience. If you are a people person and love fashion, it's a perfect job for you."
good,"1. Typical day at work- Very relaxing and peaceful. I would just go into work take a couple surveys then get ready for the floor and get to work where I would fold clothes and greet customers."
good,Fun to work at American Eagle but not enjoyable when busy. I loved some of my managers but the other ones were not enjoyable to work for.
good,"The work was fun to do, and it was great being in such a laid back environment. The day consisted of refolding shirts, restocking shelves, and going up to others and asking if they need assistance. Some people too shy to ask seem to sigh a breath of relief! It was great, it was fun. Supervisors told you what they needed to, but didn't put you down for what you might have been doing wrong. I was only there for a short time, and my hours were a little lacking, which was a shame since I greatly enjoyed working there."
good,Good atmosphere  working with people who were friendly and help out other team members.
good,Overall good culture.  Opportunities with clear concise communication from Home Office to Store Management.
good,"Greet customers, make sure customer is satisfied with their purchase, keep store neat, check up on customers. I learned how stressful it is to work in a store. Manger was often rude to workers and did not care that customers were watching him be rude. Eventually a customer made a complaint about it. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the great people that work there."
good,"Typical retail job. Help customers find things they want to buy, and suggest that they consider things they hadn't thought about trying. Also, maintaining the floor. Laid back atmosphere without too much pushing for sales is nice."
good,"For a level entry job I really couldn't have worked with a better team. The managers here are about their work, very dedicated, and caring. It is a hard day of work but rewarding. I really enjoyed working here. The only complaint I did have were the hours. After the holidays, there were a serious lack of hours and I've gone from working 40+ hours to 10 hour weeks. I also wasn't a fan of getting paid biweekly."
good,"is a nice place to work, friendly coworkers willing to help if you need it."
good,"Watch a video on latest trend or new things in the store then find where i would be working. If in fitting rooms you get rooms for customers and attend to their needs and put unwanted clothes back neatly. Sales floor you great customers, tell them about deals and help them find anything they need. You also make sure everything is presentable and looks neat. I learned customer service skills. Management was nice and co-workers were fun to work with. Hardest part was finding something to do when we weren't busy and the best part was working with friends."
good,"Promote sales for the store and give advice about new clothing styles to customers. I as able to learn how the store works when it came to promoting and learning how to sell clothes. I also learned the quality of clothes. Managers were very helpful and fun to be around just as the co-workers. the hardest part about this job was getting comfortable talking to strangers and trying to sell them the product. The most enjoyable part of the job was accomplishing the tasks that were given, like sell 20 pairs of jeans throughout your whole shift, being able to accomplish that or getting close to it. This was a good practice to get better at selling the products."
good,"not much to say great place to work in time square i learned how shipping works, management was understandable tho it's always packed in the store because its the biggest american eagle in the world i hated the hours i was given and other lots of people worked there but my coworkers and i worked as a team all the time."
good,"I come to work on time and see what specific task the managers would like me to complete. I am always working on a task for them and am always head cashier, I multi-task a lot."
good,I loved the discount and the flexibility of the scheduling. Management was fun and open to helping. company contests help employees win gifts.
good,I learned advanced register skills and how to train other associates. Management has become inconsistent with new management hires and are driving away long term employees. Hardest part of the job is having to communicate with foreigners that do not speak english or spanish.
good,I would work there again if Pay was better. I would fold jeans. I would greet poeple.
good,"I worked at American Eagle for a good 5 years, a typical work day would consist of watching a daily video that explained the current deals for the store and selling tactics used to help create sales. After watching the video the manager on duty tells you what you are doing today exp... cashier/shipping/sales floor and gives you set goals, once you are at your designated position you start working. The management team for AE are very responsible and try hard to make the part time employees comfortable."
good,"customer service, work holidays, management was good, co-workers were diverse,"
good,"advancement is based on who you know and not personal merits.  "
good,The job was very good as far as the work atmosphere. I did however have a problem with not having enough hours which came with it being retail and the on calls were somewhat stressful with mind changing after one decision is already made. The customer atmosphere and product is excellent though. It was a very fun place to work when I was on the schedule.
good,"ring up customers at the register, help them get in the proper size of clothes and go above and beyond to meet there needs."
good,"After clocking into work, we meet with whom ever is the LOD which means Leader On Duty, and they prep us for the hourly and daily goal that has to be made by the end of the day.  We set goals for ourselves and explain to our manager how are are going to excel in it.  Once that is said, we go to our section and start selling to our customers.  If it gets super busy, the manager might ask us to jump on the register to kill the line or help out in the fitting to put away some of the clothes the costumers left behind. During down time, we use that time to recover the floor and replenish on low merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that there is fabulous support from the staff.  Everyone and anyone is willing to give out a helping hand."
good,American Eagle Design office in NYC is a great place to work.  Very upbeat and young personal and a hip open ambiance.
good,"A typical day at American Eagle included greeting customers, converting customers to buyers, and maintaining store appearance."
good,They are moving their distribution center to the other side of penslyvania
good,"A typical day would be going in the morning doing all the opening procedures and getting the day ready. It is a fast paced job with learning to do things on a timed bases, amazing people and managment to work with and the best thing for my day would to make the customer feel great and smile at me when they leave the store"
good,"I tend to work about 3 hours a day processing clothing. I have to sensor it, fold it or hang it if necessary. I love my manager they are all very open and I  can ask them or come to them if I need to whenever. The hardest part of my job would be floor set they are over nights and are long and exhausting."
good,"Loved this job hands down."
good,"A normal day at American Eagle is a short shift filled with a lot of ""go-backs"" and fulfilling every customers' style needs. Denim is one the best at American Eagle, which makes them a go to for young adults and teens. Management is encouraging and completely outgoing, making the environment very inclusive for the shy sales person."
good,The management is great. I've never had any problems or complaints with them. They are really good with working around a school schedule. Overall the job is really good.
good,"Working at Aerie has been a very fun adventure! The Work incentives are great as well! The girls I work with are fun, and easy going always looking to get things done and have a good time! My typical Day would pretty much only last a couple of hours and it kept me going through out the day, because they weren't long shifts. The management is good, although there are a few professional things I would change, they're very flexible and easy to talk to, my co-workers are great and the store was fun! "
good,"Sales always came easy for me, taking what i know and sharing it with others is what i love to do. It was a fun environment in which it was the best job while in college."
good,Great experience with selling and customer interaction. Many outlets for training with constant support from peers. Everyone loves what they do and do it well.
good,"A typical day would start with the Sales Associate checking in with the Manager On Duty and learning about the special sales and promotions our store has going on. Then we are to go out on the sales floor and help customers shop by finding the right fits and styles that they want, while building outfits and being ""Friends First."" Keeping the store orderly and aesthetically pleasing is also important, and all employees strive to uphold our look. "
good,This job gives you the ability to learn how to talk to all kinds of people work under pressure and meet tight time constraints.  I worked with a great bunch of co workers all very professional and well rounded individuals and made some life long friends over the years.  
good,"The typical day at American Eagle Outfitters involves processing shipment. Once shipment has been processed, I then, either fill the floor with merchandise or back stock merchandise. I have learned how to be patient and be a leader. Management was good. Some cared more about the company than others. The hardest part of my job was being able to have everyone take the initiative. I enjoyed the freedom and being able to be a self starter. "
good,I really enjoyed working for the AEO brands. I worked in 3 different stores in five years.  Throughout those years I gained many valuable experiences that are still relevant in my current field.
good,"Fun place to work for college/high school kid."
good,"a typical day: Set up station for shipment . Accept and unload palettes of shipment .Sensor and back stock shipment . Clean up floor and set up floor back to original stat. Replenish floor with shipment and backstock the rest . Support sales floor , Throw away garbage and Leave stock room clean and leave recap of the day ."
good,"job is fun, you're never asked to do more than your job description, but there are no benefits offered to part time employees and there are no full time positions offered other than management."
good,"Great company to work for. Very welcoming environment. good employee discounts+ performance incentives such as gift cards. Good communication between management and associates. Hourly pay is very low, as is in most retail stores."
good,"My time at American Eagle Outfitters was great. On a typical day i would either help customers or work in the stock room. I learned a lot about dealing with people and working in a sometimes stressful environment. The management there was great. Two of the managers were long time friends of mine as well as great leaders and motivators. My co-workers were equally as great, they provided a fun and energetic work environment which made the job very enjoyable. There were days when things would get really busy which were some of the hardest times. Though some days were tough I really enjoyed being able to help the customers as much as possible."
good,A typical shift at American Eagle would include keeping the store straightened for customer appeal making items easier to find. I also handled inventory in the stock room which would require proper storage until they were needed in the front of the store. All of the employees are very friendly and energetic. The hardest thing we had to encounter were the upset customers. Although our managers did a great job and handling all the situations that came about. I highly enjoyed being able to help people with there needs. Even if it was only helping find the right size shirt or running to the back to grab a pair of shoes they desired.
good,"There is a high standrad to which you must perform to, but the people and encouraging management make it easier to reach your goals."
good,"On a daily basis you interact with multiple customers in a friendly manner. I learned that customer service is one of the most important details in a work enviroment. The managers were easy to work with and very helpful, while the co-workers were at times lazy. The hardest part of the job was juggling work with fun. While the most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with great people."
good,"AE is a great place to work! Benefits are great, and also the discounts. For a management position, you must be flexible, and willing to work over-nighters for merchandise updates about once a month for several days in a row. Must enjoy tasking, customer service, fashion, and working with mostly teens, as many adults do not want part-time hours for part-time pay. Pressure from upper management to reach KPI goals can be stressful: units per transaction, average dollar sale, conversion rate, number of credit card applications, etc."
good,"I would open and close the store depending on the schedule. In the mornings opening I would print schedule forecast the days numbers which included Sales goals, Credit card goals, new rewards signup goals, denim goals, UPT (Units per transaction), and ADS (Average Dollar per sale). I would also count registers and make sure we had all the change necessary for the day and drop the deposit from previous day sales. At closing I would take down the numbers from the day and calculate percentages based on if we were up or down on the day. I would count drawers to make sure we weren't over or under. I would also check to the store to make sure it was in good standards for opening. My co-workers were my assistant managers and associates who were normally in high school or college. The hardest part of my job was to get my associates excited about making goals. The most enjoyable part of my job would actually be making those goals and also being able to see change in the associates that I had trained."
good,A typical work day consisted of making sure that the day-to-day business was running smoothly. This was done by forecasting sales and adjusting the staff accordingly and also making sure that we achieved a high level of customer satisfaction.
good,"I learned a lot about retail, and all of the hard work that goes into it."
good,good job or a young adult that cant work many hours a week. loved the discount. great co-workers and management
good,"A typical day at work was very entertaining. Being that it was the holiday season, everyone was cheerful amd loving. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. I learned how to multi task which really came in handy when I became a mother. My co workers and managers were very fun and a joy to be around. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to try on all the clothes."
good,"As a sales associate, I enjoyed assisting my customers build fashionable outfits without the added stress of sales goals. I focused on what was right for my customer. I have had previous retail experience where it was very much a dog eat dog environment, I hated that! I got along with my managers and co-workers very well due to this cooperative atmosphere."
good,"This is the ideal place to work if you're in high school or a freshman/sophomore in college. They pay is above minimum wage and the discount is great if you wear that stuff....the only serious money you'll get there is if you climb into management. I only had it as a part time job in addition to my full time job, just for beer money and stuff like that....probably the biggest downside to this job was their on-call shifts...for example, you had an on-call shift from 5pm to 10pm...you had to call at least 2 hrs prior to the start of the shift to see if they were using your on-call....if they were using it, that means you had to get your behind in, if they weren't that means you weren't working that day...I see where they were going with this in that, they can schedule a bunch of people and then use as many or as few as they need depending on the traffic for that particular day...the drawback as the employee is that you can't even plan to do anything because there's the possibility that you MIGHT have to work that day, and the only way to find out is to call..."
good,American eagle is a nice work place with fun people. It is a good starting job if your just getting your foot in the door.
good,it is a fun place to at. they are extremely flexible with availability and time requests. great job to build customer service experience and meet new people.
good,This job was a lot of fun. Very loud and fast paced. lots of energy and I was able to meet so many faces. Really liked the upbeat pace but the hours were a bit long and hard. Overall it was a great experience.
good,Working at American Eagle has encouraged me to be more of an extrovert and has given me the courage to speak to larger crowds. This job has also taught me great time-management skills.
good,buen manejo de procesos de venta pero les falta organización
good,The environment is great but managers would come and go. Each manager had their own way of doing things so we would have to change methods and routine a lot l.
good,I worked at American Eagle for a few months and had a good experience. The pay is bare minimum and doesn’t match the amount of work you have to do. The employees and management was really nice and you learn a lot from the job.
good,"American Eagle is definitely a positive place to work. They offer flexible hours, and really help with questions and problems you are having at work. American eagle puts there customers first, and being a part of that makes you feel achieved."
good,I mostly worked on the floor having one on one conversations with customers. helping them find what best fits there body and what makes them the most comfortable.
good,If you don’t mind folding clothes or organizing piles of clothes then this is the perfect job for you. You will feel at home and in a stress free environment.
good,"Good direction by management, and the discounts were a very nice inclusion. There was a point made by management to wear the clothes sold in the store, which isn't always feasible in accordance with the salary I was being paid. Not many negatives."
good,"A typical day at work included learning the promotions for the day and daily sales goals. We would get zoned in a specific area of the store, I was usually put in the fitting room, by the entrance or at the register. In the fitting room, I would help the customers complete outfits and suggest similar styles. At the register, I would inform customers about credit events and sign them up if they were interested. By the entrance, I would greet customers and let them know about the daily promotions and answer any questions they had."
good,I enjoyed my brief time at American Eagle. The people were friendly and management was overall nice. It was just too much work for too little pay that ultimately turned me away.
good,The job is very hands on and involves having good communication skills! You speak with customers on the daily and always have a smile! You keep the store nice and clean and are always ready to throw a hand to someone !
good,"I was hired for seasonal work during the holiday season, so I was not required to be in an interview. It was a great experience for it was my first job."
good,"It’s a great job, love the product and company. I found out a SM position opened up and I was #1 for the job. My manager never told me. I found out through the manager transferring asking why I didn’t apply. Beyond that, it was amazing. I loved the focus, the brand, and where it was going. It was sad to leave the company, as I still wish I was there."
good,"Very cool place to work at, you'll get to work with alot of amazing people as you guys work together to help customers find their style of clothing and learn more about fashion trends along the way and see what works with which clothing."
good,"A great place to work, very normal environment for the fashion industry."
good,Even though it is just a retail job they do a lot of promos for their staff to win free things. Plus if you're good at selling you'll be able to move up into a higher sales position which usually means more hours.
good,"Able to learn a lot about generating sales and customer service. Typically perform register sales, handle and stock merchandise, as well as clean and recover the sales floor. Great working environment with fun people."
good,I learned that helping someone find an outfit isn’t as hard if you simply just ask questions. Getting to know the customer is very helpful and helps them find exactly what they are looking for.
good,A typical day at work with American Eagle is being given a list of tasks to complete before the end of your shift. Management is very helpful and flexible with your personal and work-related life. All employees are extremely invested in each other's well-being and work together on all tasks.
good,"American Eagle is a diverse workforce with a fun/friendly environment. The management team is always on point and make working there fun, and  simple."
good,"AE is an awesome place for young people who like to engage with others and share suggestions on the latest clothing trends. During holidays, back-to-school and weekends AE is a fast-paced environment and lots of fun."
good,"American Eagle has to have been my best and favourite job to date, the management and team was very nice, the orientation process was very detailed and teaches you almost everything you need to know about the job, it's a very good place to work"
good,I was so happy in the beginning but with my personal experience lead me to double learned and my first problem was the distance and the second was race problem if you doesn’t speaking some supervisors language they don’t wanted to selected you to the company .
good,The staff at American Eagle are wonderful to work with. I always loved coming to work and interacting with those that I worked with and with the customers as well
good,"Making the schedule, planning our forecast, keeping files neat and in proper order are just a few of the things I do. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers find all they need and being able to work with all employees on good terms."
good,"I enjoyed my time at AE. Unfortunately, I had a micro-manager who had no faith in her assistants. I put up with it for a long time along with the other 2 assistants. The place itself is great. For management, I was paid very well. You have fun, but work hard. A lot of folding!!  You do have to keep up on the clothing: purchasing it and knowing the trends, but they give you a great discount. I think this job is more for people who are in their teens or 20's; but even me, in my 40's found it enjoyable. I am glad I had a positive impact on my team."
good,"it was fun working there. good people"
good,"Working at American Eagle Outfitters is a wonderful job that has kind management and a light and fun atmosphere. Although, the job can be ridiculously busy, that just comes with  the territory."
good,"I started working for American Eagle Outfitters around mid November of 2018 as a seasonal associate and thoroughly enjoyed working there. I wish I could have worked there longer but, I being only seasonal, circumstances got in the way."
good,The people there are amazing. They aren't too harsh on you if you make mistakes. Work schedule is very flexible there considering most of the workers are minors. They never lose their cool even under lots of pressure.
good,i greeted the customers...i felt as if that was an important part because first impressions are everything!!!I help customers out and made sure their experience there was wonderful.
good,"I’ve had a job at American Eagle for the last four years and I would say that it is a great place to work when you are just starting to work, since the hours are flexible!"
good,"I worked Part-time for AEO during an in-between place in my life. The staff and leadership of the store were fantastic & welcoming. I enjoyed my time there that I stayed on in a lesser part-time role while I adjusted into my new full-time position. I maintained connections and kept my ears and eyes open at opportunities to return, but happiness with my current full-time situation kept me content and I did not go back. But my time there was well spent, and I appreciated the opportunities!"
good,"Very easy place to work, and very good for first time employees. Laid-back environment that never gets too busy. They don't pay much (barely above minimum wage) but for my first job I didn't mind."
good,"Fun and Productive workplace, very good employee retention despite not paying a competitive wage."
good,"I learn a lot every single day working with different kinds of people, finding a positive environment Can really help improve your experience in the workplace and I find that AEO has improve me in a lot of ways I needed improving."
good,"overall, this company is a pretty good place to work. you get good benefits (60% off as an employee discount), and everyone who works here tends to be friendly and kind. would recommend."
good,This is a great job if you are in high school or collage and looking for a part time job.  after that if you go full time and want to make a career you will have no work life balance
good,Working at American eagle is a good place to get a foot hold or a solid foundation on how retail works. I learned a lot of my basic retail knowledge working there because of its well rounded product selling.
good,"I loved the generous employee discounts at both AEO and Aerie. The job was fun and usually the time flew by while working. Customers could be unpleasant from time to time, especially during Black Friday and Christmastime when it’s super busy. The job itself was fun, I really enjoyed working here."
good,The best part of my job is the people I was working with! We all love each other. Everyone is so supportive and ready to listen if we need to get something off our chest. We can relate to one another. We get amazing discounts!! Everyone is so connected and I have recommended all my friends to apply!
good,Good fun place to work at the hours are flexible if need be and you get a really awesome discount. One of the main downsides is that they really underpay their employees and don’t really give out raises even if you’ve been there for years.
good,"Loved the Organization and the staff. The store's culture really allowed my co-workers and I to enjoy work shifts, resulting in a safe and growing working environment for everyone."
good,"Each day check sales plan and provide associates with daily goals. Give additional feedback and ensure the team that teamwork is the best strength. "

good,"SEASONAL HIRE ONLY"
good,"Management is nice at all stores I have worked at. It is easy to transfer to a new store if necessary too. "
good,"Benefits are good, 10 items at 60% off a month, free items are given out on occasion normally to promote meeting sales targets or for individual achievement. Management is flexible and numerous employees are full time students. "
good,"Job culture was pigeonholed into that of the company's image, which can be fun at times, and tiring at other times. While I was working there the childish games to help sell products sometimes forced me to be more extroverted than I felt, or came across as cheesy when trying to engage with my associates, but now that I am gone it is easily one of the things that I miss most."
good,"It is a good place to work for younger people, they teach the basic`s for applying in more retail, the people working there along with management we kind and very well balanced."
good,Great job if you are looking for extra cash or for something part time. Managers are amazing and friendly. Being a sales associate is a ton of fun and a good way to make lasting friendships.
good,"I worked at American Eagle as a summer job in CT. It was fun while I was there. My favorite thing about the it is I wasn't doing the same thing everyday. The people I worked with were very nice, and the work environment was very casual and fun."
good,"American Eagle is a very successful brand. The job is best suited for those who have an extroverted personality due to all of the social interactions that happen during the day. They are always looking for new workers, so if you like fashion, socializing, and earning your wages, then this is definitely a company you should look into."
good,"From day one as a manager, you are immersed into a plethora of a well organized business structure. The training and execution of all the systems set in place helped to teach me a better way to look into business. The extensive training program and access to training materials are what showed me my desire to train and focus on how to better the people that are working for us, giving them so much out of their job than just basic customer service."
good,American eagle was a great place to work up until about 2 years ago. They started hiring upper management from other companies and in the process began losing its identity.
good,I didn't work for the company long but it was professional. My co workers as well as management. I would recommend others who are interested in retail. Nice seasonal or even if your looking to stay. Well secured with security.
good,"I worked with a great manager in my district, which meant I was well trained and things usually ran smoothly at work, but this also meant he was strict and very particular on how jobs were completed. I loved my coworkers and when things got rough, the managers stepped up to help the other employees. I only left because of scheduling issues (being told I had time off and then getting scheduled while I was supposed to be out of town) other than that I had a great time working there."
good,Very fun place to work but they will put you to work if they see you just standing around. Like I said it’s a very friendly place but it’s also a work place. Discounts are nice. Really the only best thing about working at a retailer
good,I have learned a lot while working for american eagle over the past 2 years and half. I have worked in almost every area inside the store. All my co-workers are great amd once again i must say its like a little family and i enjoy it very much

good,Great place to work with very flexible hours! The managers and fellow associates are friendly and always inclusive. You have opportunities to learn and grow.
good,"During my short period of time working here I met a lot of wonderful co-workers and customers. I learned that the customers come first when it comes to what type of clothing or style they are looking for. The employees and management there are very organized and always made the workplace a fun and inviting place to work. Also, you get to see the new styles that come in before anyone else :)"
good,"Although the pay is low, it's a good place to work. Great store manager, best manager I've had. Very flexible hours, good place for a second job and great associate discount"
good,"A typical day at work would be filling the floor and boosting sales while doing so. I learned how to boost sales as well as persuade the customers to apply for credit cards and rewards cards help them save money. The management was a little difficult to deal with, only two out of the four managers were actually welcoming and understanding. However, the other two were not focused on helping the company, they were worried about verbally abusing their associates. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with rude managers and customers, as well as trying to watch for shoplifters. The most enjoyable part about the job would have to be the dress code, and the great employee discounts."
good,"Great place to improve communication and customer service skills, along with organization and time management. Friendly environment with good benefits."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of attending customers and helping them look for the right outfit. I learned how to properly fold clothes. management was great, all 4 of my managers got along with the associates. The culture has to be the strongest thing in that store. There was no challenge in that job. The whole job was enjoyable, from the time you got on the clock, to when you got off."
good,You are always doing something. And you always had these challenges you had to accomplish every shift. Made work exciting. My co workers were great and always there to help

good,greeting customers as they walk in and making sales. Also getting credit card application and being on time is important. The environment is very friendly.
good,There is a lot that goes into a typical AE work day. You have cleaning duties to complete before opening as well as closing duties that come with running this store. We have very strong managers who encourage us to be the best we can be and we have a nice relationship with each manager but we also respect and work very hard with them. The culture in AE is very inviting and healthy. The hardest part of the job would be selling credit (I was the credit captain of the store) but the most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing the satisfaction of customers when they walk out of the door.
good,"Good to start out on. environment, coworkers, culture is great. discounts are great. pay can be a bit on the lower end with little opportunity for significant raises. difficult to achieve upward mobility in the ranks"
good,American Eagle Outfitters was an enjoyable part time job with short hours. The 4-6 hour shifts help employees to conserve energy and be the best for each and every customer.
good,"The job is a great retail job.  The company culture is tremendous, and makes you feel empowered.  Most markets advancement is very obtainable, others are not as strong.   If you are coupled with a strong leader, you will be able to grow tremendously."
good,I have worked for a variety of managers in the 5 years I have worked for this company. They can make or break the entire job experience. Store managers have a lot of freedom to make their stores their own with different expectations and different training.

good,"Very fun environment.  Employees were encouraged to wear AE apparel and company provide 60% discounts for on line product including on sale product. Turkeys every year, clothing sale on site every year. Good decent hard working staff and management that developed to their roles from the bottom, up."
good,"I've been with this company for 3 years - the only reason I haven't been promoted is because of school. While this isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life, the company runs fairly well. District managers and above generally exist outside of reality and do not understand day-to-day customers and problems, which is where a good management team comes in."
good,"Working at American Eagle, i have gained an efficient amount retail knowledge that has helped me further grow and succeed as sales associate. The work environment was always fun and productive."

good,"They are a good company , managers are very helpful and kind, everyone in there is friends . Very clean and fun workplace . When I first started working there and I didn’t know a lot , they helped me and brought me up to speed real quick."

good,Being a sales associate for American Eagle Outfitters was calming but stressful. Working around amazing people and meeting new customers everyday was the best part of a job. The hardest part of American Eagle was after hours. Cleaning up and changing around the store was a lot of work.
good,"Ambiance intéressente avec d'avantages importants sur les coûts de la marchandisse, mais peu d'heures."
good,"I loved the discounts and thrill of helping someone find something they love, but with the upkeep and “goals” put in place I don’t believe is worth the pay."
good,"slow environment"
good,This was a part time job but  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the management team was great. They were very flexible with work schedules as I was a student.
good,Loved working here and developing into a manager. It was relaxed and a fun workplace to be at. Working the busiest times of the year were my favorite!
good,"Very fun, you will have co workers who will turn to great friends for years. The company is awesome, but it’s more for people who have a passion for retail"
good,if you need a job american eagle is a good way to go. i normal do go back and fitting room but also do other tasks such as marketing.. really i do it all except the cash register. the managers their are amazing.
good,"A typical day at work would include a lot of interaction with customers. I learned customer service skills, communication skills, and teamwork skills through working here. The management was always there for us when we had questions or needed approval for something, this was a great place to work. The employees, managers, and customers were all easy to get along with. The hardest part of this job was meeting the goals on slow days and picking out clothing for customers that I thought they would like.

good,"Since you must wear their clothes, I would think they provide a allowance but they only give you a discount which means you're forced to buy their clothes. I really don't like that. I do like that they're very customer first and everyone works together to assist the customers. It makes the job easier the less you have to say no."
good,American eagle is a nice places to work at. The employees are so nice and understanding when you have a personal issue. The discount is amazing and they help you every time you don’t understand something.
good,"The day shift ran from 6:00AM to 6:30PM, my shift only Friday-Sunday. The morning starts with stretching and announcements, then  to your station of the day, mine was DTC. You get 4 breaks during the day, 2 half hours and 2 15 minutes, giving you more than enough rest time for the length of the shift, and more stretching after the afternoon lunch. "
good,"I did; cashier, recovery, go-backs, shipment, stock and rooms."
good,"Anything with retail can be stressful, of course. But working for a well-known brand like American Eagle proved to be a difficult task, especially if you're just a student."
good,They do provide you with great discounts on items and have great black Friday and December events for employees. Food/etc. Management varies per location. to each their own opinions
good,"american eagle made me love to be a sale associate. The only problems i really had was the instability of hours, some weeks i made 40 hours some weeks i only mad 20 hours besides that some days I would work 4-12 other days I would work a double and it was during the school week which is why I had to quit. I loved rush hour because then there was always so many people to help and get to meet (being on 42 street)."
good,"American Eagle was my first job. Here, I learned how to confidently communicate with customers and tend to their needs in a respectable and time-efficient manner. I learned how to deal with different types of people; variations of personalities and backgrounds. Working with multiple people simultaneously taught me time management skills. Overall I had a really great experience working there, the atmosphere was fun and I loved my coworkers and management."
good,"American eagle is a cool place to work, and they give you an awesome discount, but they don't give you a lot of hours to work. so if you need a lot of money i wouldnt work there"
good,"If you're a fashion lover, American Eagle is a great place to get your foot in the door. The employee discount are amazing!! At times it gets to be annoying trying to get customers to sign up for a credit card which they are pretty strict on doing on a hourly basis."
good,During the duration of my employment I enjoyed working with the management team. I was hired in as a stock associate. The supervisors recognize you for your hard work and i was sad when i had to leave my position
good,AEO est une entreprise où la formation des employés est au cœur de leurs valeurs entrepreneuriales. Les employés sont centrés sur le travail d’équipe ce qui rends l’atmosphère en boutique très chaleureuse.
good,"Very fast paced and the staff was very friendly. I was only seasonal, but they worked with me well to learn quick in time for black friday. Other co-workers where not nice because they were superior to me and had more knowledge prior it being my first only few days."
good,I worked 3 12 hour shift on weekend. didn't mind it because I had the whole week to myself and had a lot of voluntary overtime. Good benefits easy going place with good managers. The only thing bad about it was the pay was kind of low but then again it wasn't a hard job. I would still be there if they didn't relocate. Weekend shift was the best. Day shift not so much
good,"overall great experience, fun people and good management, provided everyone with a fair workplace to succeed, the most enjoyable part of the job is the discount"
good,"I worked there for 4 busy seasons and loved every single time that I did. The work was straight forward and they have simplified it so much that you would really have to know what you were doing to mess up."
good,Great atomosphere. Okay benenfirs and discount. The hours aren't long. It's a lot of time standing around folding clothes and greeting customers. Overall a nice place to work

good,"With American Eagle being my first job, it has taught me a lot. It allowed me to grow as a person. I adored the people I worked with and my managers. It helped me deal with different situations and learn how to work through it. The hardest part of the job was during the busiest weeks of the year, like tax free weekend, when there would be hoards of people."
good,"Working at American Eagle Outfitters, was bittersweet. I fillled out an application there a  couple days before i was called for an interview, i get to the interview and i get hired on the spot. I came to work every Friday and Saturday and Sunday sometimes during the week depended on what hours were available. I would come in and do my job and go home, i learned that working in the retail industry is hard if you don't have that many years of experience. The manager was awesome but she soon got transferred to another AEO outlet store in Virginia,  i was so upset. The new boss was a pain. The workplace culture was definitely good to work in. The hardest part about the job was trying to please the new boss, anything that i did was barely good enough for her. The most enjoyable part of that job was i got to make new friends outside of the workplace and did my job the way it was supposed to be done. Even though i was only there for 3 months I still loved working there and loved working with some of the people i worked with."
good,American Eagle Outfitters was a great place to work. Everyday there was always something new to learn and there was always a place for input or opinions no matter what the situation. We always worked as a team and got the job done the right way.

good,Our production team was very united. Felt like I learned how to be quicker on adobe illustrator every day. Understanding people's temperaments was a challenge at first but through it I've made some long-lasting relationships.
good,I love working here and the people make there make it the best. I typically just ring people up at the register and straighten the store. It's pretty simple.
good,"A typical day at American Eagle starts off with a pre-party which lets you know all the daily goals the individual store has for the day. Through out the day there are many different tasks that can be done which goes from putting out more inventory, recovery, cashier responsibilities, customer servicing, back stocking, go backs, and online orders. The hardest part of the job is probably difficult customers but the best part of the job is helping those people in need, especially the ones that can be difficult."
good,"Great management and friendly staff.  Everyone is very helpful and makes sure the employees really understand the product before sending you out on the sales floor.  Although the discounts are nice, the company expects you to wear their merchandise while paying the lowest they possibly can."
good,AE is a great place to work. I've created great relationships with coworkers. The discount is amazing. The only downside is low pay and minimal hours during the summer.
good,its a really great place to work first because you get really good discounts on clothes and they work around your schedule can be stressing and hard work though.

good,"AEO as the global company is amazing, they believe strongly in equal opportunity employment and they love to see their employees excel. I was only employed for the holiday season but in the time I was there I had a great time every day I went into work."
good,"I enjoyed being apart of American Eagle's associates. Unfortunately, the pay and hour were more for someone in high school, not for someone who have any bills to pay."
good,"Fun people, great management that is always easy and laid back. Shifts are extremely flexible. Low stress environment. You will learn to work as a team together and make the best of the job."
good,A typical day at work would've been a short fast paced shift. It gave me skills on how to deal with customers and help make them have the best experience possible and leave smiling. Our managerial staff were quick to correct us if we ever made a mistake in a positive and encouraging fashion. The hardest part of the job would've been trying to outsell my fellow employees but the sense of competition definitely made the time more enjoyable go by faster.

good,The company is headed in the right direction in my opinion... There is for sure a great deal of opportunity in terms of communication between feild leaders and store leaders.
good,"Amazing people to work with, great atmosphere, enjoyable work. Breaks when need. Co-workers almost become family in this place when everyone works together as a team and i have yet not to see that in AE"

good,"A typical day at work involves helping customers find cute and comfy clothes, keeping the store neat, and helping customers check out. The job is enjoyable and having good customer experience will help."
good,"It is a relatively simple place to work and you almost always know what to expect when you walk in the doors. If you are looking for slow paced, then this is perfect, but if you are like me, then you desire something a bit more challenging."
good,"Fun but productive. Very straight forward sometimes, late nights. Very understanding at times. There really wasn't any hard times, my mangers were understanding due to it being my first job."
good,This job was so much fun. I was able to use all my creative aspects. Floor sets were great I was able to use my creative side and working with the customers was a wonderful experience due to I love working with people.
good,Awesome atmosphere with great people and quality merchandise. Management has a great attitude and they pick great people that will make the experience enjoyable.
good,"Un día normal en mi trabajo era llegar, registrar mi entrada (lo cual tenia que ser mi puntual), dirigirme con el encargado para decirme a que área me tenia que dirigir, generalmente estaba en la entrada, recibiendo a la gente, dándoles la bienvenida, comentándoles las promociones, y haciendo mi labor de venta en esa área, también tenia que verificar si en esa área contaba con producto abundante o si tenia que surtir, si había mucha gente le pedía a algún compañero que si me apoyaba ya que no podía descuidar mi puesto principal."
good,"A typical day at American Eagle consists of  helping customers find the best outfits for their style, folding and organizing clothes, and handling transactions on the cash register. My experience here has taught me how to be even more outgoing and connect with customers more often. The management is really great and create a really nice atmosphere in the workplace. My co-workers are really helpful and reliable. The hardest part of the job is remembering where all the clothes belong in the store. My favorite part of the job is laughing and joking with my co-workers and customers."

good,"Pretty cool place to work , not really any overtime , managers were cool everyone ended up feels my like family folding clothes and taking Cash or debit over pod"

They have great discounts for employees and are very willing to work with your schedule as long as you tell them in a timely manor. It is hard to advance unless you are willing to transfer a lot.
good,"*Upselling to customers, greeting/helping them, cashier, fitting rooms and cleaning."
good,"Great company with good hands on training. Learned a lot about the retail/customer service world. Very little pay for high expectations. Friendly staff and work environment.The way they schedule staff can be a bit biased, but other than that, good hours if you put in the effort. As retail is a very high paced job at times, the training learned had many tips on how to control a stressful situation."
good,"The people are fun and loving but the hours are minimal, the job itself if nice. The customers are the best when you meet someone with a story to tell and a great personality!"
good,"American Eagle really loves their employees, every store I have worked for was full of people who loved their job and people who wanted you to succeed! AWESOME"
good,Watch a video on the latest news and promotions for the store then fill out a goal sheet for the day. It gave me more confidence since you had to approach people and try to get them to buy clothes. Hardest part of the job was to try and influence customers when their minds were made up.
good,The company is great for anyone that is looking to advancement with experience. The company promotes with is so it builds you up to take other positions which is great for people who are always looking to learn.
good,"American Eagle is a great place to work and all the employees are awesome! I loved my coworkers and management! It was very busy, but shifts went by quick!!"

My co-workers assist me whenever i need help and let me experience the importance of teamwork. Whenever we have free time we let ourselves enjoy the shift without affecting our duty and create a great atmosphere through out the day. About my job, one of the hardest part is when we encounter customer complaint though we can handle it easily but definitely change our mood through out the shift. One of the most enjoyable part of our job is the rewards that we received from the company. Achieving Targets comes with a great result. If you have passion on what you're doing probably the most rewarding part is when you were recognized by the management and had a chance to be a good leader soon."
good,"Working at American Eagle has been a great experience because I love the environment of the job. My managers treat me like an adult, but also are clear on their expectations of me. I enjoy working with my co-workers because we are all around the same age and can relate to one another. The hardest part of the job is not knowing the answer to a customer's question. I have to be quick on my feet and think of an answer or I refer them to one of my managers. My favorited part of the job is giving clothing advice to customers."
good,I enjoy coming back to American Eagle Outfitters to work when I come home for holiday breaks or for the summer from school. The work hours are flexible and the employees at AEO are fantastic.
good,American Eagle Outfitters is a very friendly place. Employees have great attitude and approach. There is always help if needed.
good,"The compensation for entry level management suck. However, that is my only complaint that cannot be handled in due time. I am one of 4 manager and I love my colleagues. My staff, I love as individuals and coming to work, does not feel that way. We play awesome music and sell awesome clothes!"
good,"Fun and energetic environment. The management team is very productive. Always something to do every time you go into work. Not a lot of chance of advancement, however it is a good place to start off for your first job."
good,"I'm in charge of the shipments. We get deliveries every day, of new clothes, and replenishments of older stock. I organise, fold and sort away these products. I'm also responsible for the visual layout of the store, and the cleanliness and general upkeep of the back store. I'm on a headset with my managers at all time, to discuss the running of the store, and fulfilling customer requests for products not available on the shop floor."
good,"Working for American Eagle Outfitters was a perfect way to start my retail management career. After spending multiple years with the company, I felt as though I had a good foundation as a manager and was well served when I went to other companies."
good,"All in all a great place to work, as an Operations Clerk you see lots of ""action"". Meeting the companies goals is a struggle with all of the ""New""."
good,"Productive and fun,i learned a lot load and unload planes,there ok my coworkers i love working with all its phisical but a lot of fun satisfaction that nobody got hurt and the customer satisfaction."
good,"Fashion, Colleagues, Environment. These 3 power points can make any workplace interesting. The hardest part was of the job was making schedules really. Management was great once everyone got more of a feel for one another and having a strong support staff. I learned more skills on on taking charge and control of situations when needed. My support staff and I were always full of energy with the companies goals always in mind."
good,"professional, large company with good working environment.learn to work in a good environment and good coworkers.  hardest part of the job is the heat."
good,This job is honestly very fun. The environment is very up-beat and enjoyable. The management is always at your side willing t do what it takes for you to thrive as an employee.
good,Its a good part time job while you're in school or for the summer or a second job. My managers were the best and everyone was like a big family lol
good,"I worked at American Eagle just as a temporary job during the holiday season. No complaints really, I enjoyed the people and atmosphere!"
good,The environment at american eagle was both fun and competitive. Everybody becomes a family having the same goals and purpose to sell to the customer. The hardest part about the job was trying to keep up with credit cards and reward cards because that was a big thing and the more you sold the better time you had working there. The discount was also very good and it help alot with wardrobe making it very inexpensive to buy.
good,"For the most part my day consisted of folding clothes and talking to potential customers. I had to get to know the customer, and develop a working relationship to be able to recommend items of interest, which i think is the most important thing i took away from the job"
good,"I like working with a staff of 500 hundred people. Meeting new customers from all over the world. American eagle taught me a lot about customer service, from greeting, to getting to know your customer. I had a great management team. When i had family issues they understood, and was very concerned."
good,"American Eagle is a fun and upbeat place to work at, my co-workers are great, the employee discount is even better. I love working here."
good,Worked here for a short period of time for seasonal help. Very fast paced. There was never a really slow period there was always something that you could do.
good,"Amazing company to work for in the beginning! Understood a work life balance gave enough payroll for stores as time went on cutting of payroll the lack of acknowledgment of staff and customers. Turned more into a ""money maker"" than a ""customer service"" feeling"
good,This was a fun and very organized company to work for. I learned how to up-sale and valuable teamwork experience. The most difficult part of the job was selling credit cards.
good,"Easy work, constantly busy, I learned how to sell and do inventory management, management was nice in-store, relationship with corporate was minimal, co-workers were very nice, hardest part of the job was doing the over-nights, and the most enjoyable part was watching people feel good about their new clothes."
good,It was awesome working there everyday was a new adventure. I liked it everyone helped each other out so it was like a big family and it felt easy.
good,"Typical day at work for me would be me doing customer service and maintaining the Mens Apparel Departments along with promoting the stores card. While working at American Eagle I progressed in learning how to interact with people, and different ways to go about promoting and selling our merchandise. Management I don't have a problem with because at work I was consistently doing something to keep myself busy and out of trouble with management. Co-workers are great people I don't have problems with any of them not that I know of or can think about all of them are really nice and have bubbly personalities. Hardest part of the job would be trying to convince customers in signing up for the stores credit card cause nobody ever wants one... The most enjoyable part of the job is the Customers, Environment, and the music"
good,this was my first job and I was hired on the spot. Had a lot of fun with my co workers were ALOT of fun to work with. I learned a lot about customer service and working as a cashier. the only thing I didn't like about the job was cleaning up after people who would come into he store and destroy everything you just cleaned up.
good,"If you like clothes and customer service, this job may be up your alley."
good,"It was overall a good place to work, but I as I worked in multiple locations, I found some more favourable than the other. Some places were friendly and had a great environment and another place I worked with AEO was just unpleasant and not what I had experienced at another store at all."
good,"Working at American Eagle was very fun. I rarely felt like a was actually working. The most I did as a sales associate was cleaning up my area and help guests find what they need. When you're talking and helping people you have a lot of fun and you have other people that can help you out. Management is very friendly and they're close with a lot of their employees. I liked helping people get exactly what they needed and recommend things for them. Selling more items may not get you any bonuses or anything like that, but the management does indeed notice. Shifts are short and the time flies by almost like i walk right in and out."
good,"i would come into work clock in go to my post make sure my station is clean and never leave a customer unseen."
good,"learned alot about sales"
good,Loved my job. The management and co-workers were great. I spent my time at work in the stockroom which I loved.
good,"The store was always very well organized, the atmosphere is intensely fun and outgoing. A very youthful company as far as management and staff."
good,While working at this jobs i gain a lot of Team Spirit. The hardest part  about this job was to get used of communicating with customer and getting them ever items that they need and trying to accomplish the goal for the day.
good,"Live your live "
good,Many tasks needed to be completed often while customers needed help also. I have learned to multi-task and use my patience. During peak seasons work will be very fast paced and sometimes stressful. The good part was that management is very understanding and easy to get along with as well as the other associates.
good,"great environment"
good,"A typical day would be working in the shipment area in the back room, or work the sales floor by making the place nice and neat and also opened the register as cashier. At times worked over night for the new season. management was fair and co-workers were very helpful. hardest part was no one received full time hours except managers. most enjoyable was helping customers."
good,Great Place to start career and to collaborate with others.
good,"I found this job to be thrilling. the hours are flexible, but if you ask for to much time off you will lose credibility fast."
good,A typical day at work consisted of selling and promoting american eagle products. Helping customers find the right fit.
good,American Eagle is a fast paced retail job. With plenty of customer service opportunities.
good,"I enjoyed working at American Eagle Outfitters. It wasn't a hard job at all, in fact it was really simple. I did learned a lot like: how to sell, how to give good customer service, how to work with a Plano-gram, and how to work in retail. The managers there were great, it was really a good environment to be at. The co-workers were friendly and I enjoyed it very well. The only con I would have is the pay, but other than that it's fun!"
good,you have to satisfy your customer at all times.. that's the main thing i learned through out my experience there
good,"This gave a lot of knowledge about how sales and retailing works. Good job as a sales associate if you are in high school, not as much if your in college."
good,"Every day was fun, fast paced, and exciting. Working in a clothing retailer presented may obstacles, many of which were dealing with a multitude of customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers and making sure that they were happy and satisfied with their purchases. The hardest part of my job was the unhappiness I felt from not recieving any form of advancement. I applied for an assistant-manager position three times and was passed up for the position all three times. I was never given a reason as to why I was not chosen."
good,A typical day at work was meeting new people bringing them cloths and trying to make sales. I learned a lot about women's clothing. Management was okay hours were based on the managers favorites. the hardest part of the job was the seasonal hours. The best part of working there was the people I met while working there.
good,"American Eagle values its employyes. They offer competetive payrates, comprehensive benefits, and many perks that are quality of life boosters. However, the leadership in place has some room for improvement. A more focused, more reliable and trustworthy management core would make this an ideal job."
good,"I assume a leadership role with accountability for maximizing my store business results by consistently creating exceptional customer experiences. Through compelling merchandising standards, operational integrity and associate development my team and I drive results on a daily basis."
good,"Great place to work, but hard to get reliable hours. Management keeps hours exclusive to favorites. Still, best work environment you can find in Carbondale."
good,"A typical day would include helping customers with their shopping needs. This could include the help of finding different sizes and outfits for a customer or helping run the register."
good,Great work environment for young people. Good management.
good,"I had the best managers who were understanding and taught me a lot that I benefitted from. Only thing I didn't like was lack of hours when it wasn't the holiday season and being pressured to pressure people to get a store credit card."
good,"A typical day at work is to sell. You get a store goal and you write your personal goal and try to get to that goal. There are always things to do like fold clothes, attend customers, when neccesary, be at the cash register, do inventory when neccesary and mantain a clean store. "
good,"youthful environment"
good,"I liked working at American simply for the fact that I felt managers really cared about me. If a customer was ever rude or inappropriate my managers were always there to help me if I was in need. Co-workers were very respectful and I was able to connect with each one in some way. The hardest part of the job had to have been having to actually deal with some of the patrons, particular ones who came in already in an upset mood. I learned to communicate with others better, and have come to respect those who were also working with me. It is not an easy job and I have grown to respect those who do work."
good,What I enjoyed about this job was you could work full time and your hard work paid off. The company offered good raises and management did reviews with all associates. The discount was nice and the atmosphere was fun. 
good,i would do my prepare and do daily paperwork for the day
good,"I find great satisfaction helping customers and having them leave the store, just as happy or happier then when they came in. Co workers are great at American eagle"
good,"When working at American Eagle your expected to come in with a positive attitude and ready to work. Everyday was different but since the store is located on 34th street a lot of tourist come in to shop, so we had to multi-task and help more than one customer at a time. The hardest part of the job was figuring out how to approach the customer. Throughout the time I worked in American Eagle it took me a while but I learned that it's easier to sell to a customer when you connect with them on a personal level. Instead of approaching them and asking if they need help I'd start a conversation with them by asking open ended questions, that way when I ask them who or what they're shopping for they're comfortable with my assistance. The management was always on top of things, always willing to help or teach us how to do certain things or deal with certain situations so when we come across them we know what to do. One of my favorite reasons to come to work was being around my co-workers. Everyone was friendly which made it easier to communicate over the walkie if we needed a different size or style that wasn't in our section."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of providing customer service with an emphasis on building repeat-customer relationships. As many of our customers were frequent shoppers, I learned very quickly how to recognize their specific needs and tailor my approach to meeting them. Management was friendly and respectful, but the hours given to seasonal workers were below average. Though I enjoyed the atmosphere while working there, I was a bit surprised at how little a number of their seasonal employees were actually assigned work hours. Needless to say, it was a disappointing experience."
good,"American eagle is a fast pace, fun, high learning environment. Everyday your jobs can be different with many different duties that keeps it interesting. Always friendly, respectful and polite makes for a positive environment that creates harmony for the staff and workers. Management of course is always professionally yet enforcing the daily tasks and whats expected from the employee. The most enjoyable part is assisting customers and promoting the latest styles and fashion as well as the best side of the store brand. Also providing the customers with discounts to make shopping more affordable and pleasant. There is no hardest part working for this jobs."
good,"If you love your job,even it's not part of your job or you will do it because you love your job at the same time your helping each other we called that a ""teamwork"" which is that's the important in the shop.Standard fold that what I like to maintain the standard and image of the shop."
good,"Performed multiple task of stocking shelves, jewelry, and fitting rooms"
good,"For the time that I spent working at American Eagle Outfitters, I had a great time learning more about the clothing industry and performing sales representative tasks. From this unique experience, I have learned how to promote sales, communicate better, and interact with many customers and co-workers. I enjoyed this work experience thoroughly because it allowed me to develop my interpersonal skills and provided me with great insight on the clothing industry and how the mechanisms of retail work."
good,"A typical day at work, is watching a short video that helps employees see whats current and in style that helps you with ideas to sell it to customers."
good,- Open the store at 7am and work straight 8 hours.
good,Never a boring moment due to the varying customers that frequent the store. Great management that is very flexible.
good,"A typical day at American Eagle outfitters is fun, it's usually slow on weekdays and very busy on weekends. I learned a lot from being there, i gained a great work ethic, how to approach people, and be able to start conversations. My co-workers were very helpful, they showed me different approaches and strategies to every situation I was given or faced. The hardest part of working there was working night shifts when I had school the next day, but the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers leaving satisfied and happier than they came."
good,"A typical day at work, is easy going. Customers walk in, always greeted at the sign at the door. It's a welcoming feel environment. I've learned to become a better person while working there. The staff is great, a well balance feel."
good,Overall it was the best retail company I have worked for. The pay was very good. Opportunity to bonus monthly if you make your plan. Work with smart managers who know how to run a business. I loved that everyone on my team felt some bit of ownership in our store. It was our store. We were happy to be at work and challenge one another. The company invests so much in their employees training - all employees. They have multiple conferences and daily video training sessions for part-time staff. They are leading the retail world in demonstrating proper customer service and putting your customer first.
good,My experience at American Eagle has been amazing - our management is understanding when it comes to being a student. The colleagues I work with are amazing and create a great work environment!
good,Umm working here was fun I actually learned a lot here that I was then able to take and apply to my other jobs in the future. Started out as stock and in very little time moved up.
good,decent company. great for warehouse work. id recommend it to someone in there 20s just starting out. 15 a hour great food and great perks. best perks ive ever had. just need higher pay.

good,"Always having fun at work, to work in this environment you must be social, willing to learn and easygoing. Working at American Eagle has allowed me to gain confidence and learn valuable everyday skills."
good,"As a College student taking classes, management was very understanding of my responsibilities outside of work and allowed a lot of flexibility which I was very grateful for."
good,While working there I was able to sharpen my communication skills and gain more experience with customers and understanding how to balance working on tasks while servicing customers to not only satisfy them but the drive business.
good,"experiences specific to each location. when managed correctly, can become a hub for innovation and leadership grooming. if mismanaged, can rapidly devolve into a counter productive toxic culture"
good,"Great people, Wonderful environment, Lots of walking, Meeting new people, Learning life skills in organization, Packaging skills, flexibility on hours."
good,The work place was productive and humble environment with great management and helpful managers and employees. Everyone comes in excited to help a customer find their own fit in jeans or other clothing styles and accessories.
good,I was 16 when I first worked here it was kinda my second job since I had to babysit on the side but besides that American eagle wasn’t much of a bad place to work at but not amazing either.
good,Clothing retail could be fun at time american eagle is a great place to work i was seasonal and i enjoyed the little time i was there I enjoyed my co worker and customers
good,I really enjoyed working at American Eagle.. The management was very good at the store that I was at. The pay wasn'tt as good as I would have liked but we did get very good discounts
good,Typical day is the same but different. Get to meet new people that could impact others. You never know what kind of people you will meet and be able to help.
good,I believe everyone should work retail at some point in their life to humble themselves. Working at american eagle was great because its a great brand and they are inclusive with their fashion and also with their employees.
good,Loved the company culture. Worked for the company for 12 years. I only left because I found advancement else where. But have great admiration fir the brand and the people I met there.
good,"This was a temporarily job, my daily tasks included ensuring the shop floor is clean, and ready for customers. "
good,"Did not get trained to do anything, they just threw me on the floor and said to engage with customers. Staff was friendly and was always willing to help when I was lost."
good,"This job was very fun and they accommodated my work schedule so that I was able to go to school full-time. The discounts were amazing, and super beneficial for both work and life."
good,"During my two years at AEO, I gained a great deal of knowledge and experience and made some very positive connections.  The department's new Senior VP made drastic changes which included the elimination of several positions, causing me to lose mine.  The company did, however, help me out greatly with severance pay, resume help, and ensured that I leave on positive terms."
good,"- long hours (agreed to when I signed up)"
good,Pretty relaxed place to work.. Easy to understand tasks. Occasional fun team bonding events. Great management team. Fun weekend credit events & employee discounts are wonderful.
good,My job was To stock the Store Help  customers & Clean The Back Stock Room Some Days i would be on the Floor Helping Customers &  Some Days on the register
good,"It was a very company, although they did not offer much hours. overall they were very good with their employees and would recommended the younger generation to work there its a good starting place"
good,"I learned how to customer service people more. "
good,This job was a good part time job for while I was in high school. Pretty flexible with hours and they benefits of clothing discounts were very much worth it.
good,"Since I have to put 150 characters, and there's really not that much to say about American Eagle Outfitters, I'm just going to say it was a great college job."
good,So yeah much fun it was like hanging out with your friends everyday. Plus getting a great discount on cute clothes was a big bonus. I would recommend as a starter job
good,I learned alot by dealing with costumers and finding out how to capture they attention and how to pay attention to their needs.And how not to over talk the costumers.
good,"Extremely nice workers, whenever you needed help with something  there would be someone quickly to help you. Didn't really give you any hours. I always wanted to work more but they never needed as much help."
good,Helped with customer service and interpersonal and communication skills. Also helped with leadership and working as a team in a fast paced environment.
good,i dont have much to say because i worked there at such a young age but i can say i was kept for more then a year because of my work ethic . i always make sure i was doing my job and coming to work on time.
good,"Very fun, laid back place to work. Everyone that works there is very nice and supporting. A good place to work especially as a first job. very friendly staff."
good,"Great place to work. The culture created is very family orientated yet professional. Great opportunities for progression and self development."
good,Material handling of clothes was at ease each step was prepared with a scanner.  To be trained took an hour.  Management was vibrant and kept employee informed and updated.  Meetings would have fun facts read and stretches would be done every 6 hours.  Weekend shift was 12 and half hour days for three days.  Fast paced environment.
good,"I loved working there but needed more hours. The environment was friendly and they always had high expectations. They over staffed and then had to cut hours, causing a decrease in a lot of employment."
good,"The workplace culture is easy to thrive in and allows for positive critique every day. When leading the sales it can be easy to get caught up i workplace gossip instead of focusing on the customer, but American Eagles selling model creates an easy way to deter this from happening."
good,"not a stressful job, however it may be more slow-paced than anything. not much to do if business is slow, company is fun, employees make you feel like a part of the team instantly. not enough pay for what is needed to be done."
good,I have been working here for over a year and I like how its not stressful but I feel like I don't get paid enough. I basically do jobs that the managers do.
good,"Overall I think the company operates well but like a lot of retail stores, it places a lot of emphasis on the credit card and in store rewards card application."
good,"Great workplace. "
good,"The district was being reworked when, I was with this company so alot of changes, But it seemed all the changes were going to be for the best. Retails Stores are on a decline so they were changing with the times."
good,"Seemed like every pay check just went back to them because I was able to receive a discount when something new came out. Each time I worked, I was placed in a different room with a different job."
good,"As good as it gets for retail, makes work fun and dynamic. Management was dectn, great co workers and incentives for the store. Great products ans culture"
good,"Good call center environment. Very relaxed, and an open environment. Management was always looking out for advancement for their CSRs. The call center it self does not staff very many employees, however there are many great people that work here."
good,American Eagle Outfitters teaches and helps workers interact with a variety of customers while providing excellent customer service skills and making the customer feel welcomed and comfortable.
good,"Working at American eagle is a lot of fun to the right person. It is fast paced at times, and extremely slow at others. I wouldn’t recommend relying on this job alone to pay bills. It’s perfect for a little extra income, but nothing big.  as hours/shifts given is very limited. The discount it’s a too good to be true deal at times, and you’ll never want to pay full price for clothes again. The company works hard to make sure only good experiences occur for both the customers and the workers. This job can be very overwhelming on many occasions but is a really good confidence booster and gives you amazing exposure with customer service."
good,Working at American Eagle was great.  I met many different types of people and had to learn to communicate with ones that didn't speak English.  I built many friendships while working there. Some days were very busy and others were slightly busy.  It was a great job while I went to school.
good,Good place to work when it comes to out of work life balance. Pressure is there definitely but only the strong survive. Pay is also pretty good comparatively.
good,every since i started working at american eagle it has been nothing but great things!! It made me grow as a person and i have improved on my sales ever since
good,"Great Family atmosphere, really enjoy working there. I worked my way up from a part time employee into a management position. The company typically promotes from within."
good,"Set up associates for success with goals and check ins "
good,"It was really fun working here. Although the hours were always all over the place, they allowed you to request days off. I Think the training could have been better."
good,American Eagle offers so much in that you really gain a lot of experience in so many aspects in the roles people hold there. I have worked there for 2.5 years so far and I feel like I have learned more there than anywhere else.
good,Even though the hours and pay are low it's still a fun place to work. Everyone there is really nice and the managers are always willing to help. They are very understanding. It's a good first job for high schoolers I would say.
good,I love American eagle! I have always worked in child care and never in retail so this was a whole new ball game for me. I love clothes and I Love American Eagle brand. Love working with my coworkers and the customer. I am a people person so this job works for me!
good,typical day at work  well it all depends what area you work most of it is very laid back and easy going management was all right nothing really bad there
good,"As a retail job there are some things to be expected. AE certainly does all it can to ensure that their employees feel appreciated, with rewards given after years of service and a solid discount plan."
good,There's a lot to do day to day. On busy days especially on the weekends so much running back and forth for customers and also to keep appearances up for the store.
good,I was in charge of accommodating the clothing and helping the customers out with picking clothing. I was a sales representative and I loved what I did.
good,"It is a really good first job. The environment is great and it really makes you learn to be out there."
good,I really enjoyed my coworkers at my store. I loved the discounts that I received and my managers were fair and fun. It was sad when our store closed in Mason City.
good,"AEO was an Ok opportunity it was always slow on working days, but there were times we get customers and we have fun and help out customer within their needs."
good,"AE is a great retail job for someone looking to work part time while they are in school but after that, it becomes a dead end retail job. There was no room for advancement beyond a sales associate without relocation and even if you receive full time hours, you won't receive full time benefits without a manager title. The company does treat its employees well, though, with a 401k plan, amazingly unbeatable discounts, and a fun work environment. The AE managers gave me the opportunity to try out some basic visual merchandising once I had gained some tenure with my store which was not only fun, but made me feel valued."
good,I worked at American Eagle while I was in high school so it was fun for the most part. I was always lead cashier and I would manage the cash wrap every shift I was scheduled. I learned about the money flow in a retail company here.
good,i didn't have any bad memories or bad work ethics here i just wish it lasted longer. i had to leave after working here for a bit but my co workers were awesome and fun!
good,I was in charge of selling denim at AE. assisted by other colleagues when traffic became heavy. Assisted customers finding the right fit and style. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people from other countries and sharing the same interest in style.
good,No importa cuál sea tu posición hacen que se tenga el conocimiento correcto para todos
good,Good place to work especially if you're doing school and needing a job. You gain great customer service skills and general knowledge of a good work ethic.
good,The managers at American Eagle were so supportive and genuinely took interest in you and in the company.  They valued teamwork and team building to reach our goals.
good,A typical day at work is pretty usual. customers come in and out and i try to interact with every customer that walks in the store so it can help with the sales and so we can reach our goal for the week
good,"A typical day at work included selling clothes while interacting with customers and maintain displays of clothes throughout the store. "
good,Everyone played as a team member to perform adequately and get the job done. We all strive to go above and beyond to make sales and make the company grow as a whole.
good,A typical day at American Eagle is easy you get your truck loaded and you strap it down and hit the road. I have learned the in and out of hauling pipe and other oil field products. Management is decent. Work place culture is good you pretty much work without any supervision. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people on the road. The most enjoyable part of the job is being by yourself.
good,American Eagle taught me how to provide customers with exceptional customer service. The workplace culture is friendly where employees are encouraged to be their best selves.
good,I enjoyed working at American Eagle. I worked the floor and talked to customers. (Customer Serivce) I was only there seasonally but it was fun to work there. They just need better pay and beneifts.
good,"Everything here works as it should. Just an awesome work environment with awesome people.  We also have work to do to ensure that our processes aren't overly cumbersome as we grow. However, I have seen that management at Indeed does really try to consider feedback and make tangible improvements. I am confident that the company has the right culture and people to overcome any obstacles"
good,A place of work where you definitely have to like teamwork. Some holidays and weekends get quite wild. Sell as much as you can in the days you work...
good,American Eagle is a nice place to work at and it is fast paced depending on how many people come into the store and it can get busy. Some of the managers can be pushy and come off as standoffish at times. They hourly pay could've been better cause it's almost like they don't want to pay their employees and you don't get commission. The only time you'll get paid more is on holidays and you get paid time and a half. The co-workers I worked with were nice and fun to be around. Sometimes the managers can schedule for a day and not notify you and it makes you look bad on you're part because it'll make it seem as if your slacking off. The breaks are not long enough like their supposed to be they only give you 10 minute breaks which isn't long since you are standing on your feet all day. The employee discount are a plus you get a 60% discount on merchandise.
good,Stock the store and make sure all of the outgoing orders are completed throughout the day. Everyone that works there are teenagers so its pretty relaxed.
good,I have worked for a variety of managers in the 5 years I have worked for this company. They can make or break the entire job experience. Store managers have a lot of freedom to make their stores their own with different expectations and different training.
good,"Learned a lot about customer service, but felt like we were expected to work a lot harder than we got paid. A lot of times I was expected to stay longer if there was no one to take my shift."
good,"At American Eagle Outfitter, the management team have a strong camaraderie. We help one another for making the store to its standard. Guiding and teaching the sales associate work in a less stress and fun environment."
good,"Each shift I worked I was always the first one done, also picking up everyone else's slack although I didn't mind. It was an easy job. I found it enjoyable to be the first to see new products and help come up with new ideas."
good,"great company, enjoyed working for the last 15 years here.  would recommend "
good,This was a seasonal job for me during my senior year of High School. It was a fine job for someone just trying to get a little work experience while studying.
good,"Always carry and smile"
good,The workers in general would compete to see who was the best in what they were assigned. Overall the associates got along very well so there was no issue
good,"Very long hours and very competitive environment. Overall it was typical for a retail location. The goals set were high, but the team there often worked hand in hand to meet them."
good,work the shelves  stock clothes fix everything in the right order. hardest part is to satisfy the customer. the atmosphere was the most  enjoyable for mw.
good,"working at indigo was amazing, they knew the goal of the day and what was expected from all the workers. they knew how to set a goal and how to accomplish it within every shift."
good,Fun and exciting environment. Needed to balance helping customers with getting projects done on sales floor.  To many conference calls and micromanaging.
good,I would work about 8 hours 5 times a week and as a Lead Cashier I would be in charge of the entire front section of the store especially with the registers and I also made sure we were keeping up with our store overall goal. I would work in the fitting rooms as well witch gives me a great opportunity with one on one conversations with customers and making them feel like a unique experience.
good,"workplace culture is great, fun and peaceful "
good,"I loved working at American Eagle. I liked being able to talk to the customers. I learned how to sell a lot better to people, and my communication skills increased."
good,Very laid back and stress free enrivronment. Management motivates and encourages to work hard and still have fun. Management shows appreciation for employees and takes care of their own.
good,"American Eagle is a good place to get a little bit of work experience. They have good management and good customer service. My role was a temporary or seasonal position, meaning I only worked for them for the holiday season. A typical day for me was working 8:30 to 1:00, two days a week. The pay wasn't at all good only being minimum wage, but I was seasonal, so I expected as much. Although the pay wasn't good, sometimes hours did stack up if one employee had to call out and you were asked to fill in. Management was a good part of the atmosphere, they were always friendly and helpful. They never let anyone slack off, but they aren't hardcore about everything. Basic rules did apply. Help the customer first, no cellphones on the floor, have basic knowledge of the clothes to better help customers. No eating or drinking on the sales floor. No lounging around, always find something to do. The hardest part about the job is having to deal with multiple customers at once but other than that its a pretty standard workplace. The most enjoyable part of the workplace was the the time I got to spend with my fellow employees, everyone was enjoyable and kind."
good,"Working for AEO is a very fast paced, multitasking and quick problem solving work environment. I learned to improve my people/communicating skills and managing my time and others efficiently. It is a very multi cultural environment. The most challenging part is letting/seeing the staff go. The most enjoyable part of working for AEO is meeting new people and working in a family oriented environment."
good,Typical day is greeting customers and giving them customer service as soon as they walk in the door. Helping them find what they need and making sales. Cashiers would try to build profiles for customers interested in earning points as well as cashing them out as soon as possible to avoid lines. Fitting rooms would suggest to try on different items that go with items that the costumer chose to try on.
good,"My experience at American Eagle was smooth, quiet everyday. My job was very productive and close knit. The ability to communicate with the manager at any time was always a plus especially when I was a new and had many questions in the beginning."
good,"Fun environment, flexible schedule, great employee discount.  Can be very busy during holidays.  Depending on your mall hours, you may be asked to work midnight on Thanksgiving."
good,"Clock in, walk around the store room to make sure everything is in place, fold new items and put them out accordingly, greet each customer with a friendly greeting, help them find whatever item they are looking for and possibly build them an outfit off of what they want. "
good,"Answer customers’ questions about merchandise and advice customers on merchandise selection. Stamp, attach, or change price tags on merchandise, referring to price list. Stock shelves, racks, cases, and tables with new or transferred merchandise. Compare merchandise invoices to items actually received to ensure that shipments are correct. Itemize and total customer merchandise selection at checkout counter, using cash register, and accept cash or charge card for purchases."
good,American Eagle was a really fun position. Allthough at times you have to push hard for sales its worth it for the discount and we had a really good team of people.
good,This job was good job.  I worked it when I was in high school. I also worked it during the summer to save for my first car. I also worked the job my first year in college.
good,American Eagle was a good place to work especially if you was not looking for a place to go in as a career and needed flexible hours while in school. Working for american eagle was fun yet awarding.
good,"Great people, culture, and environment. However, little to no room for career advancement, salary increases, or travel outside of Pittsburgh. If you want to start a family and live in Pittsburgh then highly recommend."
good,Had a great experience.  lots of hours worked but was able to keep a good work life balance.  Schedule was somewhat flexible.  Holidays were always but that is to expected.
good,People might find that working for this company is hard but it can be. being on your feet all day can be stressful but they are very customer first driven
good,"Apart from the great clothes the store sales, its an overall amazing store. Music always playing which makes you have an upbeat attitude. At times it can get pretty busy, but it makes time go by fast."
good,Assisted customers with purchase options and recommended alternative purchasing options. Operated the cash registers and created floor displays and restocked the sales floor.
good,"Good working environment and benefits, retirement, healthcare, perks.  I'd recommend it for either an entry level job, or for someone who is looking for advancement opportunities."
good,"This is a great place to work. I recommend this if it is your first job! the discount is really nice and you meet new people everyday. There can be customers and employees that start drama though, I would be careful about that."
good,"I worked at American Eagle for 3 years and had a great time.  Being my first ever job, I was a little scared at first, but the warm and inviting culture AEO provides made for an easy transition.  The managers and staff were super friendly, and helped create a positive work environment.  I would recommend this company to anyone!"
good,It was a fun job i liked it a lot it paid good an the people was nice i didn't mind working there it helped me provide for my family. I was able to learn a lot.
good,This was a great place to work during college providing flexibility and opportunities to develop useful job skills. The management was great and was always helpful.
good,mostly stocking but great communication with customers. very diversed. my most enjoyable part of this job and every job i work for is the way i communicate with others. the fact that i can make someone feel comfortable to attend the store for what ever reason is a plus for me
good,"In this job it is not really hard to make friends, but it is kind of hard to keep up with the fast pace of the work, but you get the hang of things very quickly and the staff are very east to talk too."
good,"This job is good for people when they are in high school because it works well with their school schedule, this job is okay on the pay but it isn't that great."
good,I really enjoyed working here but it was only seasonal so I didn't get to stay. It was always a good time working there and it was a great environment to work in
good,"I love to work at American Eagle. The people I work with are amazing  and I wouldn't change anything about them. It is a great place to work at and has amazing flexibility. Although it is a good company to work for, I believe I have gone as far up as I would want to go in retail and I am now looking to pursue my career path further."
good,Management was very much organized and down to earth when it comes to sales and they made it easy for employees to learn the culture and idea of AEO. They are very good at teaching you sales skills.
good,A great workplace environment. Coworkers that turn in to family. Staff is friendly and very helpful when needed. Management lends support and guidance to all employees.
good,The inviting vibe of the establishment makes it much easier to enjoy your job. standing around selling clothes sounds drab. However America Eagle makes is something enjoyable.
good,There are no two days the same in the retail industry. The ability to handle ambiguity plays a key role in my current position. I have been able to excel in speaking to business acumen and learn how to change key performance indicators because of my career here.
good,Every day began with daily sales goals and how much money we needed to make based off of last years sales. I was responsible for making sure inventory made it to the sales floor as well as from the stock room. I was in charge of motivating the team members daily as well as making sure they were signing customers by email for discounts and news on new items coming soon.
good,"Just started and it is great! Win free items. We'll put together. The team is laid back as long as you do your work.  Customers really didn't speak a lot of English.  But, the store was forever busy."
good,"Management Staff is Amazing and great to work for!! It is always a fun environment to work in! Its a high demand store therefore, there is always something to do and your always keeping busy."
good,Easy to accumulate hours in the summer but there is a lot of work to be done. Some of which you may not know depending on your job description. You do not leave on time often.
good,"AEO is a great place to work.  Culture is everything.  Pay might not be on par with the industry, but where they lack in pay they make up in a multitude of other benefits/perks.  All depends on what you perceive as valuable."
good,"Easy going work atmosphere. Medium idle time."
good,"Loved the team I was working with, while still being able to have a relaxed environment. There was not much drama in the store I worked in but other locations are not as fortunate. I started at the end of March and by May the district manager wanted to promote me to a cashier lead."
good,"they are are uper nice there and always fun to have around you do cool bonding things like a n overnight and in the store adn you get to blast music, always fun"
good,"I worked as a seasonal employee, so the store was always messy. Although it was always busy, time flies when working throughout the day. I had a good time working there."
good,Did floorsets made sure looked clean and nice. Along with this I worked nights most of the time. Got along with the people and worked hard. Enjoy working here part time.
good,"I love working here. Amazing enviorment, coworkers that are ideal for a work place, lovely management.Super face paced job where almost all customers are returning from other stores and expect you to help them the way they would be helped at their local store."
good,"A normal day at work was busy, trying to make the required numbers in sales each day. The environment was friendly and everyone was nice. I worked there for years, so I did not have many problems with the company."
good,I was a cashier. I did floorsets. I also helped with doing customer service and helping our customers get the best shopping experience that they could get in their trip.
good,I was an assistant store manager and liked the culture there. employees were always willing to learn new things and help the store grow. great place to start as first work.
good,"Most of the employees are very friendly, some managers have a tendency to micromanage staff. The standards for the store are high, but there's some favoritism. Most of the staff is temporary, most problems come from the higher ups in corporate."
good,"American Eagle was an excellent start. It was not too fast-paced of a job, however teaches you how to deliver customer service quickly and efficiently, to give them the best shopping experience possible, You are taught ways to spot theft and stop and.or prevent it without offending customers, and how to understand body types and which clothing suits them best. Management is professional."
good,Working at American Eagle allows you to create better customer service skills and allows you to create better communication skills. It's an extremely laid back job if you follow all your tasks.
good,On top of selling weekly there were floor updates with no extra payroll which sometimes were whole floor changes.  At least twice a month there were required overnights for major floor changes.
good,"The workplace was very opening and friendly, I enjoy working in a place that was very welcoming to every person that worked there. Everyone was kind and polite to eachother"
good,The management team there is exceptional. They are very personable and helpful throughout my journey at AE. The hours are very flexible and helpful when I had two and three jobs at a time.
good,"Great place to have you first job and to learn and meet great people. I learned a great understanding of fashion, visuals, sales, and management before moving on."
good,"It was a fun working environment, I learned how to communicate with people and to work at a fast pace, I learned how to do things quickly and I loved being around clothes."
good,"I was only a seasonal employee for American Eagle. I worked for about 2 months, only on weekends, when it was busy, but everything is organized very well, and the expectations are pretty clear. If I had worked there longer, I would have been able to get a better idea of the overall work atmosphere."
good,It is really hot in the summer time but you are able to wear shorts.  You can wear light weight clothes and they have big fans.  The hours are great and the benefits are good.
good,Good starting job to get a high school student off to college or to get their feet wet in the field. There was room to move up but the spaces were limited. Moved on to bigger and better things. Great place if you are trying to get into retail management.
good,"american eagle was my first job at 16, and the world of retail was easily accessible through their management. they teach you new approaches to the retail world, all while being super helpful for you to have the opportunity to advance. it would be considered a difficult job if you don't have the drive to approach people or have the ambition to sell products, but overall the job was based around simple tasks"
good,"It was a great company, very family oriented until it was renamed to Envoy Air Inc.  Many of the same people are there and the great work ethic still exist."
good,"Management is made up of very fun individuals that all place high importance on productivity, efficiency and hard work. The job itself is satisfying work that keeps you busy and isn't too physically, emotionally or mentally challenging."
good,The life vs work balance is great. Job security and advancement opportunity is lower than I would like. Dress code and summer schedule are a great benefit.
good,American Eagle is a great place to work during Christmas season. The management is extremely friendly and compensation is met for the work . This workplace gives off a great vibe.
good,This is a great job for someone fresh out of high school that wants to start earning money. they are very flexible with the schedule. Its all about team work and customer servise
good,"I absolutely loved going into work at American Eagle. The enviroment was so relaxed, and the whole staff was like one giant family. Because of the constant flow of customers, being able to socialize with them and build relationships really enhanced my communication skills as a whole. The management was great and they were always so understanding and never made you feel pressured and uneasy. Overall, Great workplace"
good,"American Eagle is a fun, upbeat place to work if you like fashion & interacting with people. The hardest part of the job is how you handle a angry guest, you just have to remain professional and make them happy the best way you can."
good,American Eagle Fairview is a great place to work the people are always fun and helpful. The job is simple and enjoyable. In a day I serve customers by helping them find the perfect pair of jeans.
good,I'be been working for American Eagle since 2015. The environment is great  and filled with fun professional individuals. This is definitely the job for anyone seeking retail experience.
good,"la empresa te da oportunidades de crecimiento, los compañerps son muy amigables, es comodo trabajar porque e permiten usar jeans y tenis."
good,"Typical day of work where you try to sell as much as possible to earn the overtime. In this work I learned how to sell and defend myself in the world of sales, how to treat the customer and look for ways that the customer comes out satisfied of what I buy. The most difficult of this work were the night and closing shifts."
good,"Any one looking for a first job should definitely give this place some consideration. Flexible hours, good pay(for a retail job), and plenty of advancement opportunities are just some of the great perks of this job."
good,"American Eagle was a great company to work for. Super fun, and it allowed me to be outgoing and interact with people all day. One time during holiday, we have 32 men's cologne gift sets to sell. If we sold three, we'd win a prize. Within 3 hours, I sold every single gift set. My bosses were blown away with my sales skills, being that I had just started that week before. I had to stop working there simply because the hours became too much for me, since I'm a full time student."
good,American eagle is a great environment to work in and i love the employees. American eagle is a warm body place with many positions to advance within..
good,"Managers are fun and understanding. They work with your schedule, great job for students. You learn a lot about communication and multitasking. Customers can obviously be rude and sometimes mean, but management always takes your side as an employee and will back you up."
good,"I felt very welcome in this work environment. It was challenging at times when the store was busy but I had great training and co workers to help me out. I really enjoyed interacting with all of the customers and helping them with any questions that they may have had. Overall, I feel as though this retail experience was a great opportunity and has improved personal qualities about myself such as confidence, time management skills, independence etc."
good,"It was a great environment to work at with new people to work with. I learned how to do many things that helped me out in the real world. The co-workers were so cool and made plenty of friends, but the hardest part of the job was to recover the store after an extremely busy day. Only bad thing is that they had terrible management for the hour cuts because sometimes I ended up going to work at my scheduled time and they said they cut my hours and not giving me a heads up before time."
good,Overall experience was great. Excellent company definitely worth working for. From management to lower level compensation is good.
good,"Excelente trabajo y desarrollo corto plazo."
good,"un excellent travail , mais malheureusement je habite loin ."
good,This was a great place to work. It was a fast paced environment that was always busy and the culture was very positive. This company genuinely cares about the well being of its employees.
good,"Days are busy, guests are always asking questions"
good,"Nice place to work, management could be better organized, but o erall nice place to work to earn a living. Working with the people here was fun"
good,"Very friendly work place. Hands on. Easy going. Very nice discounts. I'll go consider going back with them. Pretty laid back , nice place to work"
good,Working at American Eagle was a beneficial experience as a first job. I met a lot of wonderful people and truly enjoyed a day of work and had a lot of fun on the job. There was a great discount for employees at 60% off. The managers were all very friendly and always doing their best to help me learn as much as possible. The hardest part of the job was definitely the commute but it was manageable. The managers were very lenient with my hours and always payed attention to my availability which was a plus.
good,"I have acquired various techniques and skills which enables me to handle a wide array of situations and interact with different people. I take pride in my ability to multi-task in high paced environment, interact with diverse people, and yet maintain a confident and pleasant disposition."
good,I would provide excellent customer service. Maintain and provide customer access to the fitting rooms. The customers and employees were nice. The enjoyable part was when there was a raffle the only way to enter was to sell a certain amount of products I won three times.
good,i have been working at american eagle for two years almost three now..through out my time being there i can say i am having a awesome time being there..Even tho management is not that great i still managed to be able to work with them..i have learned how to become a leader working here and learning how to deal with different personalities there
good,"I love my coworkers, they make job fun to be at. The management is good and are very efficient with work and we are great with customer service. I learned a lot."
good,"I had to give four stars because call-ins can be a pain, benefits not so great besides the discount. Overall, having been in 3 stores, the employees are fantastic, I have made so many friends. The only downside is it's retail and with that comes the on-off hours (some weeks are great where others you may only work a few hours)."
good,Everyone is very nice. The managers are always willing to help you and are there for any questions you may have. Other Associates are fun and great to work with. The environment is fast and fun. This is a great job for first timers or young adults!
good,i have learned how to better work with people and help them. i love helping people create a outfit that will make them feel good. i typically help people find new clothes and stock the store the management and co workers are great.
good,"Great place to work, co-workers and management communicate effectively and execute tasks on time. Everyone there gets along well, if there is an issue it is addressed immediately by management."
good,"Greeting , being the Lead cashier , and help in the fitting rooms . We also had to make sure we made our store daily goals . Worked as a team with stocking and inventory ."
good,"This job had you always on your feet, but gave you a real home like feel. Made each customer feel important and have a great sense of style by the time they left."
good,"Typical day work is folding clothes, cleaning the dressing rooms out, helping customers, and checking out people at the cash register. "
good,AEO is an incredible company to work for. It is like all retail environments with long working days and weekends. Being around customers with great style and working around fun people made going to work enjoyable. I was able to move up the working ladder in my store which allowed me to grow as a person and expand in many skill areas.
good,"On a typical day wt work I would start by making sure that the store and dressing room was clean and ready for use. Then, my duties for the remaining of the work day were to greet customers, them tell about our special offers, and make suggestions on clothing I think would fit them best."
good,the job provides many advancement opportunities and provides incredible benefits and discounts to its employees. My co-workers and management team were laid back and fun while still being able to accomplish the tasks at hand.
good,"I gained a wholesome of social, economic, and political skills. I worked in a fast paced environment and that was a typical day at work. I enjoyed the friendly environment."
good,I learned a lot about managing a team of people including a huge staff of new employees during Holiday; motivating all levels of management; and keeping myself motivated as well.
good,"There were many different sections to be placed per shift, for example one shift I would be strictly cash, the next shift I would be strictly sales and selling on the floor, another shift I could be working the fitting rooms. Lots of variety which is what made the job enjoyable. The co-workers were very tight knit and always stood by each others side."
good,"I learned a lot regarding customer service, selling and even keeping the store up to standard, I have also learned how to execute floorset instructions and it basically gives you more hours especially when you can work late."
good,"The American Eagle Outfitters that I worked for was a very enjoyable work place. I learned better promotion skills, as well as customer care. My co-workers were very unique individuals, they had various personalities that helped getting through the work day especially during our busiest times of the year. The hardest part of the job is when we were short handed and you would have to do a million jobs at one time, as well as trying to keep order and peace inside the store. A typical day at work would be the manager giving out everyone's assigned areas, putting our things in the locker, watching the video of the day, feeling out our work cards, and looking at our quota to reach for the day. Then starting to get things sold in the store that we possibly could that made the customers happy."
good,"I walk with pride in my uniform ready to answer questions inside and outside of the airport. Greet co-workers, go over details with Flight Crew Greet ea passenger warmly."
good,"I had a great time working at American Eagle Outfitters, i gained valuable retail experience and customer service skills which i could apply to my self in the coming future."
good,my workplace is a very fun and organized place to work. We greet customers and are very sociable with everyone. my co workers are very easy going and are easy to talk to. i  learned about the diversity of the customers. hardest part is the learning new skills so fast paced but once you learn it you get the hang of it. management is great. the most enjoyable part is that everyone comes in and loves their job and make the work environment something to look forward too.
good,managment is amazing I love almost everyone that I work with. They stress a lot about getting rewards cards and credit cards which are very hard to get when people say no the first time. Usually just clean around the store and get fitting rooms for customers but other than that the overall job is very simple.
good,"Clock in, start working on what the manager asks you to do, usually in the mornings you sweep the floor (including the fitting rooms) and if there are go backs you work on those. The hardest part of the job is probably not knowing about a product or not knowing how to order something for the customer online but you will learn as you go and your managers and co-workers can help you out..Don't be afraid to ask for help!! Everyone starts on square one,  If they get irritated don't let it get to you, Retail is a stressful job especially if you allow it to get to you personally. Customers are going to ask you questions that may come off silly to you but just answer them regardless. The most common question I've gotten is ""Is this on sale too? Because this one doesn't have the clearance price but this one over here does??"" Its pretty obvious that its on sale! But smile and answer them. Chose your battles.. Customer comes first. "
good,I worked the front rooms and greeted. I learned how to approach customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people.
good,"You'll enjoy working here! The co-workers are amazing and fun to be around. The pay is great, as well, as the benefits. Everything you need as far as training goes is provided by them."
good,Company is always open to new ideas and challenges. There a lot of room for growth. Company is full of energy. The company is growing international.
good,I enjoy it a lot i like coming each day to work and doing my goals for the day. I like doing everything ahead of time and getting my work done as i'm suppose to.
good,"Assisted customers with purchases"
good,"Boas habilidades de comunicacao. Boas capacidade de negociacao. Bom gestor de pessoas. Trabalhar bem com os outros. E se um projector precisava de apenas uma pessoa para lidar com isso eu tambem tenho a capacidade de fazer o trabalho por mm mesmo, se necessario."
good,"I was mainly in charge of running the front of the store.  This means that for every customer that came in I would great them, tell them about the sales and help them when need be."
good,Can be crazy but there is always something interesting. Everyone is friendly and fun to be around. Holidays and big sale days can be tough but there will always be something to do.
good,Terrible work-life balance but it's an ok entry-level job.  I enjoyed my time working for them.  Upper management was a bit shady.
good,"I had a great time working here. Making a connection with the customer is pretty easy with with me because I do get along with pretty much anybody. I have a nice and polite personality that i do use to win a customer over so that i can encourage them to add more clothes in order to make more sales, which means my metrics will be high."
good,"A typical day at work was being greeted with friendly staff. I worked either on the sales floor, cash registers, or fitting rooms. I learned a lot about handling money and customer service. The management and my co-workers were both for the most part very good. The hardest part about the job was closing on busy days as the store would be a mess sometimes. The most enjoyable part was working with customers and providing them the most comfortable shopping experience."
good,"A typical day at American Eagle consisted of putting every customer first, the managers know how to have fun and still get the job done. The co-workers are average, you have the hard workers and the ""do the minimum to get by"" workers. The hardest part of my job was helping customer's who are just looking to give you a hard time."
good,always busy since i was hired during the holiday season. i had to show customers to fitting rooms and assist them in the sizes in the clothes that the store was selling
good,"very positive work environment! I have another part time job and they were very accommodating in scheduling around those hours, as they were different every week. Really great management, expectations are clear and training is thorough."
good,Nice seasonal job don't expect lot of hours you wont get it. Watch the managers make sue get all your hours and you are in the system.
good,"depending on your co-workers its a really great place to work. There were good days and bad days there, but it was never too bad of a day. The customers can be a bit much at times, but generally its a great place."
good,"I learnt a lot about working in sales. I provided advice to customers about personal style, assisted in organizing the store, and completed transactions."
good,"Very friendly and freely spirited environment. Mainly folding and organizing clothes. Not difficult very easy and understandable tasks. As well has a flexible schedule, will work alongside of you ."
good,"Fun place to work"
good,"Amazing work experience.  I worked with Buckle while in college, and was able to work with them after college.  It was an incredible experience and I am happy that I got the chance to work with them."
good,fun place. see people from all around the world.the ceo will come every month to say hello and check up with us.he would treat us to lunch and snacks for doing a good job.
good,"I was always happy to come to work here. My management team was understanding, communicative, and active on the floor. My co-workers were fun and enthusiastic. I always had something to do and the clientele was great. The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers and management, I got to work with the best people. The hardest part of the job was when we didn't have many customers, we would unpack shipment of stock the floor which was fine, but I more enjoyed interacting with customers."
good,"Through the years, American Eagle has always proved to be an amazing company to work for. The fluctuating hours have been a challenge around the holidays as most of my family lives out of state and I do wish the pay were more competitive with other companies and industries, but this pales in comparison to how much I have enjoyed coaching and training people, and then seeing them use that training on a daily basis. Through teaching and being taught myself, I have learned a lot, and continue to grow during every shift I spend with the amazing team at this store."
good,Staff is very friendly and very supportive with new employees. Management is great as well. Very understanding and a very knowledgeable workplace
good,"A typical day at work for me was cleaning out the dressing rooms, restocking shelves and getting the customers. I learned how to communicate with the customers to figure out their needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was finding outfits for the customers."
good,American Eagle is a great retail job.  The sales are easy to learn and they don't work off of commission.  I mostly enjoyed floor sets and dressing bustforms in this position though.  The great amount of detail and perfection I had to learn for this position helps me in any other detail oriented position now.  The team I worked with also truly cared about each employee and who they were outside of work as well as a co-worker.
good,"I really enjoyed working in American Eagle worked in most stores, such as Soho 34st 14st and also Penn station. I grew a lot in this kind of environment such as how to customer service, resolve problems, especially training new co-worker which was an amazing experience to share my knowledge with them and to become a great team together. The management was great they were always there to hear you out and to help in my development. I pretty much enjoyed everything and the obstacles were only stepping stones to be greater."
good,"A typical day at AE is working the register, while helping out customers find what they need, by  putting the customer first. Also making sure the store is in order, menaing making sure all the cloths are folded the right way and in size order. "
good,"A typical day at work would be when I come in I look over the days shipping report so I can plan according. I would then assign tasks to any co-op student we have at the time (typically 3), then I'd walk the floor to take note of what product can be filled, in case I receive it. I then receive and process shipment, fill out the appropriate paper work. I've learned how to be efficient, and able to alter my work plan quickly depending on what the day brings."
good,"I've learned how to fold clothing, properly stock items, tag items and operate the cash register. Management is great, understanding and make sure you're in a healthy and safe environment."
good,Very dependent on the community for its traffic to base whether it will be a slow or fast pace day. A wonderful place to be yourself and feel comfortable with the work atmosphere. Constantly on your feet. There is always something to do and/or learn.
good,You usually just have to cash out coustomers and advice them how a certain product looks on them.
good,"-I've learned how to treat and respect customers "
good,Very detail oriented with the way they wanted the clothes to be folding.
good,"I like working here. I do the overnight floor sets, so I only have to work once a month, if that. It is fun and everyone has been wonderful. It is an easy way to make a little extra money."
good,"A typical day of work at American Eagle Outfitters is always putting new information to work. The managers are all highly motivated to better all the employees and advance their skills. Over the last year of working here has taught me many socializing/selling skills I wouldn't have learned in a class environment and has bettered me for it. In the particular store I work in, my co-workers are all involved in helping each other to make it a pleasant experience for both customers and employees alike.  Of course in retail, you have expect part-time is the norm which always makes it the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of this job for me has been learning selling techniques that I mold to my own style which is what makes a good sales person in any company."
good,A typically day at work was getting the store clean and organize before it would open. I learned how to meet customers needs and help them leave the store happy.
good,"Upbeat, fun place to work, great culture, inviting, always wanted to be at work. Holidays were tough but extremely flexible."
good,"American Eagle Outfitters is the perfect place of employment for young college students who do not necessarily rely on this job's paycheck to get by financially. The management team was fair, upbeat, and flexible. The rate of pay could be better, but the employee discount and employee discount specials are great and I was able to build an amazing wardrobe at great prices with clothes that are well made and have lasted 3 to 5 years+. Overall a great employment experience."
good,"Enjoyed the discounts and the staff, very accommodating when it came scheduling"
good,a great experience but a lot of stress to accomplish the job.
good,Love working at American Eagle with the right management. They always make everything fun while working hard with customers.
good,I quit for Hostess but they didn't keep me I'm trying to go back In November
good,"American Eagle is really trying to drive the movement of ""real"" marketing. Starting with the Aerie brand and now all of AEO, American Eagle is doing their part to teach how ""I'm perfect"" is because we are imperfect. "
good,"American Eagle Outfitters was the most fun I had while working a job. Receiving and processing stock enabled me to develop my organization skills and fine-tune my time management. Working only part time, the stock room would fall into chaos in the hands of sales associates and it was important to not only bring in new merchandise but keep the current stock organized as well."
good,The company strives for excellence and does its best to make sure the work environment is fair and fun.  I enjoyed the atmosphere of every manager is a manager.  From Assistant to Sales Lead you were given keys with the mindset that you could make logical business decisions.
good,"One shift consists of changing multiple displays throughout the store. Everyone has a set, individual job to do, sometimes two or three at a time. We are all willing to help one another complete a task if needed. I find that changing the displays higher up on a wall is the most difficult part. The best part is that we listen to great music throughout the shift."
good,"Make sure shelves are stocked and full, Cashier work, make sure all money is accounted for. Help customers with any problem that may come up and find a quick solution, and make our goal is made by the end of the day. I've learn to use our technology, how to scan items from stock and view what is in stock and if it  needs to be filled. Management is great they are very understanding of employees, they set goals for the company and its employees and make sure we meet them. Co workers do a lot of teamwork we help each other out when needed and make sure that a project gets done. I enjoy working with customers, every time a new customer comes in it's a new opportunity to start something different. To see what techniques can work with different people. Hardest part is the hours I would like to get more and have a stable schedule."
good,"I could not get enough of this place.  the people were great and it was so much joy putting in all the effort into the job, and work mainly.  I learned a lot.  marketing is a great tool in getting into peoples minds."
good,"A typical  day at work at American Eagle revolves around spot filling and items that are low, taking stock checks and getting them done quickly and occasionally doing Fill The Floor. FTF is where you use an iPod with AE software in it to view what customers have bought and needs to be replenished throughout the store. All in all, it is a good experience."
good,"At American Eagle it is an extremely busy, non-stop moving environment. You are not just a cashier at this job, you are also doing a lot of customer service helping the customers find items and outfits. There is a lot of cleaning and tidying of the store due to the large amount of customers throughout the day. Some shifts are floor set shifts, This includes some of the associates to do an overnight shift where we change product throughout the entire store, do marketing and change signage as well. All co-workers get along which makes the work environment light. The hardest part of the job is the overnight floor sets. There is a lot of heavy lifting and climbing involved, but we get it done. The management team is fairy good. But the most enjoyable part about the job is that we al get along and this helps us get through all the busy days and  nights we work."
good,"I had to deal with a lot of difficult customers, but that was the only downside. I enjoyed communicating and helping different customers each day."
good,I liked working there. It was a fun environment! Good crew. The job was very easy. Stocking wasnt a task at all. Once explained to you how to stock it becomes second nature.
good,Learned the importance of customer service and what it is like to be an assistant manager. Realized the importance of monitoring KPIs and how they affect business. Learned how to forecast and understand traffic trends.
good,"•Maintain vendor relations."
good,"Working at American Eagle is a steady pace job. I associate with customers and provide help if needed. I straighten clothes and make sure the store is a clean environment. At the end of the day, I clean the whole store and put everything away. I learned many things from this job. I learned how to speak to customers, I received more training on the registers, how to work in fast-paced environments, and how to be a good associate overall. My managers and co-workers are extremely amazing. They treat me with great respect when I first joined this company and they still do. They help me, they motivate me, and treat me like I am one of them. There is no hard part in my job. My managers and co-workers taught me well enough to do things on my own and to finish things. The most enjoyable part of this job is just working there."
good,"A typical day starts off slow, just fix up a few shelves and put clothes where they belong. I learned how to deal with all kinds of customers, and all types of attitudes. My managers were very friendly and very helpful if i had a question or concern. My co-workers also were very helpful if i needed them to either help me or show me how to do or fix something. The hardest part of the job was telling the customers that we didn't have either their size or style they were looking for.The most enjoyable part about the job was seeing the customer's faces when you helped them get what they wanted."
good,"- cashier"
good,AE is a great place to work due to the fellow mechanics on my night shift.
good,"American Eagle provides a comfortable environment for employees. I was able to learn multiple skills and constantly working on different tasks. Compensation and moving up in the company is weak, but managers are very flexible and supportive. Hours every week vary. One week when it is busy I might work 20-30 hours, while another week I might work only 6 hours. I enjoyed always meeting new co-workers and working in different parts of the store."
good,"A typical day at work for me is taking Stock checks, helping customers, replenishing the sales floor and stock rooms and meeting  and engaging with new people from all over the country."
good,The work environment at AE is great as well as work/life balance. It is an upbeat atmosphere with a never ending supply of things to do to keep you busy. My only disappointment with the job is that lack of training for management positions for further advancement with the company.
good,"A typical day at work would be ringing up customers or fixing up the floor, making sure everything is where it should be. I had good assistant managers to look up to and guide me. Great team! Only thing that would be irritating is if there wasn't a lot of help on the registers, lines would get long."
good,Great environment to work at. Every day going into work was a fun and exciting day to look forward to.
good,Typical days include taking calls from multiple customers and helping them with questions about their orders placed and edd (estimated date of delivery). I learned a lot of the time that people are just as curious about what they want to buy as to what it is you're going to sale them. My manager helped me to grow so much as a CSSR that my weekly scores climbed to 100% nearly every time while I was there. The hardest part of the job was having to tell a person that their order had to be canceled due to suspicious activity with their account. The most enjoyable part of my time with this company was being able to interact with people and help them out.
good,You always have something to do or someone to talk to. The management team at the Asheville store was what made working for the company worthwhile.
good,"Customer Assistance"
good,The energy at American Eagle is always high and fun. The live off of a vibrant experience throughout the whole day.

good,Getting shipment processed and put on the sales floor ready for the day. Had a very good Asst. M team and co-workers were nice and fun to work with. Nothing to hard to say about the job the most enjoyable part was the people.
good,"Inventory Control, Stocking, Shift lead trainer. Learned a lot about the products. Managed the Store and Worked as a Team. The hardest part was not being able to make the goal for the day."
good,The most enjoyable part about my job is making each and every customer happy with their experience at American Eagle.
good,"American Eagle is very business savvy. They monitor and know every aspect of their business, which any good business does.  The have done a great job of supporting the store managers and management teams as much as possible.  Most of the upper management genuinely seems to care about people that work for them.  That is what I enjoyed most about the job.  The hardest part of the job was the constant (but yet not having any pattern) changing of promotions/sales.  It was at times difficult to flex schedules based on the last minute promotional changes.  I always accomplished what needed to be done, but was not always set up for success to do so."
good,"Come in, fold clothes, help customers, attend dressing rooms. Learned about retail, especially how to effectively run a clothing store. Managers were good, they were very competent and always fun. "
good,"This was probably the most enjoyable job I have had.  Always had something to do, the staff was easy to get along with, and the pay was pretty competitive."
good,American Eagle was a very easy place to work. They were times of stress when the store was overrun with customers but everything always worked out with the help of the staff. Management was excellent and very helpful- always willing to answer a question no matter how small. The hardest part was the very end of the day when the entire store had to be reassembled for the next shopping day. The most enjoyable part was having customers thank me for my services.
good,"not bad, worked hourly in high school. nice people, great company. "
good,American Eagle was a great place to work while I was in school. They worked around my class and exam hours without a fuss.
good,"A typical day consists of assisting customers and maintaining appearance of the store. I learned organization and customer relations, and how to move past personal social barriers to achieve sales goals. management is very considerate and helpful. co workers do well in working together. hardest part of the job was maintaining the appearance of the store. best part was the atmosphere of the store."

good,was a great job. have no complaints. enjoyed working with the customers and managment was great.
good,enjoyable place to be and good place to gian experience in sales
good,The workload is never too much to handle. You are always informed about upcoming events. The benefits make it hard to leave.
good,"American Eagle holds wonderful potential for students looking to hold a part-time job in their extra time. It promotes positive work experiences by hiring young adults looking to improve themselves within the retail world. A.E. gives employees a chance to challenge themselves within a fast growing community, however there is a small issue with job security. I was hired on a non-seasonal basis but due to over-staffind I was asked, along with other hired at the same time, to come back for the back to school season. Besides this small inconvenience I really enjoyed working at American Eagle as it provided me with an excellent place to expand my retail experience."
good,It was a fun experience and I learned a lot from the experience.
good,Great Management and fun staff to work with. Well organized and clean.

good,You learn critical thinking with dealing with customers and coming with idea to how fix a problem.
good,"I started out at American Eagle Outfitters as a part time sales associate. I left as an assistant manager. I would still be there if my job transfered when I moved. It had a great atmosphere and they were big on quality of life. I do have to say it was the best job I had. I learned a lot about scheduling, payroll, and daily balancing which has helped a lot when it came to getting my current job as HR Assistant and Payroll Clerk. My one down side is rotating shifts."
good,great place to work if you like meeting new people then this is the place for you
good,"Fun place to work, good place to learn about retail and sales"
good,Great employees! Feels like a family. Fun job with ok benefits. Few hours though.
good,"I was hired through a temp agency to work for American Eagles Outfitters distribution center for the holidays. My shift was mon-thur 4pm - 230am, 4 10hr days. I enjoyed working here because I was a merchandise picker, so I worked by myself and at my own pace. Because I was a temp I had to wear a temp bag for all the employees to see so it felt like a pledge pin. Several employees were very rude because I was a temp. They would get pleasure talking about temps and how they would quit by lunch time."
good,"If you want to work in a fun upbeat atmosphere look no further, American Eagle is the company for you. As a sales associate you get to come in contact with a variety of interesting people. The managers are really cool and approachable which is a PLUS. The best part about this job is you get to wear whatever you want to work, well almost. I must say it was one of my favorite jobs."
good,"This job may have some awful app that schedules people on the wrong days, but they give you a 60% discount so that makes it harder for me to complain."
good,i have been at american eagle for 3 years and i have had some good days and i have had some bad but all of them have been making me a better person overall
good,"I was a sales associate, and would be in charge of folding merchandise, assisting customers, stocking items, and cashiering. I learned how to operate cashier systems, different fold types for clothing, and how to work in a setting that demanded teamwork 100% of the time. Management was very supportive, and was always there to help both employees and customers. The overall atmosphere in the store was great."
good,Well I am 60 years old and I love the place. One small problem is lack of communication! I love the challenge it provides me.when I leave I leave tired and satisfied. Good job American Eagle!!!!
good,Typical day at work is you service customers finding out what there wants and needs. You maintain the store to make sure merchandise is not on the floor and you want to make it presentable for customers that walk by. I have learned that you have to be patient with the customers and have to cater towards their liking. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with coworkers as they share their own style and personality that can influence yourself and as well as potential customers in the future.
good,It was difficult to move up in the company without being able to relocate to another store far away. However there are plenty of AE's all across the country so if you're willing to move this really wouldn't be a problem for you.
good,American eagle was very fun to work for because of the closeness within the staff. Working overnight floor sets can be tiring but they are fun if you enjoying tasking and visuals.
good,Overall it’s a great company to develop customer service skills and work under pressure. It also teaches you how to work as a team and how rewarding it is to do so.
good,There is a very laid back feel working there. A lot of friendly people I had a great trainer. The perks and benefits were great as well as the insurance. I also really enjoyed the shifts that they have available.
good,"the job is the same as any other retail job. It really depends on the environment of the people around you. the customers aren't great, mostly tweens."
good,"A typical day at American Eagle is usually kind of busy, depending on what you’re doing. If you are just straightening up the store it can be pretty slow but if you are working fitting rooms/register then it typically can go by quickly depending on the day as well. I learned how to stay calm in high stress situation and learned very quickly how to multitask (meaning doing 3+ jobs at once). I also learned how to stay calm and nice when people are being rude. Management can be a tricky topic because it depends on the manger. Typically it’s fine but expect communications to be lost somewhere as well. Also work culture can be tricky as well, sometimes it feels very clicks when you’re new but other times you feel welcomed. The most enjoyable part of my job is sharing my love of fashion with others and meeting new people. P"
good,"Working at American Eagle is fun especially the co-workers, they make the job fun. The job is not a load work, it’s basically just folding jeans, checking out the customers, and helping the customers and fulfilling their needs."
good,They take good care of you and treat you like a big family and they always there to help you improve your work skills and always answer your questions for you and they were good at safety
good,"A great place to work as a first job. The atmosphere is always enjoyable and the workers are easy to get along with. The job itself is not difficult, therefore making it enjoyable. The pay and sticking to scheduling availabilities are the only issues."
good,"assisting customers, moving product around in order to increase sales, coaching and developing direct reports in the moment, touchbases with management team, shipment and stocking"
good,A good job for college students the staff is great & work around your schedules. Very good with giving requested days off. As an employee the discounts are great.
good,"American Eagle provided a challenging yet interesting environment to work in. I always looked forward to work because I always found a  well structured, fast paced job that pushed me out of my comfort zone. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I had helped a customer find something that they love."
good,"When I first started at American Eagle I was very pleased with my managers at the time. However, after my store manager left things started to fall apart and become almost unbearable. The hours have always been somewhat inconsistent but they only got worse after my manager left. So long as you have the right management and do your job properly it's a fun place to work."
good,"Greeting Customers, helping customers find products, unlocking changing rooms for customers, making sure products remain stocked in colors and sizes, folding items left in changing rooms or thrown on the merchandise tables, facilitating online orders, and working the register."
good,Working at AE was certainly interesting in the sense that no two customers are the same! I definitely had a great time selling products to customers according to their needs.
good,"The team I had at the AEO San Ysidro location was energetic, dedicated and ALL recruited by me personally. "
good,"I can't speak for all AEO stores, but the one I worked at had amazing management and it was a great place to work. It was a perfect part-time job for a full time student like me."
good,I loved working here. The only problem I had with management is when the new manager came in. He didn’t like any other managers and he caused drama. But other than that it was a great place to work!
good,Fun place to work at if you're someone who needs a job but can't work a whole ton. They're super flexible with your availability and will work around your schedule. The shifts can be as short as 4 hours which is great for school nights where you can't work for very long
good,puedes desenvolverte en el área en que te sientas mejor siempre aprendes cosas nuevas
good,"I usually arrive to work and touch base with the lead that is usually on their way out as I clock in."
good,Working at American Eagle helped me learn customer service skills. I also learned how to work in as a team in order to be more time efficient. All the managers and employees were friendly.
good,I learned customer service and how to help people of all ages finding clothes. I enjoyed the interactions because it made work not boring. It was a very eventful job.
good,relaxed casual workplace.they always work well with others. there really isn't a hard thing about the job. just competitive for everyone to get more sales and most personal reviews
good,If you like working with people this is the job for you. The skills you gain with working with people to solved their fashion needs are invaluable as it helps add to problem solving.
good,"The best part about working at American Eagle are definitely the discounts! You get 3 items for 80% off and 12 items for 60% off every month. You can even use any dollar off coupons that you get from your AEOconnected rewards account on top of your discount as well as a free pair of jeans for every 5 you purchase. Loved everyone I worked with! They made work a lot more enjoyable. Management was really hands on and were always finding new ways to motivate the team. At this particular location loyalty is what got you the most hours. The better you were at signing people up for rewards card and credit cards the more hours you got. Make a mistake (show up late, call in last minute, etc) and you get less hours the week after. Which is fair in my opinion. But for sure as a sales associate the most you get is 25 hours per week. We also constantly had contests that motivated everyone to sell sell sell. It kept everyone on their toes and giving good customer service. Over all, I loved working there."
good,I currently work at American Eagle. The store is a good store I am able to interact with people that are from out the country. I also enjoy learning new things about clothing.
good,"A typical day at work would be filling the floor product making it look full and presentable. The people I work with are some great people. I have and continue to learn a lot from them. The management team is always willing to work with you and help you grow and be a great worker. They always want what is best for you. Normally days are very paced, trying to get a lot done in little time. Which would most likely be the most difficult part; getting everything done with the time you have. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friends I have made and to know that they are forever friends."
good,"American Eagle was a good place to work. They give good discounts to employees, and praise you for your successes. It is retail, so you need to be prepared to have a selling mentality, and AE really pushed their employees to meet quotas, which the Managers enforce (can be a bit stressful)."
good,always fun at work
good,"Typical work day: 4-5 hour shift"
good,"Really enjoyed my time here. For a retail job, it wasn't bad at all. the managers weren't horrible and were friendly and hardworking. My co-workers were great as well, apart from one guy (There's always one)"
good,"I worked at Union Square and I loved it!  It was fun working and helping customers find their perfect pair of jeans. However, management and the lack of hours forced me to end my time there."
good,Working at American Eagle Outfitters was an overall pleasurable experience. I would recommend working at American Eagle to those who are interested in doing so.
good,"It was another typical day at work in AEO because I was dealing with customers and putting prices on the items and what I learned was how to fold the shirts and the workplace culture there was timely fashioned. The most enjoyable part of my job there is cleaning the mirrors and windows, folding jeans, and going to the back room to help with the cargo and packages."
good,"Working at AEO was one interesting job. We got to interact with people from other countries but black Friday weekend was CRAZY. They're open 24/7 that weekend and didn't even give us a bonus from all the money they made. We worked our tail off, but I did it for the experience."
good,"This place in retail teaches you a lot. You learn how to do things in fast pace, multitask, and learn how to speak to people. I highly enjoy the atmosphere."
good,"pick or pack orders either on the retail side, or consumer online orders. Learning is based on personal goals, and management is willing to produce opportunities to advance. Multi-cultural environment. Hardest part of job is standing in one place during slow seasons. The most enjoyable part of the job is challenging one's self to exceed production expectations."
good,"Relax atmosphere, enjoy co-workers, great employee discount.. You should be tolerable of people destroying your perfect folded clothes you spent hours folding."
good,"In support services have to go to each flight to look for people that need speciale service such as wheelchairs or a child traveling by himself. In the Control office was in charge of administrative stuff. And as a Flight attendant, making sure that all my passengers have the best and comfortable flight."
good,"I've acutely learned a lot from working at American Eagle. I believe they're a great place to learn about retail. Management is great , all my mangers are really dedicated to their job. Our culture is very diverse and I love it."
good,"Working as a floor setter required about three nights in a row out of each month to remove old product from the sales floor and replace it with new product. The nights can get very late, but the job is simple."
good,"American Eagle is a fun place to work. Providing excellent customer service is their specialty. If you are looking for employment that works with your schedule, and have a desire to build genuine and unique relationships with customers, American Eagle is the place for you."
good,"While working there i was continuously tested on my customer service skills and continuously improved on areas i had previously thought i was good at. The  staff there were amazing, my only qualm is that i wouldn't get enough hours"
good,"Don't let the jeans and t-shirts fool you, AEO hires incredibly talented, smart, and innovative individuals who bring incredible depth to the workplace. The work environment  in the corporate offices is definitely relaxed in terms of dress code and atmosphere, but the culture encourages an entrepreneurial spirit - allowing associates to carve their own path to success, with leader support.  Being in the retail industry, no two days are the same - so as business ebbs between experiences success and challenges, so does your day-to-day work - ebbing between reading/reacting and celebrating/duplicating efforts. "
good,"I've never worked with a friendlier group of people. The general vibe of the company is quite casual, but everyone pitches in when necessary and gets the work done."
good,"Lo que mas aprendi en este trabajo es la manera de socializar con la gente asi como el trabajar largas jornadas, aprendi a como corregir problemas en el trabajo y a tratar de entenderlas y resolverlos con la mayor delicadez y profesionalismo."
good,"Very consistent work day. Hardest part of the day was lifting boxes and most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers in the stock room. Worked 4-6 hour shifts, once or twice a day."
good,"My managers were great, it was easy to work when I needed to, and I enjoyed the working culture it had. Management was great as they would always try to do what was best for the employees while still doing whats best for the store as well. I would absolutely recommend working there part time if needed."
good,"Its a good place to work with good hours. I can't say much because I only worked there for a couple of weeks but the discount is great. However, the few weeks I was there I loved it"
good,"Really nice, friendly and welcoming employees and managers. It's a pretty easy job but you do have to be on your feet for a while, nothing that some bandages can't help you out with. Great place to be working if you're really good with talking to people and a very helpful person."
good,"Show up"
good,"I enjoyed working at American Eagle, it was a good experience because it was a face paced environment when behind the counter. It was a friendly environment with a welcoming staff."
good,"Quel plaisir de travailler pour AE, j'apprécie le dynamisme, l'ecoute et l'entraide de Chaque personnes qui travaillent pour la compagnie."
good,I worked at American Eagle for 4 years and really enjoyed my time there. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for retail experience. I worked at AE during high school and was able to effectively balance my schooling with my work schedule and management was more than willing to accommodate my various schedules.
good,"The work place and environment are very inviting and welcoming especially as a new employee. I look forward to working shifts because I have friendships and relations with my managers. There are some inconsistencies in expectations that both the management and the district managers have for associates to accomplish. There also seems to be a string of communication that is cut, because things are not always making there way down the grapevine quickly and correctly."
good,"Fast paced environment where you are encouraged to take on multiple tasks at once, but company believes in growth and promotion from within"
good,It's a great place to start off for a first job. Creates tremendous work ethic and unbelievable people skills . Managers are understanding and patient
good,The team I work with works from 9p.m.- 5 a.m. to switch the store around and give it a fresh look each month.  Everyone is friendly and fun to work with.
good,You go in and clock and the go to the back and get ready for whatever position that you're going to be working in. From there you do your job and might help out other stuff and management is very relaxed as long as you do your work.
good,"Working with AEO was enlightening to know just how much the retail workers really care about each customer. "
good,I was rewarded by being able to move up quickly within two years due to work worn and dedication.  That is not the case with many other companies.
good,learned how important team building is and the most enjoyable part of working here is the appreciation people have when you help them.
good,"it's a perfect environment  for anybody. I know because, just for the few month that i have there, i have improved a lot technically."
good,"I love my management team, they are amazing. Its such a great environment to work in. Everyone is very easy going and fun."
good,You will learn a lot buy working in merchandise and meet a lot of defront pepole hours are not the grate you go home very late at night when you close the store.
good,"American Eagle has a friendly environment and good people to work with, all are nice and easy to get along with. A typical work day includes arriving at the store around 8 am, to sweep, and vacuum the floors and fitting rooms, wipe all of the mirrors and windows in the front display with Windex. After the store opens someone will be assigned to the fitting rooms, registers, etc., so we can use team selling and cooperation. For example, if someone has a customer in the fittings rooms and they are ready to check out, we will  use out headsets to tell each other this sort of thing. The best thing about working here is being friends first with our customers and getting to know all sorts of people on the sales floor."
good,"- How to interact with customers and deliver excellent customer service."
good,"my typical work day would be working on stock/shipment and also working on the sales  floor, I enjoy doing both I learn a lot especially how to put censors on clothes and also how to approach costumers in a nicely manner or making sure I fulfill there needs. my managers are very understanding and help full. my co-workers are like family to me and they helped me understand everything I had to do at the job when I first started. the hardest part of my job was the transition from my old job to working in retail, I enjoy my job because of my co-workers."
good,I worked here for two years and worked on and off until I became a manager myself here and I liked most of the people(can't like them all) went through a few managers some stupid and some amazing. i would for sure work for AE again.
good,"I was just a cashier. It wasnt too bad of a place to work if it's a summer/school job. Most of the people are pretty cool, customers are like most other customers (annoying and always think you're to blame). The pay isn't that good, but like I said it's just as a part time kind of job while you finish school or need a summer job. Decent discount sometimes depending on the time of year."
good,"Easy to move up in management, always promoting with-in.  Everyone is always smiling and exciting to work.  great place if you love to dress fashionable"
good,Fun environment where you can gain a lot of customer service skills and also be able to advance yourself to a better position within a reasonable time period. Very friendly staff in a very good area.
good,A typical day at American Eagle is a fun and enjoyable day. You become like family with your coworkers. Numbers are important but you also learn to always put the customer first and make then number one.
good,"The work is easy, employees are easy to get along with, and every day makes the job that much better. The management and leaders are easy going people and helpful when it comes to any and all situation they can help with."
good,"I love to remain busy. It gives me a purpose. Working here there was never a slow day. If there weren't any customers, we were still doing some type of work. I loved it. My favorite thing was organizing anything and everything. It made work simple when things got chaotic. I learned many organizing tips that I still use today."
good,"Great fun happening place, with awesome fashion ideas and growth opportunity. I love that being the stock manager meant I could get the first look at all the newest apparel. Another great place to met amazing people and it being in Florida sometimes meant seeing a famous person or two . Truly an awesome experience, wish I would not have had to move so soon."
good,"- Maintaining a customer focused team from associates to assistant   managers."
good,"An early shift started around 4-5 am in the Baggage Area, where you would have to separate the bags based on the morning flights. Other responsibilities were to do a security check around the aircraft, as well as a FOD check. Besides scanning and loading / offloading baggage, It wasn't hard to get into a rythm of things. "
good,"There is no typical day at AEO, every day is different and unique filled with various tasks and goals to accomplish. The best thing is that no one person does one specific thing, we all help out to what the business demands despite positions."
good,"American Eagle was my first job and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I was usually on the morning shift and I would come in with a manager and clean and then open the store. The management was very good at recognizing your progress and pushing you to get better. My co-workers were very easy to get along with and were always willing to help me out. I was later promoted to Lead cashier and I loved training new employees and helping them as my other co-workers had helped me. The hardest part of the job was probably attempting to help co-workers and customers at time, but this was a big part of the learning experience and it taught me to balance tasks."
good,"I learned so much more about being a Manager, and how to balance life and working full-time. Management could have been a little better, and cared for their coworkers more."
good,"Clock in start folding and stocking clothes/merchandise. Work the floor,assisting customers,cash out purchases,dressed the mannequins."
good,"My typical day at work was to come in and stock the store before it opened. I helped customers find the items they were searching for. I also worked behind the counter and rang people up and made sure if there was a sale going on that I took off the correct percentage."
good,"Great company to work for, and co-workers are like family. Fun place to work, easy to move up if you work hard. Customers are great and so is the employee discount. High volume store, which means that you are constantly busy, which is great."
good,the hardest part was learning how to do everything without instructions. i learned how to work with all customers and how to replenish the stocks.
good,I truly value the ways in which the store-level as well as upper management wish to see their staff grow. I very quickly learned how to appropriately interact with customers to make their experience both enjoyable and successful.
good,I gain a lot of communication and retail  business skills while working for this company. It was my very first retail job and I enjoyed being part of the AEO styling team.
good,As soon as I walk in the store I go into the office and learn about the new product. Next I see what kind of sales the store needs to make per day. I grab my walkie talkie and call the supervisor of the day to see what my responsibilities are. I begin by restocking and organizing the store. Next I greet customers to find their necessities and make sure they have an excellent experience from when they walk in until they check out. If the store gets busy I hop on the cash register and greet the customers and excite them about their choices. I also make sure if the customer grabbed the wrong size I call one of the other associates on the sales floor to get the customer what they need.
good,"Attract amazing, smart talent"
good,People are very friendly but given hours are just not enough so i had to look for another job. But other than that everything went pretty well
good,At American Eagle I did just about everything. Anything that the managers could put me in charge to help promote the stores abilities then they would. I did anything in my ability to help them. them managers ran things very smooth and made many games so that working there was more enjoyable. I learned many things all the way from how to lead better all the way on how to just be more productive overall while doing my jobs at once.
good,"This coming summer I would be working as a sales associate at American Eagle for three years. A typical day at work would be greeting and assisting customers in finding the right outfit that makes them feel and look good. From my experience thus far, I have gained many sales techniques to ensure selling, as well as dealing with a diverse group of people in terms of customer and co-workers. The management ensures that their employers get the recognition they deserve for doing a great job. What can be difficult at times is dealing with unruly customers, but it is imperative to always put a smile on your face and treat them with the utmost respect- after all this is a customer service related job. The most enjoyable part is working with friendly people, and gaining more work related experience."
good,Had a lot of fun working stock here at AE. Loved the managers and staff were super friendly. I would work here again. fast paced and the hardest part about the job is lifting the boxes
good,I liked the management. Fit my learning style to get out there and do it hands-on.
good,"A typical day at work involved more than a copious amount of one on one customer interaction where I helped with anything from product information to opinions on style. "
good,"working on the ramp was a fun job. it was fun working with planes, met some famous people going on the planes. it was a lot of work lifting bags, a lot of walking and standing, lots of baggage to load and unload,"
good,"An awesome place to work with great perks, such as employee discounts and clothing allowance. The management for the most part was great to work for but like any other jobs has its down time."
good,"Everyone I've encountered at this company, managers and associates, have been nothing but nice.They're friendly and if you have any questions, they're are more than happy to help. Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you have satisfied a customer."
good,Typically it's you and an Assistant Manager. You both work as cashier and sales associate. The co-workers are mostly fun people with great personalities. The managers act as fun and enjoyable as the other co-workers. The hardest part of the job are the days with the customer traffic is low and you have no one to assist or help.
good,"There is always plenty of people around to help you, and easy polices to follow, and great place to learn great customer service skills."
good,"Never not a new day at work. Different people, different problems; same people, same problems. Mainly, and vastly customer servicing is key to existing. "
good,"-Typical day/night working there was easy, all that was need was to clean my section relatively clean, and presentable. Assist customers in finding what they need, and reaching hourly store goals in sales."
good,"The American Eagle store was just started and I had to help build the new franchise. I had to get the boxes from the truck and help sort the clothes in storage. My co-workers were great people, who were cool to work with. A typical day at work was about seven through nine hours of work. I would be in the front of the store, in the men's department, or the discount department. I would assist my co-workers and customers. I would fold clothes and bring out clothing if it's low on stock. The hardest part of the job was standing up all the time. The management was above average, because some managers would place me on the work schedule; when I had open houses for colleges. Some managers would work with you and help me out. The were cool and fun to work under and enjoy them. The most enjoyable part of my job would be talking to my co-workers and customers. I learned a lot about how retail works and how to handle different customers. I also had to learn that you have to have proof of information for all managers. One manager told the company not to hire me anymore, because I miss days; when I was at colleges. I went to the store and the other managers side with me, but that one manager told me I should have give him the information."
good,"A typical day at work is help customer find the items they need or want in our store or online, getting customer fitting room and cashing them out. I learned how to do window displays and how to dress there type of mannequins. My co-works were helpful it I did not know something and we all worked well together. I feel the hardest part of my job was not have shipments on time for our customers wants. I enjoyed help my customer find things they like and dress them for a special occasion."
good,"mentored and taught management skills to younger management team. Sold and planned floor moves ,resets and accomplished sales goal needed for their business plan ."
good,Working at American Eagle has made me feel extremely valued as an employee. They have done as much as they can to work with me on creating my schedule around school and other various activities. Everyone at American Eagle gets along and has a great time working together.
good,American Eagle has great customer service. It is an easy-going job but can be hectic at times depending the day it is. Everyone that works there are very friendly people.
good,I had a great 10 years at AE.  I recommend this company to anyone looking for great benefits and job security.
good,Fantastic work environment with a lot of opportunity to advance
good,"I learned from working at American Eagle Warehouse that I was  not a warehouse worker. I enjoyed working four ten hour days and having the weekends off, and I also enjoyed the long breaks during the day. What I did not like about the job is that it was very repetitive; it was very easy to get bored."
good,"I had an amazing time working at American Eagle. It wasn't an easy place to work in because their were goals needed to be set during the day of the time I was working. However, the challenge was great for me because I am a person who doesn't like to work in a place that is easy. I had amazing coworkers and the management skills were great. They were also fair with me. I started off as a seasonal and then they kept me for part time in their store. However due to family issues I had to leave. I had a great time in that store."
good,"I might be on registers, running the fitting rooms, who knows! Every day is different. Every day I have to push myself because there's always something to be done and always some way I can help save the day. I can't imagine my life without the benefit of the coaching of my wonderful managers, or the friendship of all the many co-workers I've had. It's relentless and it's taken a lot out of me, sure, yet I've grown and gained so much since I've started there. 'LIVE YOUR LIFE'? I've definitely lived it at American Eagle Outfitters."
good,"After graduating with my MSEd, I went on a few interviews for a School Counselor position. I found out quickly that, as one of over three hundred applicants in an education system that was constantly battling for funding, that I wasn't a prime candidate having just graduated. I turned down a position at a private college that I regretted for years, and eventually went to work at BOCES. However, I was working on a grant (that would inevitably end) and I was not getting the student contact that I desired. So, after working full-time at AEO while putting myself through school with 20 weekly internship hours, I realized that I couldn't have done it if I didn't love it... and the part that I loved was the teaching. As I stepped up to the Store Manager position, work took on a new meaning. It wasn't about me doing the work. It was about me teaching others to do the work. I worked with the employees that had a goal to be a leader- anywhere, someday, and the kids who were happy with their first job. I didn't just teach them how to fold shirts and use the register- I taught them ethics, courtesy, honesty, goal setting, and every other piece of business that I thought would apply anywhere in life. We set records, celebrated with my homemade cupcakes, and then beat ourselves again. We helped people because we felt good doing it- a smile when a mom fit into jeans that weren't ""mom jeans,"" a nervous laugh from a girl in a dress going on a first date, the fist pump from the 'tween who finally fit into a shirt not from the kid's store. My employees worked their butts off for me, and liked"
good,"There is never a dull day here! Love the environment, the work, and the people!"
good,"team becomes like family, great work environment - lots of room for advancement and development - not a lot of work/life balance"
good,"This job is a bit strict with their high selling goals along with other things, so it's sort of nice going to other jobs where they expect less of you, but you are prepared for almost anything they throw at you."
good,"I loved working for American Eagle, I had the opportunity to work with a very diverse team and take lead on many of the activities that I was in charge of on a daily bases. Overall this experience helped enrich my selling capabilities and also learning to work with a diverse team."
good,Love working at American Eagle. Management is amazing. Working around ones personal schedule be well. I have had very few bad experiences working here.
good,Working at American Eagle is fun and interesting. The other employees are easy to get along with. The environment allows you to be yourself and to express yourself.
good,There is lots of time to talk with other staff. Everyone worked well together when completing tasks. The job procedures were clear and easy. Management was friendly and understanding. The pace is typically slow unless there is a major ale or holiday like black Friday. All staff must assist in some of the floor sets which happen after the store closes and last until after 1 am. This is when we re-stock and change the entire store setting. My house burned down when working here and they sent my family and me at least $300.00 worth of clothes.
good,My typical day at work was always good I felt welcomed. It’s very good company and I really liked it as my first job. Culture is good. I enjoyed working with the people.
good,Over the past four months I have developed relationships with many of American Eagle’s employees (all of which are fantastic). The job is fast paced yet fun.
good,"It’s a good first retail job. Only 4 hour shifts and not many hours. Good benefits include contests that result in associates getting a free item. Discounts include 60% on your gender clothes , 40% on the other gender , and 25% on clearance."
good,Love working at American eagle only issue is I would like more hours than 1 shift every 2-3 weeks. American eagle teaches you so much on focusing on the customer while also doing your best to make a sale. Great place to grow and expand your knowledge on retail.
good,Working at American Eagle Outfitters has helped me develop sales and customer service skills. My associates and managers are always willing to help one another. Management is supportive and always pushing us to be our best.
good,"I volunteered there for the Black Friday event last fall, the supervisor was welcoming as were the workers and they are not afraid to teach you and correct you. it is a very nice organization to work will 10/10 work there again."
good,"Loved working at American eagle, as well as with all the people I worked with. The hours were okay, but definitely could have been better. The cookstown mall was usually always busy so you had something to do"
good,Mangers were very expressive and communicated well. Most time didn't feel like work Discount was amazing. Enjoyed coming in everyday. Break was fair. Coworkers were easy to vide with.
good,"I currently work as a Cashier lead at AEO and I have to say, this is easily the healthiest retail enviroment I have worked in thus far. My entire district is under a DM who has a real way with communication that breeds the desire to grow as opposed to pushing the need to grow, and it shows in the performance of the majority of our employees."
good,"Absolutely love working with American Eagle. My management team and employees have become some of my best friends and support me like crazy. While business is competitive and retail can be a crazy environment, I believe American Eagle provides a safe space for improvement and acknowledgement of one's skills."
good,The mangement was good sometime they was not as understanding but I explained more they got a better understanding they allowed me to have time off when I was pregnant
good,With this job you’ll mainly be takkkng with customers and keeping the store stocked and neat. As a first job this really helps with opening you up and working on you customer service skills.
good,Great place to work. The benefits and pay are great. I love the management and my coworkers. Overall I had a great experience at American Eagle Outfitters.
good,"Every day started with a briefing on the promotions and the goals for the day. I learned how to sell to a variety of people, and work with a variety of people. My managers were all very goal driven, yet laid back. The hardest part of the job was to try and sell the customer more than they wanted, but it's a skill I managed to pick up.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people around my own age, so it was very easy to relate to them and build relationships."
good,I worked for American Eagle Airlines. I worked at the gate loading and offloading flights. Rerouted passengers that misconnected from their flight. Management was always helpful.
good,Loved working for American Eagle. I worked there for 3 years and enjoyed it so much! Great company to work for and also great company to get promoted with. Only downfall is they don't keep managers for long
good,I spent 5 years with the company starting out at an associate and and then to stock lead to key holder and then assistant manager in around 2.5 years. The training for each position was very thorough and a lot of the things you need to know are well documented in easily accessable binders. The company prefers to promote from within which makes it difficult on the ones being promoted only because it’s frowned upon for associates and managers to hang out after hours.
good,"They work with your hours and actually talk to you about your daily goals. You basically determine what kind of worker you are, and they place you accordingly."
good,American eagle is the first job I ever had. It’s a very different and enjoyable environemt although we work at an extremely fast pace. Great experience
good,"Management is very immature in my opinion, but great employees. Typical day is cleaning, folding clothes, helping customers, styling customers, helping with stock, ect."
good,I love working at American Eagle management was very nice and respectful. The energy going to work everyday was very refreshing. I enjoyed my short time working there
good,I was a manager here for a year and it was typically a fun place to work. Holiday time got pretty stressful since managers typically had to deal with the angry customers. Overall the company rewards its associates pretty well for all their hard work.
good,The job is a relaxed environment. People work with you and are constantly working with you so that the task could get completed. The managers are super cool.
good,"Know the merchandise. "
good,Alta motivación para el personal y grandes recompensas. Quien tiene ganas de crecer lo logra fácilmente. Producto de alta calidad y equipo excepcional.
good,Young attitude that fits the teen target audience well.  Progressive management that continually pushed entire teams to contribute to success.  Good workplace to grow.
good,"I typical day is usually spent helping customers, organizing and folding clothes, cleaning the store. The hardest part of the job is when it gets busy."
good,"It's nice just stressful at times. The best part is winning free outfits and seeing peoples faces light up when u help them. I love the job, it's by the best one i've had."
good,Fantastic team skills & great learning enviornment. 1st job I ever had and I fell in live with retail eversince. Nice coworkers you can get along with.
good,"American Eagle Outfitters is truly the cream of the crop. You can't get a better workplace with the lively, energetic music and great benefits. The company holds meetings for the employees to discuss sales and objectives for upcoming months. AEO has an amazing workplace but there is a lot of micromanagement, even when employees are doing their jobs correctly. Managers watch you very closely."
good,"its a relaxing place to work. not too many stresses that are to be had. management makes it easier to work. will gladly help you advance to the next level. will answer all questions that you have. a wonderful environment to be apart of. it's a good steady pace. not too busy but also not too slow. there are, however, busier days and slower days, but in the slower days is when you get to do more task oriented work that you wouldn't get to on another day."
good,"Trabajar en AEO es una excelente experiencia, conoces gente nueva de tu edad, y el ambiente laborar es increible. Y te dan excelente accesibilidad en tus horarios de algun otro trabajo y escuela."
good,"Fun place to work. Awesome company culture, allowing for a close bond between associates. Company values its employees and rewards them for hard work and success."
good,"American Eagle was a great place to work. I worked their over a year, The people were great and overall I really loved the company. I learned more over the year to how to really sell a product, they key to selling is getting to know the customer."
good,My first job as a sales associate and this crew that I worked with was more then welcoming. They trained me farely quick and taught me to have fun while at work with the customers. Very good company and will always be a favorite of mine.
good,"Loved the management, always honest and reliable. Understandable when it comes to family problems/emergencies. It's always easy to keep a smile on your face when you love everyone around and that's what you get when you work at AE"
good,"American Eagle was a great job to get into the field of retail. I learned many useful skills such as attentive customer service, efficiency, and independence."
good,great place to work. management was great and so are co workers. it was a great experience for my first job. your always busy and great customers.
good,"i enjoyed working for this company very much, i was never starved for work and made a real connection with my managers. there is plenty of room for advacement if you show that you are willing to work hard"
good,Management makes sure everything is in place and the employees are doing their jobs. You have to make sure your section is set up the way it's supposed to be. You have to offer rewards cards and the AEO credit card
good,Great place to work also had its ups and downs at times. Managers were very helpful at times but also had the downs to them as well
good,"Loved being in the clothe industrey and upbeat environment with younger groups of customers. I loved most of it. The down side was having to constantly watch people throw a stack of clothes you just folded neatly, all over the place."
good,"I personally, enjoy working with AE for various reasons. The environment is fun loving and comfortable. Greeting customers and getting to know each one is fun when in fitting rooms. I would definitely recommend for teens 17+."
good,"Always motivated to be the best I can be."
good,Fun work place and working alongside with my colleagues and learning from them. Enjoy working with customers and solving problems when necessary. And also enjoy the variety of job duties I perform each day.
good,I had a fun experience working here. I started as a sales associate which wasn't all that great for me since I'm not a big fan of pressuring people to buy things they don't need. But that mostly when supervisors were riding you about sales. Other times its rewarding when you're honestly supplying information when they want to buy something. It's a little bit of a double edge sword. The assistant managers were really cool also at the store in Santa Monica.
good,"Great place to work with awesome co-workers. The management and organization is phenomenal. The hardest part about the job is getting more hours to work, the pay is minimal. But the working environment makes working enjoyable."
good,"Worked at American Eagle for many years and definitely appreciate  the opportunity and knowledge I'm taking from this job. I started only as a 16 year old girl during Holiday Season , and was capable of working my way up into the management team . As an assistant store manager , I learned the business and what makes it work . Developed myself In the operations portion , hiring and development , as well as  store merchandising and visuals . AE is a company who really focuses on their employees and developing them , I will always be thankful to the company , but I feel now I'm ready to expand my knowledge and grow in other aspects outside of American Eagle."
good,"On weekends the store tends to get really busy so sometimes I feel like it was a drag. But with the awesome and energetic co-workers I had, work flew by quick. I learnt that customers are of high importance in retail because they are the ones that can bring our sale up by purchasing our products. The hardest part about this job is when a customer is looking for a specific product or item which we no longer carry or have already sold out. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people, learning about how retail runs, and building up experience."
good,"Co-workers and other management were good. A typical work day was helping customers, re-ticketing items, restocking from back stock, scheduling and supervising employees, bank deposits,etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers. The hardest part of the job was resetting floor sets."
good,"I loved coming to work everyday, everyone was so much fun to be around."
good,Hands on training and the people are just great! The corporate culture is relaxed while there is a major feeling of being a part of a team. The company mission statement is clear and it seems that all employees really are there to help people find jobs in their own way. Expectations and goals are high but the support is present to help all employees achieve set goals. Management wants to help their teams succeed.
good,"A typical day working at American Eagle, is pretty straight forward. Greeting customers, helping them out with what they need, keeping the store organized and clean.The cash register isn't as hard as it seems it took me at least a week to get the hang of it on my own. The hardest thing about the job is getting people signed up for rewards cards or an American Eagle credit card. Every time customers hear anything with card in it they automatically say no, but there are customers that would like to open up accounts. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with your co-workers that's what makes the job fun if everyone thinks and acts positive you will love your job."
good,"American Eagle was a very popular and fast paced job. I like working there because it was more of a comfort zone for me and their were constantly people in and out of the store. When it came it rush hours, the store could be a little hectic but I loved it because it gave me something to do all the time. There was never a dull moment at American Eagle."
good,"It was a well kept up company, people were nice, there were ways to improve you selling skills"
good,"American Eagle is a fun, fast paced work environment that focus on working well with customers on a daily basis."
good,"Working for AE can be very fun. Management is mostly friendly and understanding, however there are the select few that can mess it all up (as in any job)"
good,american eagle is a fun and great first job experience. i learn a lot working in american eagle and you learn to work and meet people from around the world. you learn a lot working from the cloth to how to operate a cash register.
good,"Everyday at work we are given the daily goals and must set our own personal goals for the shift. We learn how to provide the best customer service daily in a fast paced diverse environment and are currently challenged with turning browsing customers into buying customers, demonstrating product knowledge to ensure customer satisfaction and keeping up with meeting the daily goals. Management and the co-workers are very good at working as a team and fun to be around with. Overall they are excellent employees. The hardest part of the job would probably be maintaining the store organized while ensuring complete customer satisfaction and the most enjoyable would be being challenged daily and meeting new people."
good,"AE is a great place to work. Amazing staff, fun customers and top notch management. I have learned so many skills that have helped me in my retail sales area due to training at AE. I enjoyed all my years at AE."
good,"A typical day consisted of clocking in at work, watching a video that was required then summarizing the video with my supervisor in a timely fashion. Next I would then reorganize shelfs, maintain the fitting rooms, give personal testimony on clothing and recommend what would be best for individual costumers. Also, if something the costumer wanted that wasn't available in stores I would proceed to find it at the nearest AEO or order it online and have it shipped to their house. Usually AEO was always filled with costumers therefore there wasn't much time to work and talk with co-workers unless it was break. The most enjoyable part of my job would be talking to the costumers and recommending something else or adding on when I maintained the fitting rooms. However, the hardest part of my job would be reorganizing the clearance section it took plenty of time, fast-paced work and multitasking."
good,I learned alot working with this company when I started back in HS. They were a company that has taught me alot about bussiness
good,"Best co-workers, best managers, products are priced decently, excellent growth with advancement, and just an overall great job to start off in sales for experience. The corporate bureaucracy and district management is terrible."
good,Dealing with clothes for the first time was good experience for me. Helping customers with fashion advice as well.
good,"American Eagle is awesome! The people are great, the discounts are even better, and the target market that shops there is phenomenal!! I love American Eagle."
good,This was a great job. I met new people everyday. The job was just too far from my house so I had to leave. I loved the job overall. The management was amazing. They always tried to work with you and help you out the most they can.
good,"One of the easiest and least demanding jobs I've ever worked,"
good,"The management is awesome at Coconut Point. Everyone that works there is very nice and welcoming and the managers are young, which means they understand the work and life balance of a teenager. I strongly recommend working for this company. A typical day is working the cash register and dressing rooms along with folding and putting away clothes. Perfect job for a high school or college student."
good,Wonderful set of people to work for. Can’t say enough good things about management and corporate partners. Amazing environment to grow your professional careers
good,If you love their clothes you will love working here. They have great discounts for employees plus they treat employees very well. Everyday is always busy and there is always something to do so you will never get bored standing around.
good,"A typical day for is, signing in then I would get my key and our walky talky and go to one of the day mangers to see what would be doing for today’s shift. If it’s a Friday or the weekend we would have our meeting and watch AEO channel to get all of the new information on the store. "
good,"I really have enjoyed working at AE. It really helped me apply practical skills I learned other places and taught me teamwork. The pay isn't the best, but the hours were perfect to me and I felt that management was understanding of challenges."
good,"Everyone at American Eagle Outfiters are enthusiastic about going to work. It is full of energy and excitement. It is a great place to learn if you are just entering the workforce. A daily tutorial is available to help increase performance and prepare for the work environment. There are sales promotion contest with rewards. And, they will work with your school schedule. Althoug there is no place to sit down. Be prepared to stay on your feet and look good."
good,I enjoyed working at American eagle because it was such a fun place to work. The people and management just made you feel very comfortable with everyone around you
good,Working here allows me to push myself in a way i never thought i was able to do. I was known for being a hard worker and able to motivate others well.
good,"Excelente trabajo en equipo"
good,"A typical day at work includes your typical retail experience. Management is understanding, focused, fun, and supportive. Workplace culture is fast-paced, light, fun, and creative. The most enjoyable part of the job includes either working on individual sales or store projects."
good,"Loved the team I worked with, work was a lot of fun everyday. Managed to move into new positioned and learn new skills. Employee discount was a plus. Overall was a good first job in retail."
good,Enjoyed this job while I had it. Always had fun while doing overnight merchandise and enjoyed my manager. Always made things fun and would understand my schedule.
good,Management was lacking but overall great place to work for an entry level job. I learned how to communicate with customers in an effective way. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer interaction.
good,"I really enjoyed my time working with American Eagle. The pay was amazing, as well as the benefits. I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I wasn't specifically hired, with a number of others,  to get things back in order..only to be laid of two weeks later. However, if they would have kept me, im sure i would have put my future into this job."
good,Regularly making customers feels welcomed and bonding with them . Most customers that feel a connection with the workers are more likely to buy products.
good,"This was my first job and a great steeping stone that launched my working career. This job taught me about financial stability, customer interactions, and co worker interactions. It was also my first supervising job."
good,"I was hired as a Visual Merchandiser 2 months ago. It was meant to be a Secondary job and that is what I made of it. I do not suggest this job as a primary job. The hours vary drastically between 25-35 hours a week/4-9 hours a day depending on the daily shipment (there is no shipment on weekends which automatically gives you the weekends off btw :)  unless there is floor plan changes which are done overnight or weekends. The management team is EXTREMELLY understanding and able to work around your schedule/availability, which is perfect for someone who has another job already or plan to start a second job. "
good,"the managers there would talk about their employees, so just don't get to comfortable with them.Other than that the employees were nice, and the work was maintainable."
good,"I look forward to go to work the next day. AE is a great place to work in which you are in a high energy atmosphere, and a fast paced environment. However, I will say I one of the biggest cons is that I do not get many shifts."
good,"I have worked at 2 different American Eagle Outfitters, and experienced completely opposite ends of the spectrum. I started in one of the most successful stores in my region. The management was amazing and acted like a true team. In my second AEO as a manager-in-training, I became immersed in a very different work environment. A ruthless and competitive job, where before it was a team environment."
good,"American Eagle Outfitters is a great place for a first time worker to gain some experience. You have the possibility of getting cashier experience, as well as stock which I think teaches valuable skills like multitasking and you learn to work in a fast pace environment."
good,"I worked here for over a year and a half and really enjoyed it. I enjoyed helping the customers find what they needed, and getting the store back into tip top shape. The videos that you watch before each shift can be a little cheesy, and the pressure to sign people up for credit cards they don't want was my least favorite part. The discounts they offer to employees however are fantastic. The management at my particular store was awesome, I got along with all of the managers. You get a handful of rude customers in a day but the nice ones outweigh the bad."
good,"Working at American eagle was good, I came across so many different people, speaking so many different languages. My co workers were very helpful, whenever I was confused about something they were always there to help. My managers always was on top of me, letting me know what I need to work on. I learned how to deal with customers that doesn't really speak English well. Patience is the key."
good,Never had a bad day in 3 years. Great environment where you are respected and treated like family. Lots of opportunities to develop yourself and move up.
good,"This place was good to work at to gain experience, but the number of hours I got to work were very less, I had to always ask for more hours. I rarely go to see the branch manager"
good,"American Eagle was a fun place to work and I love their brand! The staff was pretty cool and laid back but still very professional. The only thing I didn't particularly care for was the ""on call scheduling"". Normally I would have a set schedule so it would be easier for me to make arrangements for a ride to work. However, the on call scheduling was more so hit and miss and became inconvenient for me due to the distance I had to commute on such short notice."
good,"American Eagle Outfitters is a wonderful place to work. Its workers are diverse and lead well. There are enjoyable parts such as contests, free items, and learning how to make an everyday persons day. The hardest part of the job is probably keeping the store orderly and clean after a long day. With the right group of people, American Eagle Outfitters is a reasonably good cultured, and fun place to work."
good,"Enjoyable. Always found something to do. Very amiable workers, remained friendly. Managers were helpful and did well training new hires."
good,"une journée typique est de dire les promotions aux clients, les aider dans leur recherche, faire le ménage. L'aspect positif est que c'est agréable de pouvoir aider les gens dans leur recherche et de les guider. Il n'y a pas vraiment d'aspect négatif"
good,"Wonderful company to work for. Many benefits, even better people. The company truly cares about it's people. They invest in their people and their people give them a return on their investment."
good,"Best experience to date!  Always a fun day were the biggest expectation is to be YOU! Great growth and development opportunities in every corner. Its all about the customer and you feel great doing it!"
good,"Working as an assistant manager in a retail environment allows one to wear ""many hats."" A typical work day would begin from business plans, paperwork, scheduling, cash handling, and end at customer servicing and reorganizing the store for the next day. The company overall has a ""Customer First"" goal and is able to trump competition with this alone. Working from a Sales Associate to Assistant Manager position allowed me to see many aspects of this company. Working with other members of the management team of all types and ages allowed me to grow as a manager and a member of the working world. The most difficult part of this job would be the attempt to please each customer fully within just a brief visit, which is outweighed by the satisfaction of an impressed, loyal, and successful customer service attempt."
good,"On a typical day at work, we focused on Customer Service, whether that being just asking the customer if they needed help or putting together outfits or add-ons for the customer.  I appreciated the employee-empowerment that the managers allowed Sales Associates to have.  During Floor Set, or when we have to put merchandise according to planogram, managers and employees both used innovative and creative skills to accomplish the common goal.  At AE, I've learned time management, customer service, audit support, merchandise sales, training, etc.  Overall, American Eagle has been a great place to work."
good,Working for this company allowed me to express my talents and creative outlook with fashion. Working with people is always an opportunity that I look forward to.
good,Working at AEO taught me invaluable skills such as people skills. I learnt how to deal with difficult customers and organisation skills. The managers were very understanding and excellent role models. My co-workers too were helpful in difficult situations. I didn't find anything in particular to be difficult but my most enjoyable experience was helping customers by going the extra mile.
good,there was never a typical day at work at American eagle sure my job was always the same but the people I was helping would make it different each day which is why I loved this job so much. I learned how to be a top salesman here and how to interact with each customer differently just by looking at them so I could get them to buy as much as possible before the left the store. my managers as well as my co-workers made the job fun and made it more fell like a family then managers and co-workers. the hardest part of my job was deffinetly keeping up with every customer when there were hundreds of customers in the store as well as keeping the store clean. the most enjoyable part of my job was being the best at what I did and who I worked for.
good,I was an assistant manager and loved it. The only reason i left the company was because i had my daughter and became a stay at home mom for a couple years. last year i went back just a a part timer and had a blast!
good,Not a bad place to work if the would pay more. Love the work schedule.
good,"i liked this job, it was fun, everyone got along well and you get treated with respect, its a really good place to work, plus you get a reallly good discount"
good,"Working at a American Eagle Outfitters further advanced my experience in the customer service field. The managers and the co-workers give an extreme sense of belonging and it felt more like I was working with friends. Before working at AEO, I was a long-time customer to this brand. Every time I visited the store, I was kindly greeted by both its representatives and managers. Now that I had the opportunity of working there, I had the chance of being that same person who asks the customers about their day and help them with their needs. It was very gratifying helping people find exactly what they were looking for!"
good,Work was filled with fun people and a great environment to learn.
good,"it's typical retail. I liked working in the stockroom more than being out front, personally. it's busy at peak seasons"
good,"I oved working for AE, eccentric people everywhere, lovely music, just helping people made me happy"
good,My typical day included customer interaction. I learned a lot about working with a team and managing a store. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent schedule. My favorite part of the job was working with people constantly.
good,I have recently just been employed and already can feel the vibe within the AE setting. It's filled with young teens who share a common interest in fashion. This is an instant gratification for the party-goers because the them of being a big party is engrained in the company's policy.
good,"I liked how all the employees helped with something if you had trouble. "
good,I worked through a temp agency at American eagle for 10 months before getting a job offer. But that was when getting hired on was harder than it is now
good,I love working there because of the staff & fun environment to work at . Also discounts were a plus . But I was given barely any hours for not enough pay.
good,It was a very productive and fun workplace the managers were interactive and easy to talk to . The co workers were easy to communicate with and outgoing. What this job taught me is organization and patience and also good communications skills takes you far in life you got to be able to communicate with other people in many different ways . To be totally honest there was no hard part in my job but i did have times i struggled but again I'm human so we all struggle at some point in life. Finally almost everyday was enjoyable at my job. I always went to work with a positive mindset. I am an extremely hard working and dedicated person
good,"I’ve worked at the American Eagle in Woodburn, Oregon for a year now and the management is amazing. They are very understanding and really care for their workers. The employees are also amazing and have made so many new friends! It’s an overall great environment and first job to have."
good,"Loved the shift I worked. Low stress. Would recommend. Good place to work. Sent us to the zoo , professional sports events.  Benefits for perfect attendance."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job would be talking to the customers and connecting them with more valuable resources to the store.  While also creating friendships with the coworkers.
good,Es una empresa que motiva mucho a sus empleados con diferentes dinámicas para hacer ventas y cumplir sus metas
good,"El sueldo y bono son muy buenos, fomentan el trabajo en equipo, capacitación constante con el trato y atención al cliente"
good,"Like I said in the review summary, each day at work is different and allows me to learn something new. My coworkers are all friendly and I can ask them anything! The hardest part of the job is making sure all customers are being accommodated for, even when it's busy. Being into fashion working here allows me to share what I love with the customers clothing wise and I can just be myself around them."
good,"Aprendí el trabajo en equipo, asi como lo importante que son las relaciones interpersonales."
good,"Move around a lot."
good,"I loved this job, I learned how to talk to those who may not speak English well. I also loved helping and seeing the smiles on their faces when helped"
good,"American Eagle Outfitters has a friendly staff that is very welcoming to new employees. Most of the customers are kind and if ever an employee needs help, it is given easily. Employees also receive a considerable discount for the store."
good,Una empresa muy divertida y que escucha a su gente
good,"Awesome people, awesome job, and great benefits. My only problem is that I only make minimum wage as a part time employee. Not a big deal except that as a part time associate, you will probably only be working 2 or 3 days a week on average, so it would be best to have a second job."
good,"working at american eagle was fun because they have good management, co-workers are friendly and managers are amazing. i learned a lot from this store such as managing your time is important. The hardest part of the job was when there's a lot of things to do such as when the season is changing, we need to change the physical appearance of the store. However the most enjoyable part of the job is whenever the store is in sale."
good,engage trop demployer pour le nombre dheure a donner appar sa numero 1
good,"American Eagle Outfitters had gave me one of the most memorable retail management experiences. I had a out standing staff that drove results for this company. They showed recognition, which motivate the staff to have a friendly competition. I enjoyed  my DM and SMs feed back. It only made me a better manager!"
good,"Great employer, I learned a lot from my direct reports they are knowlegable and willing to helo. typically a day at work involves coaching and develping all memebers of the team."
good,"Busy Day"
good,"Amazing people to work with! Fun and joyful atmosphere."
good,loved the people and managers. hard but fun work associated with customers. great company to work for and great culture within the company it self. great overall
good,Always on task and ready for any type of situation with customers. Welcoming customers with special promos and compliments.
good,I enjoyed working here I was averaging about 35 hours per weeks and I got paid by-weekly I stopped working here because I found a better opportunity.
good,"Great associates"
good,"My job as a sale associate at American Eagle was an AMAZING EXPERIENCE. What i enjoyed the most was seeing the faces of customers when they get their perfect outfits.  The hardest part of the job would be not trying to spend all of your paycheck on the clothes in the store. My co workers were great , each one of them. We worked very well as a team and made sure we were ALWAYS on the top of our game."
good,This a wonderful part time job to have. You get to assist people with their shopping needs as well as earn great bonuses for your own personal shopping.
good,"At this job, I am usually on the sales floor; meeting customers and informing them about out specials and other offers. Then I am also at the cash register when I am not on the floor, helping out other people. I learned how to better communicate with customers and figuring out how to achieve certain goals if the resources aren't present. Some of the hardest part of the job is not having enough breaks in between. Sometimes I am needed to work 4 or 5 hours straight running around because they are under-staffed etc. And it becomes tiring at times but I still give 100% of my attention and efforts towards everything that I do in order to accomplish it. Some of the most enjoyable aspects of the job is constantly meeting new people and developing connection with them, I also get to learn a lot of new things about the industry as well as learning new skills that I could use towards the future."
good,My role of being a sales associate was very fun and exciting experience for me I was able to greet customers respond with proper answers for there questions and improvements on my engagements with merchandise and providing outstanding customer service I maintain an orderly appearance throughout the sales floor I got the opportunity introducing promotions and achievements on established goals for example reaching over and beyond on sales compared to other stores.
good,overall fun place to work with very flexible hours. great staff and management to help you out whenever needed. you get discounts on the amazing clothes also for you andfamily.
good,"I love pancakes! Great work environment, good for communicating, nice customers majority of the time! The management was amazing tips were great! IHOP is a great place!"
good,Working at American Eagle is a great job if you are in high school. It doesn't pay enough for a car or to move out on your own or to pay bills. It's a great part time job during the summer so you can enjoy it.
good,i did this back when i was in high school and it quite gave me a taste of the sales associate life which i enjoyed a little i guessed because it helped me financially while in high school.
good,"If you like a fast paced and busy work environment, then you would really enjoy working here May-Dec. The other months are very slow, as it is a retail position. It is a fun place to work and great product that you can really stand behind, as well as a great group to work with."
good,Management had a lot of drama between them. The training for my job was very sloppy and did not prepare me for my first shift. They do not explain things to you well when you ask for questions about what to  do.
good,This is a good company to work for while in school. I worked at an Outlet location so the hours were not good. So definitely a job if you need less than 20 hours a week.
good,Overall it is a great work environment however the pay as well as the amount of hours was not conducive. The team members were very helpful and we all work together which is great.
good,I enjoyed working at American Eagle. The feedback from happy customers made me want to help more. I felt the need to find a full time job to help grow experience.
good,Overall American Eagle is a well place for sales. I think young workers should reccomend a job and soon higher position to gain knowledge about the job.
good,"I loved this job the most, I really did, working for american eagle was the best. Working at stock makes the job more fun I really enjoyed myself in there"
good,"They barley give you any hours, they hire a bunch of people and don't let everyone work. Management is not that great. I like the discounts and the people."
good,"Stock Management, Sales, Customer Service, Day to Day Operations, Ordering, Restocking, Inventory, Scheduling"
good,with this being my first job ever I feel as if I learned a lot about priorities and how to manage your day to day interactions with customers. This also taught me how to cross sell to customers.
good,I felt I wasn't chosen to stay due to racism '
good,American Eagle is not the place to work for seasonal. You will not get no hours or time to work.  have not worked a full part time shift since the start of February. I have not been scheduled to work there for almost 3 weeks. For part time hours we're only are allowed to work 4 hours. The pay is also horrible too.
good,i liked my job but not my employers. All female environment and the one in charge was young and hormonal. I left on good terms but the management was the reason for my leaving.
good,American eagle was such a fun place to work. I became a denim expert there after 2 months of working. The management team was great to be around and was always there for you if you needed something.
good,They had nice a staff. Great people to work with also a good environment to be in. Had fun no complaints would gladly work again. Great management the managers were able to get along with their associates.
good,"American Eagle sales associate who is highly energetic, outgoing and detail-oriented. Handles multiple responsibilities simultaneously while providing exceptional customer service."
good,"The people I worked with were very nice. I only freelanced there for a short time, so I can't speak to it too much, but it was a positive experience."
good,"A typical day at work when we do get that much customers at work. I learned how to fold jeans, shirts, and other clothes a lot. When a shipping came in I had to unpack the box and put the clothes in the right order. This store made me really OCD about every thing. Their wasn't that many mangers like two or one at least. I didn't have that many co-workers until I've seen all of them at a big event. The hardest part of the job was working on call and I didn't have that many hours working. The most enjoyable par"
good,American Eagle is a great entry environment for young students looking to get into Retail work. You learn a lot about customer service as well as work with great people. Customers and staff are always friendly.
good,American Eagle is a great company to work for. I love working with people and training new associates. The staff was very friendly and the management ensured the work environment was both positive and productive.
good,this place was not very friendly and unfair on hours and played favorites
good,"I walk into work on a typical day and find a task to start. I don't like to stand around; for one that's not my job and for two it's not going to make the customer feel appreciated. I great everyone that walks in and make sure they know I'm there to help. I learn on a daily basis to treat everyone like you would want to be treated, but also that everyone doesn't like the same things you do. I think that management shouldn't be treated any differently than other workers. We all deserve respect and should work as hard as possible. I feel like sometimes my managers think that the rules don't apply to them. I love all my co-workers, the make my day at work easier. The hardest part of my job can be dealing with customers, but I have learned to deal with the bad and the good. I always keep a smile on my face no matter what. Retail can be very enjoyable or not at all, it all depends on what you make it and what attitude you come into work with."
good,"Depending on where you are placed in your schedule, would depend on how your day would go. In this industry you are always on your feet and very busy with little down time. I enjoyed serving the public. It was very gratifying knowing most people appreciated to assistance."
good,I was a student when I worked at AE and it was great for a while but I only got paid minimum wage and not a lot of working hours during the week to allow me to make a lot of money. I loved my managers though! Very nice people!
good,"American Eagle is a great company and I loved working there, however, in the particular store I was working in things never ran smoothly. It would always feel like they were always hiring and never giving enough hours to those who were already working there. It would get really bad when the payroll was backed up. No one would get enough hours. One of the worst things that happened to me was that I got a promotion and never got a raise. Instead, they said I would get more hours to compensate for the lack of raise. The problem I faced was that they did the opposite, my hours had been cut severely."
good,"It’s was a good experience, working around people in highschool and getting to know others by working together, never felt uncomfortable or out of the circle and was always appreciated for doing extra."
good,"Great place to get management experience and dealing with different situations, however it is a tough place to move up because most of the senior staff remain in place for years."
good,"I like to stay busy ,to make the long ( Holiday Season ) hours buzz by. I train new focus pickers  this Season. "
good,This job was a very good retail experience for someone who let's say had no experience at all. It was a warm and supportive environment. I always felt at home and in unison.
good,"A job that doesn't really feel like a job. It was effortless work, a lot of customer service involved. I learned a lot of my customer service and social skills from this workplace. hardest part of the job was the pay, most enjoyable part of the job was the 40% discount"
good,The job was good until Management decided to start talking bad about associates and other managers to associates. Not a positive working environment. Over worked and extremely under paid.
good,"I liked this job but i really only took it to have extra cash, it was a pretty fun laid back job but not very promising in promoting or being a stable career."
good,"A typical day at work includes greeting customers, taking them to the fitting rooms, offering help with sizing and style, and ringing up items that the customer chose either with you or by themselves. I have worked here for almost 4 and a half years and feel like I have extensive knowledge about the product and in general have better communication skills. Management has changed frequently, there has been 4 different managers in my time there, however the assistants have remained there since the opening of the store which was around 8 or 9 years ago. The management is great though, they work so hard to schedule how you need and are consistently friendly and approachable. I absolutely love my co-workers, I have made wonderful friends and consider one of them my best friend! The hardest part of the job is having an unhappy customer and trying to turn their negative experience or feeling of the store to that of a positive and happy shopping experience, it CAN be done though and personally it doesn't happen often. Of course, then, the most enjoyable part of the job is having that customer that lifts up your day and makes you love your job. Just a few days ago I spent 3 hours with a customer and my day was made because she was so fun and easy to work with...I hadn't even realized so much time had passed while she was trying on product! Overall this is a great job, however I do not see career opportunity with this company and would like to utilize my college degree!"
good,"I love American Eagle jeans, and I loved the fact that I was hired to work in the stock room rather than trying to sell clothes."
good,"Trained new employees, sales, and customer service, meet credit card requirements."
good,"Great fun styles and atmosphere, can get hectic. expect to be working weekends as it is retail"
good,American Eagle Outfitters has definitely been a great experience so far. Everyday has been a new challenge and I've learned many things while working there.
good,"Always have to be on your toes here and make sure everyone is being helped and intended to, to assure that every customer is getting the experience they deserve."
good,Not everyone cut for retail I like my job didn’t love it but it was great for the experience can’t knock it if you don’t try it amazing people working there
good,I enjoyed working here in High School! I had a lot of fun with my co-workers and learned a lot about retail and the fashion industry. Inspired me to go to fashion school in LA!
good,"Loved working there, very good company and does amazing things for there employees! I worked there for around 9 years and learned so much about our product!"
good,you have to move quickly and meet the quota. there are several jobs and respondsibilites you have while working there. the hardest part is staying fast paced though the entire shift. most enjoyable is your alone most of the time.
good,American eagle was a great company to work for everyone was were friendly and helping. They did not have enough hours because they hire so many people.
good,Being an associate gives you experience with customer service and aeo helps with that. Coworkers and managers treat you fairly and in the place i worked at the shifts are in an app so its very convenient.
good,"fun music playing at all times, got to learn new things about other people, help them. we had the best workers there too. so sweet. it was laid back forsure"
good,A typical day at American eagle is being in a great place to be at with amazing people its a fun environment. I learned a lot at American eagle I learned how to use the cash register.I learned how to interact with customers.
good,"The job was really enjoyable. I worked there during high school so most of the customers and employees were around my age, which made it more relatable. My favorite part of the job was working the cash register. I feel like you're always busy and you're making the most of the work day. It is also the best time to sell more to the customers and make a lasting impression. But, working on the floor was pretty important too because that made a great first impression that a customer would carry with them throughout the rest of their shopping trip in the store."
good,a great place to work with supportive and hardworking co workers. Great bosses always willing to accommodate and create the best environment possible for clients and employees
good,I would recommend working at American Eagle to anyone looking to gain experience in retail.  It's a relaxed environment where people can gp and learn the ropes of customer service and retail.
good,American Eagle is a very friendly inviting work environment. I get along with all of my coworkers and managers here. I usually start my day with packing orders and end it assisting a customer.
good,Honest trustworthy responsible candidate for your company. Frequently referred to as adaptable. Leadership skills and a teamleader. Willing to learn and adjust
good,Everyone was very kind and work with customers was enjoyable. Customers who came in were also kind and it was easy to help customers find what they were looking for.
good,"It’s a great job and staff is easy to work with, they are flexible with your availability and for the most part make sure you get a fair amount of hours. I’m looking for a new job because they hired on 5 new people so hours went down, and I need more pay."
good,"Slow during weekdays, but very chill and fun bosses. Flexible schedules. Good discounts for workers & a fun place to make friends with your coworkers."
good,This is a great place to get your first retail experience! It's a lower volume store so you don't see as much traffic as you would in a larger mall. Coworkers are friendly and welcoming.
good,"This was a very nice business to work for, but once the busy season slowed down I went from working four-five long shifts a week to only one four-hour shift a week. Also, the heat broke in the store once so we closed for the three days I was scheduled and did not receive more shifts to make up for it, losing all of my hours that week."
good,Wouldn't want to spend my life there but as far as first jobs go...had a fun time. Was not eighteen at the time so I hardly worked a day a week but it was okay.
good,I absolutely love working at AE. great people and atmosphere to work in! Very laid-back and can be busy at times. Only downfall is having to clean all the time and help others demands.
good,"I absolutely loved working here, being able to help others is what I love to do and developing patience and a smile is key to customer service. The most enjoyable thing about the job was making friends that I loved to be around when coming to work. Not only making me feel comfortable but also look forward to working there."
good,I learned a lot from working with American Eagle Outfitters. It was a great experience. Many of us did a great job at working together and we were able to get the job done.
good,"I loved working at American Eagle. The coworkers and management was amazing, and I met some wonderful people because of it. I did a variety of jobs from cashier to helping customers in store to helping with fitting rooms, management always asked how to help me be better, and I absolutely recommend it."
good,"This was a job I got through a temporary service contract. I actually enjoyed the workplace, the pay was suffiecient to pay bills and live off of as a single individual."
good,"- Ensured sale goals were met "
good,"The management team I worked with seemed disorganized and not interested in running a tight ship. After being promoted twice, opportunity was limited and raises were SCARCE unless you asked for them which required a long process to accomplish."
good,My most enjoyable part of the job is how well everyone communicated on the floor. I’ve also learned how to develop a relationship with customers and learned more about sales.
good,"I've worked here through high school and college, and I have loved all aspects of working retail! I have learned a lot about customer service, merchandising, marketing, and supply chain."
good,"This company is great, I love the staff and how well they care for their employees. I have learned a great deal about retail customer service and sales."
good,"Minimal hours for part-time employees and low pay, hours weren’t flexible for students and co-workers weren’t as friendly, working place atmosphere was terrible and depressing"
good,"Best place to shop for jeans. With stylist in store to help you, you always leave with more than you intended. The staff is very helped even though a bit unorganized."
good,"It is a fast-paced work environment for a portion of the year, slow otherwise. great employees and good work for a college student. servicing customers and helping them find what they need is fulfilling. I was only part-time while in college and staff was wonderful with working with my schedule. full-time employees do get benefits and coverage. depending on what you are used to, the breaks are on the shorter side."
good,"Super easy workplace and great coworkers/management here. This is one of my favorite stores, so I loved working here and would do it again in a heartbeat. I didn't have the chance to work here for that long, so I do not have much to say about it."
good,This is a good fit for anyone starting in the workplace. It is a good chance to get experience in sales and customer service. Work hours are flexible so if you are in college you can get up to 20 hours a week part-time.
good,Fun work environment for while I was in school. This is a great part time place to work for the younger crowd. I would recommend this to college students.
good,The company itself is great. The management at my store was very unfair and didn't do what they were supposed to. The store was messy. It was a very pushy enviroment.

good,"Many young employees and managers. Because Charlestown Mall was closing, it was a very slow place to work. There was a lot of down time with nothing to do."
good,It was a big world place. Over 20 co-workers in one place and it is a very fast pace job
good,"Management was not great. Come to clock in and be on your way. Co-Workers made my day. The most enjoyable part was the Customers. The hardest was to stay focused on a busy day because it was really crazy, but worthg every minute or it!"
good,"I was a Black Friday worker, this was the busiest time and there were so many people in the store. Hardest part was folding all the clothes and then the customer would come and unfold them."
good,The hardest part of the job was to fold clothes for hours at a time. I think that it wasnt as interesting and enjoyable as perceived to be.
good,Everyday was a day for me to experience in meeting people from different backgrounds from around the world. I learned to expand my knowledge of interacting with different people.
good,I learned how to stock shelves and how to place hard tags on iteams as well to reduce prices. My managers were very fun and laid back. My co-workers were very fun and lovable. the hardest part of my job was to climb the shelves in the stock room due to the fact that i am afraid of heights.
good,"Fun, easy job. Connect with customers and show them the latest fashion trends."
good,"I love working at AE, its a face paced environment and always something to do. I like working directly with the customers and getting to know everyone enough to figure out their style to send them home with a great outfit. I also really like to competitions the company has, I am a competitive person and the free merchandise is definitely a plus."
good,My job was to greet customers and help them if needed. The team at AE is awesome they treat you with respect. Management is always giving out hours which is amazing. The best part of my job was helping the customers.
good,"A typical day at work is usually very busy there are always customers when ever we have a slow time I clean, organize and make sure everything looks good and if there is customers I make sure they do not need anything, I outfit them and helped them out to the best of my ability. I learned many things I learned marketing, registers, customer service, floor sets and many more things. The management is awesome they're all really nice and always have really good attitudes, always up for showing us new things they always have a positive attitude towards everything. My co-workers are all very nice and friendly and are always up for helping customers and helping each other out when needed. I don't think there is anything hard about my job at American Eagle. The most enjoyable part of my job is when you've done your best when helping a customer and they leave happy and satisfied with what they bought and they keep coming back and asking for you because they like you so much."
good,"Having knowledge of preparation and maintenance of records and reports of inventories, prices, expenditures, shipments, shortages and good used or issued."

good,"American Eagle outfitters is a fun upbeat work enviroment with positive coworkers as well as managers, who strive to create a safe space for all employees."
good,It was a great company to work at. management was great. Sales and cashiering are self explanatory. There were opportunities for advancement but up until assistant manager. After that opportunities were not very obtainable.
good,American eagle is a fantastic place to work and help people feel great about them self’s. Each work day is a new experience with different kind of customers. The management treats everyone fairly and they are great with everyone. The hardest part of my workday would be working with the difficult customers. And to simply get through that I just have a smile on my face and use my kindness to try and push through the day!
good,american eagle is a very upbeat workplace. you are always on your feet and you're always doing something. the discounts are amazing and definitely make up for the low pay. and they're constantly training you to make sure you're doing your job to the best of you ability.
good,"Working a American Eagle was a great first job to receive sales associate, customer service and stylist training. I felt well prepared for the job and attended and styled many costumers to the best of my abilities and their highest expectations."
good,"If you don't mind working retail hours, then I would HIGHLY recommend working at AE. The company cares about it's employees, and it is very rewarding when you're able to help customers find the perfect items."
good,American eagle is a place to work if you are at your last resort. The hours aren't always promised the way they say you have it. But you can always have someone cover your shift.
good,"Overall i had an amazing experience working for American Eagle, always a good day at work and never too stressed or upset to come back to work the next day"
good,"I learned a lot about people. I learned how to help people figure out items they like. I helped them shop for jeans of all kinds. "
good,"It's retail, you need to know the 5S, and how to correctly do a jean wall, other than that, its not that bad unless it's back to school time, then it gets pretty hectic."
good,"working at American eagle was a very fast paced job it was always busy over 100 employees you'd have to be a fast learner to work here , there I was a seasonal position American eagle is a popular store"
good,Faced the challenge of working with different kind of people with drastic different characters. Also faced plentiful types of customers and have to be adaptive towards them as different customers require different attitude.
good,I loved my job. It was fun and different everyday. I learned lots of new techniques and managing time and money. There was lots of social interaction in this job which made me stronger in talking and communicating with the customers and their needs.
good,"My time there was great until I started a family.  Once I started a family, I felt as though they didn't want someone who wasn't able to have their job their first priority."
good,"Having customer service, help building sales with all customers. Not only helping them but, to be their friend first. Get on that personal level to really find out their styles."
good,I love American Eagle. Working there has strengthened a lot of the skills i was not very good at in the beginning. The only thing that could be improved is the pay of the associates. It is very hard to live off of minimum wage.
good,Great experience your coworker are very welcoming. everyone around you is always willing to help. however the people in higher power don't really help you grow as an employee. and better you in order to further you carrer.
good,"This was my first job , I was very nervous but the environment amongst the store was very pleasant. It was challenging but it's a quick job to learn. I would recommend this job."
good,I like working there because it gives me the opportunity to work with other people with different personality and that helps me to be more sociable with others.
good,Enjoyed keeping things in order behind the scenes so that I and my coworkers could keep the atmosphere of the store able to run smoothly and happily on even the busiest days of the holiday shopping season.
good,"I personally love AE as a company! As a whole, they treat their employees very well. Every so often they hold contests within the store for the employees and we are able to win free merchandise or money. They put their employees first and do a wonderful job at teaching employees about retail."
good,"Great Work place for those goal driven. There is a constant drive to do better than the day before and an expectation for associates to meet those goals. If you meet your goals, there is more than enough space to move forward. Hours are long, but the people who are employed tend to grow."
good,"I'm not a consumer of this companies goods, however the work environment at their head quarters is one of the most pleasant I have ever experienced. Working at the head quarters I was surrounded by a lot of artistic talent that was happy to provide critique without criticism. The artistic director that I worked under was inspirational, and the freedom I was given allowed me to create sets that I am proud of and have been seen in stores, online, and in catalogues all over the country."
good,"Working at AE, no day is ever the same. Some may be similar but none of them will ever be repetitive."
good,"This was a great job, and I loved it! It was my dream job! However, when in my annual review after working there for 1 year, I was told that there were no raises given on my route. This was told to me even though I was one of the top sales associates, and I received this highest in bonus checks every month for my high sales. This was frustrating, but I told myself that this job was so wonderful that I would just wait for another route to open up and work even harder on my route so I could be a possible top contender for a new route when one opened up. However, new top management and administration was changed soon after, I was told I was not servicing one of my stores enough times (which was the FIRST time I had heard of this), and that I was being let go. It was so unexpected, and I really wish I could have stayed. It was an amazing job."
good,Very fun atmosphere. This job had the best employee discount.
good,"Love working here, I love my manager he is very energetic and it really helped me enjoy my job"
good,"You wont get a lot of hours unless its peak season. Otherwise youre getting 12 hours or less. Super fun place to work, meet lots of fun people, people will be rude! There's no set return policy so people act crazy and return stuff from years ago that has been washed and worn."
good,"I enjoyed my job very much. I learned to pick and choose my battles because customers come first. I always went above beyond to make customers happy. However, the hardest part of my job were the customers. The management was very unstable in a sense, but they were relatively great to work with. I have had a lot of new managers inclduing the general managers, in the year and 6 months I have been there."
good,friendly fun competitive work environment. If you love clothes and helping people shop this job is perfect.
good,"Typical day of work is ringing up many customers, handling over a thousand dollars in my drawer, and selling clothes on the floor. Co-workers are great and easy to get along with. Advancement is tough because there is ""politics"" within the company. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make the customer's day better and the hardest part is making our selling goals."
good,"• Oversaw a sales staff over 50 employees, ensuring staff was in compliance with daily and quarterly business goals and objectives"
good,The hardest part of the job was that i had to close up an i have a infant baby that stays at the babysitter
good,"Friendly and fun, Great people to work with. Fantastic atmosphere with appreciative customers. Would highly recommend this company and would love to continue working these, however it is only as seasonal position and it is a little bit of a distance from home."
good,My experience at American Eagle was that it was overall not too difficult and it was fun to help people and create outfits or find clothing items that you would think would look good on them.
good,"Management is the only position that pays a living wage. Not a bad starter job for basic experience. Good discount for workers, especially if you like their clothes."
good,The management team works very closely with new and experienced employees daily to improve selling tactics and social skills. Service to the customer is always held over completing a sale or adding to a sale. Well being of employees is a priority.
good,i am an american eagle employee and i absolutely love everything about working there. the managers are very nice and so much fun. working is a pleasure at american eagle
good,This was my first job and been with this company since I was about 16 I’m almost 21... the vibes are great the discounts are amazing but it just gets boring after a while. Hate working week days because no one would come in so I would be folding clothes my whole shift. It’s very competitive in a fun way.
good,I love clothing and fashion. I like assisting people with their purchases and helping them look good. I liked getting discounts on my own clothes as well.
good,I had nothing but positive experiences despite going through management overhaul continuously for two years. If you have the right attitude you will enjoy it!
good,"Typical work day was very busy, the hardest part of the job was unfriendly management, however I enjoyed meeting and helping people. The work culture was more of friends of management."
good,Very productive and fun environment. We always carried events for our employees made them feel loved for their hard hard-work. We had events with different brands.
good,AE has a great environment of managers and other employees. You are always supported and pushed to do your best. The hardest part is just learning the ropes but once you have them down you will succeed.
good,"Working at the mall is great for the first few months and then you wonder why they're always looking for people, The customers tend to be rude and always in a rush."
good,"I typical day at work was pretty fun. The most enjoyable part of the job was just talking to all the new customers that came in. Most of the management were super friendly and welcoming and helped me with whatever I had trouble with. The hardest part if the job was being cashier because there were so many things you had to remember to do on the screen to check people out and it was all overwhelming sometimes, especially on super busy days."
good,love working at american eagle. the staff is like one big family and is always there for you. its a fun but productive work environment that will give you your daily work out.
good,"First we would make sure everything was set by size, the the floor was mopped and clean, Then at the end we had to reorganize the clothe.I loved picking the perfect jeans for girls!!"
good,"I worked here in high school. It was my first retail position! It was amazing! I had a great group of people that I worked with. My store manager was amazing.. however the hours in retail part-time aren't always the most reliable. But, I picked up a lot of shifts when I could, and interacted with many types of customers and overcame a lot of my anxiety from that!"
good,"Overall working for American Eagle worked with my school schedule, so I was happy in the long run. They also offer amazing discounts for clothing. hearing that it may be one of the best! You also get some flexibility to your schedule since the shifts are short and the store is open 7 days a week."
good,coworkers are all friendly and they give good employee discount. usually its clam except for the weekends or back to school shoppers. get there in time to find parking space and they usually have a meeting before every shift so know the deals and set your goals for the day.
good,who doesn't love going shopping? its your job to ensure the satisfaction of the customer which is a lot of fun! They are a great company to work for who take good care of their employees and always have fun interactive team building events. The training for the position involved trying on tons of clothes and describing how you feel in them!
good,Great staff and friendly service. Quick paced most of the time. Very easy and everyone is friendly. make lots of friends working there. I enjoyed my time there very much.
good,American eagle was a lot of fun for a high school student that needed a part time job! I got discounts and new clothes almost every week! There is a lot of younger people that work there which makes it fun to work with friends and meet new people!
good,I believe that American Eagle is a lovely place to work aside from the poor management and the competitiveness of the workplace. The discounts are amazing and the other associates are nice.
good,"I absolutely love American Eagle as a company. Not only are they extremely kind to their employees, but they are also very accommodating to customers. They work with a  lot of different foundations to raise awareness to important issues. The management is where it always get tricky. There isn't always room for advancement, so you can get stuck in a position for quite sometime."
good,On a typical work day i would help the customers find any clothes items they might be looking for and i would also help them pick out gifts for a loved one
good,balanced. your basic retail environment. Nothing out of the ordinary ever happened an could always count on the same things everyday needing taken care of.
good,"It's mostly laid back and everyone is very sweet. I have met some great people from not only the people I work with, but customers too. It's a great environment to be around, especially because our main focus is relationships rather than sales and I think that sets a strong foundation overall for American Eagle."
good,Pretty good work environment. Slow with promoting from within. A lot of disparity between department and between management and leads. Good company if your looking for great clothes and people you can learn the retail business from. I've experience poor leadership and great leadership skills from the highest of positions so its really self motivating.
good,"Live you life, love your  job. My first job while in college. Met some great people and a had blast. I could not bring home a pay check, iI would spend it right back in the store lol."
good,"Working at American Eagle,a typical day consist of organizing of the store throughout the day and quality customer service. Also a positive attitude is always recommended."
good,Fast pace and busy company which will train the staff and allow the management to get involved and make a different in the store and employees. Great Place to work.
good,"I normally get put on as head cashier and clean up the store (make it look new). My managers are great, I tend to get along with everyone I am there to do my work and make sure that what I've done is worth the money they are paying me."
good,"My first job when I turned 16. Made me realize I liked to work in retail, had some of the best managers I've ever worked for. Had great hours starting off"
good,I think indeed was the best thing ever made it is very helpful and resourceful I would recommend and refer all of my friends and family to use indeed is the best
good,It was fun. Enjoyed working there . They need to improve the pay but overall its a great job to start off with I enjoyed  it and still shop there every now an then
good,Great communication with co-workers and managers. Training is very well taught. Managers speak well to the employees which gives the employees the best way to speak to the customers.
good,"I would be everywhere putting clothes, away helping customers find the right style of jeans, being on the register mainly while having a positive attitude it was an amazing environment to work with until we lost some of our managers creating a more stressed environment."
good,"A typical day at AE was go in clock in, grab a  walkie talky, headset and head out to sales floor. Report to the manager so they could tell you where and what you were doing for the day. Sometime i was put in the front to greet customers and inform them on the sale going on. If not i was put on the women or mens side of the store, had to help customers look for what they wanted, including if i had to ask stock or go myself to get any item from stock room. Had to make sure the clothing was folded right and maintained neatly. I was also a cashier, i would ring customers up accommodate discounts if  necessary, sign them up for the stores reward card if they didn't have one and also applied them for credit cards. co-workers and mangement got along very well, i enjoyed going to work. managers were all awesome since there were about 5. Hard part i would say was when the holidays would come around and the store would get very hectic and had to work with about 5 customers at a time."
good,Working at AEO is a nice experience. You learn a lot and you can grow with the company. They have plenty of opportunities for anybody to spread there wings.
good,"I work 9-5, Monday-Firday. Receive shipments for inventory and process the shipment received. Inventory management is very important to this job, because the stockroom can run out of room quickly if things are not where they belong."
good,"Ser parte de American Eagle Outfitters fue una experiencia muy enriquecedora para mi persona y mi experiencia profesional. "
good,"You could work with others and work hard and have a good time.There was no hard parts it just came easy.Management high up could use some work.I think they forget where they come from.The most enjoyable part of the job was the people,good friends.I learned not all work well together.I have learned to be the best of what is ask of me and to do the best job that i can.They need to let people grow with in the company."
good,"Overall a great company to work at. The pay is good, the benefits are decent, especially the discount. The best part is the overall laid back atmosphere."
good,"Co-workers are fun, helps you build on your communication skills, fun work environment. you will become friends with the employees"
good,I love my coworkers. I learned how to stock and get organized efficiently. I really don't like that there are not many hours to go around.
good,"Great job with discount on clothing.  This is a great perk considering the fact that you must like clothing or shopping or you wouldn't be working here.   I know from personal experience you can definitely move the company ladder.  I worked there less than three months and became a manager,"
good,This place is always fun to work at. There is always something to do to stay busy. All the people there are great and everyone makes customer service a top priority.
good,AEO is a great place to work if you a college or high school student. It is not a job that can support an adult with financial responsibilities unless you're a manager.
good,What I learned from American Eagle was how to meet the needs of every customer.The hardest part of the job was trying to eat in time before my break was over. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-worker.
good,I learned how to interact with others and how to be more responsible in my time. I loved my co- workers.
good,On a typical day I did go backs ( returning the merchandise to the sales floor from the fitting room) Also stocking the sales floor with merchandise from the backroom. Assisted customers with shopping. I learned that alot of customers value sales associates opinons. Also learned how to work at fast-pace with alot of people.
good,"The typical day at work is just that, a day at work. I come in when the store is closing and I leave early mornings. I really haven't learned much about the store because Im strictly just floorset. My manager are all pretty awesome so to speak. I have no issues with any. They are just as determined as I am. My co-workers an I really dont have time to enjoy one another because we're constantly on the go, but when I do talk to them they seem pretty outgoing. Staying up late is the hardest part of the job. You dont leave until the sun comes up. The things i enjoy most is when I work holidays. Meaning I get to interact with customers an help them."
good,Learned about working with customers and how to make them happy
good,"I liked this job a lot at first! I still do, but the atmosphere has changed as managers leave and new managers join the team. They are very sales orientated, SELL SELL SELL is their main focus. During hiring, I feel like they will hire anyone these days, and the training was isn't always consistent. I enjoy helping people and dressing them in something they feel comfortable in and makes them feel confident. Overall its a good job but I just personally didn't respect past assistant managers because they weren't very respectful of my religious views and didn't always do their best for the company."
good,"Helping customers, finding sizes, and stocking the shelves."
good,Every time you come in everyone has a smile on there face and they are ready to work. The manager is amazing and pushed us to do our best and meet our quotas. Hands down the best job I’ve had.
good,I enjoy the work environment at American eagle/ Aerie. Most of the managers are fairly understanding when it comes to their employees. Some of them can work on their communication skills but overall a good job.
good,"I learned how to censor items,and stock clothes. For me there was nothing really hard at all working there the only problem was not having enough hours."
good,"American Eagle has and hopefully always will continue to put the customer first. If you’ve got a good team, then it’s the best job ever  really just depends on the management. There is room for growth just as long as you let them know that’s the path you want to go by. There’s so much to learn from this company as they’re growing, so there’s something new everyday yet it still feels like home. Overall, been with the company for 3 years and haven’t ran into any issues. Our DM visits regularly and is the sweetest lady ever along with our Regional Director."
good,"It’s a pretty good work environment. There’s a tons of work if you’re a manager. I feel like you’re underpaid as a manager. If you’re a merchandising manager, be prepared to work, or don’t apply."
good,"Great, caring, friendly co-workers, atmosphere and management."
good,The workplace was very organized and clean. Everyone works as a team and builds alot of confidence for each other. Everyone has a great personality there
good,I love working here. This is a company that really cares about their employees and wants everyone to have a good experience at work. This company is really set up in way that protects their employees from problems at work and they always have opportunities to learn and grow and get promotions. They offer the best employee discount you will find anywhere and there are contests to earn free items based off sales goals all the time. They also were willing to pay for hotels and airbnbs for employees displaced by fires and will make a donation to any charity that a group off employees volunteers for. American Eagle is my favorite place I have ever worked
good,"absolutely love my job here, it is amazing and so are the people. i loved my managers and my team. i think they could pay more however, it is not a lot"
good,"Great way to interact with customers on a daily basis. Stocking the store, dressing display mannequins to display new treads. Maintaining upkeep of the store, folding cloths, sweeping, and cleaning dressing rooms."
good,"A typical day at work is coming in and welcome our customers into new products, and making a sale putting in a good sale. I would welcome customers and detailing them with good promotions we're having."
good,I made lots of friends working here. I felt welcomed as if we were one big family. I loved working there. The managers work with your schedule and are very accommodating.
good,"When you want to move up, someone will tell you one thing but you never get what was told. Doesnt matter how far up you go. The conditions agreed upon will not be met. And forget about a decent pay."
good,"I really enjoyed this job.  I wish i could've stayed longer.  The staff was amazing and so diverse. I used to love coming into work.  I would be excited.  Everyone worked as a team , got along.  Great experience."
good,My time at American Eagle gave me the confidence to break out of my shell. I learned so much in my environment with the help of management and my fellow co-workers.
good,It is a great place to work with good people and management. The discounts are worth it. The good customers make up for the bad ones they are the hardest part about the job.
good,"I love the company all around. They're discounts are amazing. they offer a lot of opportunities and tools to help better yourself from videos, online booklets, and training from your managers. "
good,"American Eagle itself is not bad I really liked the Company and would go back part time at another location. Management at my store however was off. The rest of the team however was amazing the energy for the most part is amazing and positive. Everything is centered around customer service and keeping your store organized so that your customers can find things better. A typical day would be reporting to whomever is leading that day getting a quick report on what you are to promote or up-sale and where you are stationed that day. Putting away Go-backs is also very important and ""go-backs"" are just clothes from either the fitting rooms or register that the customer decided not to take and need to go back. Also important is selling, up sale the jeans and make customer aware of new promotions all with hopes that everyone whom comes in will walk out with a purchase. AEO rewards and AEO credit cards are also very important to mention while on the floor and to try to get customers to sign up for while on register. The hardest and best part of the job would be Go- backs being the hardest and Customers being the best."
good,A wonderful place to work with wonderful people. The company has awesome incentives for sales. Can be fast paced at times. Always moving with either helping customers or stocking the store.
good,I love working for them and the discount is great and I use it a lot. The only down side to the company is the lack of compensation that follows with the company.
good,"American Eagle Outfitters is one of the best retail companies I have worked for thus far. I have been in the retail industry for 6 years, and they are the only place I can truly say I felt completely content with my work situation the entire time."
good,I was just a regular sales associate but I loved coming into work. They have amazing products. They make it so easy to be customer friendly and customer focused. They are always teaching you about the products and how to become a better seller! I miss working there and I want to one day work at headquarters one day!
good,"Working for the managers was great, they treated everyone as family. There was room for growth with the company, I moved from associate, to cashier, to cashier lead, and then to sales lead. The pay isn't the greatest and the customers aren't always the easiest to deal with, but the environment and employees made the job great."
good,"I started working here when I was 16. It is a great place to start as a teenager. A great place to start with customer service is retail. You don't get paid that well, but you can get a wonderful discount on the clothes."
good,In my time working here I learned various techniques and washes of jeans. Awesome discounts.the only downside is the credit cards and rewards cards. Its a great first job and if you can advance within the company even better. Hours are not very reliable though i was working maybe 8 hours a week.
good,"When working for American Eagle Outfitters, I learned a lot about having confidence and helping customers in the best way fit. It was one of my first jobs and they answered any questions I may have had. Working there helped me open up more and talk to customers without hesitation. I also learned a lot about meeting goals and selling merchandise."
good,"Love this place a lot, the people very friendly and willing to help you with anything, was a seasonal job but I really enjoy a lot working here. And the management very nice"
good,"Nice job to work in Team. Great, loyal  honest people"
good,"A typical day included getting online purchases collected then delievered out for the customers who ordered them. Bringing out from the backstock, clothing needed to fill out tables to look ready for presentation and sale for customers."
good,"Had a great manager who was friendly and helpful while maintaining a professional relationship that put the brand and business first. Patient and kind even on busy days. "
good,Great place to work with great opportunities and community. Confidence and creativity is key in a consistent customer service environment. There is a constant change in forecast and goals to meet. Predicaments and challenges take part every day that you must face and come up with game plans to keep a smoothly running store.
good,Need to give 100% to the details about fashion. Schedule not fix and I'm flexible about that. Give a golden memories between sales associate and customers.
good,"flexible hours, an engaging and interactive work environment, excellent management, great bonuses and work incentives, perfect part time job or high school student job."
good,"A Typical day at work would be making sure customer's were taken care of, and making sure that the store looks good. The management was always making sure that we were getting what we were supposed to be getting done done. A lot of my coworkers were younger then me and they looked at me as a leader. There wasn't anything that was really hard about this job, and I really loved going to work everyday it was fun for me."
good,"Improved various leadership,training, and customer service skills. Received sensitivity training and handled more time-sensitive work, great managing staff."
good,"Typical retail job but I find that American Eagle treats their employees very well. The company has little rules regarding clothing (you don't have to wear their clothes, you just do because the discount is amazing), all they ask if that you dress in season and appropriately like most jobs. Great, fun environment. Opportunity to make good connections with your co-workers. I definitely enjoy going to work each day and I will miss the company when I have to leave after graduation."
good,"My typical day at work is greeting customers, letting everyone know our promotions for the day, cashing customers items and helping customers choosing outfits."
good,Sales goals are really high but are reachable if you are good at communication and sales. Management is extremely helpful and friendly. The team and environment is very relaxed.
good,"I only worked one day at this particular job (Black Friday 2013) but It was a very positive and beneficial experience. I quickly picked up how to properly interact with and help customers find what they were looking for. I also learned how to restock the floor, work with stocking equipment and do so in a quick and efficient manner to ensure that all products were restocked and placed out for the customers to view. My coworkers were friendly and helpful throughout my shift. There was no difficult parts of this particular job. I felt I could handle all the tasks I was assigned and could complete them with ease. I really enjoyed helping customers and being on the floor the most but the stock was also a beneficial and important part of my job. Overall, I had a positive experience and would work here again."
good,"On a typical day I would come in ask where I am need to assist my managers. Clean the floors, greet and assist customers, picked out sizes for customers to prevent my section from becoming unorderly, and help my coworkers as much as I could to help lift their work loads to keep the store nice and neat. "
good,Its a great place to work if you're a teenager. American Eagle Outfitters basically taught me everything I know about customer service. The managers were very helpful but always seemed busy. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep everything organized during the day. The most enjoyable part was meeting different people.
good,"I enjoy the atmosphere the job offers. The customers are always different, the benefits of working there are awesome with different contests so I'm always bringing home free stuff. It has its days just like any other job, but working there for almost four years, its like working with family!"
good,"Loading new stock , pricing and tagging stock in terms of size , colour , and type. I learned how to be proactive and independent as well as manage my time. The hardest part of the job is working with different personalities however the most enjoyable part of the job is working with different kinds of customers and ensuring that they enjoy their shopping experience."
good,"I love fashion and AE is one of my favorites stores. I worked in the Galleria the first two years were pretty good the store was well managed but then it fell into new management and our stock room was a mess! Floor sets use to be fun and then with the new management they became dreadful! Co-workers and managers were easy to get along with, pay was okay but the discount was amazing!"
good,"It was nice being able to get ready and look good for people every day. I learned how to be a very sociable person, Management was nice as were my co-workers."
good,"Daily requirements include hourly reads on KPI’ s to keep track of that days goal, as well as   making sure we are comp’ing over last year.  With keeping mind of these KPI’s, use this knowledge on the sales floor.  Being mindful of top styles as well as low styles to make merchandising moves to increase sales and store productivity. Being able to delegate projects to associates while helping them improve and learn.  Having the ability to break away if focused on a project and always be customer first.  Going above and beyond to help the customer while also benefiting the store. "
good,"While I absolutely love American Eagle, the job security was iffy and the pay was far from enough. Even the promotion to a shift lead (as I was promised) would be very little of a pay raise/hours. I learned so much from my superiors, and am so thankful that I had the experience I did."
good,"Productive and fun workplace were all employees enjoy working with each other. Management always pushes workers to their best and constantly insist with the goals of the day. That hardest part of the day would be trying to reach our daily goals which include the application of credit cards. The most enjoyable part of the job would be closing, that includes folding the clothes and rewinding from a hectic day."
good,American Eagle Times Square is a pop culture for Hip People who like to be happy all the time. A typical day at AE TIMES SQUARE is talking to a lot of Foreign customers which is very interesting. I learned about different cultures and about how to take proper care of Jeans. Management is very strict on what they want but they are really nice too. The hardest part of the Job is closing because we dont close until 3 AM. Its Enjoyable but we get pretty tired...
good,I was hired as a short contract through a temp agency for a high demand in fraud during that period of time.
good,"Very hip and fashionable to work here, just wished they had more advancement opportunities for recent college grads. A hs diploma holder can have all benifits and be working over a bachelors degree earner with no benifits all because of tenure. Maybe im biased because Im the one with the bachelors but still thats a no, no. But overall, great company!"
good,The staff were friendly.  The co-workers were interesting.
good,Work was always steady. I was trained very fast and picked up on everything so i was made into a cashier in about a week from just staying on the floor greeting customers. I got along well with my co workers and all my managers did a great job and were nice. The store was always tidy and everyone communicated with each other and had good times. 
good,"great place, lots of energy, coworkers really give to the customers, management is poor secure, disorganized, unprofessial, the best part about working here was the coworkers and people"
good,"I enjoyed my time at American Eagle Outfitters, I've learned so much of every department from the cash n wrap to the stockroom."
good,I enjoy working at American eagle had a lot of re-enforcement of the company values through constant education and really rewarded you for working hard and keeping up with your duties on the floor and in the stock room.
good,Day to day experience working at American Eagle would be to greet and talk to every customer that walks in. Tell the about our promotions and see if they need any assistance. Get the customer into the fitting room if need be and try to get 3 things into their hands before they get to the cashier. As they check out its my responsibility to talk up the offers and benefits of the American Eagle credit card.
good,"If you enjoy a fast paced work day while wearing the latest on trend clothing, then this is the job for you. You will help your management team meet the ytd sales goals, gather loyality through selling AE credit cards and AE rewards. Being Party Ready is a huge part of your day with stocking, cleaning, folding, putting away items from the fitting room."
good,Very enjoyable work environment and support system. The team I worked with from colleagues to management always went above and beyond what I could ask for.
good,I enjoyed working at American eagle mainly because I was able to interact with customers most of my shifts. Talking to people is one of my strongest assets.

good,"A faced paced, upbeat, fun job for anyone in high school looking for exceptional employee discounts and easy work. Management can sometimes be a bit stressful at times and keeping the store clean at peak hours is tough. But overall a good job for anyone who enjoys getting good discounts and seeing the latest fashion trends."
good,"I am not a retail person, but the job was somewhat cool. The discounts monthly were amazing. But I was constantly restocking and no one ever came in there."
good,"Everyday you are either on the floor re-folding the clothes and talking to customers, in the fitting rooms getting customers a room, or on the register checking out customers. The management team is amazing and they know how to be a good leader by knowing how to balance work and having fun. I was able to make a lot of friends and I learned how to have good customer service."
good,"Work at American Eagle is similar to any retail store.  Upon arriving for your shift one of the managers will chat you in and tell you how the day is going, what area you will cover, and what specials are going on.  Then you just sell clothing and assist the customers."
good,"simple job, great team, easy flexible hours. Management was great and was always accommodating. I learned how to manage my tasks in a work environment that can get very busy at times"

good,AE is a great place if it's going to be your first job. I wouldn't thing you could survive just working there as they don't pay very much. Other than that it's a fun quick paced job. You can have some difficult customers bout overall it's ok.

good,"Working here was great, however hours start to get cut off after the holidays do to lack of shoppers, so don't expect to get a great amount of hours in January. Hardest part of the job would probably be dealing with customers and providing them with them with the best possible service, but as you go on you  begin to get your accustomed. Overall great experience, you learn so much about customer service through this job."
good,Working at American Eagle is honestly fun if your the type of person  that loves meeting new people and talking to others this is a great match for you my coworkers are really fun and we all work together to drives sales when working as a team it helps get the job done

good,"No podría decir mucho ya que éste fue un trabajo temporal. Solo estube empleada para la compañia por dos semana, esa era mi fecha de contrato"
good,great discount and benefits never got to leave on time because the floor always had to be floor set perfect too many part time employees who didn't know enough because they only worked 5 hours a week
good,If your not strapped for money this is a good place to get retail experience. AE has cool managers and great culture. Works a little repetitive and not to challenging. I had a great time working for the company for my first few years in college.
good,"Working at AE was amazing.  Development was phenomenal and leaders were invested in their people.  The worst part about it was that in order to move up, someone has to die.   Great retention though!"
good,It is a nice place to work.  Every day is different and a new challenge.  There is a good team feel that is supportive and encouraging.  The most enjoyable part is helping people find outfits that make them feel good about themselves.
good,Its a nice job other than sometimes you don't have much to do so you just fold clothes and organize stuff. Upside are most of the people there are outgoing and friendly. Hardest part of the job is certain holidays and stuff like black Friday.
good,"As an overnight merchandising associate we would pull stock from the back to bring it up front to sell. Build tables, walls, and stand on big ladders. Not much time to relax and always busy, but the shifts are short. "

good,"Customer service ad selling product are the priorities. I've learned how to work in teams and how to find creative solutions to customer inquiries. Communication is a key factor in making the store run smoothly. The hardest part of the job is probably trying to find creative solutions to some problems that customers approach you with, but the best part is when they walk away happy with something that they love."
good,"I was employed for the Christmas season. Sadly I was not added on with the original employees. It was an amazing experience. Only con would be that I spent my entire check on the clothes, which I loved!"

good,-Resolve customer’s complaint  - Help set up dress manikins change fixtures and organize displays  - cleaning the merchandise maintains
good,"Getting to chat with the customers that walk in to your store and seeing their smiles on their faces when you tell them about the promotions going on is priceless.

good,"Muy buena empresa, buen salario para los que van saliendo de la carrera, buena experiencia laboral, se adquiere mucho conocimiento, todos trabajamos en equipo, lo que más me gusto fue el ambiente porque todos nos llevabamos muy bien, tienen al gerente general o Store manager y sus 3 assistant store managers o subgerentes, aprendí sobre el liderazgo, sobre estandares visuales de la empresa, diferentes tipos de cliente,adquirí conocimientos de moda, la parte mas difícil del trabajo fue que era mucho tiempo parada estaba ahí 9 horas, me daban una hora de comida. Mi gerente general muy bueno, buen líder."

I learned how to set up displays that you see in clothing stores etc. when they are required to be changed or when new clothing items came in.  Management is pretty laid back, so long as you do your job.  It wasn't difficult working for AE.  I enjoyed learning something new during my short time with them, as far as clothing retail went."
good,"Fun place to work! Water Tower had some of the best managers when I started working there. Although a lot of the veteran workers (non-management) hated the new people, they eventually warm up to the ones they want to like. I loved the music and closing and floorsets were always fun. You get to flirt and sell clothes while getting paid, it doesn't get any better than that."
good,"A typical day at work is quite fun, the people I work with are great and everyone gets along for the most part. I've learned great customer service skills thanks to my managers. The managers are great, they're very flexible with me and they're patient. I don't really spend too much time with my co-workers because our hours are weird (one manager one associate per shift type deals). Hardest part of my job is trying to get people to apply for credit, credit is a big part of my everyday tasks to do and sometimes it's super hard. I just enjoy being there, it's easy-going."
good,Typically can get a little stressful but I learned how easy it is to interact with people and sell items. There was no real hard part of the job to me in my case. Co-workers were all very nice and created a little family to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the people you get to meet coming through the door whether it be usual customers or new faces.

good,Typical day at work was busy always packed. What I learned was you have to be very careful how you handle the customer products. Management is great always friendly and ready to help. Co workers are great everyone gets along with each other but new faces come and go. Hardest part of the job rush hour all lanes packed but few baggers. Most enjoyable part of the job your customers leave happy and satisfied with their service.
good,"This employer will be one of the best ""first jobs"" you can get. The managers are very good people who will help you become a good worker, but not scream at you for messing up. Minimum wage pay but very happy workplace."

good,"a typical day at work is 4-4.5 hours long. we always are checking in with the customers and adding items into their hands. we constantly talk about the rewards card and benefits of the in store credit card. I've learned to really be myself working in the retail environment. every item of clothing is a statement and different statements are okay. it has helped me to build confidence in talking to strangers and becoming ""friends first"". all of the co-workers are great. everyone is very friendly and helpful. the hardest part of the job is being on your feet up to eight hours straight sometimes, it really takes a toll on the body. the most enjoyable part is my job always plays games to meet goals. such as every time you get an add on your name into a bucket. at the end of the day they draw a name and they could win a gift card to Starbucks or an article of clothing."
good,Great environment. Very diverse company. No room for growth.
good,"A typical day at work entails approaching and addressing as many needs provided by the customers as they enter the store. Being able communicate vigilantly and efficiently to be able to aid as many clients as possible. Working at American Eagle Outfitters helps one to learn about customer relationships and different forms of communication. Management is wonderful and helpful when needed to be. Very well organized. Co-workers, in addition, make the environment of working absolutely joyful. Hardest part of job is, at times, remaining constantly on your feet for long duration of hours. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people, and the sense of accomplishment when helping customers find exactly what they are looking for."
good,I did not feel I was provided the training to be successful and run my own store!

good,"Assist with retail business operations that include cash handling, meeting sales goals, and provide great customer service."
good,"For me a typical day at work involved me greeting customers, opening fitting rooms, locating sizes and most of all ringing on a register. I learned a great deal about their system and how to problem solve when I was alone on the floor. I became extremely self sufficient and expanded my abilities to do several things at once. The managers there are pretty amazing, they tend to have these silly personalities but its always made the day more entertaining. The co-workers very because some are just temporary and are not willing to work hard while others strive to do their best. To me there was not exactly a hard part to the job it is what you make it just like anything you do in life but that also impacts what is enjoyable. Things are only as fun as you make it and I always have a blast going to work because you never know what you will get to deal with. "

The hardest part of our jobs was the cancellations of flights, but helping customers with accomodations and meals to reduce the impotence feeling after loosing their flight was vrey rewarding."
good,"Interesting Co-Workers, Very Friendly, Good Pay, and Fun Customers"
good,"American Eagle was a great place to work! I enjoyed the people I worked with and what I did. I loved the fashion part and seeing what came in next. I will say this though, if you have young children and a family it might not be for you because it is demanding and long hours."
good,"A typical day working for American Eagle Outfitters can be described as laid back with a very calm atmosphere with not many busy days out of the week. While employed, I learned how to properly greet, assist in purchases, and accurately check out guests. Management there is pretty laid back as well, but still do a very good job keeping everything together. My coworkers were very kind and patient as I learned the ropes. In my opinion, the hardest part of the job was making sure that each of our guests recieve exceptional customer service, but at the same time, I would also consider that the most enjoyable part as well."
good,"Knowledgable of promotions, greeting customers and organizing tables, wall displays and more. Hardest part of the job is being on your feet for several hours at a time. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to practice communication skills with fellow employees and customers."

After back to school I got almost no hours for a whole week and they said they didn’t know when I would be on the schedule."
good,Working at American Eagle Outfitters was a great job to work at in my opinion. My managers were fair and allowed me to be flexible with my schedule so I was able to manage my work and life.

good,"The work associates are helpful and get along well with one another. Everyone is very professional. If something needs to be asked, anyone is willing to assist."
good,"The training provided is exemplary compared to other companies. The corporate team really communicates down to the newest store associate on the daily. They think of everything and have a policy on it, a procedure on how to do it and an accompanying training video on how it should and should not be done. The amount of time investing in the sterling team makes it a top tier company to work for"
good,Great place to work but need another job. I have been there for 3 years. Customers and Managers are friendly and laid back. Very easy work environment.
good,"This was my first job ever, and I love working here. The pay is the only thing I would change, as you only receive minimum wage even after being there for 4 years like myself. The people, music, clothing, company, are all great and very enjoyable."
good,Easy going job. customers are friendly and so are the co workers. Cleaning is hard but this job taught me how to be organized. most enjoyable part is talking to customers and meeting new people.
good,"I was very young when I worked here, it was while I was in college. I would say it’s a great job for someone who is working their way through school but also enjoys fashions."
good,It's fast-paced and constant interaction with customers. When really busy it can get a bit overwhelming at times but at least you are always busy and moving!
good,"At American Eagle, I started off organizing, and fixing up jeans and tee shirts. They then trained me on how to use the cash register and how to deal with uncooperative customers. I learned how to deal with people in a respectful way and team skills by working with all different kinds of people that work there. I also learned time management and leadership."
good,"After working here for 3 months I was promoted to jean expert and a week later stylist. This company was blessed to have hired such amazing managers who constantly work above and beyond with making sure we knew what our daily jobs were, making sure we all took our breaks and knew the latest sales so we can inform our customers."
good,The managers were very helpful in supporting their employees and I learned a lot about the importance of retail and customer service. I really enjoyed starting this position in high school and it inspired me to pursue marketing.
good,Hours are VERY flexible and the discount is off the charts! Management tends to change a lot but that comes with the field of retail. Most managers are very understanding and will work with you if you work with them!
good,"My typical day at work is engaging with the customer, making them feel welcome and not feel insecure about there weight. If a customer needs a bigger size, American Eagle can order it for them. "
good,Great starting job for a college student. They have flexible hours. The managers encourage their employees to reach goals and succeed. Fairly simple job but can be hard work during rush hours.
good,"I enjoyed working at American eagle.  They were fair, understanding, and accommodating toward their employees.  I would recommend working at this workplace to a friend."

good,"American Eagle is a fun atmosphere that provides the skills to enhance your customer service.  "
good,"a typical day at - cleaning the store, refolding/restocking the jean wall, making sure all displays are to standard, greeting every person, working the cash register. I learned to be a team-player and better to assist customers find what they are looking for. Management was always supportive and great at coaching  and guiding you. The hardest part of the job was during seasonal events/sales and then also floor-sets. The most enjoyable part of the job listening to the stores playlist while working."
good,Maybe I lucked out with a good manager but she was great. The store ran smoothly and I always felt that my hard work was appreciated and seen. Good people.
good,Overall it was a fun and amazing learning environment. I learned how to provide customer service and how to manage poorly behaved customers. Management was very good and also understood I was new coming into the workforce. The hardest part of the job I would say is around the holiday time when it would become extremely hectic. But my most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help people when they need it.
good,The workspace is very fun but also quick-paced. I learned quickly (within 3 days) of how to do my job as a sales associate and cashier due to my managers calm and steady pace. Management is always helpful and organized of what the expectations are in the store and for its associates/managers. Would definitely recommend this job for anyone who is social and can work in fast-paced environments.

good,"Enjoyed managing a staff of up to thirty on a daily, crunching numbers , obtaining goals , sales and customer service retention. Room for growth in large company was a plus."
good,Great place for high school and college students. Those with real bills need something different. Management is cool. No bad experiences besides i need more money
good,"It is a nice part time job to have, especially if you like their clothes. I have a great team I work with. I believe the hardest part of my job is being able to replenish all clothes before it's my time to leave."
good,"the weekends are pretty busy but the managers are really nice and the schedule is very flexible. Everyone is really nice, in the holidays they put up a tree near my job and it very nice."
good,"Honestly I think American Eagle is The best first job place you anyone should work at. they have AWESOME programs wear they teach you about fashion and how to correctly sell ""styles"" American Eagle is also a competitive place of work, well for me because of the cash register and signing up people for credit cards/ rewards, or even building up sales."
good,"fun to work there, if you like clothing.  coworkers were friendly and nice - management focuses on personality when hiring, rather than experience or expertise.  Overall fun place to work."
good,Nice company to work part time while attending college. It was not a company that I wanted to continue working beyond college. The manager was great and very knowledgeable and helpful.
good,I would go back in a minute.  The culture and environment was great.  I like the people i worked with and worked for.  They are very  smart and committed to our customers.
good,I enjoyed working at American Eagle while in college. The hours were flexible and the pay was minimum wage. We received great discounts throughout the year. I would recommend this company as a part-time position.
good,I would recommend anyone to work at American Eagle. I started with the company when i was young and grew until i felt as if i couldn't anymore. The staff are excelent down to the managers.
good,"As a group leader, a typical day is spent figuring out our staffing needs among all departments to meet our goals, troubleshooting any bottlenecks in production, monitoring associates' production, and working with our team to complete any special projects."
good,"The store I worked in was filled with incompetent management & judgemental people who made fun of other people & employees on the job. The company itself is great, but not all employees understand the values of AEO as a company."
good,"Working at American Eagle is most certainly a really enjoyable experience, the first few month are some of the best provided you actually put the work in and do what you have to do. Outside of that being there for a while it's really hard to make progress in your job if you desire a much higher position )i.e Sales Lead or Manager). It's really a great working environment just don't expect to move up from a sales associate to a lead within a year or two"
good,It was my first retail job so I didn't know what to expect. I was there for a year and I noticed that the mangers have favorites. If you're not one of the favorites you won't get any hours.
good,AEO has many resources for training and development throughout the company. Great open and friendly relationships. Many opportunities for advancement in management.
good,"The essence of customer service is at the center of this job, you have to engage people and pull them out of their shell and that's the coolest challenge. getting to dress for the job and the good looking co-workers doesn't hurt either."
good,"I have worked here more than once at different locations. Every time I enjoyed it. I would go back, but only for seasonal floor reset. As a sales associate it makes more sense to be part time."
good,"Would be a great first time job for any age. It's a very young culture and therefore lots of fun! It's a good way to learn how to keep a professional demeanor while being friendly and engaging to customers. The actual products are things worth advocating for, so selling and up-selling isn't a drag. The frequent turnover (that is expected with a place that usually hires high school/college aged kids) makes for lots of gaps in coverage or knowledge and abilities during a shift, but everyone is encouraged to ask plenty of questions and learn as much as they can."
good,"I enjoyed working for American Eagle, because it was very simple.  It is mainly the same exact thing over and over, unless they need help in another department."
good,"Always learning things everyday. Learning quicker ways to be efficient on the register, how to enter promos differently. The management is great, they are all cool and really make things fun and non stressful."
good,"I learned to work with customers, how to tend to customers needs, how to take initiative and complete tasks in a specific time range. Adjusting to schedule changes as well."
good,This is a great place for the incoming Freshman in college. They work around class schedules and are flexible when it comes to making those arrangements.
good,"The managers are incredibly supportive and willing to work with the employees to ensure they enjoy each shift. The employees are all incredibly friendly, making it a friendly and warm work environment."
good,"Sales sales sales, credit cards. More cards more hours. Always make sure you try to get credit cards and try every customer"
good,Always A Happy Environment! Everyone IS Very Cheerful And ready To Work. I Learned A Lot Working With Different Types OF People And Confronting Different Obstacles. Me And All My Co-Workers Got Along And Made Work Fun And Easy. The Most Enjoyable Part Was Being Able To Help A Customer And Gibe The Exactly What They Needed Or What They Were Looking For.
good,"Helping customers with their specific clothing needs and making sure you fulfill their needs is definitely the most rewarding aspect of this job. Being able to have multiple jobs; cashier, fitting room attendant, floor assistant are some examples."
good,"Is a workplace where you can develop your skills and at the same time learn. "
good,"This particular store was a flagship, meaning it was the largest in the area. It was very busy with large amounts of traffic moving throughout it on a daily basis. Employees had many tasks at hand and little down time. Running this store I found it important to put employees where they could best benefit the store, but also, relocate  them every few hours, to maintain a stronger focus and allow them to build strengths in other areas. Balancing overseeing the five sales rooms while keeping track of the inventory team taking care of the two story back room could be difficult on busy days. This is where hiring great co-managers was vital. The best part of the day was watching an employee grow and find new confidence, that moment of pride they have when understanding a new technique. Then watching them later in the weeks teach another employee that same technique with patience and understanding. I learned that each day had its own unique challenges, but to take them one at a time and reach out to other stores with questions to be able to find the most suitable answer."
good,"When the management team is good, the employees are more likely to succeed. At American Eagle in Leeds, the store manager and other management are excellent. I am motivated to go to work and I enjoy my job. However, the pay is poor."
good,"I just started last week so i don't have much to say except the jeans are very nice, the quality is awesome, the employee discounts are to die for"
good,"As soon as you step in to the store, there are many people shopping and looking around, being really hands on with the product that was being presented, some of the pile of shirts, slacks, jeans, sweaters, were all thrown around on the table. It wasn't really a sight for seeing eyes but once i clocked in i made it my priority to replenish and present the clothes to company standards. All my managers were really engaged, always communicating through the headset and providing sales goals for every hour, and providing us with information about the sales floor. One of the hardest thing that i had to deal with at this job was adapting to a new system. Prior to working at American Eagle i was working at Levi Strauss & Co. for a year and a half. Being so used to one system, adapting to this new system was a challenge right from the start, but manage to enjoy every part of my job, because i was doing it well and i was being recognized for it."
good,I enjoyed working for American Eagle as a company. One of the best things about the company is that they want you to have fun and enjoy work. They are always wanting feed back around the work and how it could be better
good,great workplace fast paced environment learned a lot of sales clothing and team work. My coworkers were very easy to work with we always worked in a team manner
good,Easy place to work at. Very relaxed. Customers are easy to work with. Focus is on the sales quota. Had to focus on customers sense of fashion and use that to make sales. Management is very relaxed. Very fun to work.
good,"- A part time job and working twenty to thirty five hours, and depends on manager of hours"
good,"Cashier"
good,"American Eagle apparel line was great, therefore it made it very easy to sale to customers. Management was kind and courteous."
good,love to work there it is a fun enviroment to work in love the vybes around the store .always love meeting new people and helping them on what they need to be helped on.
good,"Positive work environment with supportive management focused on positive customer interaction and teamwork."
good,American Eagle is actually my favorite place to work of all time. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing. You will never go a day without laughing and having a good time with your co-workers. The management is fantastic. They will always join in on the fun as well as keeping every one on task and the customers happy. The only downside is that you get no benefits unless you are management.
good,"Great work environment even though the pay didn't equate to what was being asked of employees. Management was always looked for ways to improve and respected the employee management relationship. There was no drama and my voice was listened to and moving up was quick for me.I learned problem solving, organization and communication skills."
good,Not many people can work retail However im not one of them I love helping out people. and Childcare is one of my jobs ive had.
good,"American Eagle was a great place to work while I was in college.  The hours are flexible, the management is great, and the culture is fantastic."
good,"I deeply enjoyed getting to use my communication skills as well as learn organization.  The team members were some of the brightest you will find, and the management always worked with me as I continued my education."
good,"the company is a very organize establishment, very easy going work place. great co worker relationships, great discounts and over a great  place to work"
good,"American Eagle is a fun and fast paced environment to work in. There are a variety of areas in the store to work in. I became and expert in many areas and really enjoy working with all of the customers. This company has Customer First Standards in order to make each customers day. Being so customer focused is something you do not see in most retail stores, but AE exceeds in it."
good,"American Eagle is a very good company to work for. There are a few flaws with their company, which is the same as most, however, the pros very much outweigh the cons. The longer you are with them, the more perks you receive as you are promoted to become a ""Jean Expert"" or ""Stylist"", and with this promotion you get special discounts from the store. My managers were very friendly and considerate or all employees. The cons are only that the schedule is released really late and only as a week by week schedule (eg. If today is Thursday, I would just be getting the schedule for this Sunday coming up). The only other con is that they have recently become very strict regarding what they need to accomplish with sales and such. But overall, I really enjoy working there."
good,The typical day was fast but i took my time with helping my customers and making sure they walked in and out with a smile on their face.I learned how to put outfits and others necessities together for young teens and adults which helped me alot with my fashion. Management was awesome. they were always there to help with anything.Co-workers were awesome i mean there were days where i was annoyed by them but we always helped each other out.the hardest part was that i was only on call-ins.i didnt have an actual schedule.The most enjoyable was when i saw people smiling because i helped them decide what to  buy and what not to buy with an outfit.
good,"Working at American eagle was a pleasure. Busy on the weekends, got to learn a lot in the sales criteria. Co-workers were not really social so it was just working and stocking. Nothing really hard about the job, i just enjoyed being a part of a big clothing line."
good,It was amazing i learned many skills that ill be able to use in the future my manager was friendly i just loved it.
good,"An average day working at American Eagle Outfitters at times part/full-time employee off and on for almost a decade always was a friendly atmosphere, with a sales driven attitude. Associate's were taught to engage customers as they were a friend, customers were more open about what they were looking to find. Working with staff a positive energy and team effort to promote growth.  Overnight shifts to rotate new styles, the floor set went smooth and everyone worked hard to complete it."
good,"This place is a very awesome place to work, meet people, and great culture. The 20 word min. is not enough to tell about how I enjoyed this place."
good,there was a work life balance only problem was stores closed down .
good,"A typical day at work includes reviewing payroll daily, forecasting weekly sales and exceeding those sales.  During the week we receive shipment and quickly getting the product out to the sales floor. Also constantly training and coaching associates on customer service and tasks in between customers. Our management team is ensuring very customer is being helped while selling the product.  Each co-worker is always busy either helping a customer or completing a project to ensure we have correct sizes on the floor at all times.  The most enjoyable part of my job is creating a fun environment for the employees and making sure the customer leaves with an exciting new item and keeping them happy."
good,"A typical day at work includes being a cashier, stylist for customers, and keeping the store organized and clean. while working at American Eagle outfitters I have learned how to work computer systems when ordering product for the customers, style customers to fit their needs, and great selling techniques. My co- workers were also great. I enjoyed working with a young group of people with the same goals in mind. the hardest part of the job was learning how to deal with customer conflict. lastly the most enjoyable pat of the job was the up beat enviorment."
good,"I'd sign in and head straight to the back to unload the shipment and store it in the back,I'd be called out to the front later on to help with customers and to fold any clothes that were un-organized.I learned how to deal with difficult customers appropriately and nicely as well as becoming accustomed to a quick and organized environment. The management were serious and playful at the same time allowing for a easy going yet stern work force. The co workers respected the management and kept to themselves until they were on break but would help each other when needed. The hardest part of the job was making it on time everyday with out a car but I always arrived early and now I have transportation so it's no longer an issue. I enjoyed getting things done quickly,I treated the task as if it were a game or a speed challenge and tried to get it done as fast as possible while still doing it right."
good,this was great place to meet new friends while working and serving the community
good,Very positive and friendly work environment. Everyone is a friend and i enjoy going to work.
good,"...Enjoyed working with the public.  Hard work, management worked with the employees"
good,"When I first started working at American Eagle Outfitters, it was a new experience for me. I had only worked in the food industry and never in retail. I was so excited to work with such a welcoming family of employees. A typical day consists of welcoming the customers into our store and informing them of all the great deals we have going on. Making sure that each person has an easy and enjoyable experience is key to our objective. An associate will check back with the customer and connect with them based on the certain item they are looking at or are looking for. You give them suggestions of what tops will go with what bottoms to complete an outfit to their satisfaction. Once they have found everything they wish to purchase, you ring up their merchandise and thank them for coming in. As the merchandise lead, I am responsible for making sure that all of the products we carry are represented on the floor and look full and welcoming to the customers. This sometimes means rearranging how a wall or table is laid out to look its best. The managers I work with are great leaders and each have their own way to teach associates something new. This is needed to make our team a well rounded group. Each manager makes sure to be in a strong connection with each of their employees, which makes this team feel more like a family. I can only count the number of bad days that i have had here on one hand and most of those days did not have anything to do with the job itself. My co-workers are all younger than me but this has not been a problem. They all respect me and are wonderful and fun to work"
good,"It is a fun environment with awesome management. The most enjoyable part of the job is to help others, and to meet new people. The hardest part of the job is to face customers who are unhappy."
good,This is one of a kind. The hardest part about this job is trying to find the exact clothing for the customer
good,"good work environment"
good,"excellent environment, great people. Hard work but satisfying. New and exciting tasks each day. Just and overall great job."
good,"To work here was a dream of mine so when I got the job, I was ready for it! I wanted it, and I hope I did pretty good at the job. I think I did. I learned a lot of people skills, which is something I can use at every job. I loved my co workers, I loved my managers, they were nice and fun to be around o a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was knowing that I may not hit my quota of the day. The best part was going into work and talking to people."
good,"i loved working there and always looked forward to the next day of work."
good,Seasonal job so short lived job. Learned selling strategies and retail customer service
good,"I love working with AEO, It has been a wonderful experience. Going to work is alwaya a fun and worthy experience. I love working hands on with customers and helping them out with their experience. I have learned how to channel my patience and obedience while I have worked here. I love my boss and the other assistant managers as well as my fellow employees. The hardest part ofmy job would probably be dealing with customers that have or are having issues with our product. Sometimes it can be difficult to make everyone happy, but the happiest part is when you really help to make someones day."
good,"Working at American Eagle Outfitters is fun,challenging at times, competitive,but overall a really great experience that I've enjoyed these past five years. In the past five years I've learn to take on challenges that seemed impossible, which encourages me to continue striving for the impossible. Our store manager is a modern day superwoman. She's stern like a mother but in the same sense understanding like a best friend. Most importantly ensures that our goals are met. The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customer, but after the situation is resolved I'm always proud of myself for the way i resolved it. The most enjoyable part of my job is when my district manager visits and recognizes my performance!"
good,If you love clothes and working wit people this is the place to be.
good,"Working at American Eagle going on three years, and i love it. The people i work with plus the environment over all. Working at the Wrentham Outlets isn't the easy place to work but being in that Outlet since i was sixteen you learn to adapt."
good,"American eagle a great place to work, everything is simple and management is terrific"
good,It was an overall good environment. No time for playing. Manangement was pretty strict. My co-workers were great.
good,I grew alot from working at this company. I learned great customer service and teamwork skills. The AE Brand is very pride full and urges the employess to feel the same way with great incentives and a fun environment.
good,Amazing job wish they had more hours to give and when I left I wish they worked with you a bit more on transferring stores. I would have continued working there but I had to leave for school
good,Mall of Georgia location was great and I did have to transfer to another one in Atlanta due to school which I hated cause it seemed like they had too much confusion and drama
good,"Overall, I loved working at AE. Everyone I worked with always had a positive attitude and friendly. The only thing I had a problem with was the schedule (not enough hours)."
good,"I had an enjoyable time working here. I primarily worked on stock/shipment/floorset/helping customers around the store. They didn't force all employees to know how to work on registers, which I felt was good because they respected that everyone has different areas that they're more comfortable with. The pat was the same as any other retail job. They allowed fair break times, and it was all around a comfortable work environment. The discounts were pretty good too. Would definitely recommend working here."
good,"This was my first retail job that I ever got. I didn’t work crazy hours since I was part time but they always kept me in mind when others called out and needed someone to pick up a shift. Everyone is always in their own area so you don’t run over one another’s toes. I started during the holidays and even though it was super busy, they made you feel comfortable and let you know you didn’t have to rush or overwhelm yourself."
good,"This was a really great job, the people were amazing and made the job worth while. Easy job to do once toy get the hang of it, and managers are always happy to help with any questions."
good,"It’s a great company to work for. Pay is not great, but the discount is great. Upper level store management is a good place to be with the company. I’m not sure about the benefits."
good,"I worked at AE for a little over 2 years and loved it. My boss at the time was amazing and great representation of what a boss should be. Everyone is very friendly, the environment is amazing. The only reason I left was to go back to school and start in a career more oriented to my field of study."
good,If you don't have retail experience and never had a job american eagle is the perfect fit there very flexible on schedules and they understand when your sick or have a family emergency
good,The store opens at 10am but doesn’t usually start getting busy until 11:30-12:00 hits. From then on it’s mostly hands on helping customers find what they are looking for/what they are interested in and trying to get them to the cash register with things that they like.
good,I loved it. Easy to promote. As long as you go in and do your job and keep a positive attitude I feel the work day goes by very quickly. Sometimes it can be a bit intense with the rush of customers but other than that its fairly easy work.
good,"I worked for AEO for 3 years. Moved up from sales associate to Core/Lead cashier. Have been overlooked by management. Didn't pay me enough for me to stay. However, the staff was very nice. Sad to let it go. I would say it works well if your a college student. Definitely worth it."
good,"I loved the workplace culture. The motto was, be yourself. This job was not about judging people, it was about expressing yourself. Whether you have tattoos or a different style from everyone else, this place was a no judgment zone."
good,Very strict with calling in and being on time. You do get incentives for your work.  They give away many reward days. Management is really great to work with.  If you have issues with anything they address it. Awesome benefits. They do occasionally have mandatory overtime.
good,Was a good company easy work you didn't get dirty air conditioning place cafeteria to eat at there. The benefits were great we got a free turkey on thanksgiving and a 100 gift card for Christmas and on valentines Day got a 50 gift card for dinner and got super bowel Sunday off paid
good,American Eagle was an easy and welcoming first job. Employees and management were incredibly friendly and helped in what you needed. I would highly recommend working at American Eagle and will most likely work there in the future during college
good,Fun place to work. Great atmosphere to be yourself. Everyone's like a family. Great place for a person to show their own style. Everyone is always willing to help you grow
good,It is a great place to  work but management needs to be more respectful. And if an employee bring something to management they need to take it very serious.
good,"Ambiente de trabajo dinámico, cultura plenamente desarrollada hacia las personas,"
good,"Flexible hours, good work environment, friendly associates, but little opportunity for advancement. Short shifts, so depending on what you want that can be a good or bad thing. The busy days go by quickly and it is genuinely easy to enjoy the time spent there. Although it is retail and customers can be high maintenance, the overall work environment makes up for it. Good managers that are fair and laid back all the while pushing staff to meet goals. I enjoy the fast pace and consistency of the job."
good,"I am currently working here and it is the place where anyone can grow with the company. I am learning a lot of things out here. "
good,"great place to work, just little pay. I was only there for a couple of weeks, but I did not receive any hope of growing with a career in that place, and no benefits were offered to the workers."
good,"American Eagle Outfitters  offers such a diverse team to manage and successfully grow our business. The experience and training of managers and associates give us a sense of pride. Mentally, our next day of business will be more productive and successful than yesterday.  We take pride Ingram success."
good,"Lugar que siempre recomiendo para que trabajen, la cultura y el trato son de lo mejor!"
good,Overall was a fun place to work. Loved my co-workers and never minded working! The environment was very fun and working as a cashier was the highlight of the job expirence
good,"Working at AEO was the coolest, most fun job I've ever had. The workers are chill and the managers like to see everyone happy (both their customers and their workers)"
good,It is a job that you'll actually want to go to every day. The management is very supportive and work-life balance is good. They give good and flexible hours too.
good,"Aprendisajes, trabajo en equipo "
good,I loved working at American Eagle. It was by far one of my favorite places to work at. The one thing that drove me away was my manager. The reason for that is being yelled at or watching another worker being yelled at on the floor or called names on the floor in front of guest just wasn’t my work style. Rather than that by far loved this job and wish I still worked here!
good,"I was able to learn to build up costumer service, stocking, cashier, to lead cashier.  Like working with different people, the different work hours.  Pleasure to meet different people from different cultures."
good,One of the very best retail corporates I have ever worked for. I do opening or closing procedures. I never work less than 38 hours and never more than 40. It's a happy environment. Great product to sell. I love my job.
good,"Loved the job, so much fun. A lot of organizing merchandise and moving around. Busy during holiday season but fun if you enjoy being on your feet a lot."
good,It was very healthy and friendly working environment . I really enjoyed working with a diversity of people it let me understand other individuals culture and behaviour.
good,Constantemente es repetitivo todo a menos de que sea alguna promoción o evento de la tienda.
good,This job was very enjoyable. a typical day at work was always fun and there was always something interesting to see. The management here was very on the ball.
good,"Whether it is your first job, part-time job or even full-time job, you will always enjoy working in the store with many other employees. It's a great community to be a part of."
good,American Eagle was my first job while in high school and college. The management really cares about getting to know all the associates. They are very understanding and flexible when it comes to school and work.  Going to miss the company very much!
good,A great place to work. Usually everyday you learn something new if your willing to learn that is. The managers are great as well as everyone else. Team work is really stressed and the strong team helps the store a lot.
good,"I enjoyed my time at American Eagle, the only problem I had was getting enough hours, a typical week was only 20ish hours, I wanted to work full time, but hours varied through out the year."
good,"Although as a manager it was difficult to juggle the many things that were required of you it was still fun we got free products and a generous discount and I learned alot about myself and business in general and I love their product.  They don't pay very well and they work you ragged while telling you not to get overtime.  They expect you to know way too many stats in my opinion, which wasnt difficult for me once I picked it up but I'm good with numbers"
good,American Eagle Outfitters is a great company to work for.  Many members of management need improvement though.  Advancement not always from within.  Work hours are consistent with over time during peak season.
good,"A typical day at work would depend on the time of your shift that you are working and sometimes the time of the year. It can vary from tourists coming in and trying to find the all American jean or a good deal."
good,"Great company to work for! The rules are set and applied but with a laid back environment. They help you become a better person in your communication and business skills. They help you learn to apply yourself and how to move forward in life, all while making you feel comfortable. Management was very understanding and easy to work with. On a typical day of work I would help multiple customers at a time on a personal level. I would also run the cash register and answer the phones when needed."
good,"I really love It and recommend it to anyone. It’s a wonderful place to work because the people are friendly, you get awesome discounts on stylish clothes, and it’s a vey relaxin place to be"
good,"Learned so much from working with this company, not only about how to be a better manager but also about myself. Was very fortunate to have a SM that took the time to develop me."
good,The task are simple. you need to be fast and good at folding. very patient.Its a fun team to be apart .Great discounts for employees. Very flexible with your availability .
good,Was able to have an excellent partnership with my district manager in which personal/company growth was easily established. Actively participate in the growth of the management team.
good,"Well managing plus you learn how to package boxes and scan cereal numbers while stoking with other workers, good sportsmanship and leadership, I think learning how the machines and how to run the boxes on the machines are the most important part."
good,"This was my very first job it was a great start to get my feet wet in the working world ad i loved working here.  The atmosphere was relaxed and the discount was amazing! manager was really wonderful. I learned how to work the cash register,this job helped me built my people skills, I became more outgoing as well so it was great just wish the pay would have been a bit more."
good,"I love my job, but it is hard to get hours when the company is in the clothing retail ""off season."" What I understand is that our store doesn't really make enough right now to justify more hours."
good,"Sales position requiring hours of standing, organization, folding, and cleaning. Cashier skills developed. Training provided for multiple positions. Productive afternoon-evening shifts and weekends. Some shifts were graveyard for restocking and change the look of the store"
good,I really enjoy working for this company because it is very trendy and creative and the people I work with have been great throughout my employment. The managers are very professional and customers seem to be really happy with our services.
good,"The thing I enjoyed most were the people. My peers and the customers we interacted with. Daily goals were always competitive and made for a fun day, down time allowed for more training and learning new roles"
good,"american eagle is the same everywhere, you learn the stores standards and help customers effectively and efficiently the discounts are great and the schedule process is flexible for those in school"
good,I work as a stock associate and it's fun to listen to your music asking as not loud or provocative and having a sense of urgency to get what needs to be done.
good,"Being able to work here with people of different age and ethnicity, with the competitive ability to sell and gain at the same time while holding the company up at the same time with no animosity was fun"
good,"I love all my co workers at american eagle i love the company message and having a company i can believe in to promote diversity, comfort, and confidence to people of all ages, races, backgrounds, and sizes."
good,Amazing crew and management that made working there a fantastic experience. Great discount and peaceful atmosphere. Reasonable lunch breaks and a flexible schedule.
good,Excellent work environment everyone knows how to effectively work together and set aside differences. There are always friendly encounters and fun on the job events.
good,"I love working at AEO on Lexington. It is fun to help customers and make conversation with them. My favorite spots to work at are in the fitting room, by the denim wall and as a cashier. Greeting is my least favorite job. My managers are so nice and so are all of my fellow associates. Everyone is supportive of each other and it's almost perfect. My only issue is regarding hours because I don't get to work often but when I do I always leave work feeling great. You learn a lot from working here."
good,love doing floor sets and creating a friendly work experience working there is like working with family and creating an enjoyment into going to work .
good,Love working with positive people and working for a company with such a proud culture and lives by its theme. Management always recognizes the effort and hard work employees do anx make and everyone is treated fairly and with respect.
good,Perfect part time job while attending college classes. Great place to build friendships and beginning career building. Great management and support by staff.
good,"My experience with American Eagle Outfitters is great. You can tell from the beginning that this is a company that really cares for their employee's and customers. They continuously try to reach out to people through different campaigns, for example the #weallcan campaign focused on accepting everyone for who they are and expressing yourself however you want. Not judging others based on how they look and being open to everyone's point of view. Another great example is with their sister store Aerie consistently promoting that everyBODY is beautiful, with their untouched models and pop-up shops throughout the states they are always trying to empower women and lift their selfesteems."
good,"management at American eagle outfitters is awesome! they are understanding and work around you when they can."
good,While working at American Eagle Outfitters I have experienced a customer first atmosphere that has taught me how to provide excellent customer service. We work as a team to ensure our customers leave happier than when first walking in our doors. With a customer first attitude we strive to meet and exceed sales goals on a hourly and daily basis.
good,Everyone that I had the opportunity to work with helped me so much! They were all friendly and everyone got along just fine. We weren't rushed and it's a great place to work!
good,Relaxed and enjoyable environment to work in. Everyday I learned something different. With each customer came a different challenge with I met with tenacity.
good,"I've never worked for a company with better management structure. Friendly, personable, knowledgable management that passes on their knowledge and good spirits."
good,"A typical day at work is sorting through and censoring boxes of clothes, and the managers are great. It has taught me a lot about customer service. I would say the hardest part about the job is some days you do have those customers that complain about the inventory not being available, or anything just to complain. The most enjoyable part of the job is that i help people all day long find what works and fits them, and also my management team."
good,"When I started I worked the fitting rooms and greeting, then I moved up to cashier, and I even got promoted to the Merchandise leader so I was able to work more with the merchandise and laying everything out onto the sales floor as well as tract what is coming in and out of the store. I loved working there, I was able to develop communication skills not only to the costumers but as well to my bosses and coworkers and I was able to learn some leadership skills as well and completing a task on time."
good,"I love working at American Eagle.  The management and peers I work with are great to learn from, talk with and are approachable with any questions you have about product, service and their processes. The only downside is that you don't get a lot of hours in a day's shift.  However, you can pick up shifts from people who need to give theirs away.  "
good,"I loved this job, it was extremely fast paced but, enjoyable at the same time.  Very friendly employees and management.  Everyone worked together and displayed the true meaning of teamwork.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being around my staff and meeting so many wonderful people."
good,"I cannot say enough good things about this job, it truly felt like a second home and everyone from the managers to the employees are still friends I have to this day. a typical day would start with a brief of the sales and for me a 15 minute lesson of up-and-coming trends, and also a lesson in fashion. I learned the ins and outs of retail and had I continued to work there I would have been a Key holder, as I was being groomed to be one. the culture was laid back and easy going unless it was a holiday then it was all hands on deck. the hardest part of the job would be mornings, you're tasked with picking up everything by yourself that the night before forgot to do, plus markdowns, plus coming in early if need, and costumer service on top. in my opinion the night crew and day crew should be cleaning as well so its not as bad for the night. and the most enjoyable part was being able to see the smiles on peoples faces when you get them to try something on that was out of their comfort zone and having them absolutely love it."
good,"American eagle outfitters is a great company to work for. Specially, I work at Aerie and the ""aerie girls"" are all wonderful girls who strive to love themselves every day. It is our job to help our customers love the skin they are in and to make every bra fitting experience a good one"
good,"I worked here in grade 12 while I was living in the states. It is fast paced but also quite enjoyable - interacting with customers and helping them find what they need, improving your interpersonal skills, and getting some experience behind the register and dealing with customer complaints are all skills to use for future jobs!"
good,This job was interesting because of the position . I absolutely loved my job working with retail .Honestly I didn't like my schedule because of the hours .
good,This was one of the best companies that I have worked for. Great managers and great employees. It is a good place to gain a good work family. If you stay with them long enough and are a good worker you can gain management level.
good,"American Eagle is a great place to work in terms of retail. I liked the friendliness of my team, the atmosphere, and the drive to accomplish goals!"
good,I really enjoy the people that I work with. I think that is the best part of working in this retail environment. My managers have always been very professional as well as positive and motivating. Every one of my fellow associates has been very accepting and genuinely fun to work with.
good,I enjoyed working here. I got to meet a lot of very outgoing people from all over the world. A lot of travelers shop here at American Eagle because of out location in Downtown.
good,It was a great first job to work sometimes hard at first but got the hang of it and was to work there but retail gets old. Not that busy sometimes and didn't schedule to much.
good,"I was employed by this company for many years. During my experience within this company, I have witnessed many new management come and go. For some odd reason they just rarely stay very long. The employee's that work there are usually young, fun, and stylish! I have personally loved each crew I've worked with throughout the many years of employment. There are employees that stay at the company for more than 5 plus years! I would definitely recommend this company to family and friends as a fair and exciting place of employment. I learned a lot about clothing as far as color, style, origins, materials used, and productivity. I learned how to stock and refill. I learned how to do inventory. I learned how to do floor set for the different seasons. The hardest part of the job was being able to adjust to all the different management."
good,"American Eagle Outfitters is a very fun place to work. I have had a lot of fun working there, the only thing is, the pay isn't very good. I love the relationships and memories I have made there, but It's time to find a solid job that will enable me to support for a wife and possibly a family some day soon. "
good,"Great environment, I loved being a cashier and interacting with others who loved to shop at this store. Gave me a great experience with costumer service."
good,Great company to work for with opportunity to advance.  I have been in 6 different store locations and everyone being a different experience.  The one thing that stays the same is the customer first culture that is expected in every store.  This can be a very fast pace environment if the store is going to be a success!
good,"This was one of my first jobs and I had a great time working alongside the co-workers. It has always been a joy to help people find new fashion and clothes for whatever occasion suites them, if this sounds like you then this may be a job for you."
good,"Cada día las actividades estaban muy organizadas y claras las metas de venta."
good,"If your a student looking for a job with flexible hours and great staff then this Is a place for you. Friendly staff, great discounts and rewards and a fun place you would enjoy working at"
good,"Staff is super friendly and outgoing. Manager is super approachable and easy to talk to. More than just work, they're like family."
good,"friendly co-workers and a management team."
good,Everyone was always friendly and helpful. Management was easy to talk to and they were always there to make sure things were on task.
good,The company got out of hand and all my amazing managers quit and the store went down hill from there. I felt no work relationship and i felt i had no need to be working there any longer.
good,"In my experience working there, the managers held the store together. It doesn't help that I worked there during Holiday season, and the customers that came in were often rude and belligerent. Without the help of one of the managers named Nate, I would not have survived as long as I did."
good,"This job has great benefits, it's fun and youthful and it keeps you on your feet. Flexible hours to fit your school schedule."
good,The most enjoyable part of being a manager in a Retail setting is working with the youth in their first job. Watching them grow and develop with your guidance. I work with an advanced group of managers who are as passionate as I am about our work. A typical day at work for me is always different so there is not a chance to become complacent. The customers make my job very enjoyable knowing you have helped build someone's self confidence. In this type of industry you are always learning new management techniques and ways to train your employees. I work hand in hand with upper management who continuously train and develop their managers to be the best.
good,A typical day for me at American Eagle Outfitters is to unload shipment boxes and place the clothing in the bay or take it out to the floor. I also ship units of clothing out to other stores. That process consists of scanning and placing the units in the box and then taping the box up with a label.
good,It was my first time working for a clothing store. I had a lot of fun and was able to understand the job easily. Theres is so many different types of items that memorizing can be hard to put in the right place.
good,The management is super nice the employee discount is awesome and you get to meet a lot of nice cool people. I do not like the hours I ony average about 9 a week but I love every bit of those 9 hours
good,I enjoyed this position because the managers always made contests for the most sales of the day or week. This motivated me to work hard and upsell almost anything. It really taught me the value of enthusiasm and believing in the product you are selling.
good,I liked working there.i learned great customer service and hows to properly fold clothing and color order.it was easy work for the most part and I learned great fashion skills
good,"I would still be with American Eagle, if it weren't so hard to advance to a higher position and pay. Someone has to leave in order for someone to get promoted, which makes it difficult to grow your career with them. However, I loved everything they did for teams at the store level, and the management was always great."
good,"My typical day at work was pretty calm I was left to do my work. I learned all the different styles of clothing, and how to do floor sets. The management was very good easy to get along with. My co-workers were very fun to be around good hard workers. The hardest part of my job was keeping the shelves stocked especially during sales. The most enjoyable part was working with the people I worked with."
good,"Each day is something new with American Eagle Outfitters. "
good,"Typical day includes opening store procedures, leading a team to ensure goals (numbers) are met, managing inventory. Learned great leadership techniques and forecasting methods. Co workers work as a great team and have interests in advancing. Hardest part is the high traffic flow through the store and reaching to each customer. Most enjoyable is great employee compensation and advancement opportunities."
good,"Really enjoyed my time working for American Eagle Outfitters, great promotional opportunities to move up within the company."
good,Throughout the day you had many customers but the hardest part of my day was to keep all of them satisfied. My most enjoyable part of  my day was when the customer received everything they came  in for plus more and left happy. I loved my team members they were always helpful.
good,"American Eagle is a great company.  Like all fast fashion teen retailers, the business is very reactive and many decisions are made based on the most recent information at hand.  The principles they are putting in place should place continue to help the brand keep pace with its competition for the next several years."
good,"Great customers, worked on the floor. Met tons of new interesting people while working here. I love working in customer service and pleasing the customers."
good,American Eagle is a place for advancement. I enjoy the retail world and find that American Eagle constantly encourages and promotes employees to perform better.
good,"They work well with your schedule if you're part time, great perks with the discount and monthly contests. Management is great and we push each other to meet company goals."
good,This was a job that I enjoyed a lot. Always in a rush but hours go fast. There was always an exciting thing to do. Definetely not a boring one.
good,"Great training and hands on experience. Company implements great programs to keep you up to date with business agenda and sales tactics. Management is great, learn a great deal of different business aspects within the company."
good,"great store great people awesome merchandise and discounts are the best part"
good,"Typical day at work consisted of recovery, greeting customers and telling them about our current sales and discounts we had going on, constantly checking for loss prevention and answering any questions customers had. Learned how to communicate with the headset devices. My managers and co-workers were very friendly and nice to work with. Hardest part of the job was keeping the clearance organized because whenever I had to go do recovery in a different section I would come back to it all messed up again. Most enjoyable part of the job was the fun and upbeat music that played while we worked."
good,American Eagle is a great company. Everyone was so friendly and outgoing at work every day. The management team was great.
good,i enjoyed working at american eagle outfitter there were so many friendly customers as well as co workers they were a very friendly business and you can adapt to them very easily you can learn the concept within a week
good,"I did a variety of jobs while at American Eagle, but my last years were spent in the logistics department handling freight payment.  I learned a number of things pertaining to retail and shipping, quality assurance, and freight payment.  "
good,Learned a lot of techniques on how to organize and merchandise.
good,"co workers were excellent, management always had a positive attitude towards there employees.great hours"
good,"This employer is great for someone who is in college and/or has other obligations. It is a fun and upbeat sales environment with associates' who function well as a team. Management is very flexible as well as understanding in many situations. The hardest part of the job would have to be selling credit cards, this being because many people hate credit cards. I enjoy helping every customer I can with their given selections. I have learned many functions in this job such as cashier, sales, product placement, presentation, and customer service."
good,"A typical day at work consists of maintaining a clean and motivating work space behind the cash wrap. Processing returns and/or exchanges of merchandise to please customers. Providing product knowledge about sizing, wash and much more."
good,Management made my experience with the company pleasurable and I was able to gain ample experience
good,"It's an amazing retail store, because the entire work-team is friendly and professional. We are not only co-workers but we can be friends and work on a team to make the store a nice place to go shopping. A typical day at work ( I worked only mornings) is great we are allow to drink coffee or any small breakfast while receiving manager orders to continue our day. We need to be professionals and at the same time know how to treat customers and each other."
good,"clean the fitting rooms, bring new items out, cashier, and  bring out sizes that the consumer needs. The management was great! I  love working there and my co- workers were great as well. I wish I could work there longer instead of it being seasonal. I learn how work the cash  register and the hardest part was returning items. the thing I enjoy the most is the discount they would give their employees."
good,"I work at least 4.5 hours a week which isn't a lot. What I do on a normal day at work is to watch our daily videos about AE News or about the new clothes that we have.  The videos help us as sales associates to learn how to communicate with customers better and give us a better understanding about certain clothes. With this being my first job it helps me become an outgoing person with customers.  My mangers help each co-worker if we need help, they also give us tips on how to sell clothes and sell our credit cards to customers who spend a lot. I enjoy the work environment, my co-workers and managers. We all get along well."
good,"I like it here. American Eagle is a store where they excel in interpersonal relationships with customers. The employees here make sure that aces are in their places, which means that people that are good in doing certain tasks, will be placed in positions that will better the store."
good,"You would always be replenishing once you arrived to work! everyone you worked with was like family to you. City Creek mall in Salt Lake is always busy, so a typical day at work was never really typical!"
good,"Great co-workers, great benefits, and very good controlled management. "
good,"Coming into work was always a joy. I loved the environment and the vibe I got from all my co-workers. I was always ready to hear my task of the day. Whether I was greeting, working cash and wrap (cashier) or in the fitting rooms. My LOD (Leader on duty) would tell me my focus of the day and give me pointers for my area that day. I'm very big on feedback and constructive criticism and they always provided me the knowledge to stay ahead, Even when the pace would speed up we all still stayed calm and efficient. At the end of my shift we would have an After Party. My LOD that shift will breakdown the day afterwards I give my feedback. How I made my customers day and my goals for my next shift. I felt the communication was persistent and valuable. "
good,i love working at american eagle i just wish i had more hours was my only complaint.
good,"Overall, this is a very good company to work for.  The management was always willing to provide instantaneous feedback for job performance, and was always willing to assist employees to move up within the company.  The environment was fast paced, and educational opportunities were always available."
good,"as a visual merchandiser and sales associate I would often ensure the proper processing and display of merchandise, pricing and signage, floor sets and face-outs, replenish and up-stock merchandise and assist customers with merchandise on the sales floor. Management and co workers were very friendly and easy to get along with. the hardest part about the job was lack of growth/benefits, the easiest part was interacting with customers."
good,"Overall relaxed job, great managers, coworkers are easy to get a long with, you will have a good time on the job"
good,I learned how to interact with co-workers being that it was my first job and the management team was amazing.
good,"As of now, I do not receive much hours at work since I am fairly new. But a typical work day is basically customer servicing all day. Letting customers into fitting rooms, helping them put together an outfit, tell them about the deals that are going on, but making sure they do not leave the store empty handed! I learned about the jeans that we carry in the store, and all the standards within the store for our overnite floorsets. The management team seems to work well with eachother, and help one another out. My co-workers seem to be nice and friendly. They always help out when someone calls out or even staying later in their shifts. The hardest part is really trying to get recognized. I worked at a bigger company before, who knew what I was all about, working hard, works comes first, setting my own goals and standards, pushing myself to do better and harder, always meeting goals and timelines, neat and productive. The hardest part is to re-establish myself as a Visual Merchandiser. Since I am a very ambitious person, I will meet my goal. Most enjoyable part is when I am able to help with the Visual work that goes on in the store. I love making stores look good, and of course our customers!"
good,Working at AEO has taught me about diversity and dealing with different type of people. I love working here! I feel like it's an endless party going on and getting paid at the same time! Helping customers find what they need and enjoy doing it at the same time!
good,"Before there was new management, my manager was amazing and still is! I was friends with almost everyone there. My manager loved me and gave me the most hours for my hardest work. They always called me to work my ""magic"" if the store was a mess! I loved it! I wish I could work for her again!"
good,I would pick and pack orders from online. It was alot of fun once you learned how to do it. Very fast paced and the pay was great for what the job was. The hardest part is stayin on your feet for 12 hours a day on a concrete floor with hardly any movement but with it being fast paced you get used to it failry fast.
good,"I loved AE. All of the Sales Associates and Managers were friendly and we all stuck together like family. Sad that it was a seasonal position and although i made it pass the seasonal period, business went down after New Years."
good,"Greet customers, make connections to build an outfit and have some security with each other, multitasking customers as well with other coworkers, cashier as quick yet still making connections. I learned how to make connections, how important customer service is, how to multitask many things like customers, tasking, etc."
good,"Atypical day would be clocking in, watching the ""pre-party"" video, restocking the floors and the maintaining the clothing and piles. Cashiering if needed, and doing closing duties of the registers with the manager."
good,Me gusto trabajar ahí excelentes lugares divertidos trabajas en equipo los gerentes te apoyan y te enseñan todas las actividades que ahí
good,American Eagle is a great company that values their employees. Management is always there to help and listen to any discrepancies for employees and customers. My year of being there was fun with not many hiccups which made my first job one to remember.
good,I really enjoyed working there even though sometimes things weren’t well organized. I loved how well the employees interacted. Not every day was the best I can definitely say that store needs a lot of improvement.
good,"Overall I grew, learned and experienced alot from this Company. One very important skill I learned was the art of great customer service which made me a very great asset for the Company"
good,"The manager ran the store smooth and flawlessly. All employees and customers were completely happy and enjoyed every moment in the store. All in all, American Eagle was an amazing place to work at."
good,Great company to work for allows great work life balance. They have all the tools you need to help any leader or brand ambassador get ahead and be trained.
good,"One of the most amazing jobs I’ve ever had I love clothing and the experience of retail it was a lot of work but very laid back and all of the employees got along and we work hard but played harder, and I will and definitely do it again!"
good,"Muy buena empresa con buenos valores, el cliente es la prioridad."
good,American Eagle in Myrtle Beach is a great place to work! The management team is AMAZING! They truly care about their employees! This team is truly a family and loves to work together! I would recommend it to anyone that needed a part time or seasonal position!
good,it was a fun place to work at very relaxed and easy work to do i never had a hard time with any of my assignments and it was easy to get my schedule worked around
good,Working at American eagle has its ups and downs but will help you have a basic income. The culture is very friendly and high praise. During your shift you have to be on your toes because never knowing if a big rush of people come into the store. Asking question after question.
good,Great company to work for! I enjoyed the work place and people I worked with. I definitely do recommend working here if you’re in high school or school in general. You get great discounts and get to see the new clothes first !!
good,"amazing staff and friendly environment great schedule and flexibility great hours as well, customers are great always something to  do never get bored"
good,"Great company to work for! As an associate for almost 8 years now I love walking into the store as I immediately get such a fun vibe. Overall all the staff are great, inlcuding management. "
good,"This job is not for someone paying rent, this part time job is for someone is in high school or looking for a little part time job to make a little extra money."
good,i worked seasonal there but they made me feel to comfortable and apart of their team. it was definitely a fun place to work over the holidays. i would recommend
good,"Fun place to work at if you’re just starting, a lot of competitions for more discounts or free clothes to keep motivated, and management were always friendly and understanding if you were not able to come in or leave early. By far one of the best jobs I’ve worked at."
good,"American eagle is the best part-time job a college student can ask for! Hours vary depending on the season, and how well of an employee you are. The discount is amazing. The scheduling is very flexible. Managers always put the employees first and the company allows you to develop and gain higher job titles."
good,"Overall, when I began working at AEO, I enjoyed it a lot. However, after we lost one of the four managers, things began to decline. The owner/main manager was extremely stressed at all times, things changed within the company such as a mandatory set amount of credit cards an associate should have set up during the day, and it was no longer enjoyable to go to work."
good,"Staff becomes sort of like a second family, coming into work doesn't feel like much of a pain when your working with people who make the time go by faster."
good,i loved everyone i worked with. everyone was super nice and made the work load a lot easier than what it really was. i love my job and job title as well i was in charge of merchandise etc.
good,"I really enjoyed working at American Eagle. I met a lot of really cool people, and I learned a lot about marketing. They where very structured and organized, and they did exactly what they said they would do."
good,Great place to work.  Great opportunity for advancement.  The structure of this company is great to be a retail chain.  The hardest part of the job is retail hours.
good,"great employees, a lot of fun, and if your motivated to advanced its not difficult and a lot of opportunity for it. great customers (usually) and floor sets are a lot of fun"
good,Work was always a good time. Co-works were very welcoming and encouraging. Management provided great support and leadership. Hardest part I would have to say is sometimes the floor pace.
good,"I loved my job, there was always something different everyday to do. The company stood for a good cause with there body positive and celebrating individual campaigns. Work was fun everyday"
good,un trabajo bueno para empezar y crecer dentro del área de ventas.
good,"I enjoyed working at American eagle, it was a relaxed, and easy job. I  wasn't receiving my full 40 hours so I decided to get a full time job, I couldn't get free time after so I put in my 2 weeks."
good,Ambiente joven y dinámico que creaba una atmosfera competitiva sin olvidar la amabilidad.
good,"I worked in the distribution center.  Compared to other distribution centers, this one was top notch with an onsite cafeteria with lots of options and an onsite workout facility."
good,"Started in 2015 I absolutely love all my conworkers and all of the management. We are like a family. Friendly upbeat environment, have to be able to talk to customers and meet sales goals but it’s always a fun positive shift at American Eagle"
good,"Good place if you are good with working hard for goals. Very driven on keeping employees in constant communication with the customers and making sure that the store is kept  clean. Managers change often, and can be a bit rough if you don't greet every single person that walks in."
good,Customer interaction is my favorite part of this job. I really do enjoy working for this company. The only thing is that the pay wages they start you out at are extremely low.
good,American Eagle Outfitters was a good company to work for before they closed down the Warrendale DC. They gave me the opportunity to learn skilled positions including becoming a groupleader.
good,"I learned so much at this job. I had my first management position and truly learned what it was like to have a leadership experience. I trained new employees, ran the sales floor, updated marketing, etc. One of my favorite things about this job was personal shopping and styling customers. This aspect of Aerie helped let me use my creative and design skills and helped me grow in my career path as well. Overall, I learned a lot about management and retail/fashion industry that I believe will be very useful in all my future endeavors."
good,"Wonderful job while getting through high school/college. Flexible hours, great discount and fun environment. I would recommend working at this company to anyone."
good,"Typically at work you focus on helping the customers and keeping the store organized. While working there I learned about how to communicate with customers as well as fellow employees. The American Eagle company itself is amazing, I really liked what they stood for and how they marketed their brand."
good,"While holding a sales lead position, I gained a lot of responsibility and had opportunity to be a leader in a way that was not overpowering to other sales associates. The hardest part of the job was not messing up counting registers at the beginning or end of the day. The atmosphere of working with people that are so similar to me is what made the experience great and the reason why I come back to work there on my school breaks."
good,I loved this job. I had a great management team and they made work fun. I enjoyed going to work every day. We were in the process of a remodel when I joined the team and we helped set up our new store.
good,The experience was great and everyone around me was very supportive. The shifts were easy and went by fairly quickly. I always had fun when I was in the store and got to meet a lot of really cool people when I was working.

good,Some pros. Learned a lot about the retail business and also learned patience and better communicating skills with customers. Overall the manager was laid back and made it a comfortable place to work.

good,American Eagle was a fantastic place to work.  The culture was amazing and everyone was easy to work with.  I learned how to meet deadlines and be time efficient.
good,"I think it's a very fast paced environment that consistently keeps me busy and I have learned many new things while working there! The most enjoyable part is definitely the staff, it can be stressful but you become accustomed to working with certain coworkers and it makes shift much more fun. The hardest is the amount of work that comes down from corporate and the expectations for it to be done. Overall I love the AEO culture and I'm grateful for the opportunities it presented me!"
good,"I was part of the management team so there were many weeks where I worked well over 40 hours while on salary. "
good,its very fun and the people are kind and very helpful. the advancement opportunity is outstanding. ten hour shifts four days a week are great if you need the weekends for family time.
good,This company is one of the best I've worked for. They allow you to grow at your own pace. They take time to analyze where you would fit best in the AEO work place.
good,"Easy-going, fun place to work. Best job I've ever had, always felt like I had the complete support of my management staff and the other members of our team. Wish the company put less emphasis on the store credit card."
good,An environment that is challenging from a merchandising mindset because of the details that make American Eagle a fun place to shop. Layers of accesories make it a great way to drive KPIs. Management was pleasant and empowering.

good,"Great part time job for students. The company is very generous to its employees. "
good,"La empresa es uno de los lugares de trabajo más nobles que he conocido, y al menos a mí me abrió los ojos a una forma completamente diferente de interpretar y utilizar los diferentes indicadores del mercado. Para los tiempos en los que estuve con ellos aprendí muchísimas cosas, y también me dí muchos topes en la pared, pero con el apoyo del director de operaciones, convertí esos tropiezos en aprendizajes"
good,I love working with the guest/customers but retail isn't where I see myself. I see myself working in the hotel business.
good,A typical day at work was very fun; although exhausting. I improved my time management and social skills. All of my co-workers were very helpful on my first day and throughout the time I was there. The hardest part of the job was dealing with different personalities. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers.
good,Not a day goes by that you walk in and the party begins! Making customers happy is the game we play and the management teams are always ready to have a blast! American Eagle is always having a new promotion for the customers and for their employees. If you're ready to learn they're ready to teach you and there's never a day that goes by where you don't learn something new! If you want to learn and have a great attitude for work this is the job for you!
good,I loved working with American Eagle. Each day was a day to make the store greater and increase sales. The American Eagle team was extremely supportive of each other.
good,American Eagle was a very positive company. Management was always there when you needed them. The workers really kept to themselves and always provided help.
good,American Eagle was one of the best floor sales jobs I had. It really taught me a lot about sales and marketing and knowledge about quality of the product I would be selling. I also learned how to open and sale credit cards and was awarded top credit card sales. We had to meet a daily sales quota so product knowledge was highly important as well as excellent customer service as well. Add ons at the end of a sale purchase was very important because it helped reach the sales quota. I enjoyed working with all co workers at this job and every part was highly enjoyable.
good,it was definitely great customers and coworkers. You're on your feet most of the time you're there so make sure you have on comfortable shoes!
good,"I learned to communicate with customers, reach out to them when help was needed and picked up on buying habits."
good,"I've been with this company since my sophomore year of high school (2012), the work area is clean, proper, and refined. Yes, retail is usually a 'no-brainier' but American Eagle strives to push you and aim high in its work environment. I enjoyed working here."
good,"Running back and forth for a customer was very rewarding when you made a customers day for an event or just a day out to have fun. My manager staff was not only fun and upbeat, they were kind and knowledgeable."
good,"This job environment was the same as Aerie because of the fact that  it was in the same building and it is apart of American Eagle. The environment is very fun, in terms of, constantly getting the chance to help the people and have them leave with a satisfied purchase."
good,"normal mente era re acomodo de mercancia yatencion al cliente tratar de ofrecer mas producto y que la venta fuera un poco mas elevada para llegar a la meta, en provadores checar el numero de prendas y ofrecer al cliente otras tallas por si la que se llevo no le quedara. En almacen era desempacar, alarmar las prendas, doblar y acomodar en la estanteria."
good,"Every day as I went into work I looked forward to working with other employees and making sure the customer was happy. The hardest part of the job was unloading all of the shipments however, when working with others it went smoothly and effectively. I highly advise working at American Eagle. I learned how to communicate in a more effective mannor and assist others as best as possible."
good,Great work place with ever changing challenges.  Enjoyed working with all levels within the company.   Environment is employee friendly with extensive benefits.  Management was easily accessible.
good,"A typical day has you reviewing the sales, finding out where you stand on the day in regards to sales, opening rewards and credit, and conversion rates. "
good,"I had a great time working here. Making a connection with the customer is pretty easy with with me because I do get along with pretty much anybody. I have a nice and polite personality that i do use to win a customer over so that i can encourage them to add more clothes in order to make more sales, which means my metrics will be high."
good,"I have worked for this company for about 6 years and would give it an excellent review. The manager at my store was very professional and kept the environment fun, yet always made sure we had our work done."
good,I have worked at American Eagle for 4 years and absolutely love it. I have learned a lot as sales associate. I have learned to utilize my marketing skills to best sell our products to our customers and make the best out of their American Eagle shopping experience. I was often placed in fitting rooms where I was able to work hands on with each individual customer to customize their shopping wants and needs and to show them products according to their preferences. I also was placed in the front of the store where I was able to learn to come out of my shell and talk to everyone and welcome customers with a warm and welcoming attitude. The hardest part of the job tends to be those customers that get frustrated or angry if something is not right with their purchase but you just need to be patient and understanding to help ease their frustration. The most enjoyable part was being able to see customers smile when I was able to help them find a piece of clothing that they fell in love with and felt confident in when they tried it on. Working as a team with my coworkers was also a great part of the job because we acted more as a family and ran smoothly. We also were able to communicate to each other with ease as to any concerns or questions that we had.
good,"I Loved it until they closed my location with a 2 weeks notice that left most of the staff without a job :(  as a store manager, I was put at another store, but then was laid off due to not being able to afford 2 store managers at 1 location and another position not coming available."
good,work hours where not consistent but the atmosphere of the job was AMAZING!! I Love my coworkers and the store manger at the time Kelly made going to work worth while.
good,Loved this job and the people I worked with. I would probably still work there if they would not have closed the store. Best discount of any store by far. Sadly I spent my entire check in the store due to awesome discount.
good,"i would start at 9:30 starting with cleaning the fitting rooms, then i would organize the floor. i learned to have fun with what I'm doing. management was amazing, became close friends with my coworkers along with management. the hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of my contract. the most enjoyable part of my job was seeing all the smiling faces."
good,"customer service, talking to customers, selling as many products as possible, cashier, stocking, storage, floor sets, working with a large team, my favorite part was talking to people, meeting sales,  floor sets, cashier, coworkers, hardest part was making sales on slow days"
good,It was great! The hardest part of the job were the shifts as I had worked to 3am in the morning restocking at some points while trying to balance it out with my university final exams.
good,American Eagle is a fun company for people around my age. The company does an excellent job ensuring that all employees are enjoying their job and try to continue providing great customer service.
good,This job has a great work environment and has a very flexible shift time as well as amazing management.easy promotions if you do your work and do it well.
good,I would check wash from night before check drivers notes configured wash schedules and truck routes had meetings with other mangers as to what needed to be done for needed hotels load trucks for day routes set up night routes
good,The typical day is normal i just go in and begin doing what they expect me to do. Its not a bad job if you like folding and socializing.
good,A day at American Eagle is always adventurous and fun; I come in like every other day going by the company routines and protocols. The management is the best so far and the co-workers are supportive and cheerful people at all times. The hardest part of the job is having to stand all through the shift and the best part of the job is relating with co-workers and most importantly giving customers that good quality customer service and seeing the smile of satisfaction on their faces.

I learned over the years that patience is key, never to let anyone get under your skin and to always provide great customer service no matter what. Management is great they're always helpful! I love all my co workers we all have become such great friends, we all work very well together. Nothing about the job was that hard to me, I loved the job and did well at it."
good,"Good place to work, great team members. Management is always concern about employees satisfaction with work."
good,"Typical day at work 3 to 4 flights a day. About 60 to 40 passengers per flight, one flight attendant or two. Learned how to multitask in a fast pace work site. Great co-workers, teamplayers. Hardest part of the job being away from home,commuting. Most enjoyable one on one contact with passengers."
good,"cool people, laid back. Great customers. Awesome managment!"
good,Great place to learn sales techniques.  I learned how to relate to customers on the sales floor and how to perform cashier activities.  All co-workers and management were great and professional.  
good,Fantastic place to work.  Always given gifts for hard work and you are always appreciated!
good,American Eagle has been the best job I've ever had. The people I work with are absolutely incredible and treat everyone with respect and a warm attitude that just draws you in.
good,"My typical day at American Eagle is setting goals for the day as far as gaining customer loyalty through rewards cards, credit cards, and getting email addresses to extend our deals to customers who may not have a rewards car already."
good,"The day would begin as soon as you go in the store its work...I learned a lot from AE, like being a fast pace cashier, count money, help customers, convince customers and much more. Management was great and very friendly felt like family. Co-workers on the other hand much like High School. I don't think there was a hard part to this job....I loved every second it."
good,I Loved working here every one was so friendly and the environment was grate we all got along to well and worked hard and loved it.
good,Loss prevention manager making sure theft was not allowed in the store
good,I enjoy Retail period! I loved working for the company!
good,"Supervise, coach, and develop associates"
good,Ive worked here for almost 7 years! Great team and management. Great way to ave growth opportunities.
good,"A typical day at work would be to get our assignments and become productive teamplayers, to reach our goals in a safe and timely manner. I enjoy working for a company who has great leadership and does everything possible for AEO and its employees. The hardest part of the job is the down time of production. What I learned at AEO is to respect everyone and just do my work to the best of my abilities."
good,"In a typical work day I opened the store,counted the registers, cleaned,organized, helped customers with and needs or problems,was a lead cashier, assisted managers with new hires and assigning tasks. This job is where I learned how to give excellent customer service. I had amazing managers I developed excellent professional and and personal relationships with each of them. The hardest part of this job would be the all nighters working 12 hours or more overnight and keeping all employees energized and positive. I enjoyed this job so much the team work and energy level and people were amazing!"
good,"A typical day at work is insuring that all customers leave happy! I try my best to assure all customers are helped and have what they are looking for right in front of them. The hardest part is dealing with rude customers. You have to maintain your calm and smiling face even if they are being rediculously complicated! I love the atmosphere and the people I get to work with, we are kind of like a family! I love my job but I am looking for another because the only thing American Eagle is not good on is taking their employees and promoting them. They like to promote outside the company, and a full-time position is only available in management positions so I have to find a full-time job else where."
good,"i love working at American Eagle, it full of energy, managers are motivating and party ready. No drama or gossip, everybody just get along pretty well"
good,American Eagle Outfitters had great work ethics. It revolved around being a team but thinking independently. I have gained a lot from this and due to this hired great teams for my store which made work a lot more fun and the rewards were awesome.
good,Always flexible and relaxed environment.  work around my school and life schedule on short notice. Management is great and very easy to talk to and understanding

good,"by far the best work experience i have ever had. i would highly recommend applying to American Eagle to a friend or family member, the management there is so welcoming."
good,"I was worked there for a short time but the team of Managment id very good & Supportive."
good,Working with the company was a family work environment. We worked as a team to get the job done and achieve our set goals for the day. I worked in shipment as well as a sales associate for the holiday seasons. I absolutely loved working at the company.
good,I hate I had to leave American Eagle for time constraints. American Eagle is honestly a fun energetic place to work. My manager was kind and a team player. They do value the customer’s experience without comprising the worker’s.
good,"Great place to work, almost wish I never left. Great benefits if you like the clothes and customers are often great to interact with along with the coworkers. Management is friendly, just wish they offered more hours."
good,"I loved working at american Eagle it gave me and opportunity to have extra money and go to school with a flexible schedule. I had to leave because my other job promoted me to assistant manger so i did not have time to go to school, be a manger at one job, and work a part time job."
good,"I started at American Eagle at the start of my senior year in college. The management knew my plans for after graduation involved styling so they were very helpful in getting me into styling training, where I then got to help the customers find the right fit that accented their style as well as body type. I have learned a lot from working at the store an it has given me some great experience that I will be able to use for my future career."
good,"a Typical day of work will depend on the season. Usually is folding clothes, customer service and doing sales."
good,"I helped out opening up the store , i helped with setting up the store unpacking the boxes of clothes. The management team was nice . I learned how to open up a store ."
good,"I got this job to work during school so I could have flexible hours around classes and homework. I absolutely love the managers and coworkers I have, they are understanding and open and are willing to work with me with personal and school conflicts. In Aerie and American Eagle, I work as a cashier and it can be both tiring and energizing. There are always new products I love, and the customers are usually very nice. I especially love all my discounts!"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of recovering the store, helping customers, handling online orders, and doing shipment/ cleaning at the end of the day."
good,I am in charge of sorting a censoring all products that come into the store as well as applying all new marketing for upcoming floor sets and store organization.
good,I loved working for American Eagle. The staff is always so friendly and the managers were wonderful. You really felt like you belonged there and it always felt like a family. I made some really good bonds with coworkers at that location.
good,"Ive always loved that store, just because it has good quality jeans.The costumer service was great. I personally made sure people loved what they bought and felt comfortable. Im very open with people and I treat them they was id like to be treated."
good,The only reason why I quit is because they were constantly hiring new people so all of the older works ended up working once or twice a week maximum by the end.
good,"i really enjoyed working there, but it wasn't the perfect place for me. they take very good care of the customers and they make it a priority to uplift the customers before the check out and leave."
good,American Eagle will teach you the importance of employee customer interaction. It promotes and friendly and helpful environment for it's customers who visit the store daily. Manangment really helps you get out of comfort zone and build a genuine interaction with each and every person that walks into the store.
good,I loved working at American Eagle because I absolutely love helping people! I loved to help them pick out new outfits and seeing the smile on their face when they found something that they felt confident in. Helping someone feel confident in their body and love the way that they look is so awesome!
good,"Every day I come in with an open mind and a mindset to help the business grow. I help customers, execute moves on the floor, and help coach associates. Workplace is very easy to work with fellow managers and associates as everyone is driven to have the business grow."
good,"Easy going shifts and flexible schedule, sense of community and managers are really involved. The only Con is the pay and bi-weekly pay schedule. Other than that it is good work experience."
good,Πολύ απαιτητικό περιβάλλον πολύ ωραίο εργασιακό κλίμα Πολύ training και μεγάλη έμφαση στο customer service
good,"American eagle is a great place to work. I worked part-time while in school. They were great accommodating my schedule even at the last minute on occasions. Compensation is minimum wage and there isn't a ton of opportunity for raises. The benefits are great if you like their clothes. You get a set amount of 60% off coupons to use each floor set. Everything else is 40% off and clearance is 25% off whatever the sales price is. There are opportunities for small promotions that come with some priority in the scheduling and 3 80% off coupons every floor set. You are expected to dress in the same style as the store but it doesn't necessarily have to be AE, as long as it doesn't have other brands on it."
good,My first job. It was very informative as far as cashier and stocking experience. A typical day consisted of me clocking in at the register and receiving my daily task from the current on duty manager.
good,"Everyone at Green Oak American Eagle was great. Typically, it was pretty slow, so this is a very selling-based store. When there are customers, the sales associates are expected to get to know them, and check up on them very often. When it is especially slow, you are expected to do simple tasks, like folding or putting away clothes. If all of that was done, it is mostly just hanging around and getting to know your team members, which was great! The company has selling incentives very often, which was great because there were lots of opportunities to get free stuff! Our employees discounts were also very generous (40/60/80 % off). Overall recommend this job."
good,The managers were kind and very helpful in teaching you things. The coworkers were friendly and there if you needed help. It was laid back and easy to be there.
good,Working at American Eagle was one of the best learning opportunities I've ever encountered. There are tons of contests that help drive sales and friendly competition as well as an awesome employee discount. Everyone I worked with was fun and hard working.
good,I was a part time employee and I loved /working here for my first job! The staff was very enjoyable to be around and the management team was very understanding
good,"This American Eagle Outfitters at Oakville Place wasn't very busy, but it made adjusting to the job a lot easier. They taught me how to work around the place really easily, and I was working in overstock in no time. It was a great place to work during school."
good,"American eagle has a lot of benefits. Work load and goals are realistic. Great place to learn and grow in your craft. I've enjoyed being the selling Manager, helping customers find clothes that make them feel confident and good about themselves has been an amazing experience."
good,"I was only at this location for a short period of time, but I loved my coworkers and managers. It is now three years after I moved away and I still keep in contact with some of them.(:"
good,I loved working at American Eagle. The schedules are good the pay was good and the family work life balance was great. The management team is very helpful in helping you grow.
good,"I really enjoyed much of my time with American Eagle. The people there were great to work with and it was a fun environment. It was competitive enough with other brands, but gave me a great experience. I would work there again if given another opportunity."
good,"some days was very easy and others was at a quick pace"
good,a great place  To work at The manager is there I'm good It's a nice company And the close there are good In a somewhere where you can  Turn higher levels in the company area
good,A typical day at work was me engaging with customers usually tourist asking them where they are from and why they were here. I spent most of my time in the fitting rooms were i engaged much more than being on the sales floor. The hardest part of my job was really getting used to being the only mixed with color there. It was PW and i just it was more diverse. The most enjoyable part of it all was getting to see different new people everyday all from around the world and hearing their languages also.
good,You will grow so much with this company. They  take the time training and developing. They actually care about their employees. Its also easy for you to grow in the company.
good,They train you very well for being a sales associate and cashier. I felt  I was very well prepared for the job and that I attended my costumers to their highest expectations.
good,"A very efficiently ran company; they used ipads to clock us in and videos to notify us of promotions and trends and to train us. There was always a meeting before and after our shift to understand and establish our goals for the day and to discuss strengths and weaknesses and room for possible improvement. This part really helped to reinforce myself not only as an employee, but also as a person. Co-workers were really sweet and fun. Music's always jamming. Work isn't always guaranteed - you often have to call 2 hours ahead to find out if they need you to go in or not. Perks of working there is that you'll get really great discount for the clothes; downside is you'll spend all your checks on clothes if you're not careful!"
good,un ambiente de confianza y motivacion personal para ventas
good,"I enjoyed working for AE, but I had spent several years in retail Management and it was time for a change. "
good,"I enjoyed the company. There were plenty of opportunities. I personally just wanted a job where I help individuals reach goals, or helped on a more intimate level."
good,"AEO helped me a lot with my communication’ skills, and the way I interact with people. It also helped me improve my English. My Co-workers and Managers were amazing and super helpful and supportive."
good,Excellent management team who share their knowledge with everyone to accomplish the store and company goals. Excellent benefits with purchase discount at the store.
good,i started working here when i was 16yo and in 20 right now. it was a fun environment and everyday we always learned something new. would definitely recommend this company to other people
good,management and coworkers were all pleasant. good environment. fair opportunities. never really had an issue with my scheduling and days off. id definitely recommend this job to someone else
good,While i worked at American Eagle everything was contempt until customers began to break the law by stealing. My supervisor always made sure his workers were not only ok with their work lives but also contempt with our personal lives as well.
good,"Up coming company, great for students. weekend shift is from Fri -Sun, you havethe rest of the week of to go to school or be at home with your family."
good,"Meet people from all over the area, company gave you the tools and training you need to get the job done. Management support was great and could always be counted on."
good,"On a typical day at work, I would come in, clock in, get my head set, and go talk to a manager on what section they would want me to work. Throughout my shift I would keep the store tidy by keeping the clothes folded or hung nicely. I also interacted with customers on what they needed help with while navigating the store."
good,Work culture was relaxed and chill I really enjoyed it. Th hardest part would be having to travel back and forth to work. Mangament was cool an organized.
good,This is a great place to work. The management team is stellar! Colleagues are helpful and cheerful at all times. This has always been my favorite retailer to work for over the years. AE deilvers the best shopping experience AND working experience ever. This is a company that truly cares for its workers and customer.
good,I was promoted to the stylist position about 2-3 weeks into working at AEO. I learned how to be an efficient leader and how to work in retail. I  currently still work at American Eagle and have loved the working atmosphere and coworkers. Good coworkers and a good management team makes a big difference in the work environment. Everyone is so nice and I have made some amazing friends from this job. The only hard part of this job is maintaining a work schedule that has enough hours to pay the bills. It is hard to get hours during the slow seasons.
good,I was surprised by the family like atmosphere in this environment. Management is able to balance keeping employees productive while maintaining a fun and friendly atmosphere.
good,I enjoyed working this job. Everyone got along well and the discount was amazing. If your into fashion this is a great place to work. The clothes are for everyone not just small individuals or teens.
good,"american eagle is amazing."
good,I learned a lot about working in a professional environment and about customer service. It was a good place to plant my foundation for my future career.
good,A typical day at work is very eventful which I like. I have had in-depth conversation with customers about life and made good connections. The management and employees are wonderful too work with. There is never a dull moment at AEO.
good,"The inventory control department allowed for flexibility with working hours and provided a laid-back atmosphere with regard to dress attire and even overall working environment. Coworkers were friendly and helpful with regard to answering questions. The large size of the company meant that there were always many tasks to be done each day, owing to the large amount of transactions that took place daily, so the position never got boring."
good,I love working the management is nice and the coworkers are as well. BUT you dont really get much hours. Sometimes dealing with the people can be very annoying
good,"As a sales associate/stylist, I absolutely loved this job! You don't have to be a crazy people person, but communication is key! While I was at AEO, I was registered as a stylist. I received that title by becoming interested in their fashion line, and also working the graveyard shift from 8 pm to sometimes early the next morning. This only occurs once a month due to new styles, and new store settings. The benefits are great! Especially if you love to shop! The crew is amazing, and so is the manager. My manager was and still is one of the most amazing people that has come into my life."
good,"American Eagle is a great clothing store with up to date fashion and great prices, followed by great management. The volume of the store is typically high and is has great employee opportunities."
good,"I loved working at American eagle! my management was personable and really outgoing! I loved going to work to such a positive environment! they offer amazing discounts for employees! a typical day at work was folding clothes, straightening up messy piles of clothes to make them look neat. cleaning out dressing rooms ( which can feel really overwhelming sometimes) basic cleaning duties and sometimes ringing people out if your on a cash register! there is always something to do also which makes for  really fast paced work day if you stay busy!"
good,"Empresa con muy buenas condiciones laborales, crecimiento interno pero lento. Los sueldos son buenos apoyados por un bono mensual, dependiendo de las ventas del tienda el bono puede ser completo, medio o nulo."
good,Customers are always fun to talk to managers just say have fun with it and then it will seem genuine. Relate yourself with customers and laugh show them that you are listening. Also they very on top of sales and goals.
good,There was never a boring slow day at AE. I moved up positions rather quickly and i enjoyed learning something new every day. Management team: It always depended on who was working if the day would go smooth or if there would be stress. Hardest part of the job was the hours. They didn't want you to do overtime but you always did either way and it wore you out. Best part of the job was the team you got to work with as well as getting to see and help the regular customers. I made some amazing friends and made some amazing memories.
good,"I loved working In A.E it was fun , i had a lot of cool coworkers, we all got along, everything was chill, it was a fun and safe environment to work in"
good,"Working at AEO is a very relaxed but sales hungry environment. Employees are told to push credit cards, make sales, and dress customers. Each employee has a purpose. "
good,Ωραια καταστηματα!!Καλο προσωπικο και ομορφο περιβαλλον!!
good,"All of my co-workers are what made this job so simple. Everyone had such positive attitudes, were easy to talk/work with and that is a major upside to any office environment. The work it self was tedious at times but my analytical skills made this quite manageable. To be honest I love the job and the people I work with but it is just time for a change."
good,Members of management were always very supportive and encouraging of moving up in the company. Employee discount was amazing! Wonderful company to work for!
good,"American Eagles is an amazing place to work, especially if you love clothes. The team is filled with fun and kind people to be working around. Time flies by very quickly while working because enjoy helping others and satisfying others."
good,"American Eagle has become my second family. I see them more than I see most of my family, and I love every single one of the people I work with. The company itself is so accepting and so welcoming to each person's individuality. American Eagle's clothes are made to make you feel good about yourself while you wear them, which makes this quite the rewarding job. From changing people's minds about not buying something to helping them find exactly what thy came in looking for, there's always a good feeling of accomplishment after every shift."
good,Personally I found the experience at American Eagle a pleasant one with very nice people.  The 60% discount was amazing to use as well as the clothes the store sells
good,You are to preform great customer services and be knowledgeable of the company and their deals during your shift to promote to your customers. Always take it a step further to make the customer feel comfortable.
good,"Ingreso a las 8 am se reciben los niños se anota nombre hora de llegada se proporciona un desayuno se da la bienvenida con canciones se brinda afecto y contacto para contencion, se desarrollan actividades de estimulacion canciones manualidades, outside a jugar, lavado de manos higiene personal almuerzo canciones juego libre tiempo de circletime. Aprendi a conocer la conducta de los niños a sus necesidades, la satisfaccion de proporcionar respuestas a estas, la importancia de incluir normas y reglas de comportamiento que ayudan a mantener una sana rutina y un optimo desarrollo en el aprendizaje, Algo muy importante que aprendi fue aumentar mi conocimiento en el idioma ingles. La direccion y el apoyo por parte de la direccion fue oportuno y eficaz, la parte mas dificil controlar la respuesta a las necesidades de cada niño en particular. lo que mas me gusto el contacto con los niños los vinculos de afecto que se forman y el apoyo de los colegas."
good,From day to day in management there is paperwork in the morning as well at night. During the day our goal is to keep the customer first and selling. We always make sure that we are satisfying the customer and we want to make sure that customers want to come back.
good,This place was my first job. I worked with different backgrounds of people and met many people from different countries. We always played music and had some sort of competition to keep things exciting.
good,Good opportunity for sales experience and personal growth. The management always did a good job. Time-off was never a problem to achieve. Overall great entry-level job.
good,"Great position for students. I have been there for 5 years while working through university. Great culture, amazing ream, and good leadership. Willing to work around your schedule, and are very flexible."
good,it was a good part time job. the management were great to learn from and the staff really made it easy to learn.overall they knew how to work as a team to get the job done.
good,"I absolutely loved working for American Eagle Outfitters, the staff and management were amazing and friendly and kept you up to date on everything going on. Shifts weren't over bearing and always gave a notice if they needed you to stay extra to help. The difficult part was doing floor sets because they're done overnight but it was manageable. The other bad thing was that you had to make goals to keep up your hours but if you did your job well, that shouldn't be an issue!"
good,"Working at AEO is an amazing company to be a part of. They are always progressive in their ideas, staff, and work place. I enjoy my time at AEO and would recommend it for any beginning or entry level job."
good,"While working here, I found myself building up on my customer service by shadowing managers and co-workers. Articulating different ways on how to best handle certain situations."
good,"American eagle for me was a very great experience from working at Forever 21 where the store was much bigger and way more employees. The environment at American Eagle was very pruductive with the head set communication we were able to keep track of sales and motivate others on the floor. Management was very comforting and made you feel as and Asset and not just an employee, they're easy to talk to about any issues and there was always room for growth. Overall I loved my experience at American Eagle."
good,"Fun and energetic place to work in with the friendliest co-workers and bosses. Plus, it smells good all the time and has music playing over speakers, making the environment better for both the associates and customers."
good,"Competitivo, trabajo en equipo. Se manejar ventas por objetivos."
good,A typical day at work for me is cashiering. Everyday I learn to be patient as I work in customer service. I learn the promos for the day. I always fill out a goal card with goals I was to accomplish on my shift. Most of the time I accomplish those goals. I very much like working here at American Eagle.
good,"This is a HUGE company but they still care about every single employee. I've worked in various positions at AE since I was 16 years old, and they get better every year. They do small things to show appreciation for their employees and tell us all the time that WE are the company. I love being a manager here and being able to progress myself and others."
good,"AEO is a great company to work for with a lot of support.  It is a very demanding job within a management team, which can be rough on work/life balance.  They honestly try to give everyone proper work/life balance, but most employees are incredibly committed and the balance gets forgotten about."
good,"Being in the center of Time Square, New York, American Outfitters is constantly filled with local shoppers and tourist from all over the world. The environment was extremely fast pace and sometimes a little messy. However, the sales team was inviting, friendly and overall amazing which made the job a lot easier. The sales managers were serious and understanding. They pushed each sales associate to do their best because we all had a common goal which was to have a successful sales day."
good,it was a fun job when i was 18 my very first job it was alot of detail work folding clothes over and over again but cant complain for my first job. learn a lot of responsibility
good,"working at american eagle is not just about the job but about your peers and their lives and that makes work all the better because you can understand strenths and weekness, commnication is key and thats is something american eagle is about. you learn a lot but it can become stressful during overnighs and major floorsets when time is limited and i think thats the best part of american eagle"
good,Great managers! Nice co-workers. Very good work environment. Favorite part of the day was stock and bringing in the shipment in the mornings.
good,Each day I will be places on the sales floor to recover and replenish. I would also do stock checks. I learned how to fold better then I ever did. My most enjoyable part was shopping and the discounts.
good,This is a great job if you enjoy working around people and clothes. The staff and management were great people to work with. They were caring and considerate. The discount was by far the best part of the job. We received 40% off full price items which was nice.
good,"when you come in you have a meeting with the manager on duty everyday to see where are sales and what needs to be done, "
good,"My manager is great! He makes sure that all of his employees are satisfied everyday! We get great benefits, have great co-workersand get great hours."
good,"I only worked there for a season but it was fun and filled with laughter and i always got to work and left work smiling. Never had a dull day at work, working with them."
good,"On a day to day American Eagle would have lots of  customers come in and out, you had to have very good customer service for there to be sales. American Eagle taught me how to appropriately handle customers. Management at American Eagle is well organized. The co-worker are friendly and helpful when you need it. The hardest part of the job is customer management. The most enjoyable part of the job is being with friendly people in a friendly environment."
good,"Working at AE was one of the most greatest experience I've had working retail. The management and co-workers was absolutely awesome to be around because of polite, respectful, and honest everyone was with one another. I enjoyed the AE atmosphere, just walking into the store gave me a sense of pride and energy to get through the day."
good,"Es una excelente empresa que se mantiene al tanto de las necesidades de sus empleados, mantiene un excelente ambiente de trabajo y superación constante"
good,"The nice part about working here is that there is constant room for growth, since they promote from within. Customer first and be the customer are very big. I enjoy making friends that constantly come back to shop with us. Ive learned many things at this company including stock, sales, and recently promoted and trained on aerie. This is overall a great company to start with if you want to grow."
good,A typical day on the job was very energetic but also rewarding. I started to work in the Aerie department helping customers with bras and sizing. I learned the importance of first impressions especially when it was a girls first time buying her first bra. Many of the experiences where intimate and dealt with personal testimony. The hardest part would be the fact that we only had two fitting rooms and bra sizing takes a while so the line would build up very easy. Most enjoyable part was talking about something I could relate to.
good,"Longer days but more time off, fast paced on your feet work, good pay, good place to work. Pays excellent awesome benefits take care of their employees."
good,"The days are all the same at American Eagle. We make sure our customer is greeted and leave satisfied with what they came in looking for. My co-workers are awesome! I've grown some great relationships with them. My managers are great as well, they have always been there for me through whatever situation. I've learned patience and also to strive and achieve our daily goals."
good,"it is a nice place to debut its fun gives you a lot of opportunity to learn it teaches u alot and its very freindly,and its a very productive and fun work place and its around the beach"
good,"One day I was told to give customers information about our promotions, credit cards, and rewards cards. I made sure each and every person that walked in the store knew about them and knew what they were for. Many rejected me and it made me feel a little discouraged. Some of the customers gave in and gave me a chance to explain what they were for. They understood everything about the promotions, how to get a credit card, and how to get a rewards card. I got credit on the floor and my boss gave me a reward by offering me any free item from the store. Even though it started out being the most difficult part of the job, it ended up being the most enjoyable part of the job. My boss rewarded me and my coworkers applauded me. I learned that if I keep myself encouraged I can achieve greatness, no matter how many times I've been rejected."
good,"Typically I would be organizing merchandise or assisting customers in finding something they would be looking for and from time to time I would do stock or work behind the register. My co-workers were amazing and i had the best managers. The hardest part of the job, there weren't any. the most enjoyable part was working with different people of many different styles and cultures. AE was a great learning experience when it comes down to working with so many different people including customers and learning how to be patient and deal with various situations."
good,"A typical  day at American Eagle was okay. I was mainly an opener so I had to do a lot of things on my own, since it was 1 employee per manager. Having a retail background I had to learn how to do things the American Eagle way verses my previous employer way. The management was on top making sure everything was done by the time their shift was over and if any thing that the employees were on top of their duties."
good,Love being able to work with my co-workers that I became very close with. As well as being able to pick and choose outfits for customers who really ended up enjoying them.
good,The environment is always on an upbeat. There is always work to be done and people to help. Meeting new people everyday would be the best part.
good,"Management, coworkers are all extremely helpful and nice. very loving environment. Working is perfect if you enjoy retail and being hands on."
good,"A typical day at work would include getting to know our customers and find the most amazing people, you can ever meet. We were all about being friends first so our customers were regulars. Management was great. You can really trust them. Co-workers like the customers were amazing people. The hardest part of the job was always closing overnight, or when we got extremely busy. The most enjoyable? well being able to meet great people."
good,A day at American Eagle reflected one's ability to be held accountable to complete tasks directed at the end of the day. I appreciated that my superiors provided me with goals and confided in me accomplishing it before my shift was completed. Each day provided a challenge that made my job exciting. Our stock staff's core principled surrounded unity and security.
good,"This is the second time I have worked for the American Eagle Company. It is definitely a different environment than most jobs. At the moment I work at a location that has an Aerie in their store as well, I was hired as an ""Aerie Girl"" and have worked at a previous Aerie before moving here. Hard work does not go unnoticed there. The store manager does so much for the employees and is just as much of a friend as she is a supervisor. She makes you aware that you are appreciated which is not something I am use to in a workplace environment. Overall, this company does a lot for their employees and it's a very professional as well as a fun place to work."
good,"Experience I have; Sales Associate, Customer Service, Cash Handling, etc. A typical day at American Eagle Outfitters is when everyone is always highly motivated by the team everyday. Management is always highly motivated with the team as well. All of us co-workers work well together; we are like one big family at American Eagle Outfitters."
good,"I was always excited to got to work, and get customers into the right clothes. It always made me feel good knowing I helped someone feel better."
good,"the typical day was running around helping customers find what they needed. i learned how to work in the back and run the right products out for the customers. the management was good, they did what they were supposed to do. the co workers are nice, made some friends while working there. the hardest part was selling some of the products on our busiest days. i didnt really like working at a clothing store."
good,"I was recently hired on at American Eagle Outfitters as a seasonal employee, I have since done a complete floorset, and completed cashier and holiday training sessions. The discounts for associates is great, and coming to work in a relaxed environment is very comforting. I love working for American Eagle while taking classes and making career advancements for the future. Managers are great, understanding, and also do work just as us sales associates do."
good,This Company was fun to work for. They were always evolving and changing which made the job enjoyable.
good,I loved working at American eagle! great employees and great managers I needed a higher paying job so I could afford college.
good,"Typically I would start by unloading box's item by item and scanning them into the system, after each box, I would sort them with the other clothes of that type. The hardest part of that job was black friday, i had to run in and out stocking the floor non stop. But with the help and guidance, it wasn't a bad experience."
good,When hired I had no idea it would only be for a temp position but I do love meeting new people and I enjoy the energry.
good,"Start your day off cleaning up the store from the night before (sweeping, dusting, mopping, cleaning mirrors). Run to bank for deposit. Every day is a learning experience in retail.  Always something new.  My co-workers were much younger than I, but were always interested in what was going on and respectful not only of me but one another. Management and Corporate was always there for support, never afraid to dig in and offer a helping hand. Nothing hard, as long as you stayed busy things got done. Being at work"
good,My overall experience at American Eagle was great.  The managers were helpful and friendly and so were my co-workers.  I had a great time during my seasonal job and it was a fun time as well.  I enjoyed helping customers pick out that perfect outfit for themselves or a friend or family member.
good,"Awesome company to work for esp. if you are in school, they are really flezable with your school scehdule."
good,i liked working here except it is very time consuming i would want it to be more social
good,"Not your everyday job, that is for sure. Learned a lot about different cultures and people. Management was awsome and co-corkers fun poeple to be with. I enjoyed very much the traveling, but been away from my family was kind hard..."
good,"Great management and support staff, fun environment, fair wages"
good,"As an associate, I would clock in and grab my name-tag and Walkie-talkie from the break room, and go back out onto the main floor to assist customers, neaten the clothing sections, and cashier when needed. I learned how to process the store's shipment, the store policies, how to properly fold their clothes, and how to use the register. All managers are great, and very helpful when in need of assistance. My co-workers and I work together as a team, and I have built friendships with all of them. The hardest part of the job was to learn how to use the register, but now i rarely ask for assistance. The most enjoyable part of working at American Eagle Outfitters is that one will grow close with his or her co-workers, and make work productive and fun."
good,"Manage the cash wrap and cashiers. Auditing drawers upon each shift change, as well as pull hourly reports on a daily basis."
good,"Working at AEO, was one of the best experiences of my life. Work was very laid back, and a fun, upbeat environment."
good,"American Eagle was a company WELL devoted to customer service, and also policy and procedures. Even though it was looked at as ""a pert time job folding clothes,"" there was a lot that was intertwined with the job. With that being said, they taught me a lot of morals and responsibility there, making me, in my opinion, a better worker. American Eagle also taught me a lot about the business end of retail, in which I was oblivious too before becoming an employee. The experience of working here was amazing, and I would do it all again if I had too."
good,Great staff and management.  Fun and outgoing staff. Able to be yourself while working. 
good,"a typical day at work would include stocking the clothing shelves, cleaning, organizing, always greeting every customer that enterede the store & educating them on our promotions. we watched a video clip every shift to update us on new styles etc. "
good,If u love casual cute clothes and friendly people great place to work
good,"Very busy work environment, you were always on the go which I didn't mind because time flew by really fast."
good,"Typical day at work: recieve truck, sort and prepare stock for the floor or back room. Assist with customers on the sales floor when finished with stock in the back room"
good,American Eagle is very flexible with your schedule. Perfect for students or someone looking to make a couple extra dollars each month.
good,American Eagle is a fast paced customer service related environment with challenging management requirements. A typical day depends on the shift. Opening consists of specific goals and tasks related to the daily workflow tasking vs. sales ratio and employee management. The closing shift is more sales focused with the last few hours guided towards store product replenishment and banking related concerns. I learned leadership on multiple levels as well as Point of Sale specifics and many other programs related to high traffic sales environments. The hardest part of the job was constant shift fluctuation. The most enjoyable part was the customer interaction.
good,"Worked for American Eagle outfitter it was like an school for me , they teach the principles of an excellent customer service, they right way to approach and engage the customer , so they don't feel harass or intimidate by the employee but they can be comfortable and acquainted with the store and it associates. i learnt to work with the register as a cashier and also to inventory."
good,The company is excellent I love what I do but the airline industry is not as stable as it used to be. The company overall is a great place to work.
good,Can get very busy at times but is always very fun to go to. Management ar cool and down to Earth and very easy to talk to. Co workers are very easy to get along with. Customers can be difficult at times.
good,"I would update reports in the morning, unload trucks, fix errors on total counts of freight, and audit cases with errors and then create balance to fix errors."
good,If you are goal orientated and business focused this company is for you. High sense of urgency and determination for results are very necessary.
good,A typical day at work including me getting to work in the morning and working a short shift. Co-workers were kind of like family. Had great benefits. The hardest part of the job was the overnight floor sets and most of the time I enjoyed them.
good,"Set up displays, Greet Customers and make sure they have the best customer service I can present. Normally I am assigned to a task and thats my task for the day. Since the Store is very busy we try to make sure that our customers are being helped at all times. I learned Customer service is the number one priority.The Co-workers that I had were friendly and stayed to themselves. The hardest part of the job was meeting goals on slow days. The most enjoyable is making sure the customers leave satisfied."
good,A typical day at work for me was fun and very life changing because working at American Eagle was a great experience. Something that i learned was great communication skills and good customer service. The thought of helping many people within one day brings me joy and helps me feel accomplished. Everyone i worked with were great and we all showed leadership. Helping each other was another part of our job and the managers were respectable and they worked hard to keep our store in shape and bring smiles to our costumers faces. There were not many difficult times during my time of working with American Eagle but something that took patience was folding everything up and putting cloths back into order almost every Minuit. My favorite thing about working there was the thought of this wanting to be my first job and i got accepted to work there and also just meeting and greeting new people.
good,"My first job was considered ""big box"" retail, at Old Navy, so when I transitioned to American Eagle it was an adjustment, that I have come to love working for, the only reason I am looking to leave this job is because I am interested in leaving retail entirely and start something new. If someone asked me where would be a great place to work, American Eagle is a wonderful place to learn and grow, learn about operational functions and how to interact on a one-on-one basis with customers and associates and become a better manager by doing so."
good,"While working with American Eagle I’ve had the opportunity to make great friends with co-workers and management. They’re so helpful when it comes to advice both professional and personal. As of the date of this review, I’m still very close with my ex co-workers and management. Overall, a great first job."
good,I enjoyed learning about a retain business within American Eagle Outfitters. Although customer service in New York isn't the easiest I learned to deal with every kind of situation as well as enjoy the energy of giving back to customers.
good,"I love working at American eagle. I never thought i could find such a hone like environment at a work place. I love being able to help the guest find an outfit they feel absolutely amazing in. However, I do not feel like I am moving up as fat as i feel like I should. I have worked a couple roles within my store. I was stock lead for a couple months and then I was given the opportunity to open and close the store like most managers and I love it and wanted that to be my job full time"
good,"This is the first retail job I have ever worked, and made my opinion on working retail change, and made working so easy and comfortable. I wouldn't want any other retail job unless it was better than the one I have now."
good,"Ever since I started working at American Eagle Outfitters, I enjoy working with my managers and associates but however I would like to work more days and hours."
good,I enjoy giving people my opinion about a certain style or clothing. People enjoy when we interact with them and help them save money by signing up for rewards.
good,"I always had an amazing time working with my coworkers and managers. My shifts were fast paced, but fun and the discounts were great! I highly recommend this as fantastic starter job"
good,"I’m a sales associate. What I do consists of putting clothing back on the shelves, keeping everything neat and folded, selling to and casually engaging with guests, managing the fitting rooms, and checking people out at the register. You aren’t expected to do it all at once since multiple team members will be at their designated zones. "
good,"Good place to work, managers work with you don’t ask much if you. Really nice people there I can’t think of no bad thing. I only stop working there because they didn’t pay enough"
good,Company gives ample payroll to accomplish the things that need to get done. This was far different than anything else I experienced at any other retail company I worked for!
good,"Upon being hired for stock associate, "
good,Lobed dealimg with customers interactions with fellow co workers made me gain a common groumd about my self  i loved the way i was trrated i felt very comfortable
good,"Always on your toes, constantly learning new things, fun environment, best company to work for. Treated fairly and there are incentives for doing good work."
good,"Working at American Eagle was one of the most fun experiences I ever had the work place was relaxed,calm, and collected even on black friday I would say was my favorite experience in my time working there."
good,"Great time training new staff, We would create a welcoming environment for customers. Making sure the store was full of product and if we had sell through making adjustments in real time. Pushing to beat our last years numbers."
good,"Ambas empresas tenían un ambiente laboral muy divertido, los gerentes estaban siempre atentos y disponibles ante cualquier situación"
good,American Eagle is a great place to work at. The fact that it teaches you so much about customer service and responsibility as well as organization and time management is a bonus. Not only that but the other employees as well as managers are so understanding and give off a great vibe that makes you feel great about coming into work. I totally recommend this job.
good,"There was always something to do there, you would make sure things would get done in the store, make sure your numbers would good and lastly try to make the job fun. I enjoyed meeting different people and helping them with anything they needed."
good,I love working here. The people that I get to help out everyday and my management team makes this job super special to me. The culture is amazing and everyone treats you like you should be.
good,American eagle is a fun place to work at but can get fast paced at times. All the employees are friendly and we all have a good time working there because the job requires you to deal with people and be outgoing.
good,"American Eagle was a super laid back place to work. made my schedule, came in after class or after baseball and done my work and got out. also had amazing friends"
good,I love working at American Eagle. I started out working as a part time seasonal worker and ended up getting hired year round. The managers are all really nice and easy to work with. The store itself is well run and very organized. My one complaint is it can be hard to get hours.
good,Great place to work. Friendly staff and very flexible hours. It is a great place to work during the holidays. Hours go down after the holiday season but still a great place to work.
good,"I had the most fun working at American Eagle.  Not only was I always busy, but my team made everyday fun.  The customers were of all types which helped me to grow as a person all around, learning different styles."
good,If you're looking to work in retail this is the place for you. The discounts with this company is VERY good. The work environment is fun but productive. If you're looking to advance then that is something that is possible if you voice your decision.
good,Build friendships with employees and customers which makes them feel comfortable to return to your work place with confidence. Great opportunity for sales & growth within the company. Great discounts as well.
good,"Great place to work"

good,"I love working here!! It’s a calm, easy going environment. The people I work with are super friendly and accepting! It’s easy to learn and you can catch on fast!"
good,"To greet customers, fold clothes, and have them in order. Look up where clothes are in the back. Check if everything is stocked and on shelves, and neat and in order. A typical day goes by fast because customers keep you busy. I learned how ear pieces work and how to communicate with co workers through radio. I also learned a lot about being a sales associate, and on how to keep clothes in order on shelves and hanging racks. The management is very friendly and are happy to hire you. They make your work experience a lot easier. Most co workers were laid back and friendly and helpful. There to answer questions and they create a nice culture. The hardest part may be standing on your feet all day, or folding clothes if you are not to good at it. The best part is helping customers find what they need and working with other employees. Working together helps get both of your jobs done. Overall I would recommend this job if you would like to have a little bit of fun during work."
good,"Having it as my first job, I love it. My co-workers there are great and we can all go through a normal fairly well. Management is great and make the learning process very easy. My experience there is amazing and i love working there."
good,"American Eagle has by far been my favorite retail job! Lots of fun promotions, great employee discount, and fun sales goals with prizes! Very sales driven and expected to sign customers up for our credit card program and rewards program"
good,A typical work day would essentially keep you pretty busy depending on the location. My location was constantly packed so it was never too slow. My management team was really awesome and they were always willing to help/teach.As always the customers can be exhausting but they can also be great.
good,"Love working here. This place hired me with no prior retail experience and I love it. Great environment work in, nice managers and coworkers. Easy job if you have people skills."
good,"Working in USA was like American Dream. My 1st  work experience  ever. Internship Program: Work and Travel. That time was like : Dream Completed to be in US. About the Job was something which i never experienced before, to make my own money and  out of the country. I was very proud of.  I experienced something totally new, culture, people, management."
good,"I enjoyed working there.  AEO only hires part time employees thus allowing for excellent opportunities to pursue other activities.  It's a perfect job for students, 2nd job, people looking to supplement their income.  Benefits for purchasing clothing are excellent."
good,Everyone is quite friendly and I always enjoy going to work knowing that I won't only be working but having a good time.  Once you start working there you instantly become part of the family.
good,I love AEO! The managers are fun and respectful always willing to help you out. I have only been with the company for a short time but they have become very special to me. I love the discounts and just won a work raffle for $40 free item! They also have a wall of awesome to recognize hard working employees! It's so nice to be complimented by managers and fellow staff.
good,American Eagle has insanely good discounts and the management is full of sweet and helpful people. There are multiple opportunities for competition and advancement and the work environment is very relaxed and fun.
good,It was a great place to work at everyone is fun filled and you met a lot of new people and you just get along with everyone you met and helping the customers was always fun.
good,"-great brand"
good,"Great environment, great company I just really wish I could get more hours at my store so I can improve and get much more experience. It's a great job if you're going to school though"
good,"Laboraba 8 horas al día con una hora de comida, al llegar al establecimiento había que ponerse al tanto de todo, metas, bono, pendientes, incidencias, planeación actual, etc. Para así poder estar preparados para comenzar un nuevo día laboral."
good,"At AE I got lots of hours and made a ton of new friends. The people and culture of the store was great and everyone had such a fun vibe. I loved going to work, while I worked there."
good,Working in American Eagle was always great. The benefits of discounts were amazing and the people were great. Definitely a great place for a first job in retail.
good,"I have only good things to say about American Eagle. When there have been any problems, I have mentioned something to a manager and thing have helped out as much as they can with fixing it. They see hard workers and reward them. It is a great place if you don't have much retail experience, or even f you have lots!"
good,"Depending on what I am scheduled to do or what day it is really determines how the day will go. If I am working on shipment, I must work efficiently in order to get shipment received at the store unpacked and placed properly. If I am working with sales, the work environment is pretty relaxed unless it is a busy day when you are constantly greeting and helping customers which can be enjoyable when they leave with a smile on their face. From working at American  Eagle, I have learned better communications skills with not only coworkers and managers, but with people in general and this job has really allowed me to come out of my shell and become a more personable person."
good,"Working at American Eagle I help customers when in need, and I am also a cashier. This job has taught me a lot about customer service and that I enjoy working with people. The management team here is very understanding and easily approachable when it comes to questions/ concerns. The hardest part of the job for me is getting people to sign up for credit cards. The most enjoyable part of the job is relating to customers and helping them in whatever way they need."
good,"I really liked working at AEO, the management I worked under and with was really great. They have high standards, but they give you all of the tools necessary to meet the store's goals as well as your personal goals.  The job is nice because you are allowed to wear whatever you sell in the store - meaning shorts, dresses, crop tops, etc. The hardest part can be working with difficult customers, or if you don't have a great management team that can be tough as well!"
good,I really enjoyed my time working there. The schedules became a problem for me while I was playing sports in high school. Work hear was very enjoyable non the less no complaints.
good,"I always look forward to working here, and that says a lot about a retail-focused job. I am constantly interacting with people, and I am proud of my accomplishments day by day. We have daily goals, frequent contests, and a management team that knows what they're doing and treats us as they would their own family. My coworkers are all now friends of mine. The connections made with people are my favorite part about the job. I wish it paid above minimum wage, but we do get significant discounts on product. The hardest part of the job is coming in with low energy or sleep, and trying to deal with the constant flow of activity while you're exhausted."
good,"Fun, lively place to work. Works well with school schedules and can even be on the floorset team only rather than being a sales associate."
good,"Work would consist of a lot of folding clothing and keeping store well-cleaned, had to keep a watchful eye on trespassers, scammers, or thieves who would try to steal, learned how to stocking and package shipment/orders for customers, management was very nice everyone could cooperate with each other."
good,Since working there ive learned to have more patients with people. Working in retail requires you to have a lot of patients because of all the customers. I love all the people that I work with and the work environment is a very friendly one.
good,"At American Eagle I would fold clothing, greet customers, stock shelves, and help with closing the store. I enjoyed all the people I worked with and spoke to, well an employee at American Eagle. This is a fantastic place to work the people are wonderful and extremely friendly."
good,"I was an assistant manager, so anyone that has been in that role before knows that its you work just as many hours and long hours as the store managers.   My store manager was awesome, friendly, and genuinely kind! Everyone under her was the same way."
good,"All of my fellow associates and managers are very outgoing, nice, and fun.  I enjoy going to work and have fun doing my job."
good,"American Eagle's central focus is based on technology driving sales and the overall customer experience. Very passionate about developmental opportunities for lower level managers, as well as store managers."

good,"I work with costumers to ensure they are satisfied with sizes, colors, and different styles of clothing while providing exceptional service and process cash and credit transactions."
good,Working for AE was one of my favorite jobs. The people who work there are all so hardworking always positive looking out for the customers and trying to make sure their experience is spectacular and nothing less!
good,"American Eagle is perceived as a laid back company, and the work environment is just that. That isn't to say that work doesn't get done, because trust me, plenty gets done at AE, but it is to say that there is a sense of flow to the work environment. Of course, there are challenges, as with any job. However, the good outweighs the bad, and there is always something to learn with each hurdle you clear. Overall, the company provides great personnel training, and utilizes technology better than most in the field. Morale is also better than most, in that everyone works together which creates a real sense of teamwork, from the regional manager down to the associates. As far as the work itself goes, making the customer's day is always the best part of the job."
good,"I liked it there but retail wasn't for me, when people didn't want to be helped it was almost as though the managers expected me to force conversation upon them"
good,"AE Outfitters breaks their store into three zones. First is the front, greeters area. Followed by the cashiers - middle. And ending with the back - fitting rooms. More often than not you'd find me in the front of the store, greeting customers, providing customer service, informing them of special offers and everything in between. Never had a problem with management, great environment overall. The hardest part of the job was translating Portuguese and Eastern European languages. As the store's only bi-lingual worker, I was able to deconstruct basics from Romance Languages and Latin, to better understand the needs of the customer. I enjoyed helping customers that other workers would walk past."
good,"Typical day is working on the floor with customers assisting them to find products they need/want."

good,"Coming into work everyday was exciting and joyful. I learned new things and felt so close with my co-workers. The work environment was a family. I'm so easy, level-headed and full of life. I love being happy. When things had gotten hard or hectic we worked even harder to get things done."
good,"I very much enjoyed this job. I enjoyed going to work every day because I got to work one on one with customers. I got to take angry or disappointed customers and make their day take a complete turn for the better. I learned a lot about people how to work with all types of personalities. My managers were very nice and friendly. They loved to come across more as a co-worker that I can trust versus a manager that is mean. The hardest part of the job would have been trying to set everyone up for the credit card, but the most enjoyable part of the job would have been being able to make the customers day and always being able to put a smile on their face."

good,The managers are willing to compensate for times the employee cannot show up for work or need days off for a reasonable amount of time. Pays on time.

Fun and positive environment withe mainly younger people and music to keep the mood light and friendly. Ear pieces to keep the employees and the managers in constant communication throughout the shifts. Get off work on time.
good,"My typical day at work. Clock in, Talk to my floor managers about what i will be doing today and get to work. I will usually be greeting because i am such an amazing greeter. Received 3 awards there."
good,"AEO is an excellent company to work for, especially if you are a college student. Great discount for employees, fun ""games"" to win prizes and incentives, and great people. i worked at AE for 6 years, and if you make management aware that you want to move up, they will move earth and fire to help you. the questionnaire you take when hired also tells management how to treat you as an individual, as well at what your strengths and weaknesses are, which is a great tool! there is a level of trust and dedication to get the job done and a sense of reliance, making you feel like you are making a difference in the hard work that you put forth. not to mention the relationships built through hard times (Like the holiday season!) that have truly lasted a lifetime."
good,"Working at the airport was very laid back. Once a plane was on the ground you had to be prompt and on time. If a plane was schedule to be on the ground @9:30pm it's best to be at the gate by 9:15pm ready to park & unload. We had to clear all path ways on the ground, prepare needed equipment, & more. When waiting in between planes it was a very relax work setting and comfortable employees. I only gave the compensation & benefits a four because what employee wouldn't want a little more. Overall I enjoyed working for them and being able to travel."

good,"Aircraft care, worked here for over 12 years. Nice work envioment."
good,"I never thought i would hold a job at the mall. I walked in to make a purchase and ended up walking out with an application filled out, handed in, and an interview scheduled. I was checking out and the cashier was trying to make more sales. I informed him that I had little money and was in the process of looking for a job. Come to find out the man behind him who was also in the conversation was the hiring manager. He recommended me to fill out an application. The next week I was back in for an interview and got the job. The first day I was a little shy, not sure exactly what to do but with their training and guidance I slipped right into the motion and you never would have thought me to be new. I love the fact that your constantly moving and have a task to do. Another great aspect is its a social enviroment; you're constantly in communication with a customer or your co-workers. They had music and all very welcoming. They were very understanding and not a lot of pressure was put on you. There was also room for me to grow and use my leader skills. If I lived closer I would walk-in and reapply. I left there because I moved to Alabama for the summer. I hope to find a job that inspires me as much as AEO has."
good,I love meeting new people and showing them our product and helping them decide and organize their purchases

If you work for one of the larger retail stores you will have many co-workers who are usually more than willing to take your shifts or switch shifts with you so you don't have to plan around your job. As long as you give enough notice, most retail employers will have no problem giving you certain days off as long as the day you are requesting is not a busy holiday or you can find someone to cover for you. Shifts are often only 3-6 hours long so you may find that even on days you work you will still have almost the whole day to do whatever you please. This is very convenient for anyone who is attending college and looking for a part- time job."

From the  12 hours i worked it seemed to be a very friendly and optimistic environment."
good,I absolutely love working for AEO. Of course it has a typical retail environment but I honestly enjoy everyone I work with. The pay is not that great but is made up for with the discount you are given.

good,"The management team works together well, the associates are given recognition and rewards when the team exceeds goals and when they go above and beyond. We have high standards for cleanliness and visuals but all share in the work. Seeing how the customers appreciate our friendly staff and great clothes is really nice.

good,"A typical day at work usually consists of fixing merchandise on the floor, refilling merchandise on the floor, ringing out customers, and picking and packing online orders that we receive. I learned that a store's success is truly a team effort and that if you show the amount of work ethic you have it will get you far. Management has always been fantastic and very casual. The hardest part of the job is the guilt of not having a good day as a store financially. The most enjoyable part is being surrounded by people that support you and laugh with you while also knowing that you are helping the company as a whole."
good,"Working for the company tought  me about sales, team effort and working together. They were very helpful and flexible with scheduling. They’re is also wats to receive extra income by meeting your goals."

good,Typical day centered around customer servicing and upselling of units of clothing. Working collectively to provide exceptional service for all customers.
good,"this was one of the best jobs that I ever had. Management was the most amazing group of people. They really built connections and friendships with associates. I had started off an a sales associate and since I had full availability I made it known that I wanted to grow with the company. I was then moved up to be an opener and this job would require me to clean the store, set up, pick and package online orders etc. This also allowed them to let me pick items that would go onto the sales floor and arrange it. I then became a rock associate and started doing shipments for them and putting them away into the stock room and moving some of those items onto the floor an taking other things down. They gave me so many opportunities and they saw potential in me as an associate that I didn't see."
good,"Very demanding, it's a lifestyle. I had to wear the clothes we were selling on the floor at that time,the employees were walking billboards. With a 50% discount. I made it fun by having sales contests with prizes like clothes or money. We were a family, we had to be we were together more than we were with our families and I even being the boss wouldn't ask anyone to do anything I wouldn't do. I would clean the bathroom or scrape gum off the floor if it was my turn . I made everyone feel equal but not to comfortable to not forget the fact that I am the boss. I would never fraternize with my co workers. I kept it professional and fair."
good,"great company to work for, cares about there people"
good,super fun environment to work in. co-workers are awesome. very approving of flexible schedules. The clothes are super cute. The discount is great. overall great place.

You would get points for getting customers to sign up for rewards, sign up for credit cards. for cleaning duties. highest sales, etc. At the end of the month the manager would tally up the points and the person with the most points would become employee of the month for the entire month that person would receive additional discounts on purchases, pick a prize from the prize box (they were really good prizes)."
good,"Friendly environment, always encouraging, motivated, tracking our everyday goal, always putting yourself first as a challenge in order to succeed your goal."
good,"This was a great job for students, I was able to create friendships with many great people. The managers were outgoing and understanding. It was a great environment, the holidays were always so much fun and we got free food."

good,"I loved working for American Eagle Outfitters! I made a lot of friends from my co-workers. We were all one big family and worked competitively to push each other to sell as many AEO credit cards, certain items, etc. for the day. On the floor, I would assist customers to fit whatever their needs were. The easiest part was folding clothes and putting things back where they belong. This was particularly easy for me because I am a clean freak and need everything to be in order. There wasn't ever a hard part of the job for me because I enjoy being around people and helping them pick out things to wear. I feel that I have a pretty good sense of fashion and love to see their faces when they leave satisfied with what they want. Overall, it was a great environment and a successful job for me and anyone else to have."
good,"American Eagle is very up to date with clothing trends, the music is always up and coming. It is a younger crowd of people that work there always so that's nice if you're a millennial. If you're willing to take the time to actually work while you're there, this is the place for you."
good,Worked during the seasonal holiday and loved it got a lot of hours afterwards and enjoyed work management is good as well the hardest part about the job was writing so much down about what to do
good,"A typical day at American Eagle was I would clock in and immediately start helping customers whether it would be finding a certain type of jean or getting their clothes sized. If the store wasn't busy, I would go around the store and organize clothes according to size. I was in the change room a lot helping customers get their sizes or I was a greeter during the busier days. At American Eagle, I learned that work can get stressful at times but it is important to stay positive for my other co workers but most importantly the customers. The hardest part of the job was the over night shifts because we had to rearrange the store in a matter of hours before the morning but it was a good experience."
good,"Great place to work, and the people who work there are great. Everyone is very relaxed and professional. Management is very flexible and understanding with school schedules."
good,Great for learning the basics of the apparel/retail industry. The only complaint I had was that they tend to over hire and therefore I wasn't given many hours. The discount is great and the clothes are easy to sell. The store is usually very relaxed.

The management and other superiors would engage with their employees in a positive manner to make sure tasks were being completed and that each individuals wellbeing was being maintained.
good,working at AEO was an amazing experience and very enjoyable. I would recommend it to any young adult or high school student looking to start their career.
good,"I learned a lot about myself as well as the company and it went stressful to head into work everyday.  If I did not have to relocate, I would have stayed with this company for a while.  I enjoyed working as the stock lead and I would happily do it again."
good,"I mostly worked mornings which meant I prepped the store (cleaned floors, counters, dressing rooms, and go backs) after my manager would check my work if all was well I would take my first 10 min break to get it out of the way when I came back other than my personal goals I was given tasks to do in between guests. Everything was straight forward and organized and once I got in the groove of what was expected my manager would help me better myself by giving me extra goals I didn't consider doing myself and I would exceed them goals like 20 ccs in my shift or 5 500 dollar transactions and more. Everyday was a good day for me I worked for another company and was being paid more there but i quit that job for AEO i don't regret it at all i do regret leaving AEO for a job closer to school and higher paying. in 2 months ill be done with school and have already started the process of being a freelance social media manager and have been considering going back to my AEO family."
good,I had a wonderful time working in American eagle outfitters customers were friendly and respectful and so was the managers plus the discounts were amazing
good,The people I worked with were great. Management team was awesome. They understood when life happened and they worked with me on anything I needed. They should hire more than managers as full time so people can actually love off this job but they don't.

good,"AEO was my first job, sophomore year of high school! It was so different from anything I had done, and I learned so much working under the managers at AEO. I learned to handle cash and cards, apply for credit and inform people on the merchandise and payments."
good,"I enjoyed working here. This was my first job in highschool and it got me out of my shell. I was nervous speaking to people at first, but the crew and management went above and beyond to make me feel welcome, providing me with the necessary skills to become a successful customer service represenative."
good,A typical day would be walking into the shift and helping customers on the sales floor look for what they need. I would then follow up and ring them up in the cash register.

good,"Restaurant servers ensure that patrons have an enjoyable dining experience by providing quality customer service.  work in the front of the business taking orders, serving food and drinks, and removing dinnerware from the table in a timely manner. Cashier collected cash and credit cards payments."
good,A typical day at work was clocking in early and learning about the promotion of the day. Then going into your station and organize all the clothes and ready for when the stored open. I would sell and bring back everything that was missing for when the next group of customers can see it perfect. The hardest part of the job was trying to always keep the store's goal high on a slow day. The most enjoyable part of my job was being with my co-workers and just enjoying being at work selling and having fun.
good,"Amercian Eagle is a great job I love it their. I was an sales associate I greeted customers, folded clothes and make sure clothes are stocked. I love each of my my mangers because they treat us as if we are their children. The hardest part about the job is standing up for 8 to 9 hours a day especially in uncomfortable shoes. The most enjoyable part is socialize with other associate because we all are very friendly with one another."

Ce qui est amusant avec AEO c'est que chaque employer n'est pas en commission; on doit atteindre l’objectif de vente tout en équipe. Le seul problème serait qu'on n'a vraiment pas autant d'heure que ça. Je fais 3h a chaque semaine. Donc les paies sont médiocre. Par contre, on peut profiter de bon rabais dont 60% dans le magasin et 25% sur le 60% des linges in solde (donc 85%)."

There were just as many managers as there were people so they really didn't stick out or say much except for tell you when to take a break and when to go home.

good,"I loved working here. It provided time away from the stresses of college and more time to explore my fashion desires. The manager was really nice and easy going. A typical day at work was having conversations with people and providing knowledge on products they were interested in. A person have to be a good communicator and sales person to also persuade people into buying more items. I had fun giving people completely new wardrobes and helping people find things they might like. The hardest part of the job, on busy days you can not afford to have one on one experience with everyone who shops there time management is well needed."

It was fun I always had a good time with the workers there the environment was great but it was just a seasonal job. I loved working with clothing and helping customers with what they wanted and loved to wear. The hardest part of the job was when I had to stay over night to do the new displays for new clothing coming out the next day. I loved being a part of the American Eagle crew."
good,"The Customer Service Skills that Matter, being an interaction where the time spent with the customer was used to better understand their problems and needs from the company. Customers appreciate an employe who will see their problem through to its resolution. At the same time, you must have good time management skills and not spend too much time handling one customer while others are waiting. Stay focused on your goals to achieve the right balance. Being suppotive to customers and your self is growth of a business. Teamplayers get the job done."

The employees help each other during and after hours if someone is little behind in their station. Everyone's personality their in my experience is very bubbly and friendly and eager to help. The hardest part of the job was to make sure that while I was stacking clothes or restocking them, that I pay attention at the same time to see if there are any customers wandering around needing assistance. The most enjoyable part is seeing my customers happy when I helped them find a size or a color that's perfect for them. Being able to provide the best fit for my customers and seeing them leave with a smile is the best feeling."

good,"Very good environment to work in, great company to work for."
good,"While most teenagers work in restaurants, I was fortunate enough to work at my favorite clothing store! Not only was it super fun but I was also able to learn a lot about customer service and business policies. I also believe that every teenager should have the experience of working in retail because whenever I go into another store, I am always respectful of displays and try to put things back exactly how I got them because I know it takes a lot of work to keep the store clean."
good,"Awesome company! Very customer service orientated, and treat their employees very well! Very nice associate discount!!"
good,Great Place to work for. Company put employees first. Over the many years of working here AE is the best always making selling and styling easy and fun.
good,"A typical day is spent organizing clothes, finding outfits customers make take a liking to and working the cash register. After working there I had learned how important it is to be honest with the customer: if something fades quickly or isn't of the best grade of material. The management there couldn't be better, they are hard workers and great role models. There are many co-workers so its hard to have a great team created with everyone but individual tasks were always done well. Fitting rooms was the hardest part of the job, it is important to stay organized and know when its okay to put clothing items back. Being on the floor and helping customers find the perfect outfit is the most enjoyable part of the day."

good,As a sales associate i was responsible for making sure the customers were satisfied with the products also helping with various types of situation when it came to helping the customers or the members in the store.
good,The environment was always very welcoming a lot of communication between customers and associates.
good,"Starbucks is very well known for the benefits they provide there entry-level employees, so I'm not even going to talk about that. What I am going to talk about, however, is the atmosphere Starbucks believes that if you treat all your employees with respect they, in-turn, will treat each other and the customers with respect as well. I can say first hand that is true. If you get a chance to work at Starbucks TAKE IT!!!!! - Who doesn't like free coffee?"
good,Great place to work. It is extreamly fast paced and they day flys by. The management is kinda of stale.
good,"Great environment to work at. Such loving co-workers!! My managers were nice and helpful and listened with whatever you came to them with. A day at work would either be really busy or really slow. I got the chance to experience both and I enjoyed every minute of it. Helped customers with apparel and fitting rooms, folded apparel when needed and assisted customers when needed. There will be times where you have rude customers but you just have to be professional and keep a smile on no matter what. I loved the music they would play while we worked. I loved this job! although I was only hired as seasonal I still enjoyed every minute of it."
good,"At American Eagle, I manage everything that happens in the back room. My responsibility includes processing the incoming shipment, organizing the excess shipment in the shelves, and transferring out past season product. I lead a team anywhere from two to five people, depending on how much needs to be done, but most of the time I am working alone under minimal supervision. I also work closely with the management team to ensure the proper product gets to the floor when it is needed and that the clearance product is properly tagged and organized. When needed, I also work on the floor as a sales associate and cashier."
good,Enjoyed pushing back & parking planes. Unloadin & loading planes. Stocking & customer services.
good,At Corporate every day was new. It was a very exciting new environment for me. The company was always trying to keep you informed and involved. Employees got free items to keep up with the trends at work. I learned that even if you do not like a particular job that you can still learn something. As a technical designer I was required to measure garments that came into the office. I also got to sit in on some fittings and other attributes in the office. The most enjoyable part was getting to know my co-workers and always being around fashion. It is a great Company.
good,"A typical day at work for me is just talking to customers; making sure they are satisfied, assist them in any way, and completing their transactions at the cash. Management consists of fantastic people (they could give more hours to existing employees rather than hiring new ones). My co-workers are fantastic! We are like a family. The hardest part of my job is doing floorset (bringing the old clothes in and the new ones out). Other than that I enjoy every aspect of my job."
good,"Good environment, Over time available, flexible hours available."
good,"A typical day in American Eagle is a very fast work pace environment, I learned many things such as  inventory counts and labeling goods.

good,i enjoyed helping customers purchase items. Everyone got a long and was very nice to each other. I learned patience is a key factor when helping customers.
good,Loved working at American Eagle . The team I started with was like my second family. Only complaints is the new management they hired after the original group that opened the store. Not very knowledgeable with running a store that big with so many employees
good,Everyone loves to be in style. But to work in a place that has such a fun level of style is an opportunity you can pass up. Working with the customers and social media of this store is great to be apart of. Co-workers are always happy and the managers are just as relaxed and productive. I've learned how to multitask and keep up with the flow of the store.
good,Es muy emocionante este trabajo ya que todos los dias suceden cosas buenas y malas diferentes y el trato con personas de todas partes del mundo y conocer sus culturas es muy padre.
good,"I honestly wish I was going to Coastal Carolina instead of University of South Carolina so I could continue to work there. In June of 2011 I applied to two jobs, one on which I never heard from and then American Eagle. It was my first job, and I loved it. You hear from many people that the first job usually lasts no more than a month or two, I've been working at that job for two and a half years (on and off due to college) The associates were great, the management were great, you got to see hot girls all day long and work on your flirt game (oddly enough this was a part of my job - flirt with girls to increase sales)"

The hardest part about the job is probably being a cashier and trying to get the line down as customers come to  check out. I enjoy everything about the job I get to help customers and help them pick out clothes and help them with their style, and my managers making it a very easy going environment to work in"

good,"Process and Receive shipments, process and organize clothing, clean stockroom, bathrooms,and main sales floor, inventory, restock shelves and main floor, dress bust forms, prep floor sets. I learned the ends and outs of a retail store, how to stay organized and stay focused. The managers were awesome very informational and worked by the rules and always had projects for me. My co-workers were a fun group and very fun to work with. I mainly worked alone but we all interacted through out the day. The hardest part of my job was the first week got swamped with 164 boxes of merchandise four days in a row but still managed to get it all done. The most enjoyable part of the job was the awesome staff and 50% off."
good,"we are a family at american eagle, we all get along and our goal is to help customers and reach our sales goal."

good,"I really like working with all my co-workers, it's a very relaxing place to work. I really get a long with everyone. I make sure all the new merchandise is out on the floor, also have to make sure all the mannequins are up to date with the new merchandise. Have to make sure all the tables and walls are set up as wanted. There really isn't anything hard that i have had to experience yet."
good,"I just started this job recently and I can already say I love this job. "
good,"we are always occupied and never had the time to linger around, our managers made sure that we had something to do. i learned a lot from my co-workers not just about our job but also culture wise."
good,Great place to work. There was a great employee discount and fun atmosphere. Lots of conferences to attend to meet the other store managers in the district and in the northeast.
good,"A typical day at work would be reviewing promotions and making sure to notify all customers of American Eagle's signature styles as well as new ones to reach the day's sales goals. "
good,"Always had fun at work, but we kept it professional at the same time. I learned how to approach a customer with enthusiasm and tell them about our sales and our cards. As i got more confidence in talking to customers i learned how to get a customer to sign up for our rewards card. MY co workers were amazing to work with. We all got along and helped each other out with out having to ask."
good,Awesome place to work. Employees get a discount on merchandise.
good,"The discount was amazing here but retail will always be retail to me. Management was awesome with our schedules and understood we had school etc. Our co workers made up a wonderful team and we worked together. The hardest part of the job was having people come into our store and act as if we don't work hard enough already and throw clothes all over. We therefore, would have to follow behind them and clean up their mess. The most enjoyable part was proving not only to myself, but to everyone including management that I worked with that I can do anything they ask. I was trained on Register shortly after I was hired and quickly became the number one credit card sales lady! I opened up 22 credit cards in one hour and I didn't get anything for it but I was proud of myself and so was my team."
good,"Great company to work for. Much room for advancement and growth. As a asst. manager i got to do a lot of things.  I learned visuals and how to make schedules and forecast sales for the week, month. I got to learn about loss prevention and shipment receiving and sending.  Great team at the store, very close. Enjoyed my peers and employees."
good,"informed customers about promotions, helped sell clothes and helped customers"
good,"I loved American Eagle, each day was a new challenge for both my staff and myself. I enjoyed having a competent staff amongst crew and management. We as a team we able to accomplish many tasks and goals set forth at the beginning of daily analysis. I never felt over worked and still managed to gain in sales(accomplishing 5+ Million in revenue) and reduce turnover rates."
good,"Being able to run a business with great people and leadership that helps but doesn't restrict your vision, is a great opportunity for anyone."
good,"Good first time family business/job. learning how to work with customers, food and money is a good learning experience as a kid. taught me how life isnt so easy after all."
good,"giving 100% customer service making sure all daily operations was carried out overseeing the sales floor, I learned how to deal with all king of people, how to communicate better how to not fall under pressure, and to be a leader of a team.The hardest part of the job at the time was trying to coach staff that was older then me.I love to interact with customers."
good,"American Eagle has been an amazing place to work which is why I have stayed  for years. Retail is a great experience to work in for some time and, although I have enjoyed my time I would like to move on to a new field of work that is equally fulfilling."
good,"A typical day at American Eagle was awesome, you get to interact with so many people and maybe my their day by helping them out."
good,"open, set up for the day, check in with main office, help customers"
good,"The experience with American Eagle and AMR was one of the best. Very busy, fun and exciting. We worked great together as one single unit, helping each other at all times. The flexible hours were a plus and working with the GM, Supervisor and Leads always was something to look forward to.They were not afraid to be out there with us, hands on."
good,"I only worked at American Eagle for one day because I was only hired for Black Friday for a seasonal  job. But the one day I worked there the other employees were very nice and helpful. They didn't yell at me when I asked for help, and they told me what I needed to do without being rude."
good,"A typical day at work would be completely unexpectable. Fast pace and multitasking was a must. Learning time managment, while completing all tasks ontime."
good,I loved working for American Eagle. They treat their employees with respect and admiration for all the hard work that goes on in each store. The over night floor sets were a challenge but we always finished with great success.
good,"Great company, fun workplace. High energy with great employees"
good,I learned that you should always put customer before anything. By this being my first job i learned how to work with very different people and work ethics. the hardest part of my job was folding all of the clothes and making sure they were perfect before the store opening the next day. I enjoyed working with all of my employers and managers because they were so professional and respectful. 
good,"Great manangers, flexible hours, fabulous coworkers, greats hours, an hour lunch. Great benefits and discounts!"
good,"Bob Coniglio is a leader. mentor, and father figure. The agency was a top flight business. "
good,"I love working at AEO. I love to interact with customers. The managers are always willing to answer any questions I have no matter how many I have. The hardest part of the job is watching customers purchase clothing items that I want for myself. The enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and giving my opinion of the clothing items they are not sure about. Typical responsibilities: 	"
good,you walked in clocked in on the register went to the back and basically just looked at the floor chart to see where you were that day. For example if u were floor A- that means front room greeter Floor B- That means Register and Floor C- that means Dressing room and stock counting. Co-workers were nice and very fun to be around.
good,"i would do overnights to switch around departments, bring clothes from the stock room out to the sales floor, customer service in each department, always greeting customers when they walked in. i learned how to organize the stock room, and price clothing from new shipments. Management was always kind, never had any disagreements. I learned alot from other coworkers who were employeed longer than me. The hardest part was lifting boxes, nothing bothered me about the job. I enjoyed the discounts on the clothes, listening to the new music in the store, and offering my customer service skills. "
good,i learned i could push myself. generally i opened the day and set up for the day to come. my manager and i would have challenges against each other. who could out sell who. he taught me how to push myself even more. my manager was a great teacher and boss. getting to play with games for a living was great but always having to get numbers was the toughest part. especially the credit cards
good,"Process merchandise, go to the bank, learned a lot about retail, what i  like the most about my job is being independent and knowing my supervisors don't have to worry that i am not going to get the job done, they know i am working hard. "
good,"Assisting customers from NYC as well as out of tourist "
good,This job was really good for me and I have enjoyed working here. the management was awesome and scheduling perfect well for me. 
good,American Eagle is a fun place to work. You get to share time with co-workers and customers while you work. So it's bi-profitable. I learned to cohere with customers and also co-workers. The harderst part of the job is to place the clothes back in the racks because you have so many clothes to place back and so many people misplacing them. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet new people every day.
good,A typical day began with me walking to the selling floor and beginning to clean and straighten clothing and other merchandise even before the store opens. I would then greet customers and offer them my service as the begin to shop around. Often I monitored the fitting rooms and cleaned them out. I also would restock merchandise as required and help other co-workers when needed/
good,"A typical day would consist of greeting customers, helping them find what they need, and suggesting new clothes that could fit into their wardrobe."
good,"Their is no such thing as a boring day of work at AE. It is constantly crammed with customers to help out and co-workers to communicate with, being located in 42nd street their is always a busy environment. The managers are very flexible and understanding with your schedule, and with breaks. And co-workers extremely friendly, and helpful. Their is really no hard part about the job, however, plenty enjoyable, one of my favorites was helping customers put outfits together."
good,Great place. Loves their employees. Has awesome benefits and treats everyone equally.
good,Very great work environment. I've learned a lot from AE. You have a good work life balance. They pay well for good quality people.
good,Just to keep it real brief I am a future marketing major and I absolutely cherish the ae atmosphere although sometimes it can be annoying to have to recover clothes every second but selling to the customer and accomplishing that different goal everyday the store might post gives you a good feeling then the feeling when you sell to multiple customers no complaints I love ae!!!!
good,"It's a great place to work, I learned to juggle multiple tasks and have fun!"
good,"Being only a Seasonal/Temporary Sales Associate, I enjoy working here at times when I'm available. Also, American Eagle is a great workplace for high school students."
good,"A typical day of work consists of exceeding all customers expectations and having an overall fun filled day while working. I've learned that not all companies have the same type of work day, after working for two different companies. I also learned that everyday is different and you never know what you're going to encounter each day. I feel like having a great management team is important and with mine it is very easy going. I work with awesome managers and they are always treating their employees right. Landing a new job is never easy because of meeting new people but when your new co-workers are outgoing, fresh, and friendly, working somewhere new is easy. I wouldn't say there is a hard part about my job, just that some days are more challenging than other which is a good thing because you end up learning from something. I enjoy learning new things at my job and that's the best part because you never stop learning. Each day is a new experience no matter if you've made a mistake or had the best work day yet."
good,Easy going customer and employee culture
good,"A typical day at work is pretty much just standing around checking people out. I've learned a lot from working here like teamwork, helping people, dealing with angry customer, etc. My co-workers are very friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is working seasonal where there's no time to lull, everything is fast paced, and I have to run back and fourth between cashier and stocks. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with people and the feeling of satisfaction you'll get when helping customers."
good,- Fast Paced
good,"Help passengers with their flight information and any airport information, board and deplane the aircraft."
good,I didn't really work everyday just when they had a load to come in and thats when the crew come in and unloaded stock and then we put stock onto the floor and department where it need then sometimes we have to clean fixtures but it was an okay there was no hard part about
good,Everyone was amazingly nice and understanding of my personal life and my school work. The pay was great for a college student to live with. Hours were great to make a nice check but didn't overwhelm me. Everyone was equal and management kept the store flowing and organized.
good,"great atmosphere. very original and organized, can earn points to get clothes off or basically free. managers are AWESOME! and soo very helpful!"
good,"Loved working there, espcially during the holidays. Always up beat in the store."
good,great place to work. avaiable hours. gives you something to do during seasonal
good,"This was one of my favorite companies to work for . We had a great team, made sales and floor changes fun to work with. Customers looked froward to coming back being given that it was a small populated area.Scheduling was simple due to co-workers and team flexibility. Breaks were not too short, not too long. There was always a positive sale vibe in the air. Cleanliness of the store was excellent and always kept up. New lines and appearel were ever so busy and turning on time."
good,thanks for everything.cross country freight distribution pick up and delivery nice equipment good communication excellent package.
good,"A day at work starts busy and allows me to feel like I have accomplished my goals by days end. After conquering my current job duties I look forward to learning new processes. If I complete my task early, I look to help my co-workers if need be. I do not find any particular job task hard and enjoy and have enjoyed every position which I have held. In managing others, I feel it is important to have patience and to listen. I believe in empowerment allowing an individual to feel they have or do contribute to the success of the task."
good,"American Eagle is a wonderful place to work. Daily tasks include helping customers whether you are working in the fitting rooms and getting them different sizes or creating an entirely new look for them. A typical day would include cleaning and organizing the store, size wraping clothes, putting sensors on/taking them off, working at the register, knowing the current promotions so you can relay them to the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job, for me, was working with the customers. I am great at sales, so working in the fitting rooms, sales floor, or even on the cash wrap I was able to have a connection with the customers while also exceeding my personal goals in sales. The hardest part of the job can be the sales aspect, trying to sell a credit card for instance, can be difficult; but it is challenging, which also makes it fun."
good,"Greeted customers with a friendly smile, helped customers find the sizes they needed, also recommended outfits. The hardest part of the job was helping pick out outfits, because they're are so many great ones, its hard just to pick a few."
good,American Eagle is one of my favorite clothing stores so it was beneficial to work there and receive the discount
good,• Assisted customers with their needs
good,Productive always busy very fun place to work with a lot to do.

good,I had a great experience with working with an American Eagle I loved providing great customer service and keeping the store neat and well organized
good,"Fun and educate workplace....Learning every day, is a place that education and safety is the first thing every day...."
good,"A typical day at American Eagle is steadily busy. Moving at a fast pace we strive to ensure that each and every customer leaves our facility happily with a brand new item. My co-workers are always very energetic and work at quick speed. The hardest part about working there is when we get a rush of customers, and every person in there needs assistance. The ratio of customers to employee's on shift can sometimes reach up to 30+ customers to 4 employee's. Needless to say it can get a little hectic. At the end of the day what I enjoy the most about working there is being passionate about my work and what we have to offer. Looking great means feeling great, and feeling great leads to a positive attitude and confidence!"
good,Loved working for American Eagle.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting and selling to customers, folding clothes, and keeping the store clean. I learned how to sell better to customers. The management at American Eagle Outfitters is excellent. They know how to efficiently run a store, sell to customers, and make customers have an enjoyable experience in the store. The co-workers are kind, hard-working people. The hardest part of the job is working on the weekend. A lot of customers come to the outlets on the weekend, and we get swamped with customers because the store is so big. There's a lot of exclusive items at this store which make it a popular store to shop at. The most enjoyable part of the job was just getting to make a customers day after I had helped them. It's rewarding to know that I helped customers find Christmas gifts or birthday presents for their relatives."
good,"This is a great company to work for let alone great place for advancement, awesome benefits and life style."
good,American eagle clothes are so fashion forward and affordable. Working there came with many benefits including discounts.
good,AE was a very exciting company to work for. The company was doing very well and the growth in the stores and additional employees keep things moving and interesting.
good,"Is a company with great opportunity to grow, they treat employees like family and keeps employees up to date with new regulations and protocols of the company, good pay and excellent benefits."
