rating,review
bad,I've never had a job like this in my life. I dread waking up. I dread going to sleep because I know I have to wakeup and do it all over again. The morale is low. Co-workers don't show up. Customers treat you like less than trash. It's a terrible job no way around it. If you are called by this company  for any customer support roles it is better not to pick up the phone.
bad,Horrible experience working there.  It was challenging and stressful.  I would not recommend any of my colleagues to seek employment at that organization.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Management was horrible, they lie, the atmosphere is horrible. HR is close with management and retaliation occurs."
bad,"The rarest sight is seeing a manager at their desk working. They'll be gone weeks at a time, will show up half a day late, wander around aimlessly the few times they DO show up and talk about whatever the latest tv show is. No advancement opportunity, horrible work ethics, the company constantly cheats its clients, they lie about mandatory overtime, they refuse to hire enough people, and everyone treats each other horribly."
bad,Do not recommend this company.  Very stressful.  Do not give good raises or reviews.  Managers and supervisors are not always helpful when they should be.
bad,The call center is a joke. Supervisors play and socialize leaving all supervision to team leads who are even less qualified than the management. Chained to your desk. Only allowed up at breaks and lunch. Not allowed up between breaks and lunch even to go to restroom. Cannot improve self or position unless approved by management. Morale extremely low.
bad,Hr controls all pay levels and merit increases (people who dont even know you or the type of work you do) so count on terrible caps and increases.  Hourly employees are tracked like slaves with opus while salary have free reign. Very anti-American culture since they sold there sole to overseas IT for a better rating. Depressing place now.
bad,"Management says they care about their employees, but they won’t give them proper raises despite the fact that management and above is making six figures, and the hourly employees are making less than 30k."
bad,Scheduled new and existing job. Maintain documentation. Nice people to work with. Hardest part of the job was working weekends and being oncall
bad,"management very poor, your manager has no clue as to your daily job duties and when asked for assistance they will point you into another direction, very unprofessional place to work."
bad,"CNO hides behind a mantra that they are a great place to work and they take care of their staff,customers, etc. They don't. Not much has changed since they were Conseco, except the name. They are crooked and they look at you as a body in a seat. Managers are fired all the time for fudging numbers, and if you are miserable in your position you have to wait a year to transfer. People that dont fit in the environment there are quickly fired or forced to quit. Do not work here"
bad,Flexible and fun but hard ot make money...work with indigent people a lot..The have a lot of opportunity but they ahve a culture that is toxic and not healthy
bad,I was onboard when the entire IT department was outsourced. CNO management thought the outsourcer was experienced at this and had mature processes. They didn't. Many days were spent in limbo while processes were created and projects crawled along.
bad,"Management will run you to death and expect more out of you, reviews are biased if the manager likes you. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here at all"
bad,Reorganizations every year and job cuts. No job security especially in IT. Managers will lie and do shady things to keep from paying severance. Employees are miserable and it's an awful environment.
bad,This company treats its lower level employees with a sweat shop mentally.  Employees are only warm bodies to get the job done as fast as you can and being perfect with accuracy also.
bad,"This was a new industry for me, was already nervous about the change. Training sub par overall and too rushed.  If they spent more time, money, etc on quality training, the turnover rate wouldn't be through the roof.  Highly stressful position.  Benefits offered are fantastic , however, working in the call center dealing with agents in particular over the phone all day mostly angry about something, being rude and disrespectful, using foul language, belittling, are just not worth it overall.  I can't speak for other departments but the call center is definitely not where you want to work."
bad,"I work in the contact center and hate it! Adherence is unattainable, unrealistic, and too strict. Management is a joke and so fake, pretending to care but really don't. Way too number driven and look at their employees as replaceable rather than valued. They couldn't care less about you being stressed so long as you do your job. They're all over the place with hardly any organization and the rules change day to day so be careful. I wouldn't suggest this place to my worst enemy."
bad,"CNO does not commend a job well done with their employees.  They will work you hard and expect more, but offer nothing in return.  Different rues for different departments, nothing is done across the board."
bad,Poor management. Poor office cleanliness. No career opportunities. Quick turn over rate due to lack of employee appreciation. Low pay wages making less than a liveable wage.
bad,Unethical management and poor working conditions. A lot of employees looking to leave company. I was screamed at by my 2 different managers for a misunderstanding and coworkers were very backstabbing.
bad,"CNO was a pretty decent place to work for the first 2 years that I was employed there. With changes in upper management and strenuous sales goals, the job became very stressful. The management is only concerned about you hitting a monthly sales goals. They were rewarded more when agents hit or exceeded monthly goals, more than the actual agent, while not having to make one single phone sale! The best thing was being ""rewarded"" pizza or a $20 lunch allowance here and there."
bad,"This is not a true Sales job. The environment is micro-managed by the supervisors. There is no commission incentive for the first 90 days. Once you become incentive eligible the structure is not enough to support a family. As a sales person you're expected to live off the base pay of $15.10/ hr or to work excessive hours of overtime. "
bad,"The agent care rep position is equal to banging your head against a wall all day.  Extremely repetitive, the management treats you like you are a child, you're chained to your cubicle, and the agents yell at you and treat you like garbage and are allowed to get away with it.  The training is over a couple months and is the only good part.  Get the job and get paid for the training and then get out of there because this place is a joke.  They don't even have coffee for the employees.  Revolving door of people in and out of the position because it's terrible."
bad,"slow paced, compartmentalized insurance company.  little upward mobility, lacked cultural flexibility and innovative know how"
bad,The operations call center is fast paced some days others it can be laid back. Call center reps are the most devalued roles. They make you feel replaceable and not at all comfortable at work. The training is inadequate for the job and they care more about money than they do employee retention.
bad,"No job security... Bonuses get taken away if you dont pass what they call quaility which they don't teach you.... Regardless how much you sale and make goal they still manage some how take back your bonuses especially if they dont make thier goal as a company which is just robbery.... Not a career just a paycheck job dont get too comfortable because your a great seller they want ""Quality"" whatever that means...."
bad,Work is what you make of it. you can contribute at multiple levels. Compensation does not meet industry average by any means
bad,"IT Management is not able to support business priorities due to internal inefficiencies and poor employee moral. Micro-management by IT leadership has eliminated all the SMEs who can bring a change in the organization"
bad,Stressful place to work. My job as Agent Care Rep was to handle incoming calls from agents. Because many of the employees were overseas many elderly had trouble understanding what they were saying and often their policies were canceled. Then the agents would call in yelling and asking why the policy was canceled for a sick and elderly client.
bad,"They say those that don't learn from their mistakes are doomed to repeat them.  This company changes management and styles as often as you change your socks.  Career advancement is non existent.  Most jobs are being done by contractors or overseas as they have no trust in their own employees."
bad,"The ideas the company talks about are great, but the execution is very lacking. They talk about advancement and creating a culture of learning and growing but can never keep enough staff so that you can take advantage of those things."
bad,"I enjoyed the demand for multitasking, changing priorities, and challenging opportunities.  I value this experience the most even though it proved to be the most challenging. "
bad,"typical day at work is spent chained to your desk wearing a phone headset. Very strict about breaks. 2... 15 min breaks and 1/2 hr lunch."
bad,The company is huge and has a lot of branches to it. There are a lot of areas you could work in but they don’t also hire for the ones you would want. The entry level positions are hard to get out of when the company is struggling to keep staff in that area. It’s kore work than it is pay. The better departments are slow to hire but usually have a better atmosphere.
bad,"The commission scheule has gone down tremendously on ALL products except for Medicare Supplemental.  2% Commission on Annuity Sales are what you will get from one aged 70-80.  Still only 3% if under Age 70.  The best managers have gone onto other companies and you will not be able to touch even a 401 (k) without a Finacial Advisor present who will expect 50 % of potetnially ALL sales performed in the home, when he had nothing to do with it...other than make it ""complient"".  Long Term Care Claims have the highest rate of complaints with the CA Department of Insurance and Life Insurance is just not competitive.  The best part of the job was the relationship built with the clients but they became harder to make clients with an ever decreasing product portfolio.  Management promotions were no longer based on performance, rather who was owed a favor and those that challenged management to be ethical find themselves retaliated against and without leads or support.  HR is impossible to get a hold of and sexual harassment has run rampant.  Overall, this company is a tarnished liability to work for and smart potential clients will know this as well due to search engines that reveal the numerous consumer complaints...and that will costy you chargebacks and business.  No insurance company is currently a greater liability to work for than Bankers.  They have been reactive, not proactive in becoming complient and it will take decades for them to recover.  "
bad,Constant reorganizations that lead to good employees being let go because their position was eliminated.Never know from one day to the next if you will have a job.
bad,My managers way of dealing with people was to yell at them in front of the whole office area where you worked. I left as soon as I could secure another job. I reported the manager in my exit interview. I heard later that they had moved her from the area where I was.
bad,I worked in the call center for 3+ years and it was a roller coaster from the beginning. They're always short staffed which causes extreme amounts of stress on those who do work there.
bad,"I work there remotely as an analyst for four month and had trouble getting access to systems, code, and information the whole time. I also had a lot of problem, with there VPN connection dropping out. Working on site maybe a different story, but I do not recommend working remote."
bad,Alorica wasn't a very organized company to work for. They were more focused on the production and goals of  the business more so than caring about the needs of its employees.
bad,"If you are looking for a place to work that is fast paced in a call center setting & your numbers are all that matters, this would be a great place to work."
good,"Coming into this job I thought it was going to be a good atmosphere being as though it was a corporate environment but, I was completely wrong. Management is too busy trying to make friends instead of running a department effectively, when upper management comes around they pretend like the department is running smoothly although it’s in an uproar, too many hands in one pot, they talk at you instead of to you, it’s like high school."
good,"I have never seen a management team that act like “mean girls”, even the men.  I can’t say that’s the entire company but in my building that’s the environment we work in.  There is a HIGH turnover rate because of the unrealistic production goals.  There are people that have been there for years and still unable to reach production every week.  The managers talk to people they don’t like with utter disrespect.  I’m in the process of looking for another job because there is no way I can see myself retiring from this job."
good,"This review is for Infrastructure only and should not be reflective of the rest of the company.  Employee's where threatened and bulled by management to make promised delivery of projects before they where fully defined.  Feed back is always negative, and that it is not being delivered fast enough, while working with incomplete deliverable while delivering the project."
good,Many of the long term employees were let go and replaced by offshore associates. Management is driven by the almighty dollar. Its not what you know its who you know at the company
good,I met a lot of wonderful people.  The company provides many good employee benefits.  Difficulties were with tracking productivity because there were many different ways to track it.  But it was always so busy that you could forget to include different things that you did during the day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was some of that people that became close friends.
good,"Highly driven to do my job well. Flexible and ready to assist at moments notice. Highly motivated. Team player, and love's to work. Always ready to assist at all times internal and external."
good,"This company has nothing in order as far as procedures, safety, work ethic, and management. For this company to have been around for 30 something odd years, it has yet to have pleased me in my progression in life. I would say, the only thing to look forward to everyday is the great personalities of coworkers."
good,"A typical day at work is working as hard and fast as possible to make 100% production rate for the day. The hardest part of the job is coming up short with production by the end of the month and only getting a 99%, which is considered good and close to perfect if you ask anyone outside of management.  However 99% will not cut it and now you are on a production verbal.  If this continues anything under 100%, 99%'s included this will lead to termination."
good,"CNO is a results driven culture focused on sales, agents, and customers. The staff can sometimes suffer from this mindset as the there is an unbalanced approach to work and life. "
good,I worked in the call center at CNO Financial group and it is a typical call center environment. There is a high call volume and you are frequently tied to your desk
good,"I was in Agent care. Typical day was 50-80 inbound calls.  Management was just ok.  Micromanaged from the top down.  Co Workers were fun , that was about it.  No room for growth unless you played kiss bottom with the management and you didn't have a tan (if you catch my drift) .  Im glad I got out when I did, that place was starting to effect my health."
good,"""You either sink or swim"" The advice my supervisor gave me and that's exactly the culture in the office.  You learn the basics in training until they put you on the sales floor and then you realized training was a playground and not the reality of your daily duties.  You are limited to your breaks and confined to your desk troughout your shift which can be weary on you after awhile. Compensation is an understatement and to top it off they take 40% of your bonus......  It's a great job for someone looking for work and a great look on your resume for skill purposes but overall, as a current Telesales Sr.  Rep virtual agent,  there is no job security and therefore I would not consider retirement with the company. I also failed to mention it's a revolving door."
good,Staff is under paid compared to other companies. Management seems to be run by C students. No appreciation for anyone's talents
good,The training for the job I did was not very good.  There are to many scenarios that could happen and so many different forms that need processed and if you had not seen all of them it was had to keep a 100% accuracy.
good,Nice environment in which to work.  Associates are typically hard working and focused.  The hardest part of the job for IT Infrastructure is under staffing and long hours.
good,"Worked in the call center.  Systems were out of date.  No real potential to advance on the near horizon"
good,The company and its values are not terrible.  Management however is the main downside of this company.  Management is very unorganized and new rules are made up on the fly and left behind the next day.  very frustrating.
good,"Central records is a very well round area . Great people, more like working with family."
good,"Overall, I had a fair experience with CNO. It might have been the right fit for me eventually.  When I left, like many organizations, they were struggling with workplace culture.  You could tell that they wanted to have a positive workplace culture, but did not always provide the systemic support and leadership between the visionaries and the employees.  Leadership was great, but their message did not always coincide with the actual objectives of what was needed to be done on an operations standpoint.  It is a balance that is never met with insurance.  It is near impossible to provide both quality to customers and productivity to address the needs of all the customers.    The unintended effect being, ""do more with less."""
good,"For the majority of my career there, things were good to great. The end of my time there was frustrating and difficult with some conflicts and lack of support"
good,"You are entering claims into computer after scanned, prepping claims. They expect you to be perfect. Only have 5 major errors and QC has to be 98.8% and Production 100%. They put to much stress on you. When you have errors they don't train you or help you to correct the errors."
good,"Highly successful company. Good company. Fast paced. Nice jobs."
good,"Formerly this company was known as CONSECO which  consisted of several insurance companies under one umbrella."
good,"When working in technology, expect to spend 4 - 6 hours of your day in meetings. So much time is spent in rooms you almost have to work overtime (for free) in order to be productive. "
good,I worked for CNO financial for 16 years and I loved the people that I worked with and for.  I learned how to be a leader and how to take on new challenges in technology.  The hardest part of the job was coordinating efforts with off-shore contacts.  There was a 10 1/2 hour delay in time.  The most enjoyable part were the people that I worked with.
good,"Good company, compensation is more than fair for management positions.Pay for hourly roles, and IT roles are not as competitive.Health insurance benefits are not competitive with other similar companies in the industry."
good,The environment there is very segregated and siloed. For the most part all the associates are nice and pleasant to work with. The management team is not as pleasant and forthcoming when problems or concerns arise on an employee level nor a corporate level.
good,"Good work culture. Decent benefits. "
good,Customer Service Representative with multiple tasks and many people to which to speak and an overabundance of information to learn.  Opportunities to advance are endless.
good,"I have been employed at this company for 9 years. The 1st 5 years here were ok, and gave a great facade of possible advancement and was a placed that gave some promise of a future and advancement, as well as a family feel. But after that it just became dry, and lacked luster. The management became more strict, less employees, and more work, less opportunities for moving to the next level, less raises, and no morale."
good,CNO is a good place to work especially if you are new to the industry. The managers are helpful and make themselves available. I would still be working there if my personal situation did not require a more flexible schedule.
good,Spent the day cleaning up accounts.  The company was going through some tough times.  I didn't stick around to see it rebound.  Worked 4 10 hour days which was nice.
good,"Scheduling jobs, set daily parms, and monitor cycles. The only issue I had was having to work weekends."
good,Review health forms. Lifting boxes everyday at work. Everyone gets along at work. They are there when you need problem solved.
good,It is a diverse environment and has a free gym.  Flexible when it comes to family. Focus in my department is productivity. The call center was focused on customer service.
good,Very little trust and understanding between business and IT. Under utilizing talent and very little room for advancement for level 2 workers above entry level. Old Legacy systems.
good,Very laid back culture and helpful people. The camaraderie is evident with most and inviting. Knowledgeable people about the entire business.
good,"CNO is a very busy environment with multiple projects going on all the time.  I enjoy the fast pace high energy and dealing with numerous things at once.  I enjoy overseeing all of the contractors such as landscaping, cafe, construction and housekeeping"
good,I enjoy working at CNO Financial Group. Management is friendly and respectful to all employees. Work expectation are clearly communicated to employees.
good,"Answering phone calls to help insurance agents with clients information about health policies. They could call about payment information, the policy status, or commissions on the policy. I have learned an extreme amount of patience dealing with different personalities. I learned to maintain professionalism no matter the circumstance. My coworkers were always very friendly and helpful, very funny and down to earth individuals. The hardest part of the job was how unpredictable an agent could be, they could go from hot to cold in a matter of seconds. The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing about how much you had helped an agent or a family out by sending a memo over to have something adjusted to the policy. Helping and knowing you made a difference was the best part."
good,"A typical day at work is reviewing advertising, review regulations for states assigned and make sure our products comply.  Maintain company intranet site for our customers. Review testing of our products which entails all aspect of the product."
good,"It is a good company in the Insurance Sector. Provides good experience in IBM Mainframes, Java, J2EE Web Services, IBM Varicent SPM . I needed an immediate job to work in Hyderabad and CNO IT services provided a good job for the moment"
good,"Mid sized Insurance / financial services company with good corporate management.  Firm has clear idea of where they want to go and has a plan to get there.  Day to day was involved with training analysts, executing departmental projects and resolving customer service matters in a balanced professional manner."
good,"There is plenty of opportunity for advancement at the corporate office in Carmel, IN ; not as much in the satellite Chicago office.  The campus is nice and it has onsite workout facilities, onsite cafeteria and plenty of free parking."
good,"If you start at the call center, it is a very difficult environment that is always changing. It is never the same as what you are taught in training. However, if you make it a year, you then have the options to move within the company into better positions."
good,"The work life balance can be a little crazy, but the experience you gain there is really good. They put you into a project and don't spoon feed you."
good,"Here you can learn all about CNO's structure, strategy and operation, including management profiles, our values and the work we do in our communities."
good,"In a typical day of work I would attend to customer requests, I was the first impression of our company and offered service with a smile. I performed regular security verification checks, handled secure information, rerouted calls routed to my department in error using a multiline phone system, updated and maintained client files a day. My co-workers were amazing, helpful, and made the work days fantastic."
good,A typical work day would be receiving calls from customers. 
good,"The company is great in being able to move you around through the company.  If you spend your year in a position, you can begin to move, but heaven forbid you get into a position that you aren't good at.  Rather than work with you to find another good fit, they would rather put you through a paper trail of documentation to protect themselves and let you go.  I have seen a lot of good people wrongfully pushed out the door when they could have benefited the company in a different capacity."
good,"Low stress workplace that runs by deadlines. Not much interaction outside of discussing projects with managers. No major complaints about the job, but there wasn't much room for improvement."
good,Put in a lot of hours and make 300 calls per day and you will successful
good,Great benefits provided for salaried and non-salaried positions.  They don't have career paths available. Paid training is available.  They have onsite medical care and cafeteria. There are lots of extracurricular activities available.
good,CNO is a very professional stable company.   They have made some decisions which will impact their IT support needs going forward.  The change to a virtual desktop cloud will result in much less local IT support than exists today.  The company is a very strong company with great benefits and a positive working environment.   I would not be considering looking elsewhere if there were still long term opportunities in the IT environment there.
good,"A typical day here is processing payments, working with agents to make sure policies are correct.  Calling Payroll administrators when there are issues with payments."
good,"This place gave me the training necessary for me to grow as an insurance agent, and the direct coaching of the Branch Manager helped me grow in my business and personal life."
good,"A typical day at work would be that we would come to our desks and then we would prep some mail in the first couple of hours then i would go into the system and work on one system for about two to three hours then i would be asked to go to another system to work there for another three to four hours and then I would be asked to train someone then after that I would go back to my desk and finish out the day in a different system I would have to make 100 percent production in that day and have as little errors as possible and help out were I was needed. Management was ok, my coworkers were great.  I enjoyed it becuase i was helping out my co-workers and we worked as a team to get the job done."
good,"Depending on the organization you are under, CNO can be a great place to work. Business practices/management are a bit old school but they will work directly with you to meeting their standards"
good,"Good company, getting better all the time. Culture wasn't always great, but is an area that has continued to be an emphasis, which is a good thing. Benefits are OK, Management in most areas is good, with exceptions. Lots of changes in direction with projects and programs, not unusual in Financial Services, but can make things hectic."
good,CNO was a good place to work with some really good department heads and others who had opportunity to improve. The work life balance was acceptable and the hardest part about the job was our ability to inflict change in some of the deep rooted areas.
good,Company cares about employees but the managers are working managers not devoting enough time to staff.  They are committing to improving in that area.
good,"Productive work environment"
good,"CNO strives to be the best in the industry. I have learned several new skills that include leadership, training, project management, and customer service. These skill are transferable to any position in my future career path in."
good,"Real Company with real business. Has good support group."
good,"I currently assist agents in the field with providing information to help resolve issues in the line of Life and Annuity policies. I help assist in areas of policy change, licensing, commissions, claims and new business."
good,"I was on a very intense projecf thru debt management and we worked 10 hours 6 days a week to get this complete in a years time which we did, so my focus was on that only"
good,"processed claim for life . Claims audit, desk customer service, running reports, worked with different other departments, investigations, accounting, month end closings"
good,I like working here. Supportive boss and lots of advantages when you want to learn new things. I learned lots of monitoring tools to have alerts on the console. I worked almost every top technology of database here.
good,"It is an employee friendly company."
good,I loved working at Conseco! Great people and I loved my hours. Very flexible with emergency situations. The location is great and I could go home for lunch.
good,My career at CNO Financial has been beneficial and I have learned a lot. The co-workers have become life long friends. The hardest part of the job of course is the prioritization of work with a minimal trained staff.
good,"Very good work/life balance and job security. Some areas get more visibility and recognition (e.g. FP&A, Actuarial) than other areas."
good,"Work hours around 8-5, check email frequently throughout evening if so interested"
good,"As a business systems analyst intern, I not only learned the everyday work of a regular full-time BSA, I also worked in conjunct with project managers from the IT department. Not only that, I had a great time interacting with fellow interns at the company.l"
good,I have a great supervisor and team. I enjoy interacting with my coworkers. The job is rewarding and I enjoy the benefits.
good,"Depending on what department you work for, this is a great place to work."
good,"Good benefits, salaries, not too much work pressure. But not enough scope for learning or adding new skills as the projects are developed using old technologies."
good,"CNO Financial is an OK place to work. I would like a little more responsibility, independence, and higher quality and variety of work at this point in my career."
good,"Professional work ethic. Conversion of policies, written test strategy documents, test scripts and implement testing in HP QC."
good,"I've worked in about 4 different departments and they are all laid back and easy going. the only CON is the pay is not that great, but good place for non degree people."
good,I enjoyed working at CNO because the company is great I just personally did not like my job. I wish you did not have to wait a year to transfer departmetns. Also my supervisor is great
good,"As with a majority of mostly great things there are almost always things that fall through the cracks somewhere. CNO is a fantastic place to work, especially if you're a hard worker. I have, however, noticed that some of the MGMT within the company can base their hiring decisions on things that are less than admirable. Things like who their favorite so and so is instead of who would best match the role up for grabs. And the hard workers can become favorites, however, that's not a safe space either necessarily. Some MGMT thinks it's acceptable to overload certain employees with responsibilities that should not fall on them. (Things that people 1-2 positions ahead of their current position are capable of doing and should be doing but either are not or cannot complete due to their own over-packed workloads).I would recommend CNO to people who are up for the challenge of possibly being asked to do things that are well above even the 'above and beyond' some employees expect to give to their employers already."
good,If you like to work at a place that is very quite this would be the place for you. It is repetitive work that requires a lot of training but once you learn it becomes easy.
good,"Poor management. Overall the company is great and is a company to move up in , keeps you moving and learning new things. Very good environment, the employees are execelent to work around."
good,"I was a good place to work before took over by CTS. "
good,Good place to learn about Insurance business. Good IT systems to work with.
good,"Great co-workers, fun place to work, great location, productive and professional .  I would refer others looking for a professional work environment in Carmel, Indiana."
good,CNO has some really wonderful people in IT and Operations that are committed to success and meeting their business goals.  I have certainly enjoyed the challenges presented to me their over the years.
good,"I enjoyed working with this company, immediate management was incredible only negative was having to do all my BOA duties and be responsible for recruiting 90 new recruits per week."
good,"It is great to be with a very friendly team and I really like the atmosphere."
good,"Not very accommodating if you have a family but a great place to work. The culture of the company is great. The agent care position, you kind of feel like a bottom feeder. Very controlled environment, ball and chain to your seat. You have to strictly adhere to a schedule  that changes daily."
good,"Great place to work. I would recommend this employer.  I have/had many family members work for this company. As with any company there will always be a bad apple but its up to you personally to recognize, learn, and not repeat. It is starting to become more diverse and ""that's"" what makes a company top notch.....but ""As stated STARTING"" to become. Good company."
good,The company takes pride in employee excellence and works very hard to make sure each employee has a balance of work family life.  The management work hard at making sure all employees have proper training and skills that are needed to complete the jobs.
good,"I worked within the Legal Department as a Legal Assistant; created database for identifying issues with Insurance Brokers, etc.; very friendly and professional environment"
good,"Great Company.  Good place to start your career."
good,I am a current employee at CNO Financial and absolutely love my job! You are looked at as an individual and not just a number that they use to get results. Every person in management truly cares about you and their goal is to help you succeed. Even the managers that are higher up want to know who you are and care. I have never worked for a company where the VP walks around on a regular basis just to say hi to everyone. They are very flexible and do their best to accommodate anything that you need. I have been here well over a year and have never had an issue that someone in management hasn’t been able to help me resolve. They pay and hours are great to accommodate almost any schedule. I wish every place that I have worked for was like CNO!
