rating,review
bad,"Micromanaged, promises given were never meant, horrible management. work life balance - does not exist, even though talked about regularly. Pay/ benefits are decent -"
bad,The company does not value or respect it's employees. There are many loyal people there that continue to work because they feel like they have already put in a lot of time and dont have many other options.
bad,"Very negative environment. Low pay. Lots of gossiping including from management. No organization, especially in training which makes it kind of stressful. The only positive thing is a few kind people and a cafe."
bad,"Not recommending customs dept. at all.Poor salary, your efforts are not appreciated, messy, stressful,the management is fake, they talk nicely but act as it is suitable for them.No advancements. No proper trainings as everybody is or pretending to be busy.Employees are not motivated to work and the customer service is pooooor.You may negotiate a better salary or you will be stack with the same salary for the rest of your days at CH."
bad,Wouldn't tell anyone to work here at all. they do not play fair they fire people out the blew when  they don't like you. they have leaders that do not know how to lead at all.
bad,Management sucks they treat people like their idiots.they have preferences to certain people and you have to kiss butt to get promoted they don’t care for the good people and management triggers only certain people
bad,This place is like Highschool!! Either your in or your out! They throw work on top of more work. Leadership is none..they snicker and gossip worse than the employees. Glad to be out out there!
bad,CHR keeps bad employees and lets their hard workers go because they speak up about the lack of work ethic their bad employees have. CHR is a scam you work hard and do not get paid for it. This company is horrible.
bad,"trying to be a ""cool culture"" but if you're not on the inside, you don't matter.  they do what they want to accommodate management, make promises and never follow through.  drag you along."
bad,"Overall did not enjoy my experience there, poor management, horrible clients, nothing collaborative. You were rewarded with growth the more hours you put in, terrible work life balance."
bad,"If you have a frat boy lifestyle, this job is for you! Very racist! If you are African American, don’t work here! This was the worst job I’ve ever had"
bad,The management was horrible. Boss had not a clue as to what he was doing. No training. No benefits. No advancement. I would never suggest anyone work for this company! Horrible experience!!
bad,at the beginning it was a nice place then became favoritism to certain employees and towards the end when I was let go the management didn't care and  I couldn't say good bye to anyone they just wanted me to leave
bad,Just dont work here unless you want to plug numbers all day the management is awful. There is no leadership or teamwork. The operations are comsistantly changing. They do not care about you.
bad,"Bad management- micromanagement at its finest!"
bad,"As an African American working for this company I never felt comfortable or like I was in a place that would give me an opportunity to grow. I received sub-par training and was then expect to deliver results. "
bad,"Not diverse, pay is terrible. Your check is different every time you get paid not even sure the structure of the pay.  Cool place to start but dont recommend staying long just get experience."
bad,"I would not recommend, anyone to work for this company. Not enough pay for owner operator, to make profit. I contracted with C.H. Robinson for 11 years."
bad,"Unprofessional environment, extremely large turnover. In my years of being employed with CHR there have been 3 GM’s. Numerous managers and countless Employees. "
bad,"Simply not a place for the professional.  If you're an individual looking to come to a positive environment, give your all professionally, and expect respect from both those above you , and your peers, FORGET ABOUT IT.  Management is a joke, they are sloppy, unprofessional, messy, gossipers, and far under qualified for the positions in which they are in.  Save your time and energy and go to a place that recognizes and appreciates good talent."
bad,"Not somewhere you want to work if your serious about a job and advancing in your career. It feels like high school all over again with gossip and favoritism. I've heard and seen coworkers talking about people who are shown around when they come in for interviews and if your part of the favorite employees you can send endless Skype IM messages, ""brunch breaks"" (then also a lunch break), 15 min bathroom breaks, being on your cellphone with out being told anything. Keep in mind if your one of the favorites but if your not your are watched like a hawk and also have the ""favorite employees"" tell on your if your not working every single second of your shift. I don't recommend, but apply at your own risk."
bad,Very prejudice place to work for....they do not advance you based on skills ...they advance you based on who you know! I wiould not recommend anyone for this company
bad,Worst management ever in Chicago office. Unfair treatment of employees based off managers personal opinion of employees. Uncomfortable work environment. Manager gives raises based off how much she likes you not your work production. Worst job I’ve ever had
bad,"Management sucked, not organized and underpaid. There was no room for advancement. Felt there was a great deal of discrimination as well as unreasonable rules regarding clocking in."
bad,Nothing I would suggest doing for more than a couple years.  Typical corporate America...all about the numbers and if you aren't a top producer you're going to be out quickly.
bad,Worked in a freezer using forklift to put away and fill trucks. Management team barely new when a truck was coming and what was going on the truck. Boss would shop as if it was the grocery store.
bad,"The management team was always out to benefit themselves. I have never in my life been told how replaceable I am and to leave from the GM that is currently there. HR was never any help, they always had some excuse to help out the uppers than to have your back. I would never recommend a job at this company to anyone."
bad,The company has changed and is no longer the wonderful company it used to be.  Does not value employees - especially women.  Management in the Houston office is an absolute joke.
bad,"Working for C.H. Robinson is a bad choice due to the lack of compensation and workload. We are overworked and underpaid. The only good part is that benefits are offered, but that's at most jobs in today's society."
bad,"After giving this company the best 20 years of my life they cut my pay in half. They do not value you as an employee and are all about the company's bottom line. "
bad,Managers suck....they lack experience......horrible yo work for.....threatens employees if they don't work overtime ....just a horrible place to work for......owner is the biggest idiot ever along with the managers!!!!!
bad,"This company is awful"
bad,"lots of finger pointing and gossip. Very toxic employees make for a very toxic workplace. Beware of all side conversations because they will be repeated. Supervisors do nothing and allow reps to patrol each other about mistakes. The pay is terrible compared to other companies in industry. You will come in at $12-$12.50. As a temp you get no pto no benefits until 90 days and there is no ""training class"" or training at all. You have to watch and perform after 1 day of watching someone do your job."
bad,Employees have no respect for one another.   All day yelling and cursing all around the office.  Unfit working conditions.   No room for advancement....Do NOT APPLY this is a horrible job not a career
bad,"Management for the C.H Robinson San Bernardino facility is a total clown joke, they are all a joke. So many contracts have been breeched at that spot."
bad,"First week in CH Robinson at Atlanta Branch demoted my manager to Senior Ocean Import. Very stressful place to work, lack of communication and skills. Individual comes and goes when and please. Very unfriendly place to work at and  lack of management presence allowed then to stuff work down peoples throats without giving them any indication that they were increasing your workload but not going to compensate you for this."
bad,"Will not recommend this job to any one, GM at this office is complete lunatic. Office atmosphere is always tense, anything goes side ways work wise colleges do not mind throwing you under the bus to safe themselves. This is not limited to low level staffs, goes all the way to department managers and GM"
bad,"Honestly, this work place felt more like high school all over again. I felt like if I didn't "" fit in"" I would not get put on special projects. A lot of favoritism"
bad,Warehouse employee don't care about the job.All they care about is the money.Quality employee are very lazy and they eat the fruits in front of the camera.
bad,"I was not a fan of working here.  I learned a lot from Ch Robinson and I wouldn't be anywhere in the industry today if it weren't for them, but overall as a company I was not a fan."
bad,"There is no work balance, they were sued in a class action for not paying overtime and making employees skip lunch. There is no structure to this company and after 3 plus years of working there there was no future in site. This is the worst place to work at."
bad,"Terrible work experience , everyone was standing around unwilling to help the new employees with the supervisers useing the computers for Facebook , loud music was playing so no one could communicate . When orders came from the office they where Wrong and the supervisers alowed the new employees to use them anyway . The tsa is not secured with the employees being alowed to bring in shap knifes and drugs,  the employees are completing unprofessional . Due to very poor management . I left in disgust since I did not see this as a job , but saw it a short stay at county.."
bad,"Nobody here knows how to run a warehouse. Try to take a step forward, they take the opposite step backward. They hire terrible employees. They only yell for things done wrong instead of giving praise for anything done right."
bad,"Office of about 70 people maybe about 6 work, the rest pass the day staring at their computers."
bad,"CH Robinson changes their compensation plan more than we change our undergarments. This company is a joke, and its only good for overworking and under paying their employees."
bad,managment is not up to that level require.. they never hire not a place to put your mind to it. they dont appreciate. schedule is from 2;30 to 1 am but they dont let you go till 5 in the morning
bad,"Environment was horrible that 2/3 of the staff left a year ago. Staff have been hired to replace the ones that left but a lot of the knowledge, experience and business relationships went along with the departure of the employees. You end up trying to figure things out yourself which gets frustrating, yet this seems to be the way this office runs."
bad,"When I started working there about a decade ago, the mentality was that technology was something like electricity, an expense that needed to be reduced, that CHR was not a technology company.  It really is - it uses complex logistics solutions to route and track shipments.  Instead, it was all about the sales and old timers using push pins to map out truck routes.  "
bad,"Management sits around making all of the money contributing no value and doing nothing but telling employees they aren't good enough. Also, mgt loves to steal credit of their workers accomplishments telling branch mgr they did something."
bad,Awful place to work training was a JOKE. So glad i wasn't ask to stay!!!!!!! CH ROBINSON HAS NO CLASS
bad,"I worked for Ch Robinson at the Meridian, ID office and it was a huge mistake.  The office is split up into two sides that works with the carriers/trucking companies and the one that works with the customers.  If you work on the side that books the loads and works with carriers you will hate your job.  You do all the work, book all the loads, make all the outbound calls, make all the revenue for the company, track all the loads, deal with all the drivers excuses, the list goes on and on.  You are basically the grunt-peon.  If you work on the customer side it is night and day different.  You get to leave the office to meet with customers for free lunches, you get to travel all over the country going to meetings and seminars, your customers send you cookies, overall much closer to management, and get to blame the carrier reps when things go wrong.  At the beginning of 2013 corporate came out with a list of training programs that each person could sign up for across the country but they were only for employees on the customer side.  Not a single one on the carrier side.  Total slap in the face."
bad,"I was employed by CH Robinson for 5 years.  From what I have heard, this used to be a good employer to work for until the 2000s.  This company makes its profit by taking advantage of its carriers, customers, and its employees.  This company preys on young, college graduates by promising them the moon; making them work long, extremely stressful hours; never promoting them; and poorly paying them."
bad,STOP! Don't waste your time.....Poor Management and no job security.
bad,"This is a very poor place to work. They make a lot of money, but employee's are very low paid (upper $30's to lower $40's), expected to work a lot of overtime, I'm told they actually waste time taking roll to see who is at their desk and working by 8 a.m. and who is not, there is a lot of ""not my job"" attitudes, especially by the Ocean Import Manager. The HR person on site is not even trained in HR and biased when it comes to conflict resolution, they expect all account managers to generate a sales lead (about 2 a month actually) when they don't even give them enough resources to do the fundamentals of their jobs, even though that is not what they were hired to do, their job descriptions do not match the actual jobs, they hire people for the lowest salary they can, very poor training, there is very little knowledge or talent or exposure to industry experienced personnel to develop the lesser talented people. The middle management in place now needs to be re-evaluated by actual trained legit HR people to see if they are the right fit for their jobs, not the ""HR"" person on site, who also needs to be seriously evaluated to retain her position. The first level people are generally great to work with, they recognize they are all in the same boat, and feel just as taken advantage and fooled as the next guy, but the morale is very low and people are constantly diminished because the middle management need to secure their positions by keeping their thumbs on the lower rung employees by being disrespectful to them. In general, I can't find much great to work with in this company on a"
bad,This company is notrious for wasting candidates time. We tried to recruit and they kept changing what they wanted and we lost a lot of good candidates. Sr Managment butts in. They do not know what they want and will put candidates through endless interviews. We offer a pay rate that is below market and work load is enormous!
bad,"As most transportation oriented companies, CH Robinson promotes the ""men"" before the women. I worked there for there for 2 years and the men were highly favored even though the women twice as hard."
bad,Dont waste your time sending your resume. They dont wont reply with even an email and definately not a call back. Constant turnover throughout the Southeast. Pay scale is the lowest among LTL carriers nation wide. Management at best is medicore.
bad,"It started out to be a great job. But it came to the point where you had to be in a little circle of people to get anything. If you were not in this little group, you were basically shoned. They picked only their friends to move up in management and showed favor on a daily basis to their friends. (upper management)."
bad,"Terrible hours and work-life balance. Management is horrid and they will not allow you to move departments. Every single minute of your day is monitored and tasked, with no lunch break.( I was told to opt out of the 1/2 lunch break for floor coverage)."
bad,"From the moment I started working there I knew I wouldn't stay there long. The Group I was placed in was a mess. My account manager was the WORST and I say this very loosely person I ever had to work with. He had zero communication skills. He didn't train me and expected me to know how everything worked and when things went wrong because of my lack of knowledge he would be frustrated with me but I was frustrated with him because he didn't talk. He would make me do all of the work for my team while him and the other boy did NOTHING but read articles on the internet all day and do ""invoicing"". Over all bad energy, no training, low pay for the workload, and a toxic environment full of druggies."
bad,"Stepping stone job. Good for recent grads, but not for the ones who are looking to advance their career. Job entails mostly sales and analyzing carrier cost."
bad,"You have to wonder why there are so many temporary employees there and not enough full-time permanent employees. Good employees, jeopardizes management."
bad,"I would not recommend this job to most people.  The company does not take care of their customers properly and offers little support to the sales force.  The more I sold, the more I found I had to service the customers.  The support team only supported larger customers, and only 3 of the customers I sold.  This is a nightmare, as I was quickly drawn into support.  I was not told I had to work weekends during the interview process.  I was also not told about the hours worked.  After my first full year they were going to significantly reduce my salary due to a corporate decision.  I've worked many sales jobs and this was one of the worst."
bad,"I mean, it was an ok place to start in the industry. The benefits were decent, and I learned a lot. However, there is little to no training in anything you do. You get thrown into whatever role with zero guidance. Management is also very sneaky and not on your side whatsoever. It's a company for sales and account managers. As for operations, they are not cared for."
bad,Even though I was on the sales team  I heard a lot of talking about how account managers are lazy and  expects  there colleagues underthem in a lower position to do all their work. People that been there 10 years or longer felt they had some authority and were the boss. They need a wake up call because everyone will eventually get sick of them.   Lots of sneaky people there
bad,"I worked for this company for 5 years gave them 110 percent of me help them grow but when they brought new management in it all went downhill.  The manager didn't like coming to the Chicago branch so when she did she had such the worst attitude. "
bad,management non umanamente improntato sulla crescita della risorse
bad,"Want a life?  Care about people, do not work here then!  This place buys low and sells high and you get what you pay for.  Cheaper trucking companies equals older equipment and drivers that don't care.  Guess who gets the blame, you."
bad,"I learned nothing from this place. Co-workers were all part of the mean girls club. Really! People were made managers just because of who they are friends with, not for deserving. Place is run by kids who think they know everything. I will be happy when they find out how the real world really is and they don't always get there way."
bad,"If you hate sales, definitely not for you. Not paid enough for the amount of things and time put in. No work life balance because you’re stressed majority of the time."
bad,They pay a low income for the amount of work they put on you. Management promotes people who kiss there butt. They humiliate you in front of everyone.
bad,"The company may have changed since I left 5 years ago, I know the 3 top managers are all gone now.  My experience was absolutely horrible, the environment was very ""boys club"" -ish and they treated the new people horribly. The guys could take extended lunch breaks, but the girls would get in trouble for even being slightly late. Not ""mother friendly."""
bad,Horrible work environment.   Managers don't care about you as a person.  Toxic environment. No help available. Figure it all out on your own.  Sink or swim environment.
bad,HR management is so bad! No respect for temporary workers! They badly treat their temporary workers. They can end the contract anytime they want to without prior notice!! No remote working options. Uncultured & unprofessional Work culture! Pay is too low!! Please look for some other companies to make your career great!
bad,"One of the most unprofessional places you can work for in the logistics industry. No room for advancement at the Carson, CA location. I received many lessons and picked up several skills that has allowed me to prosper in the Food and Safety industry."
bad,Bad management if you dont kiss butt donr expect to move up. They expect you to work with no benefits for more than 6 months. Good luck with the staff bunch of people that act childish and bully each other through out the day till you're uncomfortable and quit. Poor management that doesnt see the need to correct those issues or listen to the needs of their staff.
bad,"CH Robinson is a cut throat company. They are big liars and management was the worst. The company should be ashamed of the pay barely higher than minimum wage. The rules changed often, nothing was consistent. This place has a very high turnover rate."
bad,"Speaking from the carrier representative team in Orange, Ca. If you like fierce competition, if you don’t mind your teammates being your competition, and if you don’t mind being at a desk all day, this job may be a fit.  Your numbers and profitability are always being watched including the number of phone calls in a day.. 100 outbound and 100 inbound per day is a general guideline.  Your emails are monitored as well, be careful on those.  You will have several managers and lots of reviews, It felt like an adult daycare to me. Some people did thrive in this environment, it was not for me though.  I made the decision to pursue other opportunities after 6 years with the company."
bad,"If I could give less stars I would. This company is run terrible especially the branch I worked in. The upper management was useless. You could voice your opinion or asked to be moved and they would only pretend to pay attention to the issue at hand. They allowed cliques to run the office. As if this was not enough, they do not have on site parking."
bad,"You are led to believe there is a career path. There is not. There are no professional growth opportunities like training or certifications. They do not reimburse for training you seek on your own. The managers manage and do not lead. Their email verbiage reads as if you were a 2nd grader. There is no rhyme or reason why certain reps are spoon fed business. They pay well for a new graduate but after that, good luck."
bad,"* Stressful work environment"
bad,"Would not recommend taking a position with this company. Loved my job, not the company.  The office is uninviting and feels more like a call center than an office space where you are part of a team."
bad,"Salaried position... Sort of like sales but you do not have your own schedule. "
bad,Wasn't very happy working for the company. Over worked and poor management. Needs a better system on paying customer. Pay was very little for over worked.
bad,"I recently worked for C.H Robinson through a temp agency called AppleOne. I worked there 4 months from May 2013-September 2013 as an Indexer. The Company supervisor at the 114 S. Racine Chicago, IL location never introduced herself to us the entire time we were there. The only way we knew who she was is by our team lead pointing her out and telling us she was the Supervisor of the location. The atmosphere was  very high school dramatic. The female team lead stayed on her phone most of the day arguing with her boyfriend while the male team lead sat there on the internet all day looking at cars and emailing other female employees trying to go out with them. If you were chummy with the team lead then you were given special privileges. People should've been working instead they are all surrounded at her desk chatting, giggling and eating. We were required to make a daily quota which wasn't a problem, I easily obtained that quota but every other week we were being called in a conference because the way we ere previously indexing documents they decided to change that and if we happened to not index it the new way we would receive a high severity errors. after 5 high severity errors u will be fired. A woman there had a problem with the Lead behavior toward her so she took it to the dept. supervisor and ended up being fired, my friend was fired because her name was brought up in the meeting there after I was fired because my friend called back to the job and wanted to know why was the reason for her being fired exaggerated and lied about and told upper management about the lead giving"
bad,"Although the company offers great benefits, the management do not help others develope or succeed. It is very unfortunate that good employees are treated unjustly,  they are not appreciated nor recognized for their hard work. Really sad to see such a huge company have people run it to the ground."
bad,"With this company their is job security, if the lady supervisor likes you, otherwise your time their can be very uncomfortable and counted. I feel that their is some kind of prejudice against  the Hispanics. What I do know is that hispanos don’t last long in the office. The Work tasks is not difficult at all,  everyday the work scope is different but not complicated. I found that the work is very easy, unfortunately their is no professionalism, communication, organization and most importantly respect. I personally liked what I did but the individual that worked in the office were special and I finally decided that that was not the  work environment that I am used to."
bad,Not led well by HR Leadership -- there is a distinct lack of HR knowledge impacting the HR team's ability to be effective. The HR culture is a bit dog-eat-dog and unforgiving. There are pockets of brilliance at the manager level. The turnover is terrible based on the leadership and culture.
bad,"While at CH Robinson, I did learn many new things. But on my own. The training consisted of ""I will show you once, and you better know it right away."" The group I was placed in was belittling and rude, the ""management"" is way too young to understand that coworkers should not treat others disrespectfully. So needless to say, nothing was ever done when these situations came up (which was daily). I agree with a previous statement made by another person stating their review. ""It was like being in the movie MEAN GIRLS!"""
bad,"Management does not care about your personal life, you can go and have a trust worthy conversation with any managers because they do not care. The pay is great but that is it!"
bad,"The only positive thing I have to say is that the co-workers are the only reason I am still working here. Terrible and incompetent management providing no support. This company is so behind the times. You cannot work from home, there is zero consistency globally, open-ended promises, high stress always, only compensation for Account Managers, do not give raises, won’t ever be respected or taken serious as a woman"
bad,"Muy decpciondo, no hay liderazgo, sigue gente que no debería y no ayudan al crecimiento"
bad,"This place is perfect for someone taking night classes and have little to no responsibilities.  The pay is horrible $14.75/hr, I found out I was making more than some that been there for years.  That's because I came through a temp agency and that's what they negotiated.  Medical and life benefits are ok.  No parking for Chicago, IL location its minimal parking and its a residential area. No holiday, no other perks to motivate you to want to stay.  My anticipated raise if I stayed would've been $0.50 at the end of June.  I been there since August 2017. You are paid twice a mth, 15th and last day. Depts do not communicate with each other to assist the customer.  You do not know how the other depts are ran to better assist your customers."
bad,"A typical work day includes nonstop ringing phones, an unending work load and an unbalanced work load in the office. You see a few employees so busy they barely look up and several goofing off, playing on their phones and doing almost nothing. The management doesn't help much and distracts other employees from helping get the work done. It was typical for the branch manager to be talking sports and tossing a ball around to other account managers so those employers weren't getting much done either. It was bad enough to have an insane amount of work to do, but if I didn't pay enough attention to my supervisor, she would get her feeling hurt and I would have to deal with her wrath. Then I would lose an hour in a useless meeting of dealing with her feelings."
bad,"Fast paced environment, very Sales heavy.  Emphasis placed heavy on profitability.  Employees who generate the most revenue garner the most attention and benefit from management.   Management is poor and if you want to advance you will need to be very cut throat or work at corporate. This is a evaluation of the Metro Detroit office in Auburn Hills and may not reflect other branch."
bad,The company is like any other corporation. Position was outsourced end of story.
bad,"If you are working in Memphis, then you are working in a country club. You must keep your head down and make friends with the right people. You must not give your opinion because then you will be seen as a trouble maker."
bad,"Strongly recommend avoiding this company. Management is unprofessional and choose obvious favorites.  Hard work was never valued. Many factors out of your control that affect the role on a daily basis. It is a stressful environment with little growth opportunities no matter how hard they sugarcoat it. Didn't think it would be in the first few weeks of the job I would wake up and already hate going to work. High turnover but that's alright because they will continue hiring recent college grads. They want to preach it is a team environment when it is really a daily competition with thousands of reps across the network. If you want to work at a call center reading information off a screen to carriers and deal with problems as they arise,then you will love this place! At the end of the day, just an inside sales role and nothing more. The job never changes day to day besides the problems you deal with (can't even describe what you will come across). Carriers are constantly frustrated with how horrendous the rates for hauling freight have become. Many people in the office were open about how they hated being there. Only positive is the benefits and PTO structure. Seems appealing to join a large company like this but suggest you take a different route. Unless you want to become another number in their system, don't waste your time."
bad,As an Operations Representative there is NO room for advancement. There is a huge amount of favortism that is very obvious. ONLY OPPORTUNITY IN SALES!
bad,"This was a job i thought I’d love. Tons of turnover. Tons of favoritism. Management sucks and now all the management consists of friends outside of work. If you don’t mesh with them, good luck keeping the job. Structure is awful. The g.m. Is full of lies and tells you what you want to hear. Training is not exactly there. Advancement not there unless you are best friends with other management. Tenure doesn’t matter, experiences doesn’t matter, audit scores don’t matter. I’d you are not in the inner circle, you are a numbermanagement."
bad,"Typical 3PL environment whose sole purpose is new sales. Current customer's are important however making new sales are more so. "
bad,"VERY Stressful, no work-life balance, no room for advancement, terrible upper management, company does not set its employees up to succeed, bad pay, no mentoring"
bad,"The typical day of work included scheduling appointments for delivery and pick up and talking to customers. I learned about the logistics industry as a whole and the difficulties that the industry faces. The management was constantly revolving and inconsistent, which did not provide me with job security, there was favoritism in the office which led to reduced opportunities of advancement. I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,Typical day was sitting at the computer for 10 hours in a cubicle. Great place to meet friends but there was a severe lack of training and no room for career advancement. Very difficult to stay motivated because the pay was so low and the only way to get a bonus was if the entire branch hit yearly quota. Personal quotas did not reflect pay.
bad,Management is not moving along with corporate realignment and stuck in the old ways of doing things. Likes to threaten taking business away to get your mind to doing something else that doesn't generate cash. They do not hold themselves accountable for bad business practices.
bad,"Areas of improvement. Lack of care for employees left many of us quitting, and some being fired for relatively ridiculous reasons. Typical day- walk in, log in, get started, joke around with coworkers. However, if you mildly inconvenienced the management with a relatively difficult schedule to work around, there was no effort involved in working around it or accepting multiple solutions from the employee. A lot of passive aggression, stealing, and a more general ""hidden"" aggression. Hardest part of the job was dealing with some coworkers, and a lack of understanding from the racist staff."
bad,"put work in c.h. robinson school work more work. eight hours had nice long lunch. nice building, nice café. worked from eight a.m to five p.m. To bad they fired me for budget cuts"
bad,"My manager was very immature and jealous of my success.  The better I did, the more she micro managed me.  My rules of employment changed weekly.  The branch manager wants to be everyone’s friend as long as quotes are being met, but if not he rants, screams and throws things at employees.  Very volatile environment, no loyalty from branch manager.  I excelled at my job and was demoted.   Loved the company, loved my job, excelled and made a tone of money.  But my insecure manager could not handle my success, biggest disappointment in my life."
bad,"CH Robinson is a brokerage that is failing at advancing into the technology space.  The majority of their people and leadership have never held a job outside of CH Robinson.  These individuals state that they want to hear outside perspectives, but they do not walk the walk.  And if you are a newbie at the company be prepared to be bullied."
bad,Worked there for 3 years and was sexually harassed and nothing was done about it. If you work in the service center you are a work horse and all they care about is how many loads you can build in a day. You are just a body to them. They don’t care about you.
bad,The location I worked at is near Memorial mall and the managers let their employees disrespect others without proper discipline for their actions. They treat you really bad as the receptionist no matter who you are. Most employees there have little to no respect for the front desk receptionist and chooses to haze each one that walks through the door. The company offers no training! NONE! I had to create my own after learning from making mistakes. Mistakes NO ONE took the time out to train me on. I love the company but absolutely hated the location I worked at! Management ?? HORRIBLE.
bad,My experience overall as an employee was good except it seemed as if the staff in my department didn't really care about work ethic or how hard an employee worked.  Management and certain employees were one big click. No matter how hard you worked their friend would always get the promotion.
bad,If I can explain my experience there I can say it could of been better. I had to deal with dislikes from some coworkers and some management. I no longer work there but I think it’s hard for me to get other jobs because of it. I will not recommend this job. If you decided to work there to get experience then after 1 year or 2  please run.  I wish I could of left silently.
bad,"Not a great place to work, management is terrible, they do not care about the ppl who work there at all! Do yourself a favour and don’t start working here"
bad,One of the most unprofessional places in the logistics industry for which you can work. No room for advancement. I have received many lessons and acquired several skills that have enabled me to thrive in the customer service industry.
bad,"Departments are willing to assist."
bad,The job was very stressful and demanding. It was ok and it was just a contract job. The job was very stressful and demanding. I was working for a staffing agency
bad,work hard with no rewards ! thats life here. learned the same repetitive work over and over again groundhog day? managers are cool but unless you blow someone or kiss some serious assets you will not move up. no work life balance.
bad,"Working at CHR was HORRIBLE. Our workloads were out of control, we'd get yelled at b/c of overtime costs, management was terrible, they'd move up the most undeserving people, and they'd make you do SO MUCH to try and move up too with very little chance of actually being the one chosen. I actually started having anxiety attacks from the stress of working there, it was THAT bad. I was completely miserable and could not wait to get out of there. No amount of money could have made me stay.They are so bad, and pay so poorly, I hear they can't get anyone with good experience these days, so it's become a place for people to get experience then leave for something better. The only good thing were the people I happened to work with on my team and a few other co-workers, I do miss them. But that's it."
bad,"They’ll work you to the bone. There’s no loyalty no matter how long you’ve worked for them. They make you work overtime (nights, weekend, holidays)  for free. They don’t care about their employees."
bad,"Current management is terrible in this office.  Over the span of 10 years, I had four different GMs and the last one is the worst by far.  Completely unprofessional and doesn't care at all about the employees."
bad,Sectioned off office between those who make money for the company and the call center. If a rep doesn't like you you could be fired just because. Also they don't follow proper procedure within the human resources department.
bad,Well did not really learn anything in C H Robinson thats exactly why am moving out - opportunities to expose should not be restricted and bias ... need not say more.
bad,Robinson likes to hire a lot of young people right out of college work them hard and not pay them well. The advancement opportunities are limited. Branch manager is about as high as one can expect to rise. If you do make it there you are paid well if not you are not. Most days you cold call and deal with transportation companies and or customers. Most 18 year olds could do the job.
bad,I did not feel like I belong. There was no real training like a proper job should have. I felt like I had a day or two to observe and then I was thrown in with the sharks. I also felt judged and watched.
bad,"Was extremely disappointed, was hired as a temp and treated like one. They are focused only on the bigger business and shrug off the small business. No teammate."
bad,"Taking calls for the drivers was fun, however, management was always trying to find a reason to write you up, or ""counsel"" you with out finding out why or what caused the circumstances.  Environment was pleasant, low key but not without its normal workplace drama."
bad,"I worked at CH Robinson in the DSA for 5 months. I watched the crew of 17 people flip over three times. I've seen people take off 3 days in a row without calling nothing happened. It seems like the people who are really lazy are the ones who have the best job security. There was a time when I had first started one of assistant managers had to take off because of a death in the family. I took over and took a couple of the new hires under my wing and train weeks that he was gone. Although I got recognized by my peers oh, there was still no chance of getting hired at that place no matter how hard and you work and how good of a job you do. I had been coming in an hour early for work everyday I never got any write-ups I never had any disciplinary action, and then one day they just let everybody go today."
bad,"A typical day is repetitive with management more worried about meeting the daily quota with minimal errors.  Training is inconsistent, and updated training is not given to everyone.  Mandatory overtime will get in the way of having any kind of work-life balance.  Management and team leads were also biased and openly played favorites with their friends."
bad,Casual work environment but upper management has no concern for their employees or customers.  Limited customer service with high turnover rate of customer base and workforce.
bad,"It has been a few years since I worked for this company, but I doubt that the racist and misogynistic office culture has changed much. There are many great employees at this branch, but there are also plenty of unprofessional individuals, which include many of the management team."
bad,The senior management makes myopic decisions that never have a long range effective result.  Meetings are constant but without clear objectives. CHR's goal is to dumb down every position so temp or entry level employees can be hired at minimal pay. There are no experts in the field so service deteriorates and customer satisfaction is minimal. You will be hard pressed to have an intelligent conversation in this environment.
bad,"This office is very unorganized. Everyone get confused who is doing what. Manager will dump work to you regardless how much workload you have. If you are experienced, you need to do other non-experienced people`s work too.  Managers don`t help doing anything."
bad,You have to get int a larger size branch in order to advance. Otherwise you will be pigeon holed into the same position year after year. Very much a breeding groud for nepotism
bad,"Did not like working for this company. The were not flexible with any schedules, did not appreciate the work that you did for the company. I will never work for this company again."
bad,"Complete management of accounts, without being localized so you can not build relationships.  The same customers you are trying to sell to you are also responsible for their account payments or lack thereof."
bad,It's turned into a meat market. Work life balance is right out of the 1800's. Stress is high and mid level management is ineffective and harsh. Stay a year to gain experience and keep looking for a real career while you do it.
bad,there are internal issues throughout the network. Rather than working together CH Robinson has designed the network to out bid other branches within the network. Making competition larger within our own network.
bad,It is tough to state positive things about my experience at the location I was at. The company has positives however. I would not recommend this location.
bad,Expected to go above and beyond for customers without being acknowledged or compensated. 'On call 24 hours a day' technically. No chance of advancement unless you were bff's with the Manager. Were told daily that CH was an 'at will' employer and no job was safe.
bad,"This company/office believes in nepotism and strongly encourages it. If you come into this organization without knowing someone, you will not get ahead. While I was employed, there was no HR on the floor to assist with any issues that may have come up. Management was very poor. This company/office has a high turn over because of the treatment of the employees."
bad,"Tienes que estar disponible por teléfono los 7 días de la semana, las 24 horas, sobre todo si manejas alguna cuenta automotriz."
bad,"Most of the management are don't appreciate if you do a good job or not. Lack of advancement, they like you to stay in the same position when you do a good job so they don't have to train new people."
bad,"CH Robinson recently lost the top spot as number 1 3pl and the reason being is unhappy employees. Many employees are unhappy with pay and will gladly leave to do the same work for another company. This is the sort of company where knowing someone will help you get raises and promotions not work ethic. If an employee complains about a team member's lack of work ethic nothing will be done about it. Management will sweep it under the rug and feel the issue will resolve itself. This creates a tense work environment and many employees leave because of subpar management. "
bad,Desirable for entry level because of the ability to get a lot of learning experience in a short period of time. Management is disconnected from operations.
bad,The culture here will vary greatly depending upon what branch you are at.There is a ton of opportunity to grow professionally. Great benefits and job security.
bad,"On a typical day, I just want to come in and do my job the best way I can and go home. I am an over achiever most times but not feeling motivated in such a negative environment. I just remind myself this is only one CHR Branch, not all of them are like this. ""BE PATIENT"""
bad,"I was an Executive Assistant at Corporate in Eden Prairie. The culture was quiet. You had to be very quiet. One of the VP's I supported told me to support her by turning work around immediately, without question and flawlessly. Ugh. The 4 Assistants on that floor sat on the floor in four corners of tis floor outside all of their glass offices. Another ugh. Not good."
bad,"Transportation Analyst:"
bad,"My typical day at work would be to ask a lead for a seating chart to see where they placed me for the day. Then I will start to make sure that I sign into my User Name and set everything up that I need to assist the drivers. I've learned a lot about truck drivers with what they need to become a driver and how fast they can lose their license. The management needs a lot of improvement with how they treat us simply with giving us our privacy on our computers and trusting that we are doing right by our binders which had everything we needed to fix any issue that comes our way. The hardest part of the job was just having to deal with the managers which we call ""Leads"". What I mean by having to deal with them is having to be treated as if we are new to the job and have no idea what we are doing there. We were basically treated as children. The only and I mean only Enjoyable part of the job was if our system went down or Lunch."
bad,"Same thing, day after day, after day...  "
bad,I worked here for 3 years. I watched them hire kids straight out of college. C. H Robinson would overwork them and would want them to feel appreciated by taking them to WhirlyBall once a year and have several get together throughout the year. ultimately this isn't enough to keep them around and they end up leaving for better paying jobs.
bad,Difficult culture to work in. More competition internally than externally. Internal values are inconsistent throughout each job position along with unclear compensations structure.
bad,"A typical day at work included gender related harassment, competitive co-workers, casual misogyny and an atmosphere of panic and stress. The dollar was most important, and humanity was ignored.  There was no work life balance and everyone aged a good 10 years their first year there."
bad,"CHR was a good company to start out in an office environment, however, after 1 or 2 years it becomes clear that they do not pay enough in comparison to the rest of the industry. "
bad,"The company itself is ok but it depends on the office, some managers do coach, mentor, and develop their subordinates to progress.  However, a lot of the offices are flat and don't have a lot of upward movement.  The work life balance is ok but not great.  Freight brokerage is not a fun job, I would not recommend it to anyone."
bad,"Manager needs to be reviewed at this location. Every week someone is quitting , poor management style . Help is put  in certain  job  areas where it is  not needed , and no extra help where it is needed.  Work flow is all backwards ,  favoritism is huge here and you will not get a big pay raise unless you bring in big  numbers . Management so focused on numbers and  being number one they forget we are humans. They do once a month meetings but probably only because corporate requests it or else they could care less. Upside is people there are friendly and it’s a good place to meet fun people!"
bad,Make outbound calls to collect on delinquent accounts and take inbound calls to assist with customer concerns. Communicate with sales representatives about unresponsive customers. Make audit calls to keep customer profiles updated. Code and notate accounts with status on payment or issues as to why payment was late. Environment was stressful and it was a challenge to resolve some issues with customers because sales representatives would not want to assist. Employee stats were posted on a department spreadsheet which made work more competitive with no increase in compensation.
bad,It is a international freight forwarding company that does not own vessels. The work never stops and it is a fast paced working environment with on going challenges daily. The company encourages teamwork.
bad,"CH Robinson was a very difficult and stressful place to work.  The office I was at in Toledo, OH had several individuals that could do whatever they pleased.  The lack of consistency in this office, led me to not want to work there.  The lack of management presence allowed then to stuff work down peoples throats without giving them any indication that they were increasing your workload but not going to compensate you for this."
bad,"C.H.Robinson Worldwide is a multinational company based in Minneapolis, USA. In the US they have very strong work ethics and a very healthy work life balance. Good policies, mature company."
bad,"Most of the reviews of CHR seem to be either it is horrible, or heaven.  It is neither.  Some good, some bad:"
bad,"The Human Resources department is not a recommended place to work at CHR. For such a large global company HR is dramatically behind the times. Senior leadership claims that they support the function but that couldn't be further from the truth. The career path in HR is laughable, at best. Compensation is terrible. No ranges, no consistency to how it is applied and low.  The whole HR team is a mess, but the Talent Acquisition team is the worst of the department.  As an example, everyone on the campus team is looking for another job. The campus manager is terrible to work for and has no business managing people.  Not one person on the team likes working for her. Concerns have been raised and nothing is done about it."
bad,The corporate office is in Minnesota and sends directors from there to manage offices in Florida and other states. This is a problem because Florida is very different when it comes to export and import. I was replace for no apparent reason. I feel they replace people who have experience in the field with college kids to save money on salaries.
bad,Good for a start I’m the industry but not good for long term. Favoritisms is shown here raises are nonexistent for some employees work life changes frequently.
bad,It was okay for the first 2 months and after that it was all down hill. It was a terrible work-life balance and the turnover was fairly high. One good thing I can say is that it was a great introductory job to transportation and logistics.
bad,"Stopped working there due to physical and mental harassment, other up to the point of this, it was a good job to have in my opinion, steady work, and a cafeteria is a plus."
bad,"No good work hours"
bad,Received good experience to carry into my next profession but work-life balance is not necessarily valued at the company and compensation is below fair in my opinion.
bad,"A typical day begins with high levels of stress. It's a rough environment to be in, although, there are good people that work there, it's the nature of the beast for it to be miserable at times. Crazy hours: 730-530 Mon-Fri. Required to work after hours. Personal Cell number must be included in e-mail for after-hours availability."
bad,Train you for 1 month expect you to know everything. The truck delivery tracking system they had in place was very confusing. I see now why it was tough for them to find someone to fill the role consistently.
bad,"If you are one of the guys at CHR, you have got it made.  Salesmen and upper management get to enjoy travelling, schmoozing, days on the golf course, nights on the town and great bonuses."
bad,"There was a lack of quality management leading to high turnover rate and 17 hour days. Permenant temp position meaning no raises, no upward mobility, and no benefits."
bad,"Management was the worst part of this job, was sole receiver for whole warehouse, was promised options to move up to training forklift, was denied multiple times even though I showed promising work results. Other than that i enjoyed the faced paced continuous workday."
bad,"Not available, not pertinent to the basis of this application."
bad,If you looking for long term career growth and yearly raises Keep it moving it’s a secure job though but management will continue to add more tasks to your plate and make excuses of branch money issues when you ask for a raise
bad,"worked for around a year and noticed the extreme lack of professionalism, training and nepotism in the workplace was contributing to its lack of overall success."
bad,C.H. Robinson is a very fast paced and cut throat type of company. Manager are very demanding and at times rude. They pay entry level employee very minimally and think that is acceptable. This is a great starting job for someone but overtime it wears on an individual and not a great work/life balance.
bad,at C.H. Robinson there isn't any room for growth. If you enjoy working the weekends and like to feel stressed while working then C.H. Robinson is for you. They only care about the bottom line. The managers pretend to be on your side when issues arise but they're not. Managers (one in particular) doesn't take the time to learn the job that you are working so if an issue arise you're basically out of luck.
bad,CH is your typical transportation company. Pit all their employees against each other instead of working together - earn as much money as possible then leave for something better
bad,"The corporate culture at this company lacks compassion, understanding, and decency.  All that is concentrated on is your productivity and the profits for the stockholders.  Do not invest more time than you need to with this company."
bad,The work is repetitive. You will perform the same tasks each and every day. This job is very fast paced and multi tasking the entire day is necessary to excel.
bad,The company it self is wonderful. There is always something new to learn and many opportunities. The biggest problem is their management. They don't care if they over work the employee that works the hardest. They will continue to treat them unfairly and not show any appreciation. Some offices are great and some with bad leadership ends up making it sour. If they were to listen to their good employees and get rid of the bad ones things would be better and revenues would definitely not be lost as much. No team work either. I saw it as all for one and one for all. Very sad as this company is great but people are in positions they shouldn't be in; like management.  Management also likes to hide things from corporate and make it seem like some employees are the reason for losses and/or problems so they don't look bad. This is not fair especially when these good employees have tried saving the branch from losing and management won't listen.
bad,"If you're lucky to end up with a good GM you're veru fortunate, however many I encountered were not properly trained or qualifed to manage a branch. Growth oportunties are limited at the branch level and often require relocation to another state."
bad,"When I started it was great.  Nice, friendly place to be.  Phoenix had just been purchased by C.H. Robinson and not a lot had changed yet.  WOW in 2 years C.H. Robinson managed to suck the life out of that place.  So very sad.  Saw a ton of turn over and no value given to the employee's.  If you can find something else, do it!!!!"
bad,"Handled 250+ loads daily. Contacted each customer for paperwork. Once received paperwork, had to bill/pay them out."
bad,"The worst salary ever, I made more waiting tables.  They make everyone learn the same exact skills and by doing that, everyone is totally replaceable.  I was let go the day they hired someone from another country at a lower salary.  Good Benifits, but all you do is call on trucks and beat them up on price.  The truckers hate CHR and call them Cheap and Heavy.  There was no goals to hit and you work in a cube in a room full of people just like you.  Also no comission on landing a new customer, so you get a big fat thank you when you land a $30,000 per month profitable customer.  Also you work long hours to get the job done, then to make it worse every year on halloween weekend you have to go on a work camp out and pay your own way on meals and drinks and your own time away from family and friends.  I almost for got the 1 Saturday morning you were required to work once every month 7am to 12 noon, fun!  I was there when Co-worker got her 5 year gift from CHR and I kid you not it was a pair of walkie talkies.  And I gurantee she wasnt making $50,000 per year after 5 years of service.  Just no motivation to work hard, everyone I worked with got there right on time, couldnt wait for a 1 hr lunch and as soon as 5pm hit they ran for the door.  Team events were very lame and everyone had their clicks and if your not a brown noser you days will be numbered.  In my office 30 of us worked pay check to pay check with no real pay increase for any reason and only the office manager made $300,000 per year.  Yeah real fair."
bad,"The culture seemed fun at first, but after 2 1/2 years and no advancement it was time to go. It is by definition a dead end job with a compensation package that is a joke. Stay away."
bad,"moral is down, you are not a person just a number. It is hard not to get down by working there"
bad,The work environment if you like being harrassed on daily then this is the company for you. Moving forward with other position they only want to reward employee that are highly LIKE by management. The hardest part of the job was dealing with employee's and nothing was of much enjoyment. Management were not as motatived and engerized as they should of been and was not as rewarding to the people that deserved recoginition.
bad,Not a company for long term growth or earnings. This is a company that they do no value their employees but just look at the short term picture. Pay is not what it should be
bad,"CHR is focused on hiring younger employees and temps so they can offer smaller salaries. As a result, the work environment lacks maturity and tends to contain cliques. The office culture is wrought with preferential treatment, age discrimination, and tactics that are designed to make older employees feel uncomfortable to the point of quitting. Thus, making more room for temps and younger employees with less salary requirements."
bad,Ch helped me to get where I am today they are the perfect stepping stone. If you are in a bad branch get out there is no way to get around that. Portland b re anchor has never promoted a general manager from within. In 40 years if you are looking for a lifetime Cartier this is not the way to go but get all the training you can I. Making 6 figures +++ from everything I got out of CHs external classes
bad,I don't have a review to give for the company. It was a great start to a career but other than that its smart to work there then leave to progress your career.
bad,"My team lead and direct report successfully created a work environment where workers felt unprepared, unequipped, unsupported, and undervalued. This was truly a meat grinder of a work place. I was shown quickly that I was replaceable, and while still in the first two months of work, was not being supported or counseled on improving efficiency and accuracy of work, then shamed for not being an effective team member. "
bad,The most enjoyable part of this job is the friends you'll make as the building hosts 1000+ employees. The hardest part of this job is your mistakes will be amplified while your successes are overlooked.
bad,"Training was a joke - completed web-based tutorials at my desk. It was loud all around me and it was hard to focus. I never felt like I knew as much as I should have and it was difficult to get assistance, most of the time. I never felt like I could go to a supervisor and the person tasked with assisting me preferred to pretend I wasn't there. I struggled, a lot, trying to figure things out. Making $14 an hour and having to pay for benefits, driving an hour each direction and hating being there made the decision to move on easy. "
bad,"It's an okay job to get out there in the job force, but I would not recommend making this company a true career home to retire from.   You will not remain the same or recognize yourself! The overall feel is that women are not capable. The ones that strive to prove that they are turn out to be just cruel! The job can be so draining and fruitless at times."
bad,"This job was very stressful, no work-life balance. Long hours. Never went home after a work day and felt like I accomplished everything that I could. Had to try to reach unattainable financial goals for the company as well. Very high turnover in the office."
bad,"Typical day is spent managing accounts, dealing with the struggles of the transportation industry.  Logistics can be fast-paced and demanding, and a 3PL like CHR is the lifeline for their customers.  Lots of pressure to make sure freight is moving as shippers rely on transportation to make sure a line isn't shut down or they lose business.  Can be very stressful at times but also rewarding."
bad,There is no need for a review. Please see all other aspects of the job description for any logistics company and run a comparison. Logistics is logistics.
bad,"Overall it's a good place to start.  Casual dress, fun atmosphere.  One bad thing is corporate has all these grand ideas, but the people who come up with these ideas haven't talked to customers in 10+ years, and have no idea what customers are seeing in the market.  Many customers quote with 5+ companies."
bad,It is a company that thrives on having a robotic presence at all times. Do not stir up any pots or ask questions against the grain. Management wants followers. Not leaders.
bad,Each office is independent of the other and operated as location specific branches.  Branch Managers operate P & L much like a franchise.
bad,Very Hardworking and helpful employees throughout the day.
bad,"If you are struggling to get a first job out of college CH might be a right fit for you. They get you experienced with office work and high amounts of phone calls. The problem is that it gets old fast and thats all you will ever do with the company. The mangment plays favs when it comes to promotions. You have to have thick skin to work here because you be cursed out by truck drivers on a regular basis, and the higher ups usually only use anger and fear to try to hit the numbers. Again there is no place to go which is why you walk into any office and its mostly 30 and under."
bad,"Typical day at work. You must be seated, logged in and working by 7:30am. While working at CHR for almost six years I believe I can step into any logistics role and excel with little to no on the job training. Since all the the employees must take a personality test we were all ""Type A"" personalities and got along very well. I also made some good friends while working there. The hardest part of the job is cutting carrier's rates making it hard for them to stay in business while seeing a 20%+ profit margin on a load. The most enjoyable part of the job is the completion of a large logistic project or securing the first load for a customer."
bad,"Management will overload your workload and give you extra responsibility, but will not allow you to move up the ranks unless they think you are friends. If you are bullied and you bring it up to management, they turn the tables to make you the problem rather than helping you find a solution. Everyone is a number, no one stands out or is recognized unless they are friends of the boss."
bad,"The company culture is not the best - very cut throat and numbers focused. Much of the carrier sales rep position is out of the employees control. Market shifts drive performance. Must be able to problem solve, time manage, and have great communication skills and lots of patience to thrive in this environment."
bad,"Always looking for a better job, they can turn and burn you really fast and dont help employees that are burnt out. With the current market you have to really gind to build a book"
bad,"The company as a whole is a mixed bag, it really matters which office you work in as far as the quality of your working life is concerned.  I enjoyed my time at the Chicago Central location."
bad,The atmosphere within the branch I worked at was similar to that of a High School. The environment is stressful and opportunities for advancement are few. Overall people seem dissatisfied with their jobs. The benefits/perks are the best part of the job.
bad,It is a very busy work day at this company.  The people there are nice but lazy.  I didnt work there very long they are not professional and if they dont like you right off the bat they will push you out.  If your looking for experience right out of college its a good starter job.
bad,"This job is fast paced and the company is constantly pushing for better goals. Think you've hit your goal for the day? thats just on paper, think again because your manager is going to ask you to explain why your numbers aren't higher. Classic sales job sit at a desk all week must be able to easily navigate email, Skype and telephone (your cell phone as well)"
bad,A good job right out of college but not for a long period of time. The training is minimal and you are required to learn difficult in-house computer programming you will not use anywhere else.
bad,"A manager can make or break a job. I switched positions to avoid the current manager and they promoted someone else way more toxic for any environment I have been in. Would not recommend,"
bad,this job pays ok and you are usually able to get a decent schedule.  the training is not that good and you may get wrote up for something that you were not even trained to do.
bad,"10 hour days with little to no flexibility."
bad,Sr. Mangmnt poor choices of leadership role to run IAH branch hurt company's reputation in Houston Market. Dept. leadership inexperienced. Customers Lost trust. Accounts are in/out the door.
bad,"Not your typical 9am-5pm. Poor management. Low pay for industry. Great co-workers. Very stressful every day. Problem resolution daily. Usually a working lunch every day. Average benefits at best. 18 PTO days to start, 5 additional days every five years of employment. High turnover mostly from employees leaving for higher paying roles or just sick of the daily stress. I would not recommend any of my friends/family to work here."
bad,"I enjoyed the sales aspects of the job and learned a lot about building relationships.  However, I learned very quickly there wasn't a clear path to leadership, they implement the lateral position change more than the vertical.  Plus, I didn't love what I was doing."
bad,I was lucky enough to have 2 great managers and like the people I worked with during my time at CH.  Without that I'm not sure how I would have lasted as long as I did as the work itself is unrewarding and the compensation does not match the stress level and long hours.
bad,"It's a grind to complete day to day tasks, most employees are maxed out on workload and not willing to help others. I've learned a lot about the transportation industry, customer service, time management, and team atmosphere. Coworkers are not very social, too busy to help others, and overall negative most of the time. The hardest part of the job is seeing the big picture while being overwhelmed in the daily tasks. It's a good company doing good things in the industry, but they don't develop their talent or take care of the people keeping the engine running."
bad,A very robotic sales job. Simply not for everyone. If a paycheck motivates you beyond meaningful work then this job can work for you. Lots of things out of one's control and very unrealistic expectations form management.
bad,"Worked in the marketing department on social media and client outreach projects. Lots of pressure from upper management with sporadic requests demanding quick turnarounds with often little info. Employees were modishly professional, often catty and a vast majority were veterans. Only a few led and kept department moral strong and chummy. Pretty typical corporate mentality and environment.  Gorgeous facilities and well-organized internal holiday shindigs."
bad,I loved working there and my job and pay and colleagues for years. We were profitable. Work life balance was good. Everyone was happy and collegial. Then they hired a truly awful manager. They should have known better. This manager fired many good people to hide their own incompetence. Upper management should have known better.
bad,"It was a very enthusiastic company to be employed with, I developed extensive customer service skills  in this position as a purchase and sales order clerk.  The environment was friendly and always positive.  This was a contract position for maternity leave."
bad,"Making $13.00 an hour for a stressful job is not worth it. If they at least payed me $15-18 I would consider staying at the current position. The manager I am working under are horrible, please treat your coworkers with respect and be patient."
bad,Fast paced work heavy environment. Flexibility and quick thinking necessary. Mulitple shifts but can be very difficult to balance with personal life. Good pay.
bad,"Was a paycheck, never nice to be a number. Ideas get hijacked and passed off as your bosses.  Credit wasnt given where it was due.  Learned alot about buisness ethics"
bad,"Talented group of young people to work with, but no real career path at all and seem to value young/cheap talent over experience.  Long hours, low pay."
bad,"Would not go back to CHR. Although I loved my fellow employees I was underpaid for the amount of hours I was expected to put in, including working late on the evenings and over the weekends."
bad,"Decent place to work when just launching your career in logistics/ supply chain."
bad,"Good stepping stone into Transportation Industry"
bad,"My first few months with Phoenix were delightful, and I truly felt the excitement and had confidence in my leadership. Unfortunately, this all declined with the buyout by CH Robinson. The culture shift was felt immediately, and management did not seem to have strong direction. I was often given conflicting information and found many discrepancies between corporate and satellite office. Ultimately it was decided in both our best interests to part ways. I do not recommend CH Robinson to anyone seeking new or advancement opportunities."
bad,"Customer Service, this is my main focus each and everyday. I make sure that I am taking care of my customer in any way I am able to. Whether its tracking their shipments, pricing out future lanes and bids or recovering any lost revenue. Being able to provide exceptional customer service to my customer is what I thrive for everyday. "
bad,"Worked here as an intern, was a good internship to get experience in the supply chain industry. However, at times I felt like they could have utilized me better. Wouldn't work there again."
bad,"Although it can be mundane at times, it is very fast-paced and hectic at others. If you do not handle stress well, this is not the environment for you. Co-workers are all easy to get along with. Very male-dominant."
bad,"Know going into a position at CH Robinson that you need to fit their image and play the roll to fit their objectives.  These don't always benefit an employee first.   They now limit the accounts you can go after (Sales Position).  Making money quick is very now more difficult.   With that being said, you open the doors to new opportunities outside the company.  Make sure you don't burn any bridges but don't drink the punch.  "
bad,"In my opinion Towards the end of my time at Ch Robinson i felt drained , i was pushing myself to go in everyday and was relieved when i was let go, at the beginning  it was ok, but you get tired of being belittled by callers all day, ive worked at a call center before this and it was nothing compared to the treatment the truckers gave you at Ch Robinson, it would leave me feeling mentally exhausted not wanting to face another caller. the way management handled the procedures was horrible they didnt even know what was going on yet expected one as a employee to get it and not get it wrong or face the consistences, they have no sick days only PTO and are expected to schedule your sick days in advance, this is hard on parents and students and for that reason i saw alot of employees be terminated, you had one call out day a month as long as pto was available and if more than one was used you would be written up"
good,"I have no desire to further elaborate on my experience with this company. It might be a good fit for some, but definitely not all. I have no desire to recommend or discourage anyone from working for this company."
good,"If you want to be tired, under appreciated, and constantly micro managed then this job is for you, have to be in the office at 7 am. I f you are even 10 min late they will keep a running tally of you."
good,"Unload inbound shipments and move to staging locations for labeling and receiving. Efficiently stack and store merchandise in assigned areas. Pull and prepare product for shipment by full truckloads with multiple drops. Utilize RF scan gun for picking, receiving, putaway, and loading functions."
good,"One director bombards with group emails about petty stuff constantly, such as bathroom issues and even takes pictures of ""body waste"" and sends those by email. No life/work balance, always getting calls and emails after hours."
good,Coworkers and other employees made the workplace fun and a great positive place to work. Upper management did not appreciate their employees and treat them with respect. There was favoritism and a lot of manipulation.
good,All male gender office abd very busy office.  Need to work on employee communication.   Job security was not guarantee and now they are no longer in Canfield
good,Management was not willing to assist the department in meeting daily/monthly/yearly goals. The department had high expectations but not enough tools to completely meet these expectations.
good,you would have to work there to know the experience. So very fast pace environment you do have to work long hours management does need a little bit of work and how they treat our employees.
good,"It wasn't a great job but it wasn't terrible."
good,"The companies culture has improved since I've been here but still has miles to go. They like to think that little changes will get you to overlook the fact you can get more money almost anywhere. You're expected to work overtime if your work isn't all done, supervisors do not like to help you. Not really much teamwork, really everyone e for themselves."
good,Although CH Robinson gives you corporate level experience in the logistics industry. I wouldn’t recommend working there. There is no work life balance and the demand for you to perform at an unreachable level is unreal
good,"My coworkrrs would literally come in plug in their headphone and work. No socializing... I was trained on all the redundant softwares they had, but when it came to learning the specifics for my position I felt like they really dropped the ball."
good,"Needs improvement internally . Once givien the opportunity to prove myself,  the supervisor over me took the credit for the processing for a huge client. The first time something went wrong, which happen before I was employed there, they used the new employee as the excuse. Not professional."
good,Laid back atmosphere when i started but management had changed by the end of my time there.  Very fun culture at the beginning but awful by the time i left.
good,"Co Worker was super sweet same old same old stuff everyday, loved the hours, no weekends no part timers, hardest thing seating all day"
good,Decent job for college grads but don't expect it to be a career at the branch level.
good,"Too much paperwork, they didn't use scanner. Just sticker bar codes,which caused a lot of mis-shipments. The errors weren't caused by long time employees but all the come and goers that were brought in by the staffing agencies."
good,I interviewed 4 times before getting the job. Once I got it I was thrown to the wolves to see if I could manage. I did not perform well under these conditions.
good,"Solid place to work , if you are a self starter and can adapt and problem solve. Don't expect help from anyone, its a culture of ""I"" and ""Me"" if you can handle that great place to work."
good,"Buen ambiente laborar , horarios de trabajo, actividades laborales y de caridad."
good,I had a great manager who made coming to work fun and I learned a lot from the training. I felt like I was going to advance in my career with all the knowledge I gained.
good,"The Company itself is great, the problem today is management. There is a lot of favoritism and if you not liked by management you don't move up. The way they make their decisions do not make sense at all, for example, within 1 year, someone with no experienced moved from entry writer to Senior entry writer to Supervisor, simply because she was flexible with her schedule."
good,"They make it seem like you will be on commission and on your way up the company ladder in no time. In truth, commission takes a minimum of 2 years to reach, if they don't fire you and replace you first. If you don't perform almost immediately, then get ready for a short run."
good,"CH Robinson is very fast paced and demanding.  "
good,"working at CH Robinson could be fun and interesting, they do try to keep employees involved. They do a lot to focus on the employee being at work and engaged.  contests and holiday celebrations.. giveaways."
good,Handle a major account for all Ocean Imports.  I dispatch around 300 containers a month to go to various parts of the U.S.  I establish relationships with numerous carriers to ensure delivery appointments are set and full filled. Send numerous emails to carriers and or clients to make sure everyone involved are doing what they need to do to make sure deliveries are on time.  Make sure all billing is correct from steam shipping lines and carriers.
good,"A good company to work for.  You will have a vast knowledge of 3PL, Logistics in general and all things transportation. It is a great place to grow your customer service skills such as verbal and written communication as you cross paths with CEO to dock workers and truck drivers on a daily bases."
good,Typical Support role. Heavy Metric based grading for performance. Difficult environment to thrive in.
good,I would recommend CHRW for college graduates looking for a career in supply chain.
good,"Working at CHR was fun, the corporate culture is one that promotes team work. If you are fresh out of college or want to break into the industry, it is a good place to start out. Not a good place for someone who has been in the industry for a while. Unless you are part of the clique, you get stuck making very little money and working very hard. You can expect to work very long hours. They are relentless with pressure to make goals and they expect too much out of people."
good,"CHR is a revolving door of people. This culture is for thick skinned people. Conversations can easily get inappropriate. There could be more professionalism across all levels. Since the office is young, there is a lot of high school pot stirring and gossip."
good,"work-life balance was in lacking entirely, i had an emergency come up and  had missed not even a full day of work and i was immediately terminated. contracted employees were treated very differently"
good,Overall company is great but the floor management creates many obstacles for advancement and are quick to hire in without acknowledging the current qualified employees.
good,"Long work days, and limited time off.  Great place to start out, and learn the ins and outs of the transportation industry but offered limited advancement opportunities."
good,This work place is very fast paced with heavy workload making for a very stressful day.  If you can't keep up your expected to work during lunch off the clock.
good,"Fast paced, quick days. Can be stressful at times but the co workers make it manageable. Opportunities for advancement. It is what you make of it. Would recommend."
good,"Good place to start your career as you get a lot of responsibility right off the bat.  However, terrible micromanagement and very little room for advancement."
good,"-8-5 Monday-Friday job"
good,"Poor work life balance. Poor management and work culture. Able to advance if you are well liked. Okay pay. Some travel. ""Work hard play hard mentality"""
good,Upper management don't know how to treat people. There's long hours and mandatory overtime. There's always lack of communication with staff. Work from office don't come out in a decent time.
good,Little opportunity for advancement. Good place to work out of college but only for 2 years. Strategy seems to change every 6 months Very fast paced and hectic work environment
good,"CHR is a good place to start in Logistics, but there isn't much room for advancement unless you start in management. The culture is very young and turn over is very high."
good,Company expects constant availablility. Very little concern for employees work / life balance leads to extreme stress levels
good,This third party logistical company offered a lot to learn and a lot to do but in my opinion did not fairly compensate its workers. my position was in the shipment information Center where we were micromanaged and treated differently than the people in other departments.
good,"ch is a great place to start your career. they offer great benefits and you get insight into the corporate world at a mostly casual level. coworkers are pleasant and easy to get along with. management is lacking, which is odd since you will typically have 2-3 supervisors at any given time. no sense of teamwork on the account management side, so expect to work through lunch and stay late often if you are given a high volume or needy customer. male counterparts will get better opportunities and make more than females. your opinion is rarely asked on issues that affect you directly, or at least in my experience this was an ongoing issue. i'd say, start your career here right out of college, learn all there is to know and get gone. you won't be rewarded for your hard work here. "
good,"I had to accomplis a quota of 88 appointments per day for deivery of freight along with billing, obtaining BOL for deliveries to warehouses, and solve any issues that may arise during the day. I had really good co-workers that were helpful. The hardest part of the job was making the quota compiled with getting other responsibilities done in a timely manner. I enjoyed the enivorement for the most part. I learned how to type much quicker and how to use a spread sheet on the computer. I became more self motivated as well."
good,Very fun and great people that worked there. I do wish they paid a little more definitely with the cost or living in Chicago Illinois. Overall good company to work for.
good,"Worked at the Iowa City office for almost 5 years.  Really loved the first 4 years of working there.  The culture in the office was great until our manager got promoted to corporate.  After that, corporate promoted our sales manager to office manager.  Once that happened the whole culture of our office changed.  The focus shifted from customer service first to a very aggressive sales approach.  His very in-your-face ""motivational"" techniques created a tense culture and alienated most of the employees.  Many productive workers chose to leave.  Promotions and rewards were not results based, only for those 100% bought into his culture."
good,The general manager is unapproachable and hard to work with.  He does not explain in detail what he wants down and never is accountable for own actions always passes the blame. The pay is lower then most jobs with same title and always give different assignments that are not included in the job title
good,"the people I work with are the reason I have stayed so long, no work life balance. management is not aligned. CH is moving forward with technology and advancements but they are starting to leave their people behind"
good,Great people to work with.  Day to day is a keeping constant track of emails and tasks to complete.  Handled day to day issues on any freight that was missing and/or late.
good,"The office environment is fun. The pay is not great. Need to staff up. Usually the day starts with going through emails, approving shipments and addressing customer issues."
good,As a buyer you work long hours and freight NEVER stops. That means one Saturday a month and on Holidays someone always has to be in the office. Good entry level position but it churns and burns quickly
good,"Company is working hard to transform themselves and become more relevant."
good,"overall, it is stressful environment. You are given more than you can handle but pay is not enough on top of that, management cut overtime and they have very unrealistic expectations. "
good,"The one thing Chrobinson missed the mark on is company culture. Phoenix intl understood the employees often spend more time at work or on the road to and from then at home daily. Their iffice envieoment met that absence of family head on. Allowing persinal touches of family at yoru work spaces. The office culture was stuctured but allowed for humor and a sense of family to prevail. Leading to long term employees.  Chrobinson came in and immediately removed all perosnal touches as to not offend someone, laughter was discouraged as it may disturb others. People who jad work 9, 10, 12 plus years with phx intl found the new stark office setting lacked the feeling of team and family that once made the company so great. Mass exit began slowly and grew rapidly as more and kore micro management came in from CHRobinson. I felt bad leaving but as qe all quickly learned. It was no longer about employee loyalty and making the employee feel like a key player,  it was now focused on the bottom line and profit only. The employee for CHR seems to be a work horse not a key player who treat well, trustez and compensated appropriatly will built the company to bigger and better thing.  Sadly CHR micromanaged the PHX INTL team right out the door. Losing many great, qualified, customer devoted people to useless rules and mircomanagement. And the customer base  suffered for it."
good,"the management style is not good,employees always complain about the salary but it is a good place to get experience and then you can move into another company ."
good,"CH Robinson is a great place to learn about transportation. The tools and analytics are second to none. The downside is work/life balance, opportunities for advancement."
good,"Overall, I great place to learn the Logistics industry. They provide good training and benefits. However, compensation is lacking and (from my experience) favoritism rewards over skill and experience for advancement."
good,This company is making a lot of changes and it's not favorable for the newer employees starting out. The office moral is down because people are worried about job security.
good,"The office was, most of the time just floating along, Management lacks clear direction.  Pay structure for my role was poor, based more on team goals rather then individual efforts."
good,A workplace that will keep you on your toes. Very much a sink or swim method. Hardest part of the day is dealing with customers who don't understand logistics and 3PL's.
good,CH Robinson was a fun place to work for a long time but the culture and atmosphere had begun to change rapidly.  Change is the only constant at CH Robinson.
good,"To be specific,  horrible Export Manager, with ""0"" Managerial, People skills.  Other Management,  extremely knowledgeable.  Avoid if you aren't into cliques, as this is the atmosphere."
good,"Track shipments booked by the Brokers."
good,"C.H. Robinson had a few issues. Namely with employee morale. The primary issue was that they had tenured employees (20+ years) who were extremely disrespectful to basically the entire staff aside from the General Manager and it created a lot of friction and heartache amongst the office. "
good,Great job to get your feet wet in the corporate world.  Lack of advancement opportunities.  Expected work outside of business hours.
good,Every day is different which made the job exciting.  You needed to be able to adapt quickly and think on your feet.
good,very business casual experience. Jeans and boots everyday and you can speak comfortably. pay isn't great but you get good experience. can be stressful depending on accounts.
good,"A typical day at work involves servicing customers, resolving problems and lots of multitasking.  I learned to work on my own and make decisions but I am also part of a great team of coworkers that are a great support system.  The hardest part of the job is having to rely on people outside of the organization to do their jobs correctly in order for my job to be completed to the satisfaction of my customer.  The most enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers and the environment they provide."
good,"My day consists of catching up on emails from the previous day. After which I run a series of KPI reports. Some are for my carrier base and others are for my customer. I reach out to my carrier base and make sure that they have met their demands from the previous day. I assist my customer with accrual issues as well as deal with all major mishaps. I focus a part of my day working on LTL loads. It is a priority to make sure that missed deliveries are rescheduled and that the new deliveries are made. In my six years I have learned balance. I have learned how to deal with my carrier base, customers, sales support, warehouses, my customers head of transportation, as well as their consignees. In addition to that I have learned how to run the day to day small reports that keep the account running smooth as well as the larger in depth reports that are run monthly and bimonthly to provide key information for my customer as well as make sure that we and our carriers are paid correctly. I have become the go to person on my account for my managers as I have been on my account over four years. I have a good repoire with my co-workers. I have trained numerous employees in my company. I have 3 subordinates who report to me and we all work together very well. The hardest part of the job is often dealing with carrier failures and making sure that they don't happen repeatedly. There are times of the year where it is more difficult to secure capacity for loads and you have to be aware of those times of the year and how they cycle. One of the most enjoyable parts of is working with my client and"
good,"C.H. Robinson is a great company to work for, for the right person. They have a excellent benefit package and a decent hourly pay rate."
good,"The culture at CHR is often good and optimistic, but it is much more skewed towards upper management or individuals who find themselves in certain careers (Like information technologies). However, even low level employees can enjoy the occasional lunch party or department outing.  The workflow tends to be very intensive and demanding, often requiring your full attention and focus at all times of busy days, and still requiring hours of attention and focus on slower days.  At all times you are expected to be working at the same fast and intensive pace as everyone else.  This kind of work often creates stress for most job departments, as accuracy and timeliness are crucial to success in logistics and shipping.  Despite the increased stress, lower level employees are underpaid, even those who excel at the job and have a multitude of experience.  If you can give every day on the job 100%, and won't burnout after a very busy week of constant work that requires very high degrees of accuracy and speed, you can succeed here."
good,"High stress and little fun"
good,"Good experience,  very corporate structure. There were some great people I worked with, but the turnover was predictable, structured to turn people over and bring in cheap young talent to run ops"
good,"Need better incentives, employee recognition and hourly pay. Parking is first come first serve. The owner should provide parking for all of his employees."
good,Fast pace competitive place to work.  Foul language and poor treatment of clients was prevalent.  Strictly money driven. promotions were distributed based on favoritism.
good,Very strict with attendance. They have a high turn over rate because of attendance. They don't take care of their employees. if you don't care out management not caring about you then go work there.
good,Intensely positive corporate culture. They oversell the benefits and career planning a bit. Almost every job included being on the phone constantly. Bad customers were given to newer employees to push growth. Bonuses were discretionary (this was a few years ago) and not tied directly to any sales or quantified. Worked there for base salary with no bonus for the first year on the agreement. Ended up leaving before that year was done. Some people who had several years in were doing well with bonuses. Many days you stay late. Almost every day everyone started pretty early. Sales targets weren't that reasonable or attainable. Competition and claims from dominant branches makes things difficult and has caused some consolidation between offices.
good,Great place if you excel in fast paced environment and willing to learn about the industry. If you think about growing and moving around it would be highly unlikely unless you have about 5 years experience and the proven work ethic
good,"Unable to keep working here despite being a great contributor..."
good,"poor management, job will not make you happy, and you gotta kiss up to get on top and never appreciated, and people only talk to when its benefits them"
good,"I joined CH Robinson with the understanding that there would be room for career advancement.  After 3 years, my immediate manager and branch manager essentially hold my career hostage and are unwilling to help me develop into a role with broader responsibilities and greater earning potential.  To my knowledge I am unfortunately at a worse location, but they definitely oversell the ""you can move anywhere, we're a global company"" that they pitch during the interview process."
good,"Not a millennial-friendly company, but very stable employment. Little to no daily benefits, stressful environment, and high paced workload. This is a good company for an entry level role or an internship, but for career advancement there are few opportunities."
good,"Brand new building plenty of work space."
good,They do an excellent job at providing you training and real hands on experience. Pay is low and raises are hard to get. Great company  to start with and learn the trade but probably better to utalize those skill elsewhere.
good,"Overall its not a terrible place to work, but the company and higher ups are incredibly clique-based. A person can be swept under and out if they don't like you."
good,"worked here for many years.   The workload was very high and could be stressful at times.  There was extremely high turn over and in my view management had generally unrealistic growth expectations year after year but it's a public company so the stockholders don't care and the employees have to deliver, a bit of a catch-22 that falls on the backs of the rank and file.  The hardest part of the job besides trying to achieve constant high growth, was navigating between landmines and trying not to end up the ire of someone higher up.  Once you got a target on your back you would generally get forced out one way or another.  You need ambition and stamina to be successful at this place because it never ends, you have to keep climbing, and whatever goal you achieved last month you had better beat it the next time around otherwise the threats start rolling down from corporate, wages get cut and people get fired or demoted.  The people are nice and the office culture is fun but at the end of the day it's every person for themselves."
good,Enjoyed most of the people I worked with and had some good leaders.. but the expectation was that you would work 10-12 hours everyday regardless of outside or family commitments.
good,"I would recommend this to anyone fresh out of college.  There is plenty of room to grow assuming you are following the sales roles.  Operations and Carrier rolls are basically stagnant.  You will know pretty quickly if you have room to grow or not.  The company has done a good job adding layers to what was a very flat structure, but advancement beyond title changes/lateral moves still seems a little questionable. Otherwise the office environment is typically entrepreneurial and uninhibited by management to chase sales leads."
good,"Work and personal life balance is great. "
good,"The logistics / transportation industry has a reputation for overworked and underpaid employees. C.H. Robinson is no different. If you are absolutely committed to this industry and are extremely organized you can certainly advance over time. However, I know a great number of people who deserved advancement and did not receive it. Overall, C.H. is a typical freight forwarder."
good,"This isnt for everyone, but there is alot of job security. It is high stress but over all a decent job to have if you can handle it. Management is okay but harsh at time."
good,"The actual job was challenging and fast pace. It was obvious from the start that some reps were favored more than others. Management distributed those reps more opportunities than others leading to an overall feeling of low moral."
good,IMO unrealistic expectations placed on employees.  Excellent training & fun culture but compensation is low & stress is high. Great for kids right out of college to gain logistics experience.
good,"- Good place to cut your teeth out of college, solid experience gained"
good,"CH Robinson offers good employee benefits; such as health, dental and prescription insurance.  Another benefit offered by CH Robinson is good 401k retirement options."
good,"The company itself is wonderful. The biggest problem is their management. Some teams are great but some fail due to poor leadership.  IT skilled workers are treated like commodities and they try to give perks like lunches and events to make up for it.  Conservative environment, not interested in change, people get in trouble for taking time off to take care of family and new babies - again it depends on the manager.  Many people leave after one or two years.  The ones that stay are people who have good teams with great leaders or no leaders, or people who are complacent about advancement and salary."
good,Not good. Carrier sales expected to never leave their desks. No career path. You will do the same thing from the day you start until the day you leave.
good,"typical day at work was routine, 8 hour days. I learned cold calling and prospecting. Management was helpful when available. My co workers were nice but stayed to themselves. Not really your team setting."
good,"C.H.R. is definately a good stepping stone, not the kind of place where you want to build your career but an awesome stepping stone. Management kind of sucks at the Kansas City Branch and is def a high stress job."
good,"CH Robinson is a strong company with many resources but each branch/division appears to have unclear goals."
good,"CH Robinson Projects Logistics Ltd. is the daughter company of CH Robinson Group, it provides employee good benefit and  strong operation network.  However, there's no proper channel  to upgrade career in this company especially in the branch where I'm currently employed"
good,"Lots of emails and communication with client, carriers and team mates. "
good,"A typical day would include reports, tracking trucks, setting appointments and building loads for trucks to pick up. I learned how the trucking industry works, and how an office environment really operates. "
good,"I respect everything I leaned at CH, but did not enjoy the majority of my time here.  The stress levels are extremely high and it is tough to pursue your own business at times (customer sales).  Your entire career at CH depends on who's assistant you end up being and what other accounts they decided to put you on."
good,"Fortune 300 company - adequate benefits package, compensation not balanced with workload. Salary pay- base the rest is paid in a bonus structure taxed at a higher rate- Corp very generous with profit sharing & 401 k contribution. Fun fast paced environment. Technology driven. Very chi'c environment - broker style negotiations from 7 am to 7 pm mon thru sat. "
good,"Young, loud, & lively atmosphere always made for a interesting day. Was able to learn alot by myself and what I expect out of my career goals since you are able to problem-solve and make critical decisions at a moments notice for your customers, all while completely using your own judgment. Also was able to brush up on my presentation skills with quarterly reviews presented to top accounts on-site. Some (very little) cold calling was required which forced you to step outside your comfort zone and be confident of myself and the product/service I was selling. Overall, great job for right out of college for I have taken the vast experience of a ll the aforementioned skills and put them to good use in future jobs/opportunites. However, as the economy tanked, so did our revenue and before I knew it I was handling what 5 account managers would typically handle and that slave-driven atmosphere eventually will make anyone bitter, lack motivation, and more than anything, burn out!!"
good,Management tends to get in the way of advancement. Very suspect pay and performance structure. Pay is not performance based - the manager has sole discretion at choosing what each employee makes.
good,CH Robinson is a good place to work when you are young coming out of college. But after a while it gets old when piles and piles of tasks are put on your plate with no end in sight.
good,"Nice benefits... pto and flexibility to use it."
good,Company is alright they just change your schedule and they don’t advise you on how to use your benifits. They usually give you other task to do but don’t give another pay.
good,It being the first job I ever had. I was overwhelmed with the work I was given at the time. I had no experience in the industry so it was challenging to me to keep up with the pace.
good,"CH Robinson does a good job with job culture and making it a fun environment to work in with great people. With that said, it's still just a large corporation and you are just a number in a sea of cubicles. Management was not impressive and definitely played favoritism, there was no support for career advancement or opportunities."
good,"The technology division of C.H. Robinson is a place where doing the minimum is acceptable, and at times applauded. If you're a good culture fit, they really don't care how good you are at programming. Not to say that's necessarily all bad. A lot of newer programmers with less experience get a great start in this company and are able to grow into good developers who stick with the company. However, your personal experience will entirely depend on your manager and team. Some managers are really good at dealing with issues, and others will make them worse or ignore them. Most managers are stretched pretty thin so it's difficult to find time to talk with them or work together on solving issues. Advancing your career is quite difficult at this company as their evaluations do not take into account your programming skills but rather people's perception of your skills, which may or may not be based on actual evidence. Your code is never looked at or evaluated to determine advancement. Working overtime or going above and beyond is rarely recognized, with the exception of having a great manager, which is probably a 1/4 chance. Most likely your manager will not have time to even remember what you are working on, nonetheless give you credit for anything exceptional you did. If you are looking for a place that's open to developers with less experience, CHR is very welcoming to newbies and very patient with slow learners. It is nearly impossible to not meet expectations at this company, which is great for people who don't tolerate stress, but bad for business as well as disheartening for"
good,Have to be determined everyday to pick up the phone and make as many calls and prospect as much as you can. It is a relatively simple job but you have to be motivated to make sales to people that know exactly what you are selling. There is no sugar coating what you are selling to the carrier.
good,"It was ok working for CH but the lack of diversity in upper level positions troubled me.  Overall, the benefits were great though.  The training for certain positions was minimal.  In order to survive here you have to be a quick learner and willing to be multifaceted."
good,A typical day of work was very rewarding. Upper level management had unrealistic budget expectations during trying times and while they claimed they understood the challenges when it came time to budget they pushed for things that were not attainable.
good,"The hardest park of the job was the pay. The most enjoyable part was helping the drivers get what they needed to get the job done."
good,Corporate policy changes removed several of the liberties that made the job fun. Structure and management changes also also brought about a variety of challenges.
good,"Office environment is gossipy, unprofessional. I liked there was never ""down-time"", the phones are always ringing and there are always several hundred unanswered emails. Though, you aren't ever just left alone to work; people are always spreading there negativity around. It's uncomfortable. Not a team atmosphere."
good,Growing/successful logistics company with endless amounts of opportunity. Very stressful but was also very rewarding. Co-workers were like family. Would go back if the option was there.
good,"The position I was in was an evening job. This can be great depending on your family needs. It's late nights and the job itself can be emotional draining. "
good,"8-5 M-F"
good,You can make really good money but it is a daily grind and hard to move forward without buddying up with people around you. Management is helpful and always there but again you will be doing basically everything on your own.
good,Great place to begin a career with growth opportunities.  Company is growing.  Clients are demanding but challenge the company.  Leadership is focused on employee growth.
good,The people are wonderful but the workload is unmanageable.  The corporate office seems to be against the smaller branches and charge for small things that seem petty
good,Typical day includes arriving between 7:30-8:30 and managing previous nights events via email.  Fast paced hours of finding freight and/trucks to match and then exceed your daily goals.  I learned many sales techniques and how to work quickly.  Hardest part is lack of vertical career movement and repetitive tasks.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to leave work and not have to deal with it until the next day.
good,"Some days we are good, but others we do not get the help that is needed to accomplish all work properly. We don't have enough equipment for all workers and we have more work then all the workers can handle on a daily basis"
good,The Job is fast paced and competitive but enjoyable. For the amount of work and stress on a daily basis the pay was very poor. This is a good place to start your logistics career but move on after two years of experience.
good,"Its a place where you show up, do your work and go home. No more no less. Roles are always changing and you tend to get the feeling that management isn't really sure what they are doing while they try to figure it out on the fly."
good,CHR has excellent training programs and mentors. It is a faced paced environment and each day is different. Employees must be creative and innovative.
good,Decent place to start a career but minimal opportunity for career advancement. The environment is lax and flexible but the work can get repetitive at times. The office staff at my branch was friendly but not particularly close.
good,"As a customer account manager, the day flies by.  You take care of many customers and their transportation needs.  Its your responsibility to help them grow by aligning the correct methods of transport to their specific shipments.  No two days are the same. Management could be more helpful as an overused phrase in the office is that our job is ""like drinking out of a fire hydrant.""  Coworkers tend to unify to help one another because of this mentally.  Once it clicks, you impress yourself daily at what you can help achieve."
good,job was located in a nice close by area. sat down allday indexing 1425 documents during the entire time u there besides the  two 15mins breaks and the 30min lunch
good,"CHR is a fun place to work and has great workplace culture. They are always doing something fun to up the moral. The best place about the job were the people. The worst thing was the management. Not all managers were there to help build and advance your career, but instead to keep you in the same place working extra hard without the incentives."
good,"Easy job to adopt to. Pay could be a lot better, but this goes with how much your office produces. The Management at my office is not up to standards, but other offices are good."
good,Spend a lot of hours in the office tied to the desk. Good people work here and it can be a lot of fun. The people are really what make it a great place to work
good,"I would go into CHR with the mindset of moving on after 5 years.  It is a great place to start as a fresh college grad, but at 5 years most employees either love it or hate it.  You will learn a variety of business skills, and you will experience work life at a Fortune 300 company.  The compensation and promotion categories are what made me leave."
good,It is a good place to start if you are fresh out of college and do not have an idea of what you would like to do. Decent starting salary and easy to gain experience along the way. Management is always available to speak to or sit down with you. The environment is intense because you are dealing with problems all day long every day with people constantly cussing. Co-workers are easy to get along with. You do not have to dress up.
good,very fast-paced job; autonomous; hardly any work-life balance- always have to be available for customers; fun office environment; mediocre management
good,"You can make some good money and the benefits are great (insurance, 401K matching, etc).  The day to day job is very stressful, taxing, and frustrating.  Many things are out of your control and many problems arise so it's difficult to really focus on getting things done.  The people in general are all very nice and fun to work with."
good,"I have learned a great deal about the supply chain industry from my work at CH Robinson over the past few years.  It has given me an opportunity to oversee and manage accounts within the office, help identify opportunities where potential clients have inefficiencies in their supply-chain model, and present new ideas and solutions to these clients in order to outsource their transportation."
good,The people here are nice. There is not a lot of room for growing with the company.
good,"...but not a great place to have one. While you learn a lot about the transportation logistics industry, the long hours and low wages makes this a not so great place to work."
good,A typical day was coming in on time and getting right to work. Indexing documents and making sure information was accurate and correct in a timely manner. The hardest part of this job was indexing documents that  were sent in a different language.
good,"I liked working there, for the most part; however, I felt as though their was preferencial treatment within the senior employees and management. Also, I felt as if certain people that were more willing to brown-nose were given better opportunities, but not everything was as promised. I guess this is a perfect place to work at and get mixed signals."
good,"The overall work environment is fine, although it varies depending on the location. My personal experience is that they let you do your job without question, as long as you are hitting, or get close to your goals. The problem I have with this company is they do not reward based on results. Their metrics are objective and they always say that next year will be when you get your big raise. They start you off at the lowest possible salary."
good,Great people but pay is minimal and a lot of work--including weekends is expected of you
good,"Fun stressful very demanding, lots of changes to keep up with urber freight, and amazon freight.  Dealt with constant change many job titles changed over the last 3-4 years"
good,The people that are there are fantastic to work with.  They are currently understaffed and the job requirements are very demanding.  There needs to be more available support to support the job functions of their account management teams.
good,"Being a BA or EPM here is very demanding. You have to be ready to dive into a lot of the unknown. Being in the KC office is a red head step child experience. The culture in general is blah. I don't hate it here, but don't love it."
good,Engaging work environment with a game room to help relieve stress. Busy work days with rarely any down time. Days go by fast. Ever changing work environm
good,There was good training and a fun workplace culture. Training was good and I appreciated the information given.  I learned about the freight forwarding industry.  The commute was the hardest part of the job.
good,They are looking to cut 70% of their sales force and we have not been told directly who will retain and position and who won't. Not being transparent at all.
good,It's a great place to start and get your feet wet. People there are mostly friendly and encourage each other. Downside is the pay and very hard to progress.
good,"CH Robinson is a great company to work for, decent pay, good career opportunities and growth potential. I would recommend CHR to applicants as they provide a challenging opportunity for the right candidates"
good,"The typical day is spent bouncing between emails, phone calls, skype and any other way of communication you may use for your business. While talking to your clients you will use the companies system to broker freight to them. The benefits are good to start coming out of College but the job is draining because the company is constantly losing customer business making the job extremely difficult. I've seen the company lose a lot of business in my two years there and corporate management has finally decided to make adjustments that seem it's too little too late. The company has lost a lot of it's market share as of recent and they will no longer be the leader in their field for much longer."
good,"It's a good job that paid well, but difficult to create a career that includes advancements or transfers. The culture is very high pressure with very little training or mentorship."
good,Long hours standing up having 30 min of lunch the worst thing was that it was frezzing 60 degrees or probably less. The people there are real nice at all times
good,"Due to HR strictly adhering to ""Requirements"" for internal/external opportunities, they've eliminated manager input/recommendation for applicants both internally and externally."
good,"C.H. offers a competitive compensation structure for those in sales and brokerage roles. The commission structure is uncapped. If you are willing to work for it, there is high earning potential. The commission are paid out monthly so you do not have to wait for quarter end or year end lump sums."
good,Great company to work for as far as benefits and paid time off. Depending on your starting role opportunity for advancement can be minimal. It's a fast paced environment which can be both exciting and stressful. Attention to detail is very important in this role.
good,"CH Robinson was a good company (3 out of 5) overall to work for. The Memphis branch does not provide much career and personal development compared to their corporate philosophy. "
good,"I really like the company and the branch I work for, but it is really hard to see advancement which is why there is a high turnover rate. I do a lot more work than I am paid for and wish advancement was quicker than it is"
good,"Willing to work well with others. They are flexible with hours and motivated to help you move up. If one struggles, they give great constructive criticism and help you achieve your goal."
good,"C.H. Robinson is a Fortune 500 provider of multimodal transportation services and third-party logistics. The company offers freight transportation, transportation management, brokerage and warehousing. It offers truckload, less than truckload, air freight, intermodal, and ocean transportation"
good,"Tracking of shipments booked for your accounts. Reporting to customers daily on updates, problems/issues & trying to gain more business. Cold calling to potential customers & setting up meetings via phone/in-person to obtain new business. Long hours & weekends are required"
good,"Busy and stressful. Constantly on your toes. Expecting 24hr calls, even on vacation.  Lot of people left this company because lack of management and advance opportunity"
good,There was always a lot of work to stay busy. There were a lot of incoming and outgoing phones calls to truck drivers and customers. Fast paced environment made it very enjoyable.
good,"Buen inicio de aprendizaje. "
good,Great job. But it was through an agency. No chance of being hired on. No job security. You are not guaranteed work from one day to the next. Upper management gave no respect to employees.
good,CHR is your typical big pants corporate job. They brought me in on telling me im going to be an account manager then switched me to sales. My office was very brown nosey with the managers. If you sucked up they loved you and loved the attention. Culture is fun but the management structure needs work. No real room for growth.
good,If you are willing to work hard you can make good money right out of college. The people that work there are one of the best thing about the company. The commission structure keeps changing and keep taking money out of sales reps pockets which is frustrating.
good,It was a great company and growth was available . I learned and advanced a lot within the time I was employed. They have several departments in which you can advance to.
good,"Excelente empresa con muy buen ambiente laboral, ampliamente recomendada"
good,"new management has been set in place in the last six months, with that being said it will take time to reach the goal that has been set back for several reasons but there is a positive out look."
good,"The work environment is nice but the management isn't the best. There are no sick days so if you would like to save up on vacation days, try not to get sick."
good,TMC provided many opportunities to expand ones knowledge of the ever growing and thriving logistics field.  Opportunities within the company to move laterally or upwards were plentiful.
good,"Heads down, feet to the pavement everyday, is expected by Management. You have performance reviews weekly and at end of month, are held accountable for your work."
good,"There isn't much to say about the job really. I worked in SIC for a handful of months, dealing with clients calling either to ask for information or to voice a complaint. More than anything else, the job is just repetitive. You're sitting down all day responding to calls, and that's about it. If you like that kind of job, then you'll do just fine here. If you need a little more engagement from your job, then I'd suggest looking someplace else. The place is definitely more relaxed than other companies of a similar ilk, but you still need to answer a good amount of calls all day, otherwise they'll sack you right quick. Your immediate superiors will probably be friendly, though dealing with people from other departments will probably be a pain. This is a good case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing. There seems to be a certain level of disorganization the higher up you go, which explains why people in SIC were getting complaint calls all the time. Overall, it's an average job. If you keep your head down and just do the work you'll probably get promoted to other departments fairly quickly. Otherwise, don't expect to get much out of it either way."
good,"It is a good company but no longer operational. Fast pass environment, taught me a lot. Good entry level position into distribution. Still has a strong Customer service location in Woodridge."
good,"Good place to start a career or start a new career. Need to be assertive, ready to learn and have a good attitude and  you will do just fine.  The hardest part of the job  is that some people have misaligned work loads."
good,great sales training program in a fast past and competitive environment. great way to meet people in the chicago area your age.  need to think quickly on your feet for problem solving.
good,"Full time employee for 9 years, still have several excellent business contacts and professional references there. Good benefits, pay structure leaves something to be desired."
good,"Great entry-level job to develop skills and experience in the workplace. Not a lot of job advancement options unless your manager retires, but good for gaining office and business experience."
good,CH Robinson is a wonderful and fast paced company but hours required are not conducive to family life unless you have a stay at home partner or older children.
good,i was there on a contract to help clean up A/R. The job is very busy and training was way to long 8 week training.I enjoyed the time i was there the staff was very friendly
good,"always new things to learn in logistics. not  much room for advancing within the company. this is an ok company to work for, they do have good benefits and 401K,"
good,"Ok place to work, can become intense, lots of learning opportunities, very demanding . Great access to market and industry information, great place to start and learn logistics."
good,"A typical Evening hours where no one will responds to my queries"
good,"The job itself is actually quite fulfilling, allowing all areas of my personality to shine, including the detective, diplomat, mother, cheerleader, Etc. "
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at CH. It was fast paced and challenging. The benefits, PTO, and pay were all great. However management at this location is lacking.My advice for management is to learn how to take personal feelings out of decisions, lead by example, learn how to communicate and coach your team. Management takes being a great leader not just a boss. Leaders coach and work to resolve issues not point fingers. The branch manager never knew what was truly going on.  Also management needs to learn how to follow their own confidentiality policies as they like to take it upon themselves to share confidential conversations with other employees in front of everyone. There were many instances where previous employees were badge on by management on the floor."
good,Young culture.  Fast paced environment.  Great benefits.  Everyday is different.  Lots of relationships and contacts to make and build for future development.
good,"It’s easy to make friends here, but over time you get very sick of the same issues that arise with OTR loads. Managers can be amazing and laid back, but it’s luck of the draw. Seems to be a lot of favoritism. Lots of people that make too much money. Lots of people that don’t make enough. All stuffed in one cramped, middle school style seating office"
good,Everday is really the same. Laid back but you have to work hard and do the job right in a timely manner.the sun can be a bit harsh sometimes but the pays good.
good,"There was no culture at the location I worked at. Go to work, do your job and go home. If you're salary you work from home as well. Pay and benefits are amazing."
good,busy every day with unattainable metrics to fulfill.  do not care about what you can do just care about the metrics.  overall good but you better get in with the right crowd.
good,Cut throat sales environment. Very transactional sales model. Good team comradery and work environment but this can very by location. Fast-paced & constantly changing environment
good,"The people are great to work with but the real downfall is in how the company operations are run.  Extremely confusing roles, red tape, cut throat style environment against others salesmen."
good,"I left because hey moved the office 1 1/2 hours from my house. Good managers, some supervisors were less than productive, but fun overall atmosphere. ."
good,"I come to work eager to work and ready to learn. I enjoy working with the people.  I try to be the best I can at my job , people look up to me and I teach everyone that wants to learn."
good,I did this job as an internship during my senior year of college.  It was a fast paced environment and was some good work experience.  It was a good entry opportunity into the transportation field.
good,"The office was really nicely set up where all people were centralized in one big room. This made the job more enjoyable as we were able to talk to each other over coffee or other snacks.  I started each day with setting appointments and tracking loads using our computer system. After this initial period of the day had passed, my job duties were to handle in bound calls, build loads, give rates and set more appointments. In performing the above mentioned tasks, I was able to speak with customers and carriers to better understand their needs so a more cost effective solution could be discussed. Developed so many long lasting relationships. Many still continue to this day!"
good,Great place to start a career. You will learn the ins and outs of working for a large corporate business structure. Best advice is to get years of experience to build up your resume but leave once you feel you have a strong enough resume to find another job. Job advancement opportunity is decreasing as the company is focusing on restructuring to protect their interests against competition moving in the industry. If you are willing to put in the hours and work hard you will do well for years. If you are looking for a job just to get insurance and other benefits this is not the place to pursue a job. You get compensated on your work performance. Very competitive working atmoshere and you must be able to handle stress at a very high level.
good,"I found this to be a difficult place to advance not necessarily because of the aspect of the work, but because of the structuring of the company.  The hours were fairly standard, but there is no flexibility in terms of work/life balance - all hours and days are in the office, 7:00/8:00am to 5:00pm with virtually no exceptions."
good,"I worked for CHR for 3 years and in 3 different roles. Each day was high-stress, high-volume, and it was difficult for me to relax once I got home. I did like the demand that the job placed on me initially, but once management was not able to meet salary requests it was time to move on."
good,"CH Robinson is an excellent company. Unfortunately, some of the best benefits of working for them depends on which office you land a position with...."
good,"CHR is a decent position to start with. It is full of young people, but does not have a lot of room for upward mobility. Each office is very decentralized and it is hard to move up within your own office."
good,"Good people to work with, middle management lacks experience as there have been many corporate changes recently, decent training program, good hours, relatively low stress, generally younger motivated company culture."
good,"A place that promotes a team atmosphere, but it is a free-for-all.  Having the ability to control your own portfolio and business is nice.  The ability to climb the ranks through effort makes it appealing, but internal relationships have more pull in production that hard work sometimes."
good,"Workload and pleasant co-workers make the days go by quickly. I've learned more about the process when it comes to logistics and the process behind consumers receiving the products they use on a daily basis. Management is very open and helpful when it comes to questions I have about the work and process behind what we do. My biggest issue, which unfortunately is the most important part of the job, is the fact that I was hired through a temp agency with a temp to hire contract that was due in October of 2016 and the company has no intention to hire anymore employees regardless of work performance."
good,"Rigid schedules, many supervisors and managers, as well as tedious work made this an unenjoyably work environment. Management was not open to new ideas. Employees were not social or interactive. This made it difficult to collaborate on projects and accomplish goals efficiently."
good,Most people there spoke only Spanish and i was much younger then the people there. The work wasnt too hard but it did effect my lower back as i had to lift 40 lb boxes frequently. Managers were alright
good,"great employees, great company. quickly learn everything about transportation. always ""on call"" responsibly for tracking customer shipments. able to build your own book of business and have immediate impact on company success."
good,"good place to work, good people and coworkers, they treat the staff well for a young person that loves to drink, I had a great time, but advancement is nonexistent"
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the new things I was able to learn. Worked with a proprietary compensation system as well as Peoplesoft.
good,Much talent on board but are they all placed correctly?  Efficiency is not a strong point but nevertheless a successful company.  Training is a weak point and you are sometimes left to figure out processes on your own.  This does not lead to best organization.
good,"Started as a college internship. There was a minimal to non existent training program. They school you on what the company does and gets you signed in with a 5 minute explanation of the job."
good,"I learned a lot about the freight shipping industry. However, it was difficult finding solutions to ongoing IT problems. Management was spread thin. I was often put at the end of the priority line when issues arose, in favor of senior reps. Additional duties included collections, clerical and solutions. Spent 10 hours a day looking at 2 video monitors and working the phones. Very little development and opportunity to advance."
good,"typical work day goes by quickly due to high volume call flow"
good,"Overall, this is a great company to work for if you studied supply chain management and desire  a management position. However, If supply chain/transportation is something that you interested in, then the every day transportation tasks ( track/trace; carrier score cards; financial reporting etc)  can become monotonous. "
good,"It was not my personal favorite type of work in a call center. It was way too restricted and did not like getting a ""report"" card every single week. I get that they are trying to get better quality, but maybe inspect and sit down with the employee once a month. That seems better."
good,CH Robinson is a great place to learn and grow from if you are just getting into the industry.  Not a place to be long term unless you move up within the company.
good,"Pleasant environment. Everyone works well together. Although there is quite a bit of work that's involved, team work within all the departments, was always a great factor."
good,Nice group of people. Would love to have gone back once re-hiring began.
good,"Call center environment.  Received incoming calls from drivers.  We gave pick up information, load information and input information from incoming calls on loads delivered."
good,Organization and Prioritizing is key.  Self Motivation will go a long way.
good,"No job stability, i didnt like the job because it wasnt any job security"
good,"fortune 500 company top of the chart for 3rd party logistics. Great business to work for. One of the best working environment to work for. Fun, exciting, layback, good pay"
good,"Not the most interesting work in the world, but a solid company to work for."
good,"Constant change, fast paced, and customer focused."
good,"Can be motivating- but to many office politics-"
good,"Challenging work environment"
good,A great company if you are interested in logistics.  A leader in supply chain.
good,I give myself 5 stars. I work hard and fast. The office is fast paced. I learned people skills for big companies to truck drivers. Management was fair. co-workers were professoial. The hardest part of the job was learning how to tune others conversations out in close seating setting. The best about the job was interacting with customers all day
good,"As an Operations Representative, I work with our major customers' inbound freight programs. Working directly with vendors and suppliers, I look for efficiencies in our customers' business processes, help implement and execute those efficiencies, and work directly with the account management team to monitor said efficiencies. As an office administrator, I help with new customer development and implementation by means of pre-loading customer information, setting new users up through the CHR based web tool, and conducting web demonstrations."
good,My job was to find carriers to cpmplete shipments going from one destination to another.  This was done through phone calls of companies and contacting individual drivers as well.  IT was a challenge to find routes coming back from the destination so it was worth while for the driver to make the complete the shipment.
good,"I truly liked the long term goals that CH Robinson had in place for the company, the building however was unethical."
good,"10hr sales day, inside, which is never fun.  it was usually either a great day or a horrible day.  not much in between.   great culture in the office though and very casual."
good,The best part of my job is talking to truck drivers all day. I am a people person. Giving them great customer service is what I strive at. I am sure it's rough being on the road all day and no one to talk too. I look at it as they are picking up and delivering our products. I can break or make their day just by being attentive and kind. Management is quick on answering questions. My co-workers are great. I work in a team. We all get along and work well together. Talking to them between calls is one of the best parts of the job. There is nothing hard about my job. When I'm given a task I make the best of it and get it done. 
good,"I start my day out by going through emails and addressing what needs to be taken care of first. I send out emails, make and take phone calls to set appointments for the freight. I enjoy the peolpe I work with, they are easy to get a long with. The management is very friendly and always up for a group outing to bring us closer together. The most enjoyable part of my job is the relations I have built with my customers. "
good,"Days were very busy with two lines and two monitors being utilized at all times. Organization was paramount. The toughest part of the job was learning the freight market. The most enjoyable part would be the relaxed environment with some very good people that were friends both in and out of work. Management was constantly changing protocol and positions which made it difficult to really sink your teeth into anything for an extended period of time. The constant internal changes were confusing and to most co-workers, unnecessary."
good,great job i wish i was still employed but they had to move on. the issue was advancement . there was was little room for improvement.
good,A typical day at work for me consists of the following tasks:
good,-Inside sales/account management
good,Overall it was a fun experience with working with truckers. That was the majority of the fun was contacting the workers for documentation that was needed in order to pay them.
good,"Great company, great benefits, perks, competitive workforce and excellent training."
good,"Working at C.H. Robinson was a temporary position but during that time the employees were nice.  "
good,employees are fairly compensated but turnover remains high with some of the work being demanding yet mundane. Career advancement for college grads is encouraged. The company is very much focused on profit and pays no attention to sustainability.
good,The company has a fast work pace and they allow you to do your work as you please without micro-managing as long as you are being productive and it shows in your numbers.
good,There are several things going on with the transition from FreightQuote to CH Robinson software so it is quite a bit of policy and process change. I enjoy the people that work there though with management not knowing what the future brings makes it hard to know if there will be advancement opportunities or not.
good,"The company itself is amazing, what I personally didn't like was the negative environment the employees have made. The managers are great and understanding."
good,"at the time of employment at CH ROBINSON management was not on one accord. My work performance was excellent ,bad  management communication was the issue that interfered with the understanding the rules and regulations."
good,"Don't necessarily get paid or get the advancement for hard work. Good benefits and mostly good management. I got sick while i was employed there and got pregnant and they were unsympathetic to my situation. My work ethic was great, i trained multiple employees while there and got several raises and bonuses. I feel like i was given a raw deal. Wouldn't recommend to others unless seriously in need of a job!"
good,"I liked that it was a small office and relaxed. What I didn't like is that I was not getting the training I needed to do my job outside of online modules. My manger/trainer went out of down and that is when the Office Manger found out how much I did not know. I asked as many questions as I could, but you are kind of thrown in the mix of things quickly. Instead of giving me the tools and time to do my job we decided to part ways."
good,"- sterke samenwerking met management"
good,"If you love to work for a company that your day is ever changing, and you are constantly problem solving then this is the job for you.  Its quick paced, and as you bounce from situation to situation its critical to constantly be alert and finding solutions for customers and or carriers.   I loved this job.  The specific people I worked with just became unbearable."
good,Faced paced working/learning environment with limited support staffing for overnight shift.  High turn overrate for proper training for new departmental role
good,CH Robinson was great as a first job into my professional career outside of college. The entry level position comes with extensive training in proprietary technology and sales skills. The day to day workload is extensively sales activities and operations.
good,"Awesome work environment, not an easy system to advance in though. All work is done through a computer system that (on the capacity side) favors the people who've been their longer. Definitely a job you'll need to pay your dues at and build plenty of relationships both internally and externally before you start to see any career advancement."
good,"CH Robinson is a great place to start your career."
good,"Grind of a job, can be a valuable career for the right person. Logistics is a tough field to find true job satisfaction. Great opportunity for entry level sales experience."
good,"Would not recommend to a friend. "
good,"Started off at a mid-level position, worked my way up to a management role. Overall, the environment was amazing, the employees were great. would've stayed but better opportunities came my way."
good,Great work environment with supportive management to reach all goals - individual and shared. Company wide resources to execute what you envision for your accounts.
good,Very little advancement. Long hours. Good earning potential but senior reps have a dominant market share. You will get burned out. Avg person last about 3 years.
good,Good out of college as you will learn a lot of business skills needed out there.  As you grow you will get more responsibility but unfortunately not much better pay.  Stressful environment even though co-workers and office environment sometimes help try to make it better.
good,"A typical day involves interacting with freight carriers to gather information for tracking. "
good,Overall it's a good company to work for if you want to get your foot in the door for basically anything in the logistics industry.
good,CH Robinson provides their employees with the benefits of being a stable company that provides flexibility and opportunities for growth both personally and professionally.
good,"Perfect job for anyone looking for experience in the Transportation industry, especially Truck load.   Very few stay in their positions though.  Turn and Burn atmosphere."
good,"Very busy and productive days."
good,Great company if you want lots of Logistics experience right off the bat.  Pretty much a baptism by fire your first day on the job but you'll earn your chops fast.
good,"CHR is going corporate and it's become more like ""working for the man"" which isn't what I signed on for!  When I first started, it felt more like a team.  I also used to think I could get promoted with hard work and in due time - I don't feel that way anymore... It's really starting to feel like they are just going to work me like a dog until I quit - which is rather hardening since I used to love my job!"
good,"This is a very fast paced job that can be very stressful and challenging.  It is a great office environment for a corporate company and carries a work hard, play hard mentality.  You will learn many different skills along the way here such as account management, sales, negotiation and supply-chain management."
good,Our office culture is extremely fast paced and goal oriented
good,"Work can become very stagnate at times and if you a very driven person, it can get very discouraging."
good,"As an intern, a typical day at work consisted of: calling drivers to book truckloads in a database, dispatching the drivers, and negotiating truckload rates, details, etc. I gained negotiating skills and a great deal of knowledge about the third party logistics industry. "
good,Fast paced environment. They care about the bottom line money.
good,Great starter job- good for entry level college grads looking for sales experience. Not much room for job advancement however.
good,"Know that transportation never stops. You are constantly dealing with your current customers and expected to keep new business flowing. In the transportation world, there are always problems to find solutions to. Balance is key."
good,"Duties include but not limited to data entry, entering load numbers in the system, processing paperwork, indexing  daily quota's numbers ,met every da"
good,"This is good place to have your first job out fo college; however, compensation leaves some to be desired considering how much influence you have over customer supply chains."
good,C.H. Robinson is a good company to start your career at. It gave me good business world experience and taught me skills that I will take with me to other jobs.
good,"Fast Pace Ongoing call center. "
good,"This place is your typical logistics company. Not much to complain about other than the pay. Most people start out at the call center, then get promoted to an account coordinator or rep and eventually to a salesperson depending on if you CHOOSE to move up. What I didn't like is from call center, to account representative, to logistics manager, I sure got moved up quick within 2 years, but my pay didn't change at all. When I asked for a raise, they offered me to move to sales and work off of the commission I would make and where it is much more strict. (Many people moved up to sales and for fired within a month due to not reaching a quota. They also could not move back to their previous position since it was most likely taken and had to either start at call center or get another job.) Extremely stressful job with huge ultimatums that I could not keep up with, but this is logistics."
good,Has potential to be a great company but needs better management and better pay and raises through out the year. Has great co-workers and relaxed energy.
good,"CH Robinson, is a good place to work the schedule is as great as it comes weekends off, also most holidays off, the pace of work is fast your days are going by fast. The only thing is the pay. for the amount of work you do the pay should be more."
good,"The environment gets very stressful at sometimes, sometimes it’s slow. Management expects the new employees to catch on fast which is very stressful and discouraging."
good,C.H.Robinson is a good company with pretty decent work hours. The company provides benefits for their employees and on-the-job training for most positions
good,Overall a great place to start your career. Not a long term fit if you are not truly hungry to grind in the transportation industry. One can garner great skills from the firm.
good,The place is okay. Its not the worst place either. The environment is so laid back and chill people get complacent. The pay could be much better but overall its okay
good,"I've been working at TMC for 2 years now and it's not the worst job, but it doesn't motivate me to get up in the morning. The job is very intensive and 8 hours are not enough to get a lot of the work completed. I really enjoy a lot of the people that work here, but there have been so many changes implemented that have unfortunately made the job start becoming un-enjoyable."
good,"Workday is pretty stressful, but can be fulfilling."
good,"-A very fast paced environment. No two days  were the same "
good,Interested in logistics but not sure where to start? C.H. Robinson has many opportunities for the recent grad as well as seasoned professionals.  Must be able to multi-task in a high pressure environment.  Teamwork is huge here...no islanders.
good,"Typical day goes by extremely fast. The job is very cut-throat and competitive. Management gives guidance and pays somewhat fairly, but employees are definitely overworked at times."
good,"Fun atmosphere with great coworkers, but the pay is terrible. Made more at Walmart. Great pto/health care. Should spend more money on payroll and will benefit greatly"
good,"Great place to intern and learn 3PL at it's best. "
good,"Work hard.  Play hard.  No micromanaging.  They provide you with tools to grow your business as much as you want.  "
good,"Demanding work with a non-restrictive, make of it what you want to get out of it culture. Great people make the hard work worth it. There are opportunities if a person fits the mold and focuses to excel here."
good,"Gran volumen de trabajo pero muy dinámico, el ambiente y la relación con los colegas ha sido lo mejor."
good,"- Sending and receiving 100 to 150 emails"
good,"Good fast paced environment.  Great place to get your feet wet if you're interested entering a career in sales and/or logistics.  The people there are great to work with, relaxed work environment and dress code.  Good starting pay and benefits.  Very competitive marketplace right now selling logistics services, basically being commoditized by shippers wanting the lowest cost option. Take calls at all hours of the night to resolve customer issues.  Constant pressure to meet call/sales quotas."
good,"有机会接触到国际客户， 跟公司个部门合作管理项目。"
good,"C. H. Robinson is a great career launching point as most positions are entry-level. It's a fun atmosphere with no dress code. However, there are little opportunities for advancement and raises and bonus are almost non-existent. "
good,Fast-paced work environment that stresses communication skills and computer/phone quickness. Culture is young (most aged 24-40) and casual in the office. Flexible locations but not so much flex on hours.
good,"Working at CH Robinson is fast paced, exciting, good vision for future company and plenty of opportunities to advance. On the down-side, departments are constantly merging or changing which changes your work hours, days and duties. Therefore, your adaptability skills are crucial. Overall loved working at CH Robinson."
good,Good place to start career but with little advancement opportunities it's hard to stay for the long haul. They definitely over promise the growth opportunities available. Instead of promoting from within as they claim they love to do.. they started hiring external people for hire roles.
good,"nice to work at miss it, fast environment, nice place cold have a great boss and co workers miss all of them and the benefits excellent works over time all the time"
good,The structure is built that new employees can thrive but the opportunity for advancement is minimal. I don't feel pressure to work more than 40 hours if I don't want to. My manager is great but upper management won't pay team members what's needed to retain them.
good,In the morning I would call all my customers to see how their morning of sales was going and to see if they needed anything for the week.  At Robinson Fresh I learned how to use my time more wisely and how to sell better. What I liked most about this job was the relationships I made and I was very busy every day.  The hardest part of the job was that I have no control over the weather and the delivery trucks which made the job very stressful.
good,"The culture is very unique and fun, it has plenty of room to grow but you must be willing to learn on your own. It did not feel like they were ready or willing to put together a training program which made it difficult for individuals new to the industry."
good,"No room for growth. Shoot for management positions from day 1. Compensation is mediocre at best. Hours are crippling. "
good,"Hallmark was a great learning experience for a Teenager. A typical day would consist of stocking the cards and working on inventory. I was able to learn about inventory and balancing a register, as well as social skills in working in Customer Service."
good,"there was nothing typical about any given day."
good,"Great Co workers always willing to help. Lots of different roles and positions to switch into. Always busy which makes for a fast day. Family oriented, professional yet fun place to work."
good,Every day is a challenge working at CH Robinson as your always trying to come up with new ideas to generate sales an sell our service. Some days are fun and others are stressful with very long hours.
good,Didn’t enjoy this job as much as I wanted to because of personal reasons but it was a good company and learning experience. Would definitely go back if I could!
good,Easy job that consisted of speaking with drivers in the trucking industry.  Job was sometimes frustrating because we didn't really help drivers with situations just notated the problem and rep would call back.
good,"Good positions if someone is going to school. The management was very poor. When you asked about promotion, they always maid up some reason for you not to move up."
good,"I have a lot of issues with CHR. Benefits are good, but that's about it. Lots of turnover. Management needs some improving. My department grew too fast so I feel more like a number than a member of the team."
good,"Everyone at the company treated me well but it was simply not a good fit for me. Third party logistics is a fast-paced, stressful industry and you’ll do more fire fighting and operational work than selling in the sales executive role."
good,"lo unico malo de la empresa es que no te valoran y por tal motivo hay mucha rotacion de personal, pero todo lo demas esta muy bien."
good,"Great place to work, but as it is a 3PL, the only assets it has are it's people, and with market fluctuations, it's impossible for them to do everything they can for all employees.  The greatest hurdle they have is negotiations between branches are lacking, limiting carrier access to freight.  Also, communication between corporate and branch/office level could be better.  Certain branches get more say in setting corporate policy, while others sometimes get left in the dark."
good,I would come in and get a basic over view of the goal of the day via email. Then I would begin processing orders for the day. I would inform leads of what we had to do for the day. Then the pickers and leads would execute.
good,"Start in a procurement type role, very sales like. Lots of phone time and warm-calling."
good,"It would be a better place to work without them being sued and having to close down.  The place that bought them, NFI, has very little experience in running a warehouse; CH Robinson has a good system and is a decent place to work"
good,"This is a great place to work for, great culture and life balance."
good,"A good entry level experience into the world of logistics.  Overall, this wasn't a bad job for someone who had no logistics experience.  Managers were very good and helpful if needed."
good,Money making machine of a company with sales reps pounding the phones all day in order to bring business in while the other half pounds the phones to move the business that had been brought in from the other sales reps. Commission based per load moved.
good,"CHR was a great experience for a graduate fresh out of college. CHR gives you the opportunity to reach into your skill set and bring out a more productive person. I learned how to communicate and problem-solve in ways that I never had to before. "
good,Diverse work space with supportive colleagues. Ability to constantly evolve and further develop my insight of continually evolving supply chain solutions.
good,"fast paced work environment that demands multitasking skills while paying attention to details. working at ch Robinson i sharped my skills in data analyzes, multitasking, maintaining accurate information and working with team members."
good,When I was employed at CH Robinson I was working there as a truck dispatcher not a driver. CH Robinson has a laid back environment everyone worked together made team decision to get truckers out on deliveries.
good,this is a laid back company can be fast paced and busy alot of the times depending on your department with the company. it is a great company to be apart of but some of there departments need some work.
good,"Overall, the executive leadership of CH Robinson is great.   Pay is fair.   The hidden benefits for hard workers such as stock options are fantastic!    Definitely a company where hard work can be rewarded.   Personally, I fell victim to a poor General Manager.  He went thru a few changes in his personal life and took them out on his direct reports.   After he changed, the mentality and culture of our office changed.  We began to miss targets and bonus numbers.   Instead of leadership, we experienced personal blame (read . . . You have a kid now, you can't perform at the same level. . . .).    If you have a good manager, this is a great place to work.   However, be careful to explore if you work well with your potential manager during the interview process."
good,"This really is a great company with many great people. You must produce and perform to succeed. If you do, it’s quite rewarding. Management in Indianapolis location is horrible. The GM specifically (EB). Corporate knows and chooses to do nothing. They promote what they tolerate. "
good,Working for C.H. Robinson has been a mixed bag. The industry provides a high stress environment and the company does a poor job of insulating its employees from that. They do provide industry standard benefits and great name recognition in the industry.  There is limited room for growth internally as they are moving to leaner management opportunities . The company like so many others is becoming more flat as organization and pushing automation to fill the gaps.
good,received and filledcustomers orders worked on fast moving lines the management was good and worked with employees employees received a lot of free produce
good,"Very fast-paced environment, two computer screens, two phones that ring off the hook all day. Not sure how it is at the corporate level, but the branch level (bay area) is severely lacking in management. Women there work extremely hard and are extremely undervalued; while the men do as they please and work very little. Other than that, it is a fun job and a fun group."
good,"Start work at 8am - check on all deliveries for the day and make sure all deliveries the night before are accounted for. If there are any rejections, make sure the report is sent to the necessary party. Check on all trucks in transit and make sure they are in good position for on-time delivery. "
good,Great place to start a career. You learn a great deal and how to be successful.   Muat be willing to move locations to grow vertically in the confirmed company.
good,Great place to learn the logistics culture.  This company has a committed work life balance and the atmosphere is cool and laid back while still remaining professioanl.
good,"Great company but CHR Torrance has some bad leadership on the Global Forwarding side. "
good,"Arrive to work check up on current shipments make sure they are tracking to be on on time for pick up or delivery."
good,A typical day is fast paced . Quite environment to work in  Enjoyed watching the playoffs during work hours on a big screen. It had a great workplace culture
good,"Great job out of college. Opportunity to make a lot of money if you get luck and put the work in it. Burns you out down the road thou, especially if you have kids."
good,Its a great place if you want to get paid to sit down all day.When the phones are not ringing we are mostly watching movies on out phones and playing games.
good,"CHR is a good place to work entry level but seems to lack in pay and compensation, the work is tough and challenging and success isnt compensated fairly so people tend to focus more on themselves and getting their commission than focusing on driving the business"
good,"Good Place to work. Good people and benefits. Sometimes stressful, but overall would recommend to those who are looking for a job. Fast pace and builds on communication skills."
good,"Good work environment"
good,"It was a pretty simple and enjoyable job! The pay was good and good hours, no weekend shifts unless it was for overtime."
good,CH Robinson is a great place to work if you are looking for something easy and stress free.
good,"CHR offers the chance for learning the position you are placed in from the ground up, or for expanding one's already good skills."
good,Loved it! Friendly office culture with opportunities to advance if logistics/freight is the industry in which you want to continue. Beautiful new building too. I definitely feel proud of my work environment
good,"Good Company to work for, good job security.  Do not recognize hard work for raise potential.  I would recommend the job for someone starting out into the field."
good,"Working for CH Robinson was a good experience. The people there are very nice, with the exception of management. Management in different departments are questionable."
good,Company is very exciting to work at. Definitely a work hard play hard company with Friday challenges between departments. Unfortunately the position I worked did not offer a lot in growth.
good,"Great place to work, I enjoy working here as a developer. There is always new tech to learn and the day to day rarely becomes mundane. Great atmosphere as well."
good,C.H. Robinson is a third party logistics company. I learned a lot about logistics and the load to truck market during my time there. I was also able to further develop my negotiation and sales skills while employed there.
good,"Can be quite lucrative, you work you get rewarded, casual atmosphere, high energy, high stress. You have some of the expectations of a sales role, but none of the rewards."
good,Supportive management where everyone is encouraged to contribute. Employees are a tight knit group who also support each other in work and life. Daily life is fast paced in air and attention to detail is a must.
good,Management never allowed advancement due to no higher education. Despite having over a decade of experience in the industry and a big contact list of carriers.
good,"This job is extremely technical with many moving parts.  You must know aspects customs;"
good,"Offered good work culture"
good,"this job is not for everyone. it is very demanding with high stress. "
good,"Had many incentives for top employees"
good,"It was a good place overall to work. Good benefits. Casual atmosphere. I did not intend to retire until next year, but they closed my department with no reason given..."
good,Fast-paced performance environment utilizing talent and technology.  Sales and finance ability is a benefit to every growth role.  Good company with potential.
good,"A busy environment, with rewarding benefits. The goal model is team based and that helps get everyone on the same page to achieve results. It is also a fun work environment."
good,"It's a pretty solid job right out of college and has a much higher earning potential than most first jobs.  Even beyond the first couple yrs, the earning potential is there, the problem is the industry has changed and the role isn't quite as lucrative as it used to be. This is not to say one cannot be compensated handsomely, but it will require a good amount of hustle. "
good,"-fun and smaller work environment"
good,CH Robinson is a great place to work but everyone can be very stressed and no one likes to admit when they are wrong. The job has been great but it is not what I want to do for the rest of my life.
good,This is a productive environment that I really enjoyed working in. They are asking me too add more info and I don't have anything else too say. It was an ok place to work
good,"A typical day would be searching for new companies to help move freight by matching their freight with trucking companies who needed to keep their trucks moving. I learned about the industry and what it took to make these things happen to get things where they needed to be. "
good,Entered through a six and a half month training program to learn all aspects of the business. Worked directly with an experienced account manager and assisted in managing existing portfolios.
good,A company full of great people make work a breeze.  Often unclear on expectations on what was being asked.  Lax dress code and a family type setting make this a desirable place to be employed.
good,"Research companies to contact, Contact companies ask them about their supply chain so we can add value, try and get a meeting or have a meeting over the phone."
good,"Mucha presión, pero grandes compensaciones económicas. No existe la mejor cultura del trabajo, pero individualmente los recursos son muy capacitados y valisos"
good,"•	In charge of  building and maintaining relationships with carriers"
good,I was a trainee at the firm. I reported at around 10am and returned by 5pm. I learnt alot from the employees there and found that they were extremely helpful and experienced in their field.
good,I learn a great deal concerning task management but the office culture is a lot of blaming and unfair treatment on advancement. Advancement wasn't based off skill but favoritism.
good,"CH Robinson is a great company with integrity, and a powerhouse in the logistics industry. Has all the tools and resources available to be successful and ship anything anywhere."
good,"I've been at the company for ten years and I have gained tremendous experience, knowledge, and friendships. I've met wonderful people and some jerks, but overall I am pleased with my career here. There are ways they can grow and improve and the number 1 area is management training and development. If they truly want to see growth in various modes of transportation, they need to develop their managers. They need to invest more in technology and employee retention. "
good,"Typical day at work could consist of making quotations, going through terms and conditions (office) or travel, i.e. conduct route surveys or do load witnessing. Work alone with only limited contact with management through activity reports. Hardest part of job is stress as you are responsible for shipping very valuable oversized or overweight equipment. Most enjoyable is that you meet new people and new work Sites all the time. I worked from home in the last 2 years of the job from my home in Nanaimo BC after moving from Calgary."
good,"Great company to gain first hand experience in transportation. Great compensation, however long hours and grunt work could prove to be taxing if you have a family."
good,"Great job in the industry, good benefits, good compensation. Large network and outstanding 3PL services. Large network of carriers and offices across the US with global presents"
good,Management  problems interfering with the company's culture  on a local level which was in my experience to charismatically make the seemingly impossible happen every moment and feeling hyped by your challenging day to pursue exciting lifestyles outside of work but under the wrong management the system fails and moving freight becomes a hostile nightmare of negativity.
good,The people and overall environment is great but it takes forever to move up. It is fast paced and pushes you to constantly learn new things especially since it is almost impossible to train for this job prior to hiring.
good,"I started in the dispatch department. Giving the drivers pick up and drop information of freight. Eventually I was promoted to accounts receivable. "
good,"The company is the best in the industry, and the largest in the industry.  That being said, it has the downfalls that fit that bill."
good,I was handed new projects and reports to do/help out with often.
good,Low pay is somewhat offset by the excellent benefits.  Fun place to work.
good,"CH Robinson's goal is to enhance clients supply chain and logistics performance through strategic planning, process re-engineering, and/or information technology implementation. Develop and manage a wide range of projects which include but are not limited to outsource transportation, strategic sourcing, and logistics network design."
good,"One comes in, checks on trucks pending deliveries, advise customers of any delays. Checks on daily shipments, and make delivery appointments, while getting customers quotes and working on bids, and attending to current issues."
good,"Make a minimum of 50-75 outbound phone calls per day to trucking companies. Build and maintain carrier relationships to move CHR freight. Building trust amongst peers in branch and around the network. Everyday was something new either fun, challenging or exciting. Making and exceeding goals for every month and year was the best challenge that I was able to crush!"
good,"Good people, very hard work environment. Work here a couple years than move on unless you're based in MN. There are no advancement opportunites in the random branches."
good,"Typically would make 200+ cold calls to trucking companies and truck drivers and sell them the shipment to confirm to have our clients products shipped all over the world.  Also, worked with earning new client business through cold calling."
good,"Nice atmosphere, If you speak Spanish well this is the place for you. Often times after 5pm you will encounter calls about a T-CHECKS, drivers calling for pay so that they can complete the load to its final destination. Sometimes it could be compared to pulling teeth getting drivers information. Other than that the workday does go by pretty fast"
good,"Working primarily on the operations side of the business I handled day to day logistical solutions as well as gained exposure to outside sales, prospecting customers, and face to face customer meetings. A very ""open door"" policy at work allowed for a constant stream of communication through all levels of the branch and co workers were very receptive and helpful whenever needed. The branch was one of the smaller within the company, yet deemed among the top most efficient within the company. Branch was fast growing and required workers to be able to adapt in a fast paced, multitasking environment. Constantly met and exceeded expectations as a branch and on an individual level. Performance incentives were based mainly on overall branch performance, furthermore pushing cooperation and communication among co workers."
good,"Great experience, will teach you how to work hard and learn various skillsets. Logistics is a cutthroat industry with a lot of competition internally and with external companies as well all fighting over the same freight. Overall great first job."
good,The company is becoming more automated and the job descriptions are changing somewhat unrealisticaly. Expectations overlap and it's time for a cahange.
good,very basic company with not to much room for growth and old school thinking; a place where it is more important your working schedule than the work done.
good,"You will interact with many customers, carriers, shippers, and receivers. The sheer size of the company allows you to see it all when it comes to how companies move their product. "
good,"Company provides a fun, fast paced environment with multitude of opportunity and career advancement across mutiple modal segments and job families.  Perfect for Entry Level to Mid Tier level employees looking to expand opportunities."
good,Great starter job to getting into the transportation and logistics field but not alot of room for advancement. would suggest this employer to anyone fresh out of college.
good,"CH Robinson is a great company for recently graduated college kids but, as a mid-career employee, not very focused on older employees. Corporate jobs were open if a person wanted to relocate. If not, there was not a lot of opportunity."
good,"CH Robinson recently disbanded its UX team and dispersed its members to various project teams. "
good,Great benefits and good causes. Teamwork is pushed hard and i enjoy how philanthropic they are. They work with you on your schedule if able. Friendly smiling faces
good,Typical work day involves a lot of Skype meetings and project planning with remote internal partners and customers.  It is easy to block time to complete any required tasks or job functions.  The culture is very self directed with a lot of flexibility to plan around personal needs.
good,"You must be good at multi tasking.  This job is very competitive, and it is very well respected as a whole.  For the most part on a daily basis if you are good at this job is financially and self rewarding."
good,Being a leader allowed me to set the pace of work on a daily base with my team and ultimately hitting our monthly goal. I would not micro manage but trust the work process from each and every single teammate.
good,Fairly decent job good pay good managers good hours good condition workers would recommend this job to most I would of still been working here if i didn't move
good,"Upon arrival, the first task is to track your board, following up with the whereabouts of the shipments you are following.  the remainder of the day is making sure everything is set for customs clearance, and delivery, and to finish, invoice clients for shipments that are completed."
good,"CH Robinson is an excellent place to start your career. Great training program, great team, decent starting salary. The new sales exec role rewards hustlers and you can learn a lot in a short time. Be careful not to get complacent and also push your managers for development opportunities."
good,"working here is what you make of it, it is s stressfull industry. your sucees varies on the relationships you make wiht customer reps in your own own office."
good,"Good way to get experience in the logistics industry, introduces you to a lot of things that college and education cant teach. Very fast paced and competitive"
good,This was a great place to learn about reporting and analysis. The rest of it was fine just kind of blah. Very repetitive. They talk about room for growth but it really is the same job on a different account.
good,"I enjoyed working here. It is a bit segregated by race and by level of education, and a bit fratty, but if you can get past all of that you might enjoy all that the company has to offer."
good,"I'd recommend CH for anyone who is willing to learn the industry quickly and effectively. CH gave me that jump start and propelled me into the career I have today. "
good,An excellent experience. A great company to ever work for.  A great atmosphere and a team of motivated people. Learned alot during my employment. A great atmosphere. An experience that taught many vaulable lessons.
good,"Fun place to begin a career in the supply chain organization. This position isn't for everyone though. Make sure you come preparing to work each day, for that is the only way to get noticed in this company. Those who prosper and work hard are the ones that enjoy working and building relationships."
good,"you are responsible for managing a portfolio of business including but not lmited to: cross selling multiple modes, conducting business reviews, generating leads, creating and managing SOP's for each account."
good,"Typical work week. Always something to do and a way to learn more about the company. Wide open workplace culture. The hardest part of the job is working with some of the management. Enjoyed meeting employees, vendors and companies."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships that are built and the many people I have come into contact with over the years. Those relationships has and continue to shape who I am as a worker here. It is a place that is good to work and the relationships last outside of work going to different training session. Even hanging out at different places for different occasions.
good,"I think they are a great company, they took care of there employees."
good,"Positive and dedicated work environment where all departments work well together.  Motivated workers that strive to make the day to day business run smoothly while growing the business and securing new customers and opportunities.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my customers and partnering with them to find solutions to their pain points.  There was a lot of variety in what I did, each day brought with it a new set of challenges and obstacles to overcome."
good,"While employees are well compensated in their positions, the job is unforgiving and relentless. Being continually the ""middle man"" between sellers and buyers puts the employee constantly at odds with both. In one's off hours, it is expected that problems and issues will be resolved at any time of day or night. The industry is highly competitive and stressful, with time constraints and logistical issues continually being consistently problematic."
good,"With this particular company a typical day at work would consist of me being alone at night. It was a 3rd shift job in which I worked independently. There were no hard parts involving this job, as long as instructions were followed nothing could go wrong. Management was great, always nice & supportive. What I enjoyed most about this job was the ability to work independently, a quiet environment always and being trusted with task and to work alone."
good,Sadly ABX was bought by DSV. Everything that was fun about working at ABX was destroyed by that purchase.
good,Some days you are loaded others you are not.
good,"The activities and plans that CH Robinson has for the future are indeed market leading, aggressive, and necessary to maintain their competitive edge. That being said these plans can leave some team members behind without remorse and in the name of 'necessary change'. "
good,nice friendly productive very easy laid back........some what unfair thats all needs to know about my experience working with this company .............
good,CH Robinson is a large company with numerous opportunities. They have a vision looking ahead and are not afraid of changing with the times. Being a very large corporation there can be some red tape type issues.
good,What you would expect of a fortune 200 monolithic corporation.  Opportunity to move around but lots of layers.  Values tenure over fresh perspectives sometimes.
good,Very fast paced work environment. Multitasking is a must. Constant changing of software was a problem. Once you get used to an operating system it seems like there are new updates to learn.
good,I thoroughly enjoy my time with this company. I would have preferred to advance more quickly from my current role but wasn't promoted due to office politics.
good,"Hiring so many people and sending them through training at the same time might be resulting in new employees falling through the cracks.  There needs to be more individualized training on how to handle collections once on the floor.  Current employees are trying their best to help new hires work with collections, but due to lack of individualized training about how best to handle calls to customers, they are loosing as many new employees as they are hiring."
good,Worked with brilliant people which made working life more enjoyable. Just enough work to keep us going and always finished on time which allowed for more family time. Due to centralisation the Glasgow Office was closed
good,"This is a great place to work, but not many opportunities for advancement. Salary is on the lower end of the scale, but other employee benefits can make up for it."
good,A great place to work minus the Operations Department Manager. There are several veterans there who go out of their way to help you maximize your growth in knowledge.
good,Day would go by fast as this is a very high pace place to work. Also high stressful place to work. No day is the same. Great team to work with. Good work life balance.
good,"Overall good starting point to enter Logistics industry. Outstanding technology platform & systems. Workload can be overwhelming at times, could use better emphasis on training and communications."
good,It’s very hard to advance within CHR but they provide necessary and executional training / experience to further your Logistics career. Working environment is fast paced and fun
good,"Be prepared to work 10+ hours a day. You're on the front lines so you must be available even after the regular work day is over. Company provides you with a company phone. Zero micro managing which was nice and you have a lot of freedom on how you get the job done, as long as you produce results. Not much culture where I worked, but it was a ""work hard, play hard"" environment where I thrived. Good first job out of school to learn supply chain and logistics."
good,I enjoy my time at CHR - it is a training ground for new college grads and logistics veterans alike. It is a great place to learn logistics from the ground up. The fast paced environment makes new employees adapt or fail. The compensation is below industry average for hourly positions.
good,"This company is very goal focused.  Goals are established on a daily, monthly, and yearly scheduled, and your compensation is based on if you meet your goals."
good,"CHR has a lot of upside in a very competitive industry.  They compensate their employees fairly, but the opportunities to advance within your location can be limited."
good,"Nice place to go relax on your breaks. It had a TV and nice comfy couches. People would go in there to take naps, talk on the phone, or even if you just wanted somewhere quiet to be."
good,Overall I loved working for CH Robinson. It was a great work environment with great people. The hours were long some days but the benefits made up for the hours.
good,good place to start a career when you first get out of school.  lots of travel and good times     lots of locations to pick from to work .  great benefits
good,"I had fun during my time at Robinson, and learned a lot.  I still talk to many of my old co-workers.  In my role, there was little room for advancement, so I had to leave the company to continue growing in my career."
good,"The company as whole was not a bad place to work for, but they for sure acted like every single person was replaceable so the importance of each role was never stressed to each individual."
good,"Fun environment, decent benefits, Okay work-life balace. Little room for advancement, great culture. Very good career starter. Great management. It could have been better if hours were flexible"
good,This is a place were you can take advantage to learn a lot.  It could be fun place as there are many activities for holidays or national days etc.. Like any other work place it could be overwhelming but management is there to help make any difficult situation better.
good,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with, and the company offers great benefits including generous time off. I was able to advance every couple years and develop a career."
good,"Depending on your role, there is a lot of flexibility in your day to day. Little to no mircromanaging. Corporate resources are there to support you as needed."
good,Assisted customer with there checking and savings account information. I also provided solutions and products to the customer to assist them in there banking needs.
good,"Great place to begin a sales career out of college.  Fast-paced environment with the need to be able to multitask.  You must be willing to work ten hour days with little breaks and pound the phones to make as many calls as possible.  Choose where you get placed wisely and specifically ask experienced reps which managers are decent to work under.  You will learn a lot about all aspects of the sales industry and customer service, and you will walk away with a world of knowledge about the logistics industry."
good,"Overall good place to gain experience in Supply Chain Management and Logistics. Fast paced, extreme attention to detail required."
good,"The work itself can be stressful, but the environment is laid back. Great support network to answer any questions and assist with problems. "
good,"A great company to start your carrier with. A fun young cultured work environment, but fast paced and results driven."
good,enjoyed working there the people were ok. Able to learn new things
good,8 hours of talking to drivers taking load info and updating the system. I learned that I was able to multi task between calls and updates. good coworkers. management was to many chiefs with no real set chain of command. I worked early mornings but my direct supervisor was on the night shift. hardest part of job was the communication with management. helping drivers get home or loads and helping co workers with mad drivers
good,The beginning is great but the company only sees you as a means for profit and you are completely replaceable.
good,"Distribution patterns, tracking, and tracing"
good,I just remember C.H Robinson being good at providing transportation resources to their clients. The work environment was laid back for the most part and the people were pretty cool as well.
good,The work environment is good to learn the ins and outs of the logistics industries.
good,"I enjoyed my time at C.H. Robinson. The company culture was fast-paced and innovative, and the people around me were very enjoyable to work with. Would recommend."
good,Great work life balance and you feel you have a sense of purpose while at work. You are not micromanaged and someone is always available to help if you need it.
good,At the management treated you like family but made sure work was finished before the day. Work/life balance was enjoyable and for most of the time everyone got along with each other.
good,"A typical day involves managing emails with clients and addressing an assortment of issues that can arise in logistics. Problem-solving is a requirement in my industry, and thinking critically through problems is a necessity."
good,"Great People,  Large fast paced office.   Management lets you do your job and does not micro manage.   Carrier Sales is a stressful position but rewarding if you are good at it."
good,This was a fun job. You need to be highly motivated and good with phone sales and cold calls. Once you get a good book of business it becomes a lot easier.
good,"I love working at C.H.R. The benefits are awesome. The only downfall is there is not much flexibility for parents with children. Your schedule is fixed. You have a certain amount of PTO, but no leeway if you run out of pto and something comes up like a child gets sick, or you're unable to find childcare one day, etc. The pay is alright, but don't expect any big raises. While raises are based on performance in my position, they're also fixed so you can only get a raise up to a certain amount, which you work hard all year for. Other than that, the environment is great. The people are mostly professional. Work attire could be held to a higher standard. If there was more flexibility for parents with children, I probably wouldn't be looking for other jobs."
good,"A typical day at C.H. Robinson -"
good,This Fortune 500 company prides itself on the culture it creates by hiring high energy employees who are passionate about their cause. The company does a great job teaching new employees all the ins and outs of the transportation industry so they can feel confident talking to clients and prospects.
good,"I learned a lot from my time there. Very grateful for the friends I made, and the experiences. I wish I could have stayed with the company but was not able to transfer."
good,you will need to ask questions in order to do your job. a lot of what you do is learned on the job. they have good resources for you to improve your daily output
good,A good place to work; I was in Internation transportation sales and worked with a great strategic account manager. However my branch GM was very stand offish and gave very little direction and training.
good,I enjoyed working at C.H.Robinson. My day started with going over what I have on my load board. it is very organized. I have a team to back me up . People are very friendly over there. It is very motivating to work with my colleague. My branch is very focused on continuous education.
good,"Moved from IL to FL so this will be for both. "
good,"Overall, the day-to-day responsibilities and tasks were exactly as described. I feel that I was unfortunately working for a branch/manager that did not allow for as much growth within the company as other branches/managers allow elsewhere. Great work-life balance. 8-5 with an hour lunch M-F and I was encouraged to leave once I hit 40 hours/week."
good,"The branch network of Robinson is different than corporate culture. Many branches experience a very different work culture than we experienced in my Branch, I would highly recommend the firm as a whole."
good,"CH Robinson was my home company for a few years and I was shown a completely different way to go about my typical work day. We made time for breaks so as not to become too overwhelmed by our workload and we also did team meetings off-site so as to remind ourselves that we still need to be human and have some fun. No company is perfect, but CH Robinson was a very nice home for the duration of my employment."
good,Great place to work. Great culture. Laid back but demanding work load. Enjoyed the employees and management. Learned many things about Logistics and databases.
good,"CHR is a stable, industry leading company.   The pay is below average but the benefits are excellent.  Tenure-ship at my branch was deep, making hard to advance."
good,"Although they preach work life balance, they are very unlikely to actually adhere to it. Great benefits, but success varies based on location and area of focus."
good,Sometimes overwhelming dealing with 2 systems. Management can be frustrating and unsympathetic to health issues. Team oriented workplace. hardest part was work load. Most enjoyable was team pulled together and was very helpful when need be.
good,"Great starting point out of college.  The benefits were great, but the pay was not there.  Tried to move up, but nowhere for me to go, so I left.  The hours are  from 8-5 with minimal overtime needed."
good,As an Ops Rep you'll be working nonstop. If you're lucky you'll be put on a smaller account and have the opportunity to move up. If you're unlucky you'll be stuck taking calls and building orders all day for less than you'll make in most other call centers in the area. Still interesting to gain some general logistics knowledge.
good,Since the CFO retired it was very stressful to work there.  Then the accounting department that I was in charge of went from 5 people to just me.  The accounting department closed and was moved to the USA.
good,"Fun place to work, the environment is great! One thing that makes it difficult is management is not always on your side. The long hours of the job can make it tough.  All and all, great place to work"
good,"CH Robinson is consistently on a number of ""Top American Companies"" to work for.  I have been employed at CH Robinson for almost 13 years and overall I have been very happy working there.  CH Robinson treats its employees very well in general and rewards hard work with advancement and recognition."
good,This job wasn't bad. Jut didn't pay well. I only worked here for a short time. But if your good at data entry this is the job for you. The only thing I didn't like was you can get in trouble for the mistakes you make.
good,"A typical day at work was like working in a freezer with flowers. I learned alot about the floral business, The ins ad outs of import and export, The flower temps and the different kinds of flowers."
good,Title says it all. The work life balance here is great. Benefits are pretty good as well. The green is not very good though. If making a high salary is not important to you then this place is awesome.
good,"A good company to work for, with great training. They are forward thinking and always developing for the future. Local management could be better and needs to be supervised"
good,"Competitive workplace. Hours are pretty straight forward for when you come into work and leave. Show up, hit the phones, call it a day. Most of the managers push you to improve. Hardest part of the job was dealing with angry clients every day. Most enjoyable part of the job was the success, and the people in the office. Most of the employees were laid back and fun to be around."
good,"Working at C.H. Robinson can be fun, inviting and relaxed but we definitely have a lot that is on our plates to manage on a daily bases.  I began my career as an appointment scheduler which quickly lead to taking on high value loads.  Roughly 5 months later, I joined the load building team which consisted of building loads manually into the database for several different customers.  approximetly 6 months later I was promoted to an operations representative working with one customer but additionally helped on other accounts.  Currently, I work  as an Account Coordinator, I lead a team of four people on the overall operations processes for the customer with a specific large customer and handle many day to day tasks which include; tracking & tracing, situational problem solving, conflict resolution, multi-tasking, attention to detail, spreadsheet analysis and updating, and project development.  Hardest part of my job is not having enough time in the day to continue taking on more tasks to improve other aspects of the business.  The most enjoyable part of the business is customer satisfaction, our team of 9 has earned 3 major awards as a group from the customer.  The atmosphere can vary, we have sales teams that can be loud at times when we have wins, it tends to get a little rowdy at times but manageable."
good,"A typical day consists of calling and emailing current customers and prospects to grow business."
good,"Fast pace, multi-tasking skills required."
good,Daily challenge to be better than the person next to me. Many facets of the metrics for success were unbalanced but the rewards for meeting them were very self satisfying.
good,"As large as this company is, it feels like one HUGE family. The culture throughout the building is very comfortable and relaxed, People are friendly and playful, when they are not stressed with work. Depending on the account you are working on, there is much room to grow and advance within the company. You have both your really good management and some that lack leadership and team-building skills. The hardest part of the job is when there are bad weather conditions. People are typically very busy and stressed out. the most enjoyable part of the job is Friday company competitions, usually a 15 minute game among teams/ departments to let off some steam and a chance to win lunch for your entire team, as well as the company outings."
good,"Cool and young company to work for, competitive pay, good benefits, sometimes can be over worked/under staffed. Time off/perks are great, office culture is very relaxing and easy going."
good,"Good Place to start a career"
good,"Good culture and good people.  Never a shortage of work to be done.  Low base salary with additional bonus/compensation for year end individual, team, office, and company goals."
good,"Overall CH Robinson is good environment to work in with awesome people! I enjoyed working there, learning about truck drivers and being being able to help them out when in need."
good,This is process oriented organization. They take care of employees. Company policy is maintained property.Office colleagues are very supportive .But sometime get stress as need to fulfill the target.
good,"Overall a great company. Plenty of opportunities for advancement and training in your field. Had a team environment, but compensation was based directly on your success."
good,"It is a low stress position. In this position, work stays at work. There is minimal micro-managing. A typical work day consist of taking about 90 phone calls from truck drivers explaining to them their daily load duties. It is a very simplistic position, perfect for a college student."
good,"Excellent company, with lots of growth opportunity. Great benefits and fun environment. There are many awesome perks for working for C.H Robinson."
good,"My experience working there has been pleasant. I've worked in several departments within the time that I've been there and I truly love it. If your a people person and have a drive in sales, this is the job for you!"
good,"My office was great.  Classic Work-Hard, Play-Hard mentality.  Allowed me to deal with many large Fortune 500 Companies while also operating with many Mom-and-Pop business'.  Management and Co-Workers were great; it's just tough/grinding work."
good,"You do work long hours, but it's a great atmosphere. This is a very fast-paced business, and you need to be alert and aware of what's going on, especially with your own loads."
good,"C.H. Robinson is a great company to work for.  I don't even know where to start in regards to what I learned there.  Management was very informative and kept everyone in the loop on the pulse of business from the day to day operations to the quarterly P&L and everything in between, it didn't matter if you were an intern, ops rep, or a senior sales representative."
good,"A laid back environment where success is based on personal drive. This was a great experience where I learned a lot, and added skills/tools to take with me for my next job. There is very little opportunity to growth without relocation."
good,"-Self-motivated employees"
good,I started as a world-class intern before I graduated. Interning here gave me a great idea of how the office workplace is and great resources for the future.
good,"The interesting part of working at CHR for so long is how incredible different every office truly is.  The cultures, leadership styles and overall atmosphere of each office is so varied."
good,day at work was high and fun company to work for. Co-workers were not really inviting. Hardest part of the job was end of the month reports.The company trips were the most enjoyable part.
good,"Mornings involve followup on any issues that happened since the previous business day, customer decisions on rates, examining the days business as it stands, calling customers to get an idea of the days workload, meetings with co-workers, possible sales calls outside the office."
good,The company offers many opportunities to learn more about the transportation industry.
good,CH is a big company that has many arms. They want constant growth and expect nothing less. You can really learn what it means to be a logistics broker from them.
good,A typical day at work can be some what stressful. I have learned how to work independently without management on your back. Management can be supportive at times. Co-workers are cool to be around and work with. Hardest part of my job was correcting inaccurate bills of lading and data entry. The most enjoyable part of the job was the company parties and appreciation days.
good,"when I found out I was pregnant I was 3 months and and I figured I should wait on telling anyone because I didn’t want to be let go because of my pregnancy, but when I started to need time off form work due to health issues related  to my pregnancy I decided to tell my managers and shorty after I was let go."
good,"Great place to work! I will refer family and friends. The only reason I left was to be a stay at home. The benefits are good, there is always room to grow and move up."
good,"Work-life balance is good, not expected to kill yourself for the company. Management has always helped where wanted but otherwise lets the team have autonomy to work how they see fit. Recent leadership turnover is leading to a lot of change and uncertainty, though. The corporate offices are also getting too full so it has become a loud environment."
good,"Work at CH Robinson was amazing. The people, the culture, the environment all promoted one to be there. Management was amazing, some of the best I’ve been under. Challenged us daily to excel, learn and grow."
good,"Fun team environment willing to work together to win business.  Support is there, but the pricing is not.  Weak pricing = losing to competitors.  Clicky"
good,Enjoyed working for Robinson sorry things did not work out and my career with them was cut short I had very positive experiences during my time with them.
good,"If you enjoy Logistics, great company for you. Very fun culture alot of employees right out of college great way to meet new people in a new city.  Opportunity to help out with other job families."
good,"Good entry level job, when it is time to work it is quick pace. As far as career advancement, there is not much of it. After 2 years you will be up for a ""promotion"" which entails a name change. The first bonus wont come until you're there for 2+ years. They balance this all out with the benefits they offer, which are nice for if you have a family."
good,I worked here as a temp in LTL operations and learned alot. I was very young and not going to be there long so I didn't know much going in. Since then I have worked at TQL and am actually considering returning to opportunities at C.H Robinson.
good,"CHR does a great job with developing interns for future full-time employment. If you don't have experience with carriers in the beginning you'll be tad but confused, but just ask a bunch of questions and don't be afraid to stand out!"
good,It was good and I enjoyed working there. The people were nice and so was management. The work environment was productive and diverse. I would work there again.

good,"it was an overall good experience, good pay and good benefits.  I was given incremental pay raises and felt like the compensation for my work was good."
good,CH Robinson offers an entrepreneurial work environment allowing for personal growth and career advancement. You truly get out of it what you put in and you are allowed to make your own career path based on your own interests and talents.
good,Some Saturday shifts required throughout the year. Company typically does not want overtime pay unless absolutely needed. Getting stagnant is possible if you do not constantly hustle.
good,I have many years of experience with this company. It is a great company to be at no matter what point you are in your career. You will be compensated for your level of success.
good,"Incredible culture- great mix of tenured mentors, and other young people. Great benefits and insurance. Interesting and fast paced daily work. Thorough training program that sets employees up for success."
good,CHR hires most people right out of college.  It is a great place to learn the 3PL business.  If you do well career opportunities are available.  Moving to a smaller company is also a great career move after a few years.

Management was always available and willing to listen and take opinions seriously and professionally.  The company is committed in their employees.

good,"Operations:"
good,A very good company to work for. The days go by quickly and you work hard with a great group of people.Very good compensation and supportive people.

I have also learned how to behave in a professional, corporate environment. From email etiquette to proper behavior at dinner meetings, its a top notch organization. My co-workers are willing to help as a team environment is highly encouraged. Dealing with accounting issues is my least favorite part of the job. We have an accounts receivables department, yet are always asked to stay on top of our customers to pay their bills. I do love working in a team environment."
good,"C.H. Robinson is a great work environment with hundreds of different work opportunities. However, after nearly 2 years I was having difficulty seeing how I was going to move up with the company.

But over all it's a good environment and great place to make a career!"

We worked in a team environment where everyone was knowledgeable. The hardest and greatest part of the job was thinking on your feet. It was enjoyable as it forced you to learn and research new things to improve. Everyone is casual and down to earth; there is a laid back office culture. Management is great and lets you work independently. A typical day at work would have me processing entries for all modes of transport, consulting with customers on tariffs and classification, and doing a variety of other tasks for compliance and review of our department's work."

good,"The workplace environment was desirable and fun, and the roles were clearly defined. However, chances of job advancement were slim to none. Bonuses and opportunities to advance were awarded to few, and few and far between."
good,It was an alright place to work I guess. The only thing I would say is that they don't give raises frequently enough. Got one raise and I was there three years.
good,"Clear direction, hands off manager would recommend to anyone."
good,I learned a lot with C.H. Robinson in sales and recruiting. I made a lot of great friends and developed professional skills that will help me in the rest of my career.

good,"This is a great place to work, but I am looking for something closer to home."
good,"Great place to work."
good,great place to earn your logistics chops if you are hungry for abuse. If you can make it at C.H you can make it with any company

good,"We motivate one other to work hard and work as a team in the fast paced environment. I learned to be a diligent worker providing the customer with exceptional service, constant communication and fast results. The hardest part of the job is the uncontrollable factors that challenge transportation such as weather, the economy and government regulations."
good,Awesome team environment. Management and fellow employees always willing to support each other. High pace environment comparable to the New York Stock Exchange.
good,gain great sales experience out of college.  Shows the in's and out's of direct negotiation.
good,Everyday it was a problem solving day. Many things will happen on a day to day basis when being in a 3PL company. It was the duty to make the distributors and freight line as happy as possible while being as efficient and effective as possible for your branch.
good,High energy environment in a dynamic and ever changing industry.
good,Multi-task and problem solve for third party logistics.  Account and carrier management.  
good,"Phone calls, spreadsheets, communication with my branches and customers daily."
good,Great company to work for. Decent compensation package and great working atmosphere.
good,"I manage several accounts and my main job is to strategically analyze accounts. I break down accounts and see what I can fix internally to be more efficient and then I move externally with the customer. What the customer can do to be more efficient and what we can do for then to help them pay their past dues quicker. I work on a process improvement for their company to train and break bad habits of paying late and move them into a more normal payment term process. I enjoy being trusted to do what I need to do at my job without being micro managed, this helps me work more efficiently. My direct supervisor is great and has really taught me everything I could ever need to know and more. I enjoy really digging into the issues of an account and being able to fix it. The reward of having the account back to normal because of you is a great feeling.l"

good,"The expectation is that you get your work done and if you do, they are very family friendly. The compensate pretty well and you gain extremely valuable experience. The hardest part of the job is with such a large company, silos exist and it can be tough to get things done quickly."
good,"The overall culture at CHR is quick-paced and relatively stressful, depending on the role.  The IT building has an open, collaborative work space with fun events and is a constant buzz of activity due to the endless backlog of work."
good,"Over the last ten years they have been growing and changing a lot.  As they re-invest more and more into their business, I am sure that they will continue to grow and remain a market leader."
good,"Al ser los empleados el activo mas importante de la empresa, se enfocan mucho en los perfiles de los empleados para que exista un ambiente laboral adecuado y también, en mi experiencia como parte del equipo operativo coordinador de importaciones y exportaciones, las responsabilidades que tenía me ayudaban a tomar mis propias decisiones y poder absoluto de negociación con diferentes proveedores lo cual me ha ayudado mucho en mi carrera profesional"
good,Come in in the morning grab a coffee from the lunch room and start my day. Put myself in available and get prepared to take inbound calls. Document calls from drivers as well as the customer on in times and out times. And also document if the callers are running late. The paste is a normal paste that ill help you get through your day quickly. So calls normally last until lunch. I would have lunch and then after lunch log back in to take more inbound calls. By the time you look up its time to go home!
good,"Great company structure. Great place to sharpen your teeth. Limited ability for compensation growth. This was a great place to grow and learn about the industry, but not somewhere for me to continue to grow throughout a career."
good,"C.H. Robinson is a fast-paced, competitive environment that empowers their employees to make the best decisions for the company and for their external relationships of outside carriers. A typical day would consist of countless cold-calls to carriers to see if they are interested in certain transportation jobs for a price that the C.H. Robinson employee can't go over. What I learned from this job is to not take things personal because there were a lot of irritated personnel on the other side of the phone. Management is very helping if you need it. They are really hands off and trust that you know how to solve problems because they are rarely in your vicinity."
good,"C.H Robinson , is a fantastic company. If you are able to recive a position, I strongly recomend it. They can groom you into a roll that you most desire. The staff and the enviroment are very well worth it. If you are just starting out C.H Robinson is a company that see's your potential and value. They will extend them selfs out to you and it would be in your best intrest to prove you were woth that gamble."

good,"low benefit package, but good salary, good manager, but no chance to grow within the company, no chance to work abroad through the company, good system"
good,"Great company and job out of college, it helped me to gain a great deal of knowledge in the realm of sales. Gained a lot of wisdom on how to close deals and talking with deal makers such as CEO's, CFO's, and COO's."
good,C.H. Robinson is an excellent place to work.  Growing accounts is very satisfying and you have the autonomy to get the job done using your own skills. The company culture is fun and high energy.

This was one of the best companies I've ever worked for."

good,CH Robinson is a great place to work. The company cares about its employees and helps them to succeed in the logistics industry. The management staff work with you and not against you.
good,"Great company, great culture with lots of great people.  Can be very stressful at times, but what job isn't.  At the end of the day, I just wasn't doint what I loved to do.  My passion and skill set lies more on the Front-End...after being placed on a team I was primarily working in the Back-End.  I left to follow my passion."
good,During my employment with C.H. Robinson was awesome.  Never a dull moment and always learning something new daily.  Great teamwork and company happy hours were a plus!
good,CH Robinson was my home for 11 years - there was always an opportunity to better myself and my career within their network. CH Robinson was goal oriented and let you pursue that goal with your own drive. CH Robinson does an excellent job at promoting you and your future. They work with you to find your path to betterment and better money. The benefits were outstanding. The pace was always very quick and there were times when I wouldn't be able to keep up but knowledge soon took over and the pace lessened and the job was manageable and fun. This is a great place to work and grow!
good,"Great Culture, Terrific employer that allows you to express yourself.  Great Employee's throughout the entire network."

good,"The culture of C.H. Robinson balanced out the demand of the work that was required. Management were incredibly cognizant of the needs and well being of the employees. They were aware of how taxing a call center can become and made sure to accommodate our needs when necessary. Overall my experience with C.H. Robinson was enjoyable. The calls could become overwhelming at times, but it was still manageable."
good,"Great culture, people, and realistic management.  Excellent facilities, would go back if given the opportunity.  Work hard, play mentality.  Advance app's."
good,"Interning at CH gave me the opportunity to get my foot in the door in an industry that, at first, I had very little interest in. As an intern, they provided me with a mentor within account management that cared and taught me a lot about the transportation industry."
good,"The job consisted of resolving all billing payment discrepancies for their LTL customers. So you never knew exactly what you were going to encounter in a day, which is part of what made the day enjoyable. "
good,Great place to work if you would like a challenge and are willing to learn. Completely different culture than expected but very grateful for the things I was taught.
good,"I looked forward to going to work everyday. My managers were motivating, fun and understanding. My co-workers welcomed me with open arms and were always there to help me.

good,I work with a small group of 8 people.  We all work together as a team to get things done.  Work is always a fun place to go into.  Every team member has their own niche that they excel at so we all help each other out every single day.
good,Great for recent graduates! Fun work environment with management that cares
good,"Management and co-workers are awesome, understanding, and very supportive especially when it comes to family emergencies.  Plenty of opportunity to move up in the company."
good,Growth and development is hard in this company if you started in a entry level position. Only certain teams get raises and promotions and entry level gets a lot of work and no perks.
good,Everyone knew your business. Nothing was confidential. You have to be friends with upper management to receive recognition. I've had some good moments but their error system wasn't the best. Theres no way I should've been terminated for the issue that occurred.
good,Not a bad place to work if your just beginning to get out in the work field. Very hands on and friendly people that are willing to help you get the job done
good,The job place is a very up beat and fast paced productive environment. People are always the highlight of your day so working with them was a wonderful delight.

good,"The work environment was great. Working on the Account management side, close to sales, was a great experience. It gave me more exposure into transportation and supply chain management."
good,"CH Robinson is a very well run company that employs very talented and hard working people that are fun to work with. I worked in the GAC which is a new and relatively untested account management program for accounts with revenue >/= $2B/year. The company is structured with semi autonomous Global Forwarding offices with their own P&L's. GAC charges these individual offices for the GAC service and displaces Global Forwarding account managers in the process.  Needless to say, this creates some tension and conflict that does not permit GAC Account Managers to operate independently."
good,loved working here.  allowed you to work without micro-management as long as your job is done. work in team type setting.  food provided many times.  very casual dress.
good,CH Robinson was a great company to work for.  I learned all about Supply Chain and Trucking from working there.  I currently use what i learned there to better myself day by day.  Benefits are excellent and a great work environment to work for.

good,"working at CH Robinson was fast and exciting. People talking loud and moving fast. A typical day at work would be answering calls and giving instructions to vehicle operators. Quick thinking and solving problems fast. Working for this company you have to be in communication with different people at all times. Customer Reps, Carrier Reps,  customer service, all work together to keep the companies hiring CH Robinson  to haul or pick up their freight moving. One of the most enjoyable parts of working with CH Robinson was getting to know many people with different qualities and personalities. The hardest part about this job was learning when to step back and keep calm in stressful situations. Being there for many years taught me how to listen and think quick when faced with a problem."
good,Managed a high volume workload within a deadline-driven environment. I've learned a lot at C.H. Robinson. We strived on integrity and working under pressure. The management was very cool and down to earth and offered training when needed. My peers were very helpful with any situation that occurred and will assist on your workload when needed. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers even though it was handled with no problem. I enjoyed receiving incentives when we win in any game that will improve your collection numbers for that day.
good,Get ready to be on the phone and email all day. It can be rewarding because you are given the independence to grow and secure business. Fun co workers. Decent management

good,If the opportunity presented itself I would go back. There are many opportunities to move around in the company you just have to prove yourself and bring something to the table.

good,"Every day put a smile on your face, working with the public and the staff co workers. "

good,Herramientas y capacitación constante para desempeñar tu puesto.
good,"Buen ambitente laboral, excelentes instalaciones en San Pedro, sin duda volveria."
good,They didn't pay fairly based on the work load provided. Unless you held a certain role within the company. They try to buy you off with TV's and vending machines and game rooms.
good,"The training and business world exposure is second to none.  You have access to Fortune 500 clients, multi-million dollar systems and experts across the CHR network.  If you want a career in supply chain and logistics, this is a great place to start."

After orientation and training, I took to the Navishere Logistics System right away and was quickly able to submerge myself into the day to day routine. Loved the fast paced job and being able to multi-task between dispatching, logging calls, troubleshooting logistics, updating ETA's, building loads and other work orders, emailing, making calls, and maintaining great communication with the inter C.H.

My managers were flexible and let me move around between the account management, sales, and carrier side. I was lucky enough to have an analytics background so I was able to work with the sales team on great projects"
good,This place was perfect for me to learn a lot about working in a office environment. There is a lot of opportunities for advancement if logistics is what you are interested in.

good,Everyday was a new day with lots to do. It was a very productive environment and high energy company. My training at that company wasnt up to par but when I was able to get trained they did a good job.
good,typical day consists of meeting with my team and make sure we prioritize our tasks. I make sure and touch base with existing customers before following up with prospects and generating new leads. What I've learned is the importance of not only working with a team but trusting each other in order to move forward and execute correctly. Like in all sales positions I think the most complicated part of my job is getting to decision makers. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to close a sales cycle from discover to the actual implementation of an account.
good,"C.H.Robinson people are in the middle of the action every day, making the connections that keep the economy moving. Our three business units – freight brokerage, expedited transportation and freight forwarding – use relationships with more than 22,000 carriers to serve over 8,500 customers with freight to ship in the manufacturing, industrial, retail, commercial, life sciences and government sectors."
good,"It is a great job, I enjoy working for my boss, I enjoy my coworker, I'm a temp, so I'm not sure of job security, I have been there 1yr 7mths, wish I could make more money so I do not have to work paycheck to paycheck other than that it is a great job."
good,"a typical day at work is scheduling pick up and delivery appointments. I have learned the importance of multi-tasking to get things done in a timely manner. Management is very helpful and always willign to provide help if needed. My co-workers are very supportive and willing to help if necessary.

I know a lot of the managers and GM’s and I can honestly say most of them are the greatest people I have ever worked with! Just make sure to review SOPs daily / weekly no matter how long you’ve been there. If you have questions ask a lead for help.

CHR is worldwide so the sky is the limit."

Everyone was so helpful and accepting of the fact that I went into this internship not knowing (anything really) about the industry. Because I am an intern, I get a smaller workload, but I do see that working here entails a lot of focus and time management. The team I worked with had so much energy and they were all sort of like a family. I went in to work everyday knowing that I would be greeted by my team, invited out to lunch, and asked if I needed any guidance or had any general questions. I think CHR is a great place to grow, as most of my team members have been working there for many years and seem to really enjoy it. I would recommend CHR, especially to anyone who is in College or just getting out of College!"

I can honestly say, it was the best job I ever had. I learned so much about logistics and its processes and rewards for the brokers. I spoke to Canadians and Mexicans on my nightly outgoing international calls to keep track of the carriers along with their destinations. Working evening hours is the hardest shift. You have to problem solve situations and contact agents for advise or email them after-hours. After weeks of repetition on the night shift, I learned how to deal with international border issues, what happens if the driver's truck breaks down in the middle of nowhere, where and when will the next load of products will be picked up or dropped off and how to use Google Maps for directions for lost drivers. I highly recommend anyone looking for employment in logistics, customer service or any IT field to consider applying to C. H. Robinson.
