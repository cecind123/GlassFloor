rating,review
good,"There is a strong corporate culture,a commitment to excellence and a collaborative team environment at UHS. It is a company anyone should feel proud to be affiliated with."
bad,"I worked there for many years never git a raise, very hostile work place. The director digreates you as a woman, sexually harrases you with personal questions. Treats you like a slave and takes your money from your pay check as he pleases"
bad,Worked 3 years as a therapist. Social service manager is outright abusive. Tells you to back date notes and treatment plans. She makes serious accusations of her staff members. High turnover rate.. problem at valley behavioral health hospital in Phoenix is abusive social service manager. Makes staff do groups when they are not licensed to do so.very unhealthy work environment. Manager didn’t inform staff of a patient suicide attempt until after programming was over on the unit.
bad,"Palmdale Regional Medical Center, OR is the worst!  Deserving of “ZERO STARS”....Run! Don’t even consider this place.  Note: 4 Nurses new to the OR hired for PeriOp Training all quit!   Favoritism, Bullying, Unprofessional charge nurses & a Director who seemingly turns a blind eye to the behavior is what you can expect."
bad,"Universal was an overwhelming place to work, they would stack on job duties without asking or telling- they just expected you to pick up someone else's slack. They never reward you for exceeding your job duties and doing a good job, but will always point out when you make a mistake. They never have job advancement opportunities, and you will never get a raise or bonus."
bad,I used to think that organizational culture does not matter until I worked here. The company does not encourage individual growth or development. Meeting targets was more important than employee satisfaction.
bad,"If you enjoy chaos, working countless hours, and being expected to work and to be available 24-7, then this is the place for you. This UHS facility is a behavioral health care; locked, residential child and adolescent hospital. Overall this place is not recommended as an ideal working environment."
bad,one of the worst places i have had the pleasure of working no benefits no paid time off nothing except shotty manager and some okay coworkers it was a mix but not worth it
bad,"I can write a book to describe what happens in this slaughterhouse. Indeed, I can write a book about this place and the people who work there. I would never, ever choose to end up in that dirty, unsafe, dangerous, and careless place. I have witnessed so much negligence, verbal and, sadly, physical abuse that I can go for weeks writing about it. The ratio nurses/techs patients (often 1 tech/nurse will have to take care of 15-18 patients if you're lucky) is awful and ridiculous which, of course, has a direct repercussion on the employees' immediate safety especially when you're working in the clinical (APS) or CSU units. You can see how poorly the management care about patients (even if they fake they care) and employees. They join units to save money on employees (2 techs rather than 4, or 1 tech rather than 2) care a ""zucchini"" about your personal safety, and lack of care you'll end up providing to the clients/patients. Therapists who are put under a tremendous pressure to take care of 30 patients (this includes paperwork, group sessions, and individual’s assessments). You'll see how therapists show all the time clear signs of distress. You'll start asking yourself how is it possible that a professional, who is supposed to help people who pay to be there, looks like he/she needs to be helped himself/herself in the first place. What can I tell you?? "
bad,"The brook dupont has the worst work environment I have ever seen.  The management does not support the staff, and speaks to employees in a degrading manner.  The company overall does not seem to care about the patients, just profits.  I would not recommend this facility to neither patients or healthcare employees."
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked.  Not centered around good patient care.  the employees are not valued at all.  Hostile work environment, and obvious favoritism in the workplace."
bad,"As a clinical therapist I was expected to do billing,, nursing responsibilities , collect money, and  tolerate abuse from the doctors.  Staff was mean to clients and did not take their medical complaints seriously. I would not work in this environment."
bad,This place is horrible. The management is horrible and if your in the wrong clique they are even worse. Your life is constantly in danger because of the lack of staffing and training that they give you about the job and kids that are there. They therapists are scared to death of the kids and lie to them about going home which gets the kids mad at us (mental health techs) and we didn’t do anything. Some of these kids need to be in jail for the attacks they do to the other kids but it gets swept under the rug. And some of the kids should not be discharged back into the community because they are seriously dangerous to the public. If u want to have high blood pressure and your own mental break down then head over to Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center.
bad,"Stressful and dangerous.  Management only cares about filling beds.  Understaffed, turnover is shocking.  Breaks are rare, even on double shifts.  Coworkers are awesome, culture is terrible."
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone who has a family to provide for and/or a professional license to protect. I did not listen to others who told me not to work for this company specifically Newport News Behavioral Health and Harbor Point Behavioral Health.  This  was by far the worst working experience in my book.  Please, take heed and run!!"
bad,"I started as a temp and did all my hours and still was not converted permanently then I was just left go, they no longer needed my services.  No social life"
bad,"I do not like applying here.  They make the application so difficult to do. I must've applied NUMEROUS of times and no one calls me. I am CNA with lots of experience, I would think someone woulda called me a long time ago for an interview. I called human resources and they weren't much help. I doubt this is a good place to work. There are always positions open and I always wonder if employees are replaceable. Most likely they are."
bad,"Where do I even start...terrible management, everyone either quits or gets fired over minuscule issues, walls and ceilings infested with mold, no back up, no advancement, will try to call you in on your days off or make you stay late daily, college degree level employees get paid 50 cents more than high school level employees, ask you to step in for supervisors and then don't compensate you like promised, tiny raises that are never more than 30 cents, you call off for being sick you get points against you...the list goes on and on. Oh and there is nothing but backstabbing and drama between employees! Do not work here."
bad,I worked here and feel bad for the kids and people still there. No one wants to improve this place and those who do just get shut down. You will leave sad and disheartened and very under paid. I don't complain much but This place just makes it hard not to. I wish they would make positive changes but at the end it's for money you don't see and not anything else.
good,"There is a strong corporate culture,a commitment to excellence and a collaborative team environment at UHS. It is a company anyone should feel proud to be affiliated with."
bad,"Run while you can, if your not in the admin. click; you get used. No one wants to hear what admin. can do better. It's a very depressing work place. Thank god for  the patient's that's what keeps you at work not respect or thanks."
bad,"Run....run RUN! !!!"
bad,"I was used up and spit back out into my life in just under 90 days.  I went from working 50 plus hours a week trying to prove myself for a job in a field i am beyond passionate about to unemployed single mother. And with no reference to get another in this field my chances are slim. We are told that we must work as a team and look out for eachother. Yet I have never worked in a place where I couldn't trust ANYONE I worked for and I've worked in sales.  The ""offical"" documented  reason I was terminated was helping a coworker for 5 mins so she could take a quick bbreak apparently this is against policy yet  This has been done once by myself and multiple times by other RAs before not to mention she has been there at the company longer than I have so it was my assumption that this was ok to do. I finished my checks on my clients and went to help my coworker. No incidents occurred with her clients in her department and I went back to where my clients were in group. Less than an hour later my cell phone rings while I am talking to a suicidal client.. The call was from my boss on a Saturday that's never good. I unfortunately stop my conversation with the client inorder to answer this call i am then reprimanded for helping my coworker with a break. Someone had called him to inform him. On a Saturday someone called my boss to tattle. This was becoming somewhat of a normalcy that was extremely annoying and discouraging. I immediately apologized and took responsibility for my part in assuming this was acceptable behavior. I did not know it was against policies and procedures. I certainly"
bad,"Poor management, Therapist are under appreciated given 40 hours week salary with 80 hours work to complete in that time frame. With no comp time. Highly stressful due to high turn over rate, short staffing and disrespect of staff combined with the stressful nature of monitoring and counseling various maladaptive behaviors of the clientele. Staff client ratio is almost always not within regulation. This is NOT a good place to work."
bad,"Highly stressful, low paying, low moral place to work. For profit company and administration lets you know it. Mental health facility that does not care about their employees mental health nor the patients. They only care about making a dollar!"
bad,"Extremely disorganized, communication is done through yelling and screaming when something goes wrong. Very very stressful job low pay. If you want to have high blood pressure or a stroke this is the perfect job for you."
bad,"This is the most unethical place I've ever worker in over 20 years. The so-called CEO has zero management skills, has a bachelors degree with no supervisory experience. She relies heavily on the HR manager who will stab you in your back at any given moment. They have fired some of the best, most educated, experienced and committed people I've ever met. Why? Because they've raised serious concerns about patient care, patient and staff safety, they object to being cursed at by the Assessment Center Manager (who doesn't even know how to use the computer system - can't admit a patient to the hospital or complete a decent clinical assessment herself but will literally yell at and about staff doing it the wrong way). Your marketing dept made her way to the top the old fashioned way - true and factual. There is no ethics board so they mistreat patients and no one is overseeing their immoral practices. The benefit's - who can afford them? Horrible benefits. Management will smile in your face, gain your trust and make promises but be sure to listen for the bus - they'll throw you under in less than a heartbeat. You'll want to gauge your own eyeballs out if you accept a position at CHH. Oh and don't feel too important if they do hire you, they hire anyone and don't check references. That's how the last CEO was able to slip in with his fake PhD (bought it online). This place is so sad. DE is a disgrace and LH is her willing copilot. Don't say you weren't warned. By the way, any good reviews you read came from the same snakes who create the miserable working environment. It was the happiest"
bad,Spring Mountain and UHS are horrible to work for. Management sets the tone and a culture of playing favorites. If you're not a submissive person then you're on the outside looking in. The DON and ADON aren't leaders. The worst experience of my life.
bad,Horrible position. No room for advancement. Expect to be physically assaulted by patients and exploited by staff. Horrible pay also. This company is always hiring. That should tell u something. I only work there a couple months and I saw 3 job orientation during my time spent there.
bad,This company neglects and beat the children. Clients sleeping with other clients and administration. Hides it from the parents clients are not taking care of staff beating clients. Calling them out of thier names the director of nursing is horrible. staff molesting the clients no teachers Clients are just held there being medicated and neglect and abused.  When state comes in they hide everything.
bad,Not a good place to work.  Very stressful and not much support from management.  Underpaid for what is expected.
bad,"Bhw 's cursing at residents and using excessive force. . Horrible! Management is horrible and you will never have opportunity for advancement if you are not in the ""click"" mandates daily, 70 hours a week and not even a thank you for helping? Ridiculous! ! Do not work here."
bad,"I work at Cypress Creek Hospital in Houston, TX. This is a HORRIBLE place to work.  The CEO and HR director are corrupt.  They have no qualms when it comes to lying to protect themselves or finding someone else to blame when they need to cover up the fraud they commit on a daily basis...and the fraud they allow to happen.  Universal Health Services does not seem to care that Cypress Creek Hospital is run by tyrants.The CEO is a smooth talker and can weasel his way out of anything. I have nothing positive to say about this company or the hospital.  Quality care and hard work are not rewarded.  It is so sad that the employees AND patients are so disrespected at this facility. It really is all about the money.  I thought that when UHS bought PSI Solutions, things would get better.  But everything has gotten worse.  UHS stocks keeps climbing...yet they continue with cutbacks.  Their mission statement of this company is a terrible lie.  Stay away...they don't care about anyone but themselves."
bad,"This is the most disorganized, abusive to it's professional employees, disrespectful and dangerous to the patients company I've ever worked for in 25 years of working in various facilities. I never have time for lunch, they lied in my interview about my job responsibilities and I am doing FAR more than they said and other things I won't go in to. Patient to staff ratio is ridiculous and it's impossible to give good patient care or documentation unless you spend 12 hours/ 5 day shifts rather than 8 hour shifts. The only reason I'm sticking around FOR NOW is that they are paying me VERY well but it's SUCH a poor work environment I am at the point I am willing to walk away from a fabulous pay check. UHS needs to respect their employees and their patients. It's the worst."
bad,No support systenm. Horrible culture . No work life balance
bad,Understaffed patients having sex TB and whooping cough possible exposure ! You name it ive seen it charted and reported ! Upper MGNT turn a blind eye and if yo speak up you will be targeted and next you will take the walk of shame. Horrible place or to work be a patient Kids can watch disney movies at home and save peoples tax money !
bad,"The management is awful. They want you to work the jobs of 3 people,alot of favoratism, most of the employees here came from a similiar co, who try to run this company like the one they came from, no potential for advancement,if you have an issue with a coworker or a part of your job and you speak up about it, you will be retialiated against, so be prepared,the raises suck and there is never a dull moment here. Mo"
bad,"This was an interesting position, full of experiences I will use to sniff out such an environment on subsequent interviews at other companies.  Everyday I was the recipient of finger-pointing to correct issues where I had no control and no opportunity for influence.  It was a constant blame-game with no real visionary in my line of management.  The culture breeds bullies who thrive on tormenting new hires.  There is no work-from-home option, even during snow storms, when employees are asked to move their cars (in 6+ inches of snow) so the plow can clear the parking lot.  The dress code is pure business - I wore a suit nearly every day to sit in an office."
bad,"UHS is known for being extremely lean to the point of employee burnout. They do not value employees in most departments and need a much better compensation structure. "
good,"There is a strong corporate culture,a commitment to excellence and a collaborative team environment at UHS. It is a company anyone should feel proud to be affiliated with."
bad,Under staffed all the time because of the grid not the acuity of patients. Get called off so often you need another job just to pay bills. Usually the only nurse for up to 25 patients that includes passing all medications and running as the charge nurse.
bad,"Management does not care about you no matter which department you're in. They will write you up even though you did nothing wrong. Hostile environment with people yelling at each other in every department. There is favoritism and if your not part of the ""in"" group you will get blamed for things you didn't do. The place is always understaffed because they can't keep people that want to work in this environment. By the time I left I felt beaten down. This place should be shut down, the way they treat their staff is horrible. It's unbelievable that staff get treated in this manner in a Psychiatric Hospital that is meant to heal others."
bad,"I live in the Sacramento area."
bad,"This company as a whole do not respect their employees in work wise. This is a production and micromanage place! No paid holidays which they do not tell you. A lot of turnover rate job posting every week!. If you get the job be ware and get out fast you will be looking for another job. This is stressful  environment, it all about productivity then quality no proper training is giving no policy nor procedures to go by for a 500 fortune company. Mangers and team leader do not know what they are doing."
bad,Employees are not valued. Even management is not valued. Managers have very little authority. Profit is the main concern. Abusive CEO and CFO.
bad,"My administrative tenure started under wonderful CEO leadership until corporate made some changes. The newly hired CEO is a puppet for the corporate figureheads and isn't cocerned with client care. The other reviews are correct. The bottom line is money. Sure corporations need to keep the lights on and it is a business but there is a huge sacrifice to client/patient care. The regional corporate CEO is not equipped to handle his role. He uses fear and intimidation to rule over his subjects causing the acting facility CEO to cower down in submission. There is no team within leadership. Hard, dedicated leaders are let go. UHS does not stand by their leaders, directors that is. Your disposable. Your a number and even if you cross your T's and dot your i's don't expect a tenure longer than 1 1/2 years. They cut corners on supplies, resources for clients, technology, etc. They want peak performance with limited resources. State programs and non profits have more resources at their disposals. Staff are constantly asked to FLEX time and fear based leadership reigns. Staff are always concerned with whether they will stay employed or be furloughed or take a reduction in pay due to being forced to flex. While the CEO's and corporate folks rake in heavy salaries. It's a joke. If you value yourself this is not the gig for you."
bad,"Ranks at the top of one of the worst places I have worked. The management is horrible. They are in the stone ages as far as records goes. They don't want to move forward. They have unqualified people in charge of areas that they shouldn't.  I wanted to like the job I had there, but management made that difficult."
bad,"UHS repeatedly encouraged lying about bed availability when referrals without a payor source came in. Management often placed patients in rooms without promise of a bed. The facility in Lexington SC is old, depressing, and badly in need of updating. And why that's not happening is confusing since this place doesn't pay employees their worth or provide innovative treatment or care. "
bad,"Supervisors have been there a while & have little high-school 'cliques'.  They give more shifts to their 'friends'.  Opportunities are not available to those equally or more qualified.  Overwhelming workload & short-staffed most of the time, making a dangerous situation even worse.  Staff get injured on a regular basis.  Hard work is NOT rewarded!   Minor human mistakes are blown out of proportion, & these people are vindictive.  They will ruin your reputation in the blink of an eye!  Run!"
bad,"I worked as a mental health worker and basically had to do everyone's job. I took vitals signs for all patients yet they have rn's there. I was told rn""s had to much paperwork...then I gave all groups ex.life goals, teaching skills to the patients etc etc.. I was their mentor ..counselor and teacher..I did the social workers job. All their shifts are 12 hours so your their 7am-7pm.. They have a high turnover rate! Working 12 hours I rarely EVER got to take a break because there not enough workers to relieve you. Your breaks are suppose to be 2 15 min and a 30 minute lunch which you rarely get to take. The pay is Horrible!!!! Basic pay is between 10-12hr depending on experience however for everything that I was doing it should have been more like 17-18$ hr. You walk and sit with patients for breakfast lunch and dinner..you do all their vitals..you security check all their rooms. When you have a group of patients you are by yourself at all times..one day it could be you and 13 adolescent boys or 12 adults.. There is no security either in this mental health facility so if your alone and a group of patients start to fight you have to run down the hall to the phone...I could go on and on....just beware"
bad,Don’t trust the Director of Nursing/administration.  They will look you in the face and lie to your face. Stay away at all costs.  The residents are suffering because the lack of care from the front office. Wipe out the current admin and get someone in there who wants best for the residents.
bad,"There are other good places to work. Company has many layoffs. Employees are constantly moved around the office, and this causes a poor work environment. Office space on first floor is cramped and noisy. Managers are awful. Steer clear of this place."
bad,"I was there from 9-5 alone.  Doing the work, which I didnt mind.  I can work alone easily.  Workplace culture was horrible. Hardest part of the job was the nurse who was supposed to go see patients 90 days to review their health status.  This was never done."
bad,"good co workers, top management needs work, pay needs work learned not to trust what told, Staffing levels need work, Lack trust in top management, gain great experience"
bad,"worked on units with 26 patients to just one nurse and tech.  Upper management has no clue and acts like they own you. You get treated with no respect, paid poorly, and treated like a dog.  You will be lucky if you get more than two shifts of training. Corporate and management doesn't care about patients or staff, only money."
bad,This company did not support the employer gaining the most training possible to do a sufficient job . Management was not supportive or approachable.Did not have a positive experience
good,"There is a strong corporate culture,a commitment to excellence and a collaborative team environment at UHS. It is a company anyone should feel proud to be affiliated with."
bad,"A typical day at work? Prior to leaving home, I would get headaches and GI symptoms. Why? Because the DON is mean. One never knows when their last shift will be. Staff fear her. She speaks negatively about those who are not like her; position within the facility doesn't matter. She was overheard saying that she wanted to get rid of a supervisor who was diagnosed with cancer. Nobody is safe, as she likes nobody. She knows how to stay out of trouble. Multiple complaints filed to Department of Health and UHS. Governing bodies visit the facility, but nothing is done. Without the DON, the facility would run smoothly and staff would not fear for their jobs. Annual evaluations are harsh and raises are minimal, typically 1%. Keep in mind this is a Fortune 500 company. Should one feel valued when given a 1% raise? 40%+ turnover. Staff feel pressured to allow continuous last minute changes to the 6 week schedule; never feeling as though they can make plans for their days off. Despite administration, I grew both professionally and personally during my tenure. I had a great working relationship with staff; both nurses and MHTs. I enjoyed my patients, and overall, enjoyed my job. UHS is a for profit corporation. The Meadows should focus more on human service, especially when it comes to their staff."
bad,Welcome to Madmen in 1962 - the culture was very white male oriented - blue suits/red ties - in fact I was told during the interview not to wear anything but a white shirt
bad,"This was a great place to work for many years. staff was like family. The facility has deteriorated so much in the last year, it is dangerously understsffed and not safe for patients or staff. The new CEO doesnt seem to care about anything except ""fill the beds and make money""."
bad,I worked and helped build La Amistad to a respectable institution then watched upper management take all credit and dismissed all who really made it happen. Now they replacing National Deaf Academy with. Seven Waters in Mt. Dora. Please Google NDA Mt.Dora and see the poor care they gave to those patients in Central Fl. I also am a resident who lives close by that revamped facility focus and I WILL be very vocal when they undoubtedly foul up. Work for UHS at your careers peril.
bad,I worked there for a year and a half as a driver.  As an on call driver they would want you to work 12 or 24 hour shifts.  Some weekends they would want you on call all weekend and most times you would not go out at all.  If there were any weekend discharges the supervisor would do them and take the hours away from the other drivers.
bad,Poor work environment with constant turn over. High pressure to cover shifts so the management doesn't have to do it themselves. They will not hesitate to dump work they don't feel like doing on you.
bad,"I found the work to be challenging and rewarding when working with clients and other facilities we worked with. However, an emphasis was placed on efficiency of paperwork rather than on client outcomes. Supervision was sporadic, often done by text, and often negative."
bad,This company has changed management and staff so much since my stay. Everyone wants to leave as there are very unqualified staff telling others how to do there job and they are unaware of how to do their own. If you are minority you will not likely be acknowledged for anything. However each team usually supports one another however each team individually is against each other. Staff disrespect and abuse during restraints verbally and physically and as a therapist you have to deal with the controversy with communities and their parents and families. Very fast paced enironment and high caseloads.
bad,"The people who actually work with the patients are very good. The therapists, MHTs, and nurses care about the patients and work very hard. Unfortunately management is AWFUL. We are always understaffed, over worked, and under paid. Patient safety is a distant second to their love of money. Employee safety is not even considered. This is a ""treatment facility"" that recently laid off 80% of the therapists working there. And the HR staff is the worst I have ever dealt with. By far."
bad,I worked for Case Management. Terrible director. I've been a case manager for 15 years and this was the worst treatment I have ever experienced. He has no empathy for his staff. Don't work for this company. Especially case management department.
bad,"This is a poorly run system for nurses. No support, outdated policies. Everyday your license is at risk. There is no care for patients. All this company cares about is money. Unqualified professionals are working on every level. This place cant keep decent employees. There is no staff education and no one to go to for answers. Run if you are there now!"
bad,Management promotes fear and paranoia amongst staff. They watch cameras like a hawk and then use data collected against you. A very shaming culture. Nurses are written up that have never had issues before. Pay is great; sign-on bonus offered. Very poor employee retention. The hospital is dirty and not patient-centered. I will not stay even though I am at the top of my pay scale and was offered a huge sign-on bonues.
bad,Executive management is a boys-club bunch of bullies. Lower management and HR will NOT take your side and you will be forced to suck it up and deal with the harrassment or resign.
bad,"stressful, chaos!! Lack of leadership or support. Always shorthanded!! I worked for this company for over 5 years, I have seen so many people come and go."
bad,"As a mental health technican, management does not value you as an employee. The nurses here after given way too much leeway and boss techs around. New management is power hungry and like changing things all the time. You could be the best staff ever and they would find something wrong with you."
bad,Terrible place. The directors in place were all back stabbing and evil. I ran screaming and never looked back. They were nasty to your face as well. I can't believe the bad ones stay and the good people leave.
bad,"If you are seeking to gain experience working with mentally ill patients, this is a good place to start-- not stay. You cannot grow here. As a matter of fact, it is all about favoritism. Management lacks managerial and interpersonal skills. Supervisors are condescending and unrealistic with expectations (they do not provide adequate staff to help you obtain their expectations). This organization is extremely frugal they rather cut back on staffing and patient snacks before considering employee and patient needs. Here, if you have a bachelors degree, it is equivalent to having NO DEGREE because they could care less about you as a working professional. Compensation? None. Respect? None. Acknowledgment/ appreciation? Never. Unethical? At times, YES. This place will burn you out. Not so much because of the patient population and the high demands, but due to STAFF (some are ethical and pleasurable to work with). In the end, the patients suffer the most from the disorganization and the frugality of this company."
bad,"This was the worst job ever, they dont care about patients!!! Management only cares about money!!!! They have their own buddy system and only look out for each other!!! Find another job!!! Run!!!"
bad,"This review is for Garfield Park Hospital. That hospital is a joke. They are unethical, money driven, and started with a poor reputation. They had several riots on the unit do to understaffing. UHS shut the hospital down at least twice. The turn over rate is insane. The hospital has been open for 2 years but is on it's third CEO. The intake department is a revolving door. They will admit kids that don't meet inpatient criteria for money. They have been known to step up kids from outpatient programs for money. They place kids of all ages on the same floor when census is low. Staff on third shift sleep on the job but don't get in trouble. Staff that make racial strife on the job and keep up drama remain employed. However staff that voice concerns about their jobs, or raise concerns about ethical issues, or ask to transfer to other positions within the same hospital are let go. The director of HR is a lying snake do not trust anything that comes out her mouth. Favoritism and biased management is part of UHS. No one has job security, you can be let go at anytime without cause. Seriously the hospital is a joke and leadership is clueless and incompetent."
good,"There is a strong corporate culture,a commitment to excellence and a collaborative team environment at UHS. It is a company anyone should feel proud to be affiliated with."
bad,"Just not a great place to work. As an employee your license is constantly at risk. No sense of direction from upper management. Very uncomfortable work environment. Instead of being proactive they have a reactive approach. Worst DON ever. Too many employees with sugar in their tank, including management."
bad,Work is stressful. They barely train you. Management plays favoritism and gossips about employees all day. Co-workers are childish and gossip as well. Hardest part of the job is the job. Most enjoyable part is leaving for the day and pay day.
bad,You may fit well with this organization.  It was not a good fit for me.  There is little balance between what is asked of  you and what support you receive to deliver upon the asks.
bad,"Good place to start for someone who doesn't have any experience. The pay is good. The schedule is flexible. Coworkers are nice for the most part. Management can be a struggle. They do not follow through on their commitments. They show favoritism and do not actually manage. Employees can basically get away with anything. Which is great if you are the type of person who goes to work just to get a check and not to actually work. Management tactics include bullying and trying to invoke fear in employees. It doesn't work. It only makes the work environment toxic."
bad,"All buildings within UHS are different-"
bad,"If you are not liked by the upper management, then you might as well quit.  It will be just a matter of time before they will push you out the door.  Unethical practices, unfair treatment (both patient & employees), unprofessional management, under staffed & over worked healthcare providers, make it up as we go along environment,  and the list goes on and on. The turn over here is off the charts.  Even sadder....the hospital I worked at (Valley Hospital Phoenix, AZ) is owned by a HUGE Corporation that is clueless to the aforementioned practices."
bad,"Management all stick together and will get rid of anyone they see as a threat. I will tell any one to get out when you can find something better. No one is safe, you can work over time and be a well rounded employee, but just let one thing happen, they will fire you. A learning experience for me, but will never be loyal again. Most definitely was a bad decision working for this evil place"
bad,"Devoted over four years to help develop an adequate recreation therapy program. I had to beg for adequate funding and management was oblivious to the requiements of providing quality recreation programs. Profit- driven mentality resulted in poor quality programs and a low morale. Building was poorly ventilated and patients were provided excessive smoke breaks causing smoke to filter into building space causing me to have headaches and other health conditions. I reported mold and ventilation concerns, but little was done to provide a healthy environment. I would not recommend working for a company that devotes all focus on profits. People's lives are more valuable and CEO's are blinded by $$$."
bad,"Lots of ridiculous job expectations as a mental health tech despite not being licensed. Long hours and low pay. Patients will wear you down, which is to be expected in this environment."
bad,"I am a current employee. If u work here YOU will be sorry."
bad,"Please do not waste your time at such a facility. Horrible management, terrible work attitudes, are not concerned about patients and are strongly money driven! If you are a person of good character, morals, and integrity... Do not, and I repeat.. DO NOT challenge your beliefs by joining such a facility! Staff morale is so low that it's ridiculous! I don't know where they have found the staff, but surely they were once humans before they became carnivorous animals! I pray that whomever is reading this, finds another job bc this place is horrible! Staff is rude to the patients and the doctors care the least bit about the patients. They have no time for the patients and only want to shove MEDS without actually showing concern. This place should be reported for a number of things !!!!"
bad,"Great employees, lack of recognition for hard work, no advancement, backwards thinking from management, constant lack of support from administration in every facility"
bad,"Positives about this place; most of the staff members truly want to help, some work tovether as a taem to get task done and keep patients and each other safe. Rate of pay is decent. Place looks good on paper."
bad,"I worked at Rolling Hills Hospital as a nurse. The staff are awesome! Absolutely no boundaries for patients are enforced. O No matter how psychotic a patient is on admission, seclusion is frowned upon. The most acute unit is staffed mostly by new nurses Employee recognition and rewards given to staff who who are buddies with administration. Hospital is filthy! Will not hire cleaning staff. No security! Nurses and techs have been injured! Goals of the organization change daily New nurses make the same hourly as experienced nurses. Several administrative positions turn over each year. Administration would rather hire new staff than train and reward existing staff. Staff turnover has risen exponentially with no changes! Could be a great place but management more concerned about pinching dollars than acknowledging good work performance."
bad,"This job was incredibly difficult to work at. Management was incredibly disorganized, we did not receive breaks, and we worked an average of 50+ hours a week due to a mandarin policy, where we would be forced to work 16 hours shifts."
bad,Not concerned with employee morale. Management makes decisions based on census not on employee safety in environment.
bad,"The staff doesn't care about the residents.   The environment/culture is not the best. If you are someone who cares, you are labeled as weak.  My employment their was not good."
bad,"Pay peanuts, get monkeys. Can't keep good staff, typical day includes multiple restraints and getting hit by patients. We live in an expensive college town and they pay $3.00/hr less than McDonald's to come to work and get assaulted."
bad,You have some autonomy but you are on your own when it comes to agitated patients. They no longer allow seclusion for teenagers and they do whatever they want.
good,"There is a strong corporate culture,a commitment to excellence and a collaborative team environment at UHS. It is a company anyone should feel proud to be affiliated with."
bad,"crazy from beginning to the end. Working along with nurses and the patient. The management as at the time that I was working there was poor. A little bit okay, but can do better, 24hrs on call."
bad,UNPROFESSIONAL! The owner of Universal Healthcare Services knows nothing about his job.  The company was passed down to him after his mother passed.  All he cares about is MONEY and not the patients!  I was released from the contract w/o being properly notified!  I was not paid on time on several different occasions!
bad,"Way too much of workload for designers. I like being busy and having work to do, but this was over the top. Very stressful. Poor management. Outdated office environment."
bad,"This company only sees one thing, $. The upper management really doesn't have a clue what they are doing.  As soon as you disagree with the COO or CEO, you're out the door."
bad,I have worked at 2 different hospitals owned by UHS and each one was too much primarily focused on the numbers and revenue instead of having a healthy balance between that and excellent patient care. Poor management and benefits. The most enjoyable part of my job at UHS was working with the patients.
bad,"Fortune 500 company that’s run like a family business. Company is extremely conservative, afraid to take worthwhile risks. Always playing follow the leader. Dysfunctional leadership that likes pitting managers against each other to avoid having them discover how truly behind the curve the company is. One of the worst work experiences of my life. I didn’t know that such draconian companies still existed....And, the whole behavioral health side of the business is corrupt. Literally just paid over $100 million in fines for keeping patients longer than necessary and possibly against their will. Way to go!"
bad,"""Pedal to the Metal"" all day; 8-hour shift rarely has time for 30-minutes lunch break; 10-12 hour shifts are able to take breaks.  Frequent OT in relationship to position & patient needs.  No real support or educational opportunities to learn (non-clinical) position requirements, regulations & no assistance; short staffed department.  Corporate-wide ""administrative"" frame of focus as opposed to ""in the trenches"" people/clinical focus."
bad,"Was my first job out of nursing school. Unfortunately. Taught me what not to do as a nurse. Hostile, unsympathetic, poor management, poor morale environment. Punitive and uncaring for staff and patients. Got my 1 year experience and ran as soon as I could. The company is all about money, in fact the upper management gets a bonus if they save money on limiting staff. Awful place. You can do better. "
bad,"Unfair and manipulative management.  Overworked staff, lack of support.  This company is only focused on the money.  They do not care about the staff of clients in their care."
bad,"loved learning a new trait and growing with the company, i didn't like always feeling expendable, I didn't like every ones negativity, or the raises. Benefits were great pay was ok."
bad,"McAllen Medical Center is for someone who just wants to get their foot in the door. But don't recommend it for long term work. Management is ridiculous, and don't get to the bottom of things when needed to. Floors are constantly understaffed and this causes problems to arise and patients to be affected. It's can be very stressful and get hectic really fast. Management does not appreciate employees what so ever. They definitely don't ""practice what they preach."" This hospital is falling apart. It's very dirty."
bad,"Chaotic constantly, not real life work balance, always on call and penalized if you did not work when asked to come in on your day off.  The benefits are good but the pay is not comparable to other organizations that do the same thing."
bad,"The company is good but the bad does not outweigh the good."
bad,"I've been with the company for nearly three years, first as an intern, then as an intake clinician at two different facilities. During my time at the first facility, there was a sentinel event wherein a psychotic patient escaped, ran to the grocery store next door, and went to town on themselves with a box cutter. This is because the facility is consistently, critically understaffed. I was reassured by my supervisor that not all UHS facilities were as bad as ours, so when I moved I took a job at another one, trusting the situation would be better. It was far, far worse. ""Service Excellence"" was used as a bullying tactic by administration when you expressed any level of dissent. Understaffing is so horrible that nurses have been expected to do their job as well as that of a tech, taking acute patients by themselves with no support. Team Support requests would go unanswered until it escalated to a full code. Hourly workers would be relentlessly pressured to clock out on time, regardless of what work needed to be finished, then would be written up the next day for incomplete paperwork. People have been denied leave requests after the death of family members. Hard fast policies regarding medical acuity have been overruled by administration simply because a patient has good insurance, even though we can't accommodate the patient comfortably. Doctors have been strong-armed into accepting patients who lack acuity, just because they have good insurance. Over the last few months, I've asked repeat patients why they come back, and they always say something to the effect of how nice it"
bad,"Appealed medical claims for level of care, authorizations and medical necessity. Required production standard. One year expected to work 150-200 claims per week. Managers did not know how to do our work or understand problems with insurance companies."
bad,This is a horrible company.  Stay away! Upper management doesn't know how to work and will trample all over everyone in order to get their budgets met.  Most co-workers are trying really hard despite overwhelming odds. Not a safe place for your family members!
bad,"Great multidisciplinary staff, however, managerial staff has caused many of nursing staff to leave as well as low morale amongst those who continue to work units. Staffed for census only without acuity being considered, resulting in injured staff and lack of time to complete work within scheduled shift.  The best skills shown by management is backstabbing and ridiculing.  Clearly the company is driven by profit margins and not caring for patients!"
bad,"Minimal support and feedback.  Even as a leader in the company, you still have minimal amount of feedback, support and decision making abilities."
good,"There is a strong corporate culture,a commitment to excellence and a collaborative team environment at UHS. It is a company anyone should feel proud to be affiliated with."
bad,"I worked at NorthStar for over a year. Most of the new recruits, don't even make it through the first week of orientation, let alone out on the floor. Short staffed ALL the time. Scheduler will tell you to ""Have your game on."" when you are short staffed. Sometimes left understaffed on the floor with 24 hostile kids at a time. Never feel safe, since the kids are allowed to hit, kick, bite, spit, smack, or shove you a few times before they can be consequenced. It was a good starting job, but if you are looking for something long term, this isn't the place."
bad,"A lot of egos which do not allow you to accomplish the greater good, which is helping the children."
bad,UHS has great work/life balance but the culture sucks. Its a silo community and it isn't encouraged to reach out to people and make connections. This organization is more suited to the Senior Management.
bad,"Horrible management; all employees are paid vastly different wages ($10-18) even with the same experience, schooling and/or skill levels; always in a staffing shortage; constant mandated shifts and working short; management purposely tries to find your mistakes to get you fired, and will change policies without notice in order to do so; managers bring their children to staff meetings; no communication between management and staff; all employees/management/administrators sleep around with eachother; never feel valued as an employee. The job can be rewarding at times due to patient interaction and working the floor."
bad,"Love working with children. there is both and acute and residential units. Many great staff work for Universal Health Services, enough good things cannot be said about them"
bad,"See title and heed my warning. You will work hard and you will be compensated minimally for it. If your looking for part time work, there are easier ways to make money. Look there!"
bad,UHS has a couple facilities in Washington.  A lot of staff members are fantastic.  There can be delicious free food.  We have great technology.  Some employees are cross-trained in departments.
bad,I had gained vast knowledge/experience working with the HIV/AIDS population and the Dept. of Health gains at defeating this virus.
bad,Care is merely given by what administration allows. Cleanliness is lacking. Housekeeping is bareboned and obsolete. Staff has been ran over by one set of administration to the next but expects to keep perfect mindset while being degraded for small mistakes. Horrible environment. Horrible name in community.
bad,"Company run strictly by the numbers. No heart, no employee and customer service. Heartless and no strategic mission. Job culture is poor. Management needs a new look and focus."
bad,Constantly short-staffed and the program on different units was run poorly.  The patient's do not get the care that they are entiteled to due to the lack of staff because your entire shift is spent doing safety rounds which leaves no time to actually assist the patient;s in the support they need.
bad,The units are grossly unstaffed and the hospital does not comply with mandatory staffing ratios in California which is resulting in unsafe patient care. There is little time to be therapeutic with patients because the admission rate can vary from at least 2 to 5  admissions a shift per unit. The admissions department has non medical staff making decisions about accepting patients with medical issues and they have a disregard for ensuring the facility can meet the medical needs because they are only focused on how many beds are full. Admissions also has no regard for patient or staff safety because they admit very violent patients despite units being at bare minimum staffing ratio or being understaffed. Management tries to hire staff but they leave faster than new ones can be oriented so it never improves. They are notorious for staffing 1 nurse and 1 tech on a 18 bed unit at night and expecting another unit to break relief one another.
bad,"Great people, love helping patients, pay very low, high turnover in several areas, don't see advancement much.  The people for the most part a great to work with.  Most have a real calling for the work they do.  Coworkers will be there to help you, cover for you when you are off and begin to feel like a family after awhile"
bad,"No work-from-home availability or flexibility with schedule, people aren't particularly happy or friendly but not a lot of pressure there."
bad,Challenging place to work. Great employees.Very large company with many demands and expectations.Production almost impossible to achieve and little to no training. Best part of the job is when you have spent many hours on a claim and to finally see it paid.
bad,"Stressful environment, hard to enjoy working while having to meet demand or answer for not meeting demand of 60 accounts a day."
good,"There is a strong corporate culture,a commitment to excellence and a collaborative team environment at UHS. It is a company anyone should feel proud to be affiliated with."
bad,difficult place to work for. co-workers are not client focused nor is administration. huge company focused on money more than the individuals that they are supposed to be caring for.
bad,I learned a lot of first hand knowledge regarding dealing with individuals with various mental health issues.
bad,Staff are not all treated equally. Administration plays favorites and bends the rules for certain staff.  There are several lead techs that are unprofessional that you have to work with.  Management overlooks what they want to overlook.  Certain staff are promoted to positions that they do not have the qualifications for.
bad,This position is great for someone that been in an ACFO program.
good,A typical day was being on the phone from 8am until 5pm dealing with angry customers complaining and requesting a refund because of a bad product. My co-workers and supervisor was a delight to work with. Everyone was so helpful.
good,"A typical day at my job would consist of meeting several staff on the unit. Making sure residents complete their ADL's. Escort the resident's to school and hope for a great day. I learned TCI while working at the Universal Health Service/Pavilion Foundation School. I also learned how to work under pressure while dealing with challenging residents. I learned how to decrease certain behaviors and how to manage them. I enjoyed working with the majority of my co-workers. The hardest thing about working at Universal Health Service/Pavilion Foundation School was having to place residents in restraints and isolating them into the quiet lounge. What I enjoyed most about being a TA was the student's and my classroom. I worked in a FLS class which is a challenge but it takes a person with a lot of patience, commitment, and dedicated to work there; that is what I enjoyed most!"
good,This is a good start for someone right out of college with a degree in psychology or related field.There id not much room for promotion depending on position applied for.
good,"It can be a successful place, but there is a lack of accountability and consistency. I am under the current stress not knowing if I am going to have a job today or tomorrow. They say they are concerned about the employees, but make a decision based upon what they want (management). They have a high turn over rate and don't care about the behind the scene workers."
good,The Newport News Behavioral Health Center is a great place to work for those who enjoy working with at risk youth.  The job is very hands-on and any Mental Health Worker rapidly will learn much about the field.
good,"This was a spin off from patient care technologies that I was force to move to or loose my job. It was frequent travel, low pay and owned by one person."
good,This program is now closed. This is were I learned how to case manage. I worked with many interties while here and learned many things. The biggest down fall was that we sent girls back into situation that were not good.
good,"Pay too much for not enough health and dental benefits. "
good,"Lack of support, pressure to admit, frequent turnover in staff ; Uncertainty of programming. Great co-workers but the company allows condescending comments/threats to employees."
good,No comment . It's a Start up wity high turnover in leadership and department representative which leaves a not so good feeling of job sevurity. Advancement or growth.
good,"very little corporate support, zero department guidelines, no leadership or direction. At one point, I had worked 47 days in a row and the HR manager could have cared less."
good,In order to make a descent salary you must work cray hours. If the management/Admin was more respectful to their employees it may be worth it. I definitely felt unappreciated
good,"There is a strong corporate culture,a commitment to excellence and a collaborative team environment at UHS. It is a company anyone should feel proud to be affiliated with."
good,Working at UHS I learned so much but it was an environment that was very stressful because of the pressure you were on to take a certain amount of calls per hour.  At times it was all about the numbers and not about making sure the callers questions were answered.   I must say I worked with some very smart and caring people that really was helpful and motivational during some very tough days.   I think this company can really be a great place to work if management only would listen to the workers.
good,"It was very long ago,I remember just learning reel to reel sage computer system,and I learned about the coffee roasting business."
good,"Dual function as Director/RD, there were no dull moment."
good,"Let go only halfway into probation period with no explanation, but that I did not do my rounds correctly!  NO EXPLANATION!!  NO warning!!  Blacks run whites off!!"
good,"I work nights.and I completes my rounds"
good,"Always looking for ways to improve patient and staff satisfaction. But very little follow up. Continued problems with staffing and accountability. Rapid turnover in staff, and administration"
good,Filled with strange and difficult to work with people that made every day a dread. Very hard to focus as a writer working in a huge cube farm. Just a number in a big Fortune 500 company. I did however learn a lot about digital strategy from my boss.
good,This is a good company to gain entry level experience into a healthcare environment. Some departments are better than others. Its a fairly new company in the healthcare field compared to other companies. Overall its a pretty good starter job but I wouldn't advised long term unless your a manager.
good,i worked there for 4 years and overall enjoyed it. the staff was easy to work with
good,"easy job, not busy but benefit is not good. you will have to use leave time for all public vocation time."
good,Not a bad position if you are out of college. Compensation is ok but  not enough for the time sacrifice the manager ask. The manager tends to over stress and passes that stress onto his workers in phone conversations. You can become frustrated with scheduling very easily. Seem to always work underman. Some positive people in they are but hard to find. Good job if independence is desired.
good,Working at Universal Health Systems allowed me to advance from an entry level position as a collection assistant to a medicare biller.  I appreciate the experience and was able to provide for my family during the duration of employment.  It was an interesting experience of which I  Iearned self discipline and codes of conduct and compliance although it was not always enforced.
good,The Management didn't care about  their staff or patients until time for survey and that is when they want to act concern or even show their face----------------------------------
good,This job was fast pace and the training was very minimum to none. I had to learn most of the job by trail and error and teach myself. My teammates were awesome and we worked together to get the job done. We would go above and beyond to help each other out as much as possible so everyone succeed.
good,I am looking for an opportunity to create a more effective work/life balance. Universal Health Services has put me in a situation that throws out the work/life balance.
good,Rivendell is a safe therapeutic work environment that ensures the safety of the patients and employees
good,"There is a strong corporate culture,a commitment to excellence and a collaborative team environment at UHS. It is a company anyone should feel proud to be affiliated with."
good,High administrative and direct staff turnover - little sense of direction. Lots of corporate oversite with little to minimal resources - budget biggest priority
good,"In Orlando, the pay was decent and was funded and properly staffed. In New Orleans, the pay was very low and environment was dangerous. At times being the only male in the entire hospital."
good,All about the bottom dollar and management sticks together and never mind the regular employees. They need to listen more to the people that actually does the work/job. That way everyone can be on the same page and really good employees like myself would stay. I truly love my line of work and would hate to leave.
good,"There is a lot of opportunity for growth within this company. Fast pace growth, but results in being compensated on the lower end of the pay scale with low merit increases."
good,"I was assigned to manage the Affordable Care Act, BPCI (Medicare Bundled program), and Value Based Contracting for 30+ hospitals.  A typical day was interacting with Medicare, consultants and hospital constituents on a daily basis."
good,"As a technician you day can vary, depending on which unit (child, adolescent, adult) you're sent to work on. You end up gaining a lot of experience working with different patient populations. If you like a consistent work environment you won't appreciate it, but if you like change then you will. You won't see much of the management, since you'll be busy helping patients. The other technicians are good at their jobs and are nice enough to teach the ropes to someone new. The hardest part and easiest part is simultaneously the patients; when you have a lot of ""bad"" patients come in you'll be extremely busy and your patience will be tested. The job can definitely be mentally fatiguing. On the flip side, those patients that genuinely seem to get better and turn their life around will make you feel good, like you're really making a difference."
good,Upper management smiles at your face and stabs you in the back. all they think about is their numbers!!!! Work with some nice people.
good,Working nights has it's pros but it also has its cons. It's a good company to work for as a 1st job. It's a good learning experience. The hardest part of the job is when the residents start to act out and there aren't enough staff to help out.
good,"Handle inbound calls from Agents regarding issues involving member's benefits, agent's commissions and certifications."
good,"I was hired and the A/R days were 175. No one could tell me what they were during the interview process. (BIG RED FLAG) I was young and green...I was just looking for a job to support my growing family. The previous CFO went to lunch and never came back. (ANOTHER BIG RED FLAG) The Business Office was a mess., It took me about a year to get the A/R days to 80 and that was without writing off to bad debt. Well, not all of it that is. Eventually, we were known as the cash cow of the southern region. (Their term not mine.) Working there now? I would love it but then...no I was way too green to take on that kind of mess. However, I endured it and made the best of it and made tons of contacts that would later help me down the road in my own consulting business."
good,UHS is a great place to work if you are not looking to advance within the company.  The co-workers know their jobs well and have all been in there same positions for years.
good,"For the most part, the company was a good place to work. A lot of the advancement opportunities seemed to be afforded to people that were not the most appropriate person for the position, but rather leaned more towards something similar to either a buddy system or sucking up."
good,The hours work was hard on family life. I will decline to answer most of the questions in reference to upper management. The staff was great and needed good leadership. The pay was good and so was the benefits. The best part of the job was the satisfaction of helping the youth.
good,"The company has many positives but definitely has some culture issues which has led to employees not feeling supported and leaving. However, some departments do not have the overshadowing culture issues."
good,"This is an unsafe place to work, or to be a patient. The company only cares about money, not their staff or patients. While working in Ocala , Fla, the Vines Hospital, there were two sentinel events involving the same patient, the last one resulted in her death. The company's solution was to add more paper work, not staff."
good,"The job is community based so having an open mind to work with all of the population in mental is expected. Being able to communicate, organize and having a good rapport with people."
good,"I have been working here for 8 years now and there is no place such this place. It is an unique environment that provides many things such as rope course, rock wall, movie theater, exercise room, kitchen, art room, game room and a swimming pool. I work with variety of populations from children to adults, with different disabilities and backgrounds. I have utmost respect for all the residents I work with and all the staff. Despite of the place closing, I will never have a bitter feeling towards this place. This has been a rewarding and positive journey."
good,"While I love the clients and what I do here, I am looking for something more challenging.  When I was hired in December of 2014, I was told that the position would be full time (40 hours) within a few months.  Unfortunately, a year plus later, I am still only a part-time employee and am looking for full-time work and something more challenging."
good,"My typical day at work is when having a distinctive member, I've learned to operate the telephone with a professional manner and communicate with ease with clients on a personal and professional level, my superior are the most sweetest people who knows how to treat people,the hardest part is when i can not resolve the issues of the members and the most enjoyable part is talking to different people with different matters and solving the issue."
good,"There is a strong corporate culture,a commitment to excellence and a collaborative team environment at UHS. It is a company anyone should feel proud to be affiliated with."
good,"Company takes your needs into account, lots of great exposure to different types of projects. Office has a great location outside of the city with lunch cafeteria onsite."
good,"If you are looking to wear many hats, and gain experience, this is the job for you. Most positions requiring education are very, very stable, wear many hats, and do a variety of work. Very busy,"
good,An environment where learning and communication is encouraged. Several fun activities to create a sense of community.
good,I loved being able to help patients get back up on their feet. The management does not keep the staff and patients best interests at heart and the moral of the company has come down. There is no balance to work and home life and they expect work to come before your family.
good,Working at a 5 hospital system provides opportunity for lateral moves and advancement. Current trends in the community (i.e. Las Vegas economy) have created significant challenges with a higher population of uninsured clients. The most difficult part of the job is having to perform quality work with less and less resources. The most enjoyable part of the job is the commitment of co-workers to try and come together to maximize our efforts.
good,This company encouraged learning and developing personal and professional skills.
good,"It is a perfect job for people who are in their pre retirement mode, very comfortable and cozy if you don't aspire to grow."
good,"Decent organization for to work. A typical you are very productive. I utilized several different system. Management is okay. Workplace is very diverse, challenging and a very busy environment. Nothing difficult about the work. The people are very helpful and pleasant."
good,"The Customer Support Center coordinator position is very easy. The information is easy to retain and the compensation/ benefits are wonderful. "
good,Must be able to multi/task and be able to work overtime when asked. Must be punctual as this affects the percent of your yearly raise and review.  The best part of the day is when I clock out at 4:30pm.
good,I love being a surgical tech. I still enjoy going to work daily. I am exploring all my assets in the job market and think I would like to travel to me me a better surgical technologiest. I love helping people and work well with most.
good,Informative and productive department. It is an okay place to work for. Great charities they work with and a lot of smiling faces. When you meet goal they sometimes allow a whole month of jeans instead of business casual dress.
good,"In the event that you are up for the test then UHS is the employment for you. Extraordinary open door anticipates a balanced person who has charging, accumulations, coding, bookkeeping, and so on encounter"
good,I enjoyed the daily challenges and felt a great value was given . Professionalism and true caring for the mission was evident in the weekly update meetings.
good,"Working at UHS is really an awesome experience especially f you get to work in an awesome team. Salary sucks and no work from home but apart from those, UHS is really an awesome place"
good,"Residential treatment center for teens.  Workplace culture is pretty laid back.  Do what is expected of you and follow protocol, and you can move up into supervisory role."
good,"This job is what you make of it. Fast paced and can be intimidating at first; however, with time the job is easy to learn/master.  Staff here is extremely helpful if you are willing to put forth the effort in the job.  This job is teamwork oriented and can really make your work day easier when dealing with patient needs.  I found this job rewarding when working with the patients and the staff.   If your seeking patient experience or interested in the healthcare field, you would most certainly improve your skill set here and possibly give insight on future career goals.   The only real downside I have found with this job is your underpaid for what you do.  Everyone has their bad days but as mentioned before it is what you make of it and if you work with your team and get what needs done, things can run smoothly."
good,Day to day it is a very stressful job you are QA'd everyday you have very little to no time to accomplish the tasks that you have to do.  If you do not learn your job at the timeframe that they expect you too which is impossible the leads and supervisors pick on you.  There has been several employees that has left because of the team lead who is not professional and is very rude and mean.
good,"There is a strong corporate culture,a commitment to excellence and a collaborative team environment at UHS. It is a company anyone should feel proud to be affiliated with."
good,"No day is the same at Universal Health Services. Some days are great, some not so great, but as a team - we make it through! I love how friendly most people are, and the management team is very hands on - it's overall a fun place to work!"
good,many knowledgable people with a lot of information to learn. Good atmosphere and the people are really great. had a great experience working there.
good,Loved my coworkers and Administration. Department Directors Terrible....to focused on themselves and getting what they want rather the focusing on the patients and their staff.
good,Daily we work through emdeon to process professional fees.  We have to work all claim edits and process the claims by 11 am.  I have learned several things such as how to process claims as accurately and efficiently so claims will be processed by the insurance company's.  I also work correspondences daily so claims can be processed on a timely manner.
good,I worked as a Financial Counselor at the Mens center. I enjoyed what i did to the fullest. Loved my co-workers and all of my Patients. I really really lined it a lot. They are in the beginning phases of making some very needed changes that will be very positive. I have no complaints and loved both my Business Team and my Mens Center team. I chose go leave due to financial hardships of my own. No personal reasons or dislikes of my job. I will miss them dearly.
good,"Perfect for Future graduates who majored in Information/ Healthcare  technology, Networking, or any IT background. They pay pretty well, but the work load can be quite heavy, after some months you will consider the offer you took. Depending on the depart meant, your days here can be pretty smooth."
good,Have to have the stomach to see and smells the things you do. A lot of cleaning  and walking. Boredom will set in due to the lack of work at times.
good,I've worked here for nine years.  I love the people I work with and I would stay but there is no room for advancement.  This job does not provide any benefits except for vacation.
good,This is a skilled facility that has 95+ residents. There is residents with dementia to total care. Most of staff work as a team and help each other out.
good,"Expect to work 55-60 hours per week if you are a Therapist, as your responsibilities are endless and your caseload is heavy."
good,Some very good people at UHS. Large employer provides stable job. Good place to get experience. Depending upon location growth potential may be limited.
good,relay loved job. manager wasn't easiest person to talk to. lord forbid you needed off to take care of a personal situation he would have a heart attack. just wan ted you to be t work and never have to have a personal issue you needed to resolve outside work. otherwise I loved job

The culture of the job varied just with the kids coming from different backgrounds and having different medical diagnosis. The hardest part of the job would honestly be management. Employees weren't always considered in certain situations. Also, the job has children with behavioral complications, so with, that could be considered the ""hard part"" of the job.

good,"Overall, UHS is a nice company to work for and treats employees well. My main issue is that they are traditional and should adapt to allow remote work! They are slowly adapting to modern times. I worked in office writing copy, and there were times when I wouldn't see anyone on my team for days while working in the same office because I was seated elsewhere. Yet they had serious concerns with remote work. I think they could attract and retain younger talent if they offered flex/remote options after a preliminary period (once they gain trust). I worked remote on some snow days, which shows progress! The old-school, cubicle office is a little depressing. Otherwise, I think it's a nice company!"

good,"The overall Company was very great. I enjoyed going to work (when I was called) The office stand point was very welcoming. However, the department stand point especially the dietary department was very unprofessional.  I started out under the impression  that I'll be fulltime.. Well atleast thats what I was told in my interview but, when I start working I was told I was PRN I only worked 4 hours a day and that everyone who's hired start out as PRN.  I was trained for 2 weeks. Once my training was over  I was told I wasn't needed so I didn't work for 2 weeks straight. However, the 2 other people l started with was getting 40+ hours. I was called back to work. I worked maybe three good weeks then once again I was told by the Kitchen Manager that the Supervisor took me off the schedule until further noticed will in my case until one of the employees left for surgery then I would be able to get 40 hours a week. Once I was called back to fill in for that employee I was not granted those 40 hours, I barley got 30 hours. Ironically, once I got a new Job I was being blamed for not cleaning up after my shift when that should have been the least of their problems. The problem should have been how the Kitchen Manager was taking food for personal use or how the other kitchen staff was getting drunk and not showing up to work but was never fired."
