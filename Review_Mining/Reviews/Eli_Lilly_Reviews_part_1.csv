bad,"This is the type of company that unless you're there 10 years or longer your prior work experience doesn't seem to count towards posting for other opportunities. The management culture there is dishonest and untrustworthy. Manager will tell you not to worry about it and then bring it up on your field ride report or end of the year review. As Lilly tries to break into the biotech world and they stick to their internal talent pool much of the time senior leadership, marketing, field positions and access and reimbursement done the positions before  and therefore  continually make errors and when things go wrong  it's always somebody else's fault . positions are filled with people that have never"
bad,The only concern of Eli Lily is profit! They use people as if they are dispensable.  Poor training. Hiring more temps all the time. You will regret working for this company!!
bad,"Nothing good is to come of working here. Deliver pizzas, spin around a brass pole a few times—anything is better than working for this company. If I were to make a list of the worst people I’d met in my life, 90% of them would be Lilly employees."
bad,"All talk and no action.  Management will ride you till you die."
bad,The Workplace culture is very poor. The hardest part of the job is dealing with incompetent management. There aren't any enjoyable aspects of the job.
bad,"Very little chance of promotion and personal development. "
bad,Great job for whoever want to learn on tav\blet machines loved it wher should I strt loved it worked there through a job agaency in Puerto rico  I loved working with them
bad,"Also, worst application process on planet Earth. Redundant questions that literally repeated themselves 3 or more times. Extremely time consuming and felt like I was applying for a kids job like it was the early 2000's"
bad,The hardest part of this job is they tell you they will hire you on if you show up on time and do the work etc. but in reality they wil luse you you for as long as possible.
bad,"Eli Lilly is a great company and very well managed.  I would worked with this company again.  "
bad,I hope they treat their employees better than they do their contractors.  Spent two years there and it got worse every day. Contractors weren’t even allowed to park in lots near the building they worked in- had to walk almost a mile from parking to office no matter the weather.
bad,"Company has really gone downhill over the last few years "
bad,"Empresa totalmente hierarquizada, com líderes que não valorizam seus funcionários e muitas vezes os humilham ou sobrecarregam de trabalho. Total desvalorização do estagiário."
bad,Reading some of the reviews previously posted it is obvious that there aren't too many lowly warehouse workers writing reviews but I am one of them. I was hired @ Lilly in July of 2011 through a contract service. I have a blemish on my record but I fully disclosed that information to the contracting service. I still got the job and continued to work up until Feb 2012. I had a chance to better myself and go for an FDE position with Lilly. Even though I had worked there for 7 months I still had to do an interview and go through the whole hiring process. I did great in the interview and received a call that I got the job the only thing they needed now was an application faxed and I would be an employee finally. So I filled out the same type of application and gave the exact same information and I was fired the same day. They said it was about ethics but how ethical do you think I felt after I had been nothing but truthful from the begininng and a very hard worker?! Not very. But now I'm stuck unemployed and have about a hundred dollars left to my name so yeah...THANKS LILLY!
bad,"The manufacturing side of this company is NOT the same Lilly everyone raves about. SUCH a huge disappointment. If you are a single mom in mfg forget about it, you'll never make it. No flexibility and if you have the misfortune of getting sick and calling in, even with medical documentation, you will be constantly threatened with losing your job. There is a reason why this company is not the top pharma company lol.. it is all in who you know and not how hard you work...much the same model I saw when I worked as a contractor in R and D. Some people have it really good here, it is really just luck of the draw, but I have never been treated so poorly in any job and I have been in the industry for almost 20 years. I can't wait to see this place in my rearview mirror for the last time. I should have listened to others who worked on the mfg side who had similar experiences. Good luck.."
bad,company does not provide job security or a work/life balance.  it is expected to work over 40 hours; upper management does not provide support or guidance to employees but worries only about their career path; would not recommend as an employment option
bad,This was  my first CRA job and I had a wonderful time learning the role of a CRA.  I was able to learn about different therapeutic areas.   I was also engaged in covering for my manager doing here vacation.
bad,"This is the WORST company I've ever worked for. I would not recommend this corporate environment to anyone I like. The Departmental Managers often have very little training or education, yet they have many who have much more education reporting to them. Unless you like to be a follower, unless you are a ""Yes"" man and agree to idiotic ideas, I advise that you look into a much more promising company that values family, military, work/life balance and your efforts."
bad,Was once a pretty good company.
bad,Full of meetings. Very collaborative. A lot of turnover. A very large company with a distributed management structure. A lot of field personnel who occasionally came for meetings to HQ.
bad,They have no respect for people. You will be consistently blocked for promotions or posting on positions at other sites. They do not value experience or hard-workers. They only value certain degrees from certain Universities. They pick and choose who to promote and who to hold back based on popularity. I wouldn't go back there if they were the last company on the planet.
bad,"Extremely stressful, toxic environment."
bad,"Excellent computer skills, soft skills, & communication skills both written and verbal.  Looking for a part-time position with some flexibility.  I worked in training & development, and also as admin. assistant.  Enjoy learning new skills,"
bad,"Younger workers are allowed to do homework, snap chat, play games on their phone, watch cartoons, face book, you tube, gossip, or whatever they want to do.  Opinions of older workers with a work ethics are dismissed as old fashioned and irrelevant."
bad,If you wish to work for Eli Lilly I would suggest moving to Indianapolis because the New York site is treating poorly. We are not provided the same privileges and only just received permanent desk after 8 years at the current site.
bad,"Alot of loyal employees lost their jobs with Lilly due to lack of good management and good judgement. Lilly could have offered the employee opinions like taking a pay cut or droping their insurance, before kicking them out the door. I put in alot of years not to memtion hours for nothing. It's been over one year and nothing. This is a company that waste money like water, wow. The company won""t make it ..."
bad,"Indisposizione all'insegnamento, Non affidabilità sulle informazioni trasmesse. Mancanza di trasparenza."
bad,Good entry level Pay but no advancement opportunities. Very political. Jobs are given as favors not based on qualifications. Great benefit package once you're permanent. Management team is very inexperienced which  makes daily task very difficult.
bad,"Lilly's environment and culture has deteriorated particularly in the past 7 years. Many have left there because of this. The last 2 years was especially difficult because I dreaded going to work."
bad,"This wasn't a very good place to work. The management didn't engage with their employees, were rude, and expected you to learn something new the first time it was taught. They didn't like suggestions on ways to improve processes. They hold company events and if you are a contractor they exclude them."
bad,Empresa ótima para se trabalhar. Uma das melhores. Colegas de trabalho unidos e sempre dispostos a ajudar.
bad,"A very tedious day, not up to date with cGMP, will not listen to experienced people, a lot of temporary people running plants, management are not interested in listening to Temporary people, they are not treated with respect, as this is supposed to be a Lilly value !"
bad,"In this project, I basically need to support various Ubuntu Servers, which Hosts various ELI LILLY websites which are responsible their Marketing and sales websites."
bad,I was only at Lilly for a year and had 3 different district managers.  It was like a carousel.  Very poor management training.  The acted as if they had a chip on their shoulder.
bad,"No Respect for employee, No respect to Diversity.  Individual from different Diversity suffers and humiliate by People who are from American origin. Surrounding is humiliating people."
bad,A typical day at work - expected.  You are required to do what is expected of you. That some times could be 8 hours or 10 hours depending upon whether it is the first of the month or the end of the month.
bad,"Management is way below par"
bad,"Empresa Dinamica e agradável de Trabalhar"
bad,"Lack of transparency in transferring KB. Lazy and fool micromanagement. Company is populating  kind of ""human care"" while never minding about employees  "
bad,Slow sample rate makes the job easy. High degree of cGMP knowledge in this company. Management was nice but not always experienced. Coworkers were fantastic. The job did drag on due to slow sample rates. People were great and knowledge of staff was quite extesive
bad,Unless you are a relative you will not advance. You will require a PHD while a relative of any employee will only have a GED. If you know more than your boss they become easily intimidated (and you will). The worst culture of any job that I have ever had. The rules change based on managements feelings for that particluar day. Please read glassdoor reviews before making the mistake of joining this company.
bad,20 years ago was a great place. Now management is rewarded for taking away anything they can to save   Money. New employees don’t get a retirement they took that away 10 years ago.
bad,The culture is created organically or through deliberate and consistent planning and action. The organization understand their own culture and take careful steps to manage and promote it effectively.
bad,"Plan to leave in 5-7 years.  Long term employment is less valued than in the past."
bad,"Retention of staff is a major issue and management can not make the necessary improvements."
bad,"No Diversity at this workplace. managers play favoritism and only promote those they like. "
bad,"a typical day at work will depend on your routing plan, you're required to visit at least 12 clients per day. While working for the company, I have learned to be be flexible and adaptable to the different circumstances that may arise within the day. The supervisors needs further training on people management although the workplace culture is fair. The hardest part of the job is that there is no work life balance and job advancement takes a long and tedious process before you get promoted. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you're able to meet different clients per day where you get to develop your communication skills."
bad,Corporate America at its finest.  Just drink coffee do your best and try not to bring the day home with you.  Some of the supervisor's need management classes.
bad,"I don't play ping pong.  Stress, more stress.  The general feeling was that a person must make themselves look better by making someone else look worse.  "
bad,"I was hired on for an 18 month contract but it was finished in 4 months. They have great training in place but the way you get treated there, as a contractor is not anything to brag about. I felt like a second class citizen. Gyms were only for employees so contractors could watch through the glass but could not use the facility. I was very impressed with how well the training was organized and presented. I learned a lot while I was there."
bad,"C'è una forte differenza fra chi ha il lavoro stabile - ipergarantito e pieni di benefit - e una vasta popolazione di precari, interinali e soprattutto lavoratori in appalto (attraverso coop, società di servizi o a partita iva) a cui è demandato quasi tutto il lavoro operativo in tutti i reparti . La tendenza è quella di usare fin dove possibile i tempi determinati senza confermare se non in pochi casi e di esternalizzare il grosso delle attività pagando meno chi le esegue. L'ambiente è molto ovattato, tutti sono molto gentili e accomodanti dando l'impressione di essere fortunato anche se appartieni alla seconda categoria di lavoratori: nessuno è fino in fondo cosciente di questa ineguaglianza e di questo velato ""sfruttamento"""
bad,"Company loyalty non-existant. Inept upper managent, due to constant turnover, leads to poor decision making. Middle management generally toes the corporate line."
bad,"Manager was inexperienced and didn't back up his employees. When other employees where given the opportunity to take early retirement, it just meant more work for the remaining folks even though executives and upper management said it would not."
bad,Very unstable environment with the reduction of 3800 employees.  Changes daily to the work process that make life more difficult.  CDAs (Clinical Data Associates) at Lilly are actually project managers since project managers no longer exist on Lilly studies. I have a $6000 deductible on my insurance that doesn't really cover anything.
bad,During the one year I have worked in Eli Lilly I have faced some troubles as sometimes they did not strict to company policy. I think they have to review again their way of thinking.
bad,"NIce company to work. Comfortable enviroment, but not good at creating opportunities for an employee to grow."
bad,Worked through contract firm.  Treated like a second class person.  Management was offended when I expressed  interest in direct placement even though my contract firm had worked out a deal where there would be no cost to me if I was hired direct.  One manager with no power to hire told me he would like to hire me direct in order to get me to fill in for someone on vacation.  It paid well but not worth the hassle of not knowing if your contract will be renewed until the last minute.
bad,"I've worked for the company for over 15 years and have seen a lot of changes, more bad than good. The area that i worked in was caring less about the people  every year, which showed in promotions,raises, etc. One truly bad characteristic of the area i worked was that you were less likely to get advancement opportunities if you were good at your job."
bad,Contract Position - FMEA on new equipment validation.  Eli Lilly employees had strong tendency to look down on contract employees.  Not a show stopper.
bad,Terrible hours in the production side. CEO out of touch with what is going on outside of his office. Co-workers would rather talk about you than to you.
bad,The company took from April to June to get me my first paycheck and when they did most financial institutions would not cash it because the bank that issued the check was considered unstable.  It was a revolving door of management and I'm pretty sure it was based in India since everyone that worked directly for SpectraForce had an Indian accent.
bad,i was contracted through waste management. The pay for what I was doing was not so great. I was around hazardous chemicals everyday which wasn't healthy.
bad,It has been a learning experience till date with scope of upgrading my own knowledge grow both technically and professionally
bad,"Compensation for performance was wonderful. Corporate Center was a great place to be and wonderful people there. Opportunity for growth and development, not consistent."
bad,"Working day starts with several meetings (process team, staff meeting) after which i work with my team in several laboratory issues and initiatives, coordinate with several functions for business continuity (production, quality and engineering)."
bad,Management expected processors to work overtime everyday.  Majority of processors worked 10 to 12 hours a day.  This work schedule conflicted with my personal life.
bad,"home health aide who did all personal care, wound care, errands, meds, cooking and light housework"
bad,"Around '95 culture changed. Employees no longer considered valuable or as assets but expendable. Contracted out nearly everything. No job security, no raises, pigeon holed in positions, executive leader ship got richer but rank and file employees got poorer. Executive leadership gave themselves raises and salary froze everyone else. Company became very unethical in business practices resulting in billion dollar lawsuits. Glad I got my 20+ in and got out so I ha e a pension and 40 1k. Company now sucks."
bad,"always stay busy, training is ongoing. Job is meaningful. Makes a difference to in the patients lives that we serve each and everyday. very talented employees throughout"
bad,"A empresa que entrei em 2000, não existe mais. Não há equilíbrio entre vida profissional e vida pessoal."
bad,monitoreo de centros de investigacion clinica y manejo de asuntos regulatorios
bad,"Great company for a new employee; or someone with a young family."
bad,The company is undergoing transformation.  Very chaotic/stressful.  My new manager seems to only want folks reporting to her that will do what they are told and not express differing views.
bad,"bad manager let the reps make decisions he should have made, reps were forced ranked so you were competing against your teammates instead of competing reps from other companies"
bad,I was willing to learn and help out where it was needed. I worked as a team player.  I put in a few suggestions that were used to help make the production line run easier. I put a B-safe in at least once a month sometimes 2 in a month.  I loved the job I was doing and wanted to learn more.
bad,"The job was not bad; however I had a very poor manager.  While his manager said I did an excellent job by catching some errors that could have potentially caused a recall, the immediate manager took it personal and made my life miserable."
bad,"The ultimate in corporate beaurocracy.  Good pay, good vacation, good benefits.  A million levels of management.   No one advances to what they're really capable of until higher personel retire.  Management has no clue what really goes on in lower ranks.  incompetent employees abound."
bad,"A typical day at Lilly is sitting in a flexible open environmentpositivies messages throughout the buidling. Family focused environment and thankful I worked with the company when my kids were toddlers.  Co-workers are multi-cultural  and most are highly intellgent. Captalizing on the diversity allows diverse thinking and its a win/win for all parties involved.  The hardest part of the job is working in an industry of a changing environment and watching top talent leave due to not being in the right position. Management varies and if you have a great leader, you never want them to leave."
bad,"very tough environment , not a friendly one, very bureaucratic"
bad,Imclone was a great company to work for awhile back till Eli lilly bought out imclone.
bad,"Typical pharma sales gig. Not the worst in the industry, but not the best either."
bad,The culture here seemed to treat consultants like outsiders. Very good exclusive which was not good for collaboration. The regular employees seemed content though.
bad,Throughout my time at Eli Lilly I have felt very under appreciated as an employee. The management is very removed from any process and does not understand the impact of the decisions that they make.
bad,"seems to be unstable at the current time.  cutbacks occurring all through 2017,  proceed with caution.  resulting in more work for remaining workforce"
bad,"Its not what you know its who you know. If you are not apart of the ""In"" Crowd you will not advance. A lot of backstabbing and People talking behind your back even management."
bad,People get promoted over people that actually deserved it. I was told you start at the bottom and work your way up. Now that's NOT true at all as they hire new people making a lot more money than you do because there isn't a union. They promote who they want. If you have a mom or dad working in the company you'll be fine you'll succeed with promotions and have a great salary nobody watches your back but you. So good luck making it on your own.
bad,"Employees and executive leadership are sincere in their desire to make lives better through medical research and advancement. "
bad,I don't think working through a third party vendor was a good experience for me.
bad,"If you are a full time employee, I've heard it is great.  Contract work did not place me an environment I enjoyed."
bad,"multinazionale, sedi lavorative non stabili se ci sono joint venture"
bad,"flexible schedule but no benefits whatsoever."
good,"long hours"
good,Not worth it; save your time and apply elsewhere.  Good orientation but nothing offered as a FTE only contract work....and do not think you are safe from being let go before contract.
good,At my level we are held back and can’t advance.  They cut people but won’t let people advance who have been doing the job     But no money is coming there way.   Very much on who u know
good,L'Azienda sarebbe un buonissimo posto dove lavorare ma hanno iniziato ad assumere il personale con contratti di somministrazione tendendo a stabilizzare sempre meno i dipendenti.
good,"The management for their IT Security team was much less than that.  The atmosphere for a contract employee was degrading at best.  I would never recommend them for a contract employee.  I do understand that the do take care of their full time employees much better.  But with that said, I would never work for them again, even if offered a full time employee."
good,A good place to be a scientist if you can avoid the politics.  Stressful unstable environment right now.  Strong future for those who can hang on.  Strong pipeline.
good,"A tremendous amount of responsibility, unfortunately no authority or management support. "
good,"In general a good company to work fo, unfortunately a few bad apples can spoil the bunch. More attention needs to be paid to line managers to ensure that they are following the rules and respecting the Company's values and culture."
good,"ambiente de trabajo tranquilo, el balance vida trabajo aun tiene cosas por mejorar"
good,The corporation is not nimble and is losing it's edge for innovation. Lack of diversity of thought makes it a non-optimal work environment.
good,"A empresa em si é uma grande empresa. No passado o funcionário tinha seu valor agregado ao recebimento. A vontade de trabalhar era imperativo e sempre eramos valorizados."
good,I have learned a lot from working there. I have picked up more experience with machines. I also see how a global company of it's stature runs business and cares for it's employees.
good,Working for Eli Lilly was through a temp agency. There are no benefits with Eli Lilly when you are a contracted employee. Your only benefits would be through the agency from which you are paid. It was made clear to me by my employment agency that I would never receive a raise as that was part of the negotiated contract between them and Eli Lilly.
good,The role I had was a contact. Regular staff talk down the individuals in my role.  Not everyone did but alot did.the parking lot were so very far from the building.
good,"unfortunately, CEO and hierarchy are about numbers rather than its people and what we can contribute.  Communication to work together is lacking. Good people, just not ""quick"" or cohesive in relationships."
good,Eli Lilly has moved into a culture of giving their employees every 'in house' benefit known to man in an effort for their employees to spend more time at work than not. Pay was poor. Management was average/poor.
good,"I was a contractor and I was treated as a contractor. The gym in the building was off limits to contractors however we could watch through the windows or when there was a fire drill since the gym was the muster zone. Just something I noted however it didn't bother me since I provide a professional service without expectations of inclusion of employee ""basic benefits""."
good,"The change in the culture at Lilly in the 20 years has been astounding. Lilly would not recognize the company today. To gain promotions, you have to walk on water. No loyalty and they don't value experience because they can hire the young and dumb and work them until they burn out."
good,"The hardest part of the job is building relationships where the workplace culture is pre-existence.  In order to be successful, you must build trust and relationships in an environment that's hard to penetrate."
good,good and safe place to work. Good philosophy but the working hours are the worst. good coworkers. the duty at work was always the same.
good,"I usually get to work an hour before the shift, to get the pass down information from the previous shift's supervisor. Then have a mini-meeting with my supervision and plan out how the shift is going to be run. Discussing which personal is going to what station, scheduling break rotations. Make sure that the lines are prep'ed and stocked for the work order that is about to be processed. Assist/Train Operators in troubleshooting and maintenance of machines."
good,It helped me in finding a permanent job in the field I really enjoyed and meeting people.
good,"Es buena empresa para trabajar, tiene excelentes productos, pero le falta mejorar en clima laboral"
good,"The organization needed good benefits and paid time off for their employees to contradict the corrosive and corrupt culture they appeared to have. Managers are always trying to get ahead, majority of the workforce is contractors and they aren't included in corporate events. It's very political within the organization as well. I was very dissapointed."
good,If you don’t fit in you are screwed. Leadership not very professional. B1 line was the worst especially the Team Lead very rude. Good pay if you like the type of work  where you don’t use your brain.
good,"To many people want to be on the fast track and it becomes cut throat."
good,The work environment and culture changed over time and reallocation became the norm.  Good pay but very little room for advancement at starting levels.
good,"I served in a fixed duration employee role and they subsequently reduced the number of therapeutic areas they'd support. I was unable to apply for other roles for which I was qualified, so I left. Its a very one-sided system."
good,Eli Lilly and Co would be a great place to work if they would rid themselves of the FDE and contract positions and promote an atmosphere of growth within the company. You have multiple very talented employees that wonder when they are out of a job all because the company wants to save money.
good,"Few people doing all the work. Lots of laziness. Management  doesn't actually enforce anything. No real raises, just cost of living increases, which aren't much."
good,"Very diverse team, I am able to learn a lot about the business unit.  I greatly enjoy the various people I am able to support on a daily basis.  The hardest part is being a contractor and not being able to participate in team functions."
good,"with several misses in 2016, Lilly is making huge cuts.   I have been a part of two separate division and both have made massive cuts forcing me to move to other areas.   They want to be innovative but consistently rank in the bottom third for getting products from discovery to market"
good,If you like the corporate world you will fit right in.  It's just is not a place if you have a people friendly heart. Great job if you want to be technical and learn about trial medicines.  Turns people's lives into numbers and data.
good,Still better than many places. Excellent comradery. Enjoyable to work in an industry that helps people live better lives.
good,"While I worked at Lilly I was satisfied with the job for the most part.  The culture began to change as my time went on.  "
good,"People on management position with no formal educaton on management. Poor management skills, poor people skills. Offer no job posting. Management have no idea on how to direct people since they do not have education on management."
good,"Great place to develop however being a contractor, I felt like there was a different dynamic - i.e. being looked down on. I learnt a lot about the process of drug delivery and insight into pharmaceutical world."
good,Every day impact the same situations. A lot absenteeism. People doing the same thing for more than 10 year an don't know the job in details. Management doesn't address the situation to eliminate root cause.
good,"Como a grande maioria das indústrias farmacêuticas, a Lilly possui um ótimo pacote de benefícios e remuneração."
good,"Good team environment and freedom to think outside the box to address problems."
good,"Eli Lilly is run by lobbyist and corporate people who are only looking to step ahead of others, regardless of how they do it. Development and leadership programs are there just for saying they have them. Pointless."
good,"when i started it was awesome.  lots of changes, not all were good.         Indeed wants me to say more, but here really isn't anything esle to say.  I am just not that verbose!"
good,"The job wasn't very challenging because my immediate supervisor was more concerned with advancing her career and providing her direct reports her full attention. I was an after thought because in her opinion my job wasn't important enough to be bothered. There was no coaching for advancement - once you were in a administrative role, you were NOT considered for other roles."
good,"No room for creativity. You must follow every rule to the T or risk losing your job. There is no flexibility for admin positions. "
good,"Great place to work but if you are very experienced, highly educated, been a consistent innovator and high on deliverables...likely will not provide advancement opportunities.  However, if you are a new millennial campus hire, and meet certain criteria and sponsorship, you advancement opportunities are endless.  Culture is pretty resistant to change which is converse to the messaging.  Benefits are competitive, and many very bright individuals here.  However, big difference in opportunities for campus hires versus experienced hires.  Interesting they are becoming more open about that messaging now.  Overall good place to work."
good,"A room for improvement is there."
good,It's Corporate America.  It has a new stress of doing something that's very important.  Not for people who don't enjoy being stationed in front of a computer all day.
good,"Benefits are declining, layoff and outsourcing is becoming more frequent, and several large divisions have been sold off.  Job security has become a thing of the past."
good,Conservative company culture and tense working environment. Good compensation at midwest area. Onsite gym is really nice.
good,"We were a contracted company inside Eli Lilly me and another guy would get there at 7am we would have a list of conference rooms to set-up and folding tables and chairs to deliver inside the many buildings and floors inside those builds at the Eli Lilly headquarters downtown Indy(listed by time stamp in order of which they were due by). We would hit the carpet accomplishing our assignments one at a time in order. The third guy would show up 2 hours late because he ""accidentally slept in"" every other day. The manager then would show up an hour after him. They would make us speed through the list early in the day and then we would just sit in the office and talk. I must admit that was kind of cool, but seemed a little like a waste. The hardest part of the job was when Eli Lilly would decide to have a company wide event outside and we would have to set-up 60 tables with linens and chairs and 10 canopy's and games and tables for catered food etc., and a hundred foot tent."
good,I have worked here for 6 years and have enjoyed my time with the company.  Just not a lot of growth in the current position. Looking for something more.
good,This is an average pharma company.  They provide very good training for you pharmaceutical sales career.  I worked with good people but mangers were at best OK.
good,"Keeps the patients we help always first"
good,"Lilly is a wonderful company to work for if you're prepared to work in a culture that's very self serving. Not all departments are the same, marketing in particular is very political and you must be good at navigating."
good,"The day started at 7:00 am until 6:00 pm, after a long 1 hr 20 min commute and I would focus on closing out my scope of work, which took main priority. However, I would be asked to help out with other areas of work, to achieve schedule dead lines for others. This gave me a better understanding of other disciplines. "
good,"The ever changing culture along with management changes makes the daily routine difficult to predict, Along with the rough hours that are expected to be worked with the recent retirement program, Many weeks working 5 or 6 12 hour shifts in a row while rotating from days to nights and nights to days in consecutive weeks, Making the work/life balance rough, The compensation is fair, But money isn't everything. If you don't have or want any kind of a family life, Then manufacturing for this company may be the right job for you, But if your life isn't all about work, Then I would proceed with caution."
good,the job is fast paced mostly.  the pay and benefits are good. the company is clean and safety is important. i would have preferred shorter days and less weekends but if i was offered a full time position it would have been worth it.
good,"Multi-national pharma company with issues. It was big before but due to several mismanagement and internal issues by the local upper executives, the company has since been reduced to a very small entity in the Philippines."
good,It is a good company for direct employees but has poor treatment to contractor.They need to treat contractors like their employees and involve them in all activities and gatherings where Lilly employee participate.
good,A company with good ethical and integrity. Try hard to get the next generation drug to the market as soon as possible to benefit the patients in need.
good,"I do really like my sales job at Lilly. However, there is too much emphasis on how much influence you have on the area and the nation, versus how well you do at your job. Too much manager opinion and politics involved."
good,"It was a nice place to work. Stable. Good pay.  Nice co-workers.  Management was a little out of touch with lower paid employees, but it didn't bother me."
good,"My department is extremely stressful and management can get away with being as disrespectful to you as they want to be. Overall the benefits are great! The pay isn't bad, you just have to put up with a lot of pressure and high levels of stress."
good,Interesting organization to work .Employee safety and values are key priority .Management is dynamic . Improving market share has remained a challenge always . Most motivating part of the work is patient is the key priority and goal is improve customer delight .
good,Like all big pharmaceutical companies is a lot processes driven thus simple tasks can be time consuming
good,I typical is help me learn more how company help customers and employees on a different level.
good,Good stable company. Requires higher education for advancement. Benefits are great but pay was low. Stuffy corporate atmosphere
good,"Customer-centric sales culture"
good,"Eli Lilly & Company utilizes core working hours consisting of 9AM - 3PM, Monday through Friday. Although it is core hours for work/life balance, you are required to put in 40+ hours a week. It's important that your Outlook Calendar is up-to-date so your whereabouts are known."
good,"Hard working place to work. I was giving my opportunity for growth , and understanding . Ability to cross training I many areas . Giving many training session on new and old Instrumentation . Also through background in DEA policy and procedures ."
good,"Enjoyed my time with this company, they look out after their people and offer plenty of room to grow in your chosen profession.  They have a helpful staff of corporate people, who will jump at the chance to assist."
good,"Working for Eli Lilly and Company has allowed me gain a wide variety of experience supporting numerous business partners, event planning, calendaring, hiring efforts.  Appreciative of the experience and learning."
good,Not Applicable. I have no desire to say anything about this company. I  would like to move forward with searching through your open job position. I can't move forward because you don't understand that I don't  need or want to saying anything about the company.
good,Empresa con sentido de pertenencia y escuela de negocios
good,"Great training and opportunities to learn and develop. "
good,This I hope this was good for the company. Doing surveys can be a drag and this was no exception. All the same I hope this overall helped your company and its development.
good,"Nice working environment, they give you the tools to succeed. Only issue I had was with colleagues but I can't hold the company responsible for that (although they didn't really handle them that well). Good teaching opportunities but not much room for advancement. Would still recommend"
good,Eli Lilly is a good company to start your career. They will teach you so much but you need to go somewhere else if you really want to advance and achieve your goals.
good,"It was a short consultancy project and so I do not have grounded insights. My views are preliminary insights. People were smart, and helpful. The organization was very supportive."
good,"Overall just look at the stars and you should be able to future it out. As I really do not want to type a dissertation. It is not a bad place, but it really is not a great place either."
good,"I can't complain, it has been good over the years. Flexible when I needed the time off, helped with adopting my children and was there for me when I needed time off when my husband and daughter were ill."
good,Lilly was my initial exposure to working for an international corporation. The facilities and resources were second to none. Tremendous opportunities if one applied him or herself appropriately.
good,"A empresa não tem muitas oportunidades de promoção, é bastante rígida e resistente a mudanças."
good,"A professional company to work for, incorporates all relevant work ethics. Flexibility is encouraged whilst deadlines are met with ease."
good,"This is a compilation of the three companies I worked for, without over changing companies (joint venture and sale of interest of one of the JV partners). It would no be representative."
good,"Very rewarding "
good,"Diversity was not a strong suit for Lilly during my time there. I am sure they have changed - the optimist in me- and are more diverse in culture, structure, and development."
good,I was always very busy with the next assignment or experiment that had to be done. My boss would have weekly meetings so that we can update on current projects progress.
good,"There are many collaborations within the US and OUS so communication is the key to getting quality products released to the public while ensuring they meet FDA standards. At times this can be challenging with multiple partners working on one project. Getting to know different cultures and what one may requirement that another does not for a manufacturing site is very insightful. I have learned to be patient, good communication, respect for people, being up to date on standard regulations is all key to make any product work."
good,"It has been quite a while since I worked at Lilly but at the time I was pregnant and then a new Mom. The company had been listed as a Top Company for Working Mothers. I found myself in a situation where my manager was annoyed I was tired during my pregnancy which she reported to several of my peers, and then refused to follow company policy to facilitate my breastfeeding while traveling for work. For me these were very difficult issues I had to overcome. When I tried to move to a different part of the sales force to work part-time, she tried to prevent this from happening as well. I reported her to HR and nothing came of it. Fortunately I was able to transfer within the company but those 2 years did not make me feel good about the company."
good,I have worked in Eli Lilly more than 3 years. The company has great business culture. It is a very serious place with the dress code. You usually work 7 hours a day which is an advantage.
good,A pleasant place to work if you understand the requirements of working in a regulated industry and participate in the company's work culture.  This company has a long history of providing life saving products despite what the media says.
good,Eli Lilly gives me an opportunity to work with the international Brand and helps me to learn the basics of Pharmaceutical industry.To associate with Lilly helped me in achieving the well reputation in Pharmaceutical industry.
good,I have learned a lot working for Lilly but it is not the fun collaborative place it used to be. It feels like work now. Benefits have been continually cut and opportunities are far and few between. It is still a good place to work but I'm not sure for how much longer.
good,"• Adapt to changes, self-motivated, curious, passionate, ready to share, execution-oriented,"
good,Many engagement managers with as many different styles. Mostly the company wrote checks and pretended to understand the work being done. here are your required additional characters.
good,"Our sales team delivers vital health care solutions to people in need around the world. As a world-class company known for its innovative medicines, we are dedicated to ensuring these needs are met through creating positive experiences for our customers. In our culture of innovation, teamwork and professional development, you can expect great things today and in the future. Sales positions at Lilly offer a path to positively impact people’s lives, while enhancing your future with solid training, professional experience and an exceptional benefits package."
good,"Was there as contractor and liked working there. I really enjoyed my Manager and wish I could have stayed. I was extended for several months which I really was very appreciative of."
good,"Company is reluctant to change or processes, procedures and SOPS to become mainstream. Not geared towards new college hires or millennials. Tenure employees seek to weave out employees they do not relate with or are challenged against."
good,"cultural diversity"
good,"Good reviews, good work life balance, peer to peer review. Strong culture to embrace change.  Supportive management and leadership to support growth and development."
good,Very modern laboratory environment. Management quality was variable but mostly critical. Advancement is difficult. Lilly seeks to outsource as many lab jobs as possible. Management is more concerned about outsourcing than managing their existing talent pool.
good,"If you lived in central Indiana then you probably know of Eli Lilly. Its an established company with little to no consistency. The company preaches diversity and respect for the individual but that can all go out the window with the phrase ""Business needs"" They do offer training and for the most part their benefits are maybe a smidge better than most but in my experience those balance out compared to other companies. They do have a decent bonus program and try sponsoring company events. Management tends to decent enough but also seem to be too over the top."
good,"Team di lavoro molto unito, possibilità di lavorare con funzioni diverse tra loro."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working with the clients and being challenged with the projects I was assigned to.  However, the BCforward side was highly disorganized with many changes in organizational structure, lots of leadership turnover, and internal staff turnover.  Reporting structure was confusing and with the high turnover in leadership, annual reviews were missed, pay increases were promised but not made, benefits were minimal."
good,"Nice company"
good,"- A typical day involves setting up and monitoring multiple reactions as part of synthetic route design. Additionally, multiple conversations occur with colleagues and supervisors regarding project goals and priorities"
good,Competitive company that can have long term benefits. Currently undergoing a transformation of strategies and aligning for long term grow.
good,"I have learned a lot during my 18 years of employment.  While the company has cut or reduced a lot of our benefits and pension, it still is a good place to work in the midwest."
good,"a typical day is taking members and helping them with their financial goals, and everyday banking transactions.  Most enjoyable part is recommending products and services that best fits our members needs."
good,"Pros – Lot to contribute and to do."
good,We manufacture animal feed supplements. It is very rewarding to know our products help feed the world.
good,"I learned how to lead in a highly regulated, very complex, front-loaded process."
good,"Forex dealing with banks in London."
good,Good environment but the company had to close the plant where I was working because the products were sent to another area.
good,"Lilly is a large pharma company with thousands of reps across numerous divisions. It wasn't hard to get lost among the herd. To stand out, you needed the help of a manager whose mission it was to get you promoted, usually at the expense of the other reps in your district. "
good,"•	Systems:  Worked extensively with Windows 7/XP and Macintosh iOS 6.1.3"
good,Pharmaceutical sales experience in primary care setting. Business analysis and sales knowledge developed and executed successfully.
good,Great place to work for. Very flexible with working time. Great coworkers and a lot of opportunities.
good,"Gestione del personale indeterminato ottimale. Buon ambiente di lavoro, ottimi benefit e salario."
good,The people I worked with were a great group. A typical day at work was full of cage changes and cleaning. management was nice. The hardest part of the job was that I did not feel that I was using the skills I have gained over the years- therefor did not feel that I was growing in the position.
good,I wrote about fifty programs. It was good. The management was confursed. Working on the Japanese submission
good,"Très bons salaires, avantages sociaux. Travail très intéressant mais aucune sécurité d'emploi."
good,I inspected all capsules to make sure there are no dents or holes and I had the counter for capsules to be prepared to go into the bottles.
good,"There is no typical day at Eli Lilly and Company. The organization is in the midst of redefining who and what they will continue to pursuit in the form of pharmaceutical success. The issue with that statement is that the focus continues to be on drug pipeline and growth transformation, but the attention to innovation exhibiting process inefficiency and reduced headcount is not consistent with the focus. A standard day consist of employees are extremely overloaded and approached with additional job responsibilities previously managed by 2 – 3 resources. Days mainly consist of functions that include staying current on email and many meetings, leaving very little time to complete the actual work. I have learned time management, attention to detail, pure account management and navigating bureaucracy. Broader in terms of the organization in general, resources at Eli Lilly and Company have the potential to learn quite a bit in the realm of medicine, laboratory research, clinical trials, sales and marketing and enterprise information technology. There is a wide spectrum in terms of management. Individuals considering this organization will find leaders more concerned with making them look good, yet other leaders truly focus on growth and development for their direct reports. However, the organization has made significant reduction in the areas of structured academic and professional development and certifications. Co-workers are great. There is a true and genuine perception of group success and willingness to bring everyone up to speed. However, there are isolated pockets of departments"
good,"Very good company, but has started cutting benefits, increasing work loads, and capping personal growth.  It is not the same company that I started with."
good,"I was an intern here, so I wasn't paid, but was constantly getting chances to learn and grow from a learning perspective."
good,"It was alright, if you were a white male. It was definitely implied that the Shift supervisor was slightly racist and sexist. No PTO, neglected requested time off, no vacation time. Training was included and paid for, yet not quite substacial for specific job roles. Was asked to do twice as much work as males with the same amount of experience, yet paid less."
good,"Pay, benefits, and work/life balance are good. "
good,Good company to work for. Must have a career path to receive promotion considerations. Would have stayed with the company if the opportunities for advancement were easier to come by.
good,"Always started day with meetings about what the day looked like, yet knowing that it is subject to change.  It was fun at times but was serious all the times.  There were a lot of expectations on you by management as well as the expectations you put on yourself."
good,"Lots of meetings, favoritism, management sometimes promoted strictly to satisfy an affinity group, mobile work stations are ridiculous, culture has changed to one of fear."
good,"Terrible management, especially in the quality control/animal care department. "
good,"Relaxed, but strict at the same time.  I learned a lot about many different systems throughout the entire company and many best practices in the IT/Pharma industry.  Management was less than favorable at times, however, they were not the worst I have had.  Hardest part was how boring it got at time.  The most enjoyable part was when you were given a task without a super strict time limit and people breathing over your neck for it to be finished quickly"
good,"Most deadlines are unrealistic and no one has an idea of what goes on outside their own area. When provided with proper knowledge, nothing changes. Most refuse to understand process/order in which things have to occur, which in turn causes hold ups, which then causes people to miss deadlines."
good,"Through use of portal, HUB, and Specialty Pharmacies, I helped HCP Offices get coverage for Biologic Medications in the immunosuppressive market.  Direct access to HCPO staff, constant interactions with HUB staff, collaborations with Specialty Pharmacies.  Worked in the commercial space and Medicare, Medicaid, and TriCare.  Helped with LMN, Appeals, EOBs."
good,"Since I was hired on Contract, I was unable to share in the benefits package along with my peers. When the Contract was over, the job was over whether or not you wanted to continue working there or not."
good,"Work with great people, but management gets in the way.  Company has great benefits.  A good company to work for and raise a family.  Able to work flexible hours."
good,"There are a lot of great things about working at Eli Lilly. The pay and benefits are great, and there's a lot of room for advancement within the company. However, I'm glad I only worked there through a summer program. Some of the employees are disgruntled, which in turn makes them step all over you. Because there are so many branches and employees, it was difficult to feel like you're more than just a number to them."
good,"At Eli Lilly, there is so much that i have learn and accomplish from the start untill present, up and down is common situation and i believe everyone has their time and extra effort to manage it."
good,Be prepared for re-organizations every 2 years.  Job uncertainty is the main issue. No real hope in the pipeline. Otherwise a historically good company with good benefits.
good,Management did not listen to their employees. they also o did not look out for their employees. they looked out for themselves. this company has good benifits
good,"Well sufficed when it comes to training to equip the people amidst seismic changes in the market place/ industry. "
good,"The company itself is very loyal, flexible and supportive of work/life family and health.  My first 2/3 years were engaging, energizing, team oriented, transparent and supportive with an environment of TEAM and offered many opportunities for personal development.  The last 1/3 was in a completely different area which slowly became more and more stressful over the years.  The environment had a micro-managed & stressed out atmosphere leaving employees feeling drained, harassed and anxious.  That said, my entire career there I worked alongside fantastic, supportive, team playing peers and colleagues."
good,Would have been a great job if it were not a temporary position..Management was easy to get along with and work with.Learned  alot about processing returns
good,"Typical days included follow-up with internal requests for information, external communications, communications and follow-up with vendors, fulfillment of medical education material, set-up and attendance of medical education meetings. Overall management was helpful in providing guidance for growth and encouraged reaching out to other parts of the organization to learn procedures and processes that may benefit our team. The environment was very relaxed and enjoyable to work with any number of people at multiple levels of the organization. The most difficult time was last 12-18 months when management was different which included a totally different view of expectations. Job was not fulfilling which in turn resulted in elimination of my position."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Eli Lilly, it has allowed me to progress rapidly within the company but the downside is that financially they pay well below the industry standard. For that reason I am looking to move on"
good,"great place to learn "
good,"Great, established company, just has a different way of retaining their administative assistants."
good,"Hi paced work environment.Can be stressful at times. Strives for product Quality and safety of workers. Excellent benefits. Pay for performance guidelines however, gives middle management broad authority to abuse its position. Nepotism is rampant.  Very difficult to be promoted after 5yrs. Ultra competitive environment that hinders development of employees. Most enjoyable part of the job is that you know you are part of the big picture and help saves lives and patient outcomes."
good,"Lilly is considered a big school which was perfect with me when I first joined Lilly as a Fresh graduate. I have learned a lot and gained a lot of practical experience in the Engineering/ manufacturing field. I have progressed through out my career in Lilly to gain management skills through leading a team of Technicians and junior engineers. Overall, I enjoyed working in this company"
good,"Great place to work, but difficult to advance.  Here I learned the SAP software in great detail and enhanced my purchasing knowledge.  Management and co-workers were pretty good.  Not very diverse there and the company has a lot of contract employees.  "
good,Great place to work for when your not a contractor. They treat their poeple with the upmost respect. Great Environment to work in when you are a lilly employee.
good,"There are opportunities to do some amazing things and contribute to the greater good.  The benefits are great and the people are very talented.  Enterprise-level initiatives are definitely going in the right direction.  However, although company is working to make strides on Diversity and Inclusion, it will take time for all employees at all levels to feel valued and open to share their ideas.  Challenging the status quo, even if it is for the greater good, is more risky than it should be in the current environment.  Some supervisors are absolutely amazing with their employees - supportive and helpful toward their success.  However, in general, supervisors have too much power over their employees, so for those who are not open to hearing alternative ideas to their own, it can lead to employees feeling/being 'punished' for sharing a different perspective.  I've experienced both types of supervisors here."
good,Nice offices in downtown Indianapolis with convenient access to local amenities. Environment was a little sale and projects take along time to get going and complete due to the regulatory requirements. That's to be expected in the industry but can be difficult at times to navigate.
good,"Empresa con buena cultura laboral, pero difícil subir de puestos."
good,"They pay well and have great benefits, but don't treat the business well in other ways, such as by ensuring that the right people are in the right roles. They have also stopped being as flexible with work from home arrangements, unless a role is specifically field based."
good,"A liderança na empresa é hostil e discriminatória, não da apoio aos seus funcionários e terceiros."
good,"Would love to say something positive about Lilly, but outside of pay and benefits there was not much to write home about.  This company has lost direction and little-to-no future hope in innovation.  This is not much different from most other pharmaceutical companies, to be honest.  Just a dying industry."
good,Pharmaceutical Sales Rep -
good,Learning the science of disease and information on medication.
good,"A typical day consisted of what I chose to accomplish. I enjoyed managing my own time. The Supervisor was very friendly and helpful when I had questions. Management was very distant,and seemed to be removed from any kind of relationship with me, but professional. Didn't expect to be isolated from them. Co-Workers were very funny, and bright. THe hardest part of the job was learning about things I knew nothing about, and having to leave because my contract is ending. The most enjoyable part of the job is the self management with work and time, and the fact that the work load was not more than I could bear."
good,"Great job, however, ended abruptly when they closed the Bridgewater location.  People were friendly, great life/work balance.  New CEO was horrible.  Many great people lost their jobs in Bridgewater."
good,"Less flexibility over work times. Too much macro-management."
good,I was hired in as a specialty Neuroscience rep that called in Inpatient Psychiatric hospitals. I truly enjoyed promoting in the mental health space I had two great partners and my work family balance was very doable.
good,"Job security is never there. I've seen the most brilliant people walk out the door when Lilly should've been doing everything they could to hang on to them. But, it's typical corporate business models. To cut expenses you need to cut heads."
good,"It was fun to work with the company and at the same time work was passionately done "
good,"I was very happy with my job at Lilly. I especially liked working with my team mate in instructional design, as well as my supervisor and director.  The working environment was very pleasant, the use of hoteling made it great for meeting in different areas."
good,"My career was launched at Lilly. I started as an admin and ended as a project assistant. The only real drawback of working for Lilly is that they place high value on advanced degrees, so it an be a challenge to move up through the ranks."
good,"Buenas oportunidades de desarrollo"
good,Great place to work - wonderful environment.  Nice to have a company like this in the Midwest. A lot of great people and opportunities. Competitive benefits.
good,"Good pay, very stressful environment being a biotech company. Good quality, for me it was hard to advance in here and why I left. The products are good quality."
good,Overall I enjoyed working there. Because there are no sick days people would come to work and spread germs and get others sick. I loved always having weekends off. Very friendly environment. Could wear jeans constantly.
good,"Day to day life is very slow paced, people are resistant to change and do not provide constructive feedback. Benefits and pay are more than fair, however, cutting travel costs hinders project progress."
good,"My typical day at work was to pretty much do as i was told and mind my  own business. Finish up what was given for you to do. Clean your area."
good,"high end work, with top quality workers, friendly a employers. work in expensive remodels with the highest of expectations. great place to work"
good,"Fortune 500 company great management. Delivering packages, stocking all products. Daily data entry."
good,Good work/life balance and great compensation make Lilly a great place to work.  Great teamwork environment and focused on helping patients live healthier and better lives.
good,"I love my role of Global Budget Associate, however Lilly breached contract with my company.  Lilly is offering positions, but only in-house. I live in Austin and cannot relocate to Indy right now."
good,"Umas das coisas que mais gostei como estagiária de marketing, era o GP (gerenciamento de performance). Era um relatório feito pelos meus chefes com as atividades a serem desenvolvidas e com atividades já realizadas, com feedbacks e com alguns atributos de notas. Esse relatório foi fundamental para o meu crescimento pessoal e profissional, pois eram opiniões sobre meu desempenho na empresa."
good,Company is offering opportunities for development. Busy and fun environment which allows to grasp a knowledge from different processes and departments.  
good,"Like most companies Lilly's long term research planning usually turned our to be very short term."
good,The work itself was not hard.  The issues we with management and there lack of insuring that all three shifts worked there part of the repairs. When asked about a raise to compensate for the extra work and hours put in to cover others not working there shifts or contributing to the repair efforts was totally ignored.
good,it was day to day long days. how different types of meds was made and manufacered  all the paper work and everything it take to produce a produce. it was interesting.
good,"Did not pay as well as you would expect a big pharma company to. Culture was one of calls per day, and just doing what you're told, nodding your head, and smiling.  Not a great experience there."
good,"Eli Lilly is a great place to work! Has the best perks in the state PERIOD. Though if you are placed on the wrong team then watch out. Eli Lilly does not have a lot of empathy based people. A lot of people feel that they are provided because they have been  there for 30 years but that is far from the truth. There work has been not to get fired for 30 years. A lot of these folks have no connection to the customers they serve."
good,"Good company to work for, specially for those seeking opportunities in pharmaceutical company. Respect for people and fair salary."
good,"constant changes with minimal notification or training opportunities if you did not hold a professional degree or licensure "
good,"Empresa agradable."
good,fair employer in a part-time position; there was excessive changes in the management;  the company was very comfortable with the virtual office concept;
good,I learned a lot at this company. Was hoping to work their until I retired. I gave a lot to a company and was the best at all of the projects that I was assigned to. Downsized in 2008.
good,Great perks if you are an employee which is almost impossible to become. Ive been a contractor off an on for almost 13 years and have applied as a fulltime employee with no luck. The workplace is always enjoyable and professional with up to date work stations and equipment. Staff is helpful. I have learned alot. Hardest part is having to wait 12 months in between contracts. I dont really have any opinion about the company since Im not an employee.
good,I had several contract positions with this company - great training ground for learning pharmaceuticals.
good,My typical day was making sales calls on Doctors office but talking to the staff was the most enjoyable part of my job. I loved getting to know everyone and the Doctor too. After awhile you become friends and build relationships that last.
good,Planeas tus visitas a médicos y farmacias
good,*Is a productive and fast job in every time.
good,"Only a few select people move up, mostly because they have a network so hard work doesn't always pay off. Great company culture. Competitive environment as well, sales rep are often more likely to transition to home office than the other way around."
good,Eli Lilly and company is a great company but the advancement and the ability for growth are limited unless you work at corporate in Indianapolis. I wanted to stay with a company for long term growth bt that was not possible.
good,"This job was a pleasant  opportunity. The day would typically begin with video conference room regular meetings scheduled in the morning with Eli Lilly's Indianapolis location and a check of the outlook calendar to identify any non regular scheduled conference meetings. After completing this task, I would review my email to identify any service request that needed attention and contact these employees to determine the best time to provide support for these issues. Next I would need to review any new hire or refresh tasks for computer new computer deployment. After it was determined the number of computers that would need to be setup, I would begin imaging and installing any additional software beyond the basic image that were requested and needed by the scientist receiving new computers. I would then contact the employees regarding the delivery of these computers. I also had regular request for basic printer support issues and contact vendors for more complex issues to schedule service appointments to repair the designated printer. We also had the responsibility of receiving shipments and sending shipments via the shipping receiving departments in the building. There would also be situations when bench tech laptop repair was also needed. This would be the typical responsibilities of a normal day at Eli Lilly."
good,Coming through years of changes.  Greatness on horizon again. Focus on diabetes and oncology is strong.  Recent challenges with research and development.
good,"If you are a contractor, you are treated differently, to some extent but it really depends on your team. Mine wasn't really bad, I didn't get some of the employees perks. "
good,"Prepare reports forecasting hours, and direct / indirect expenses for molecule projects."
good,Nice place for entry-level. The pay was competitive. Nice management. Bad shift 12 hr long with weekly rotation.
good,innovative and updated company with great developmental strategy for the employees
good,"I have been at Lilly for two years. When I got here, I thought they were different, but our recent restructuring has shown me that they are no different than all of the other Big Pharma companies these days. They see sales people as expendable, and the first place they cut when they are looking to trim expenses. They also see us as interchangeable parts, so no consideration is given to how good you are."
good,- typical day of work: at least 10 hours / day
good,"Good company but unfortunatley not much opportunity for advancement unless you are willing to relocate to Indiana. Also, there is not budget this year for raises or ongoing education to help with career advancement."
good,"Lilly in the last 20 years have mfgd and sold many life-saving medicines, and does the breakthrough research to validate the medications efficacy and safety, but the marketing (sales) arm many times do not have the integrity and morals to properly sell these medicines to the medical profession, and the public. It was stimulating to represent Lilly and their medicines, but in the end, their reputation is soiled due to unethical sales practices which made the world-wide and national press. What a shame!"
good,"In my first experience with a pharmaceutical company, Eli Lilly proved to be exemplary in its professionalism and commitment to patient health. Would recommend working there to anyone interested."
good,Accueil chaleureux et ambiance très calme. Bons avantages
good,"Culture is often oppressive, with layers of red tape for all jobs and excessive ""networking"" necessary to advance."
good,"pro:"
good,good company with solid fundamentals.  can work at this company for a long time and have lots of different opportunities.  they tend to get rid of employees that are loyal with eliminating jobs/divisions.
good,"Conservative pharma company with proven success. Talented people and good pay. Firm believer that leadership sets the tone for environment, and this can be a mixed bag within the organization."
good,I was trained to become a Chemical Engineer over 19 years. I learned an incredible amount in my time there. I would not change a thing. The drawback is it's a huge corporation with lots of red tape.
good,"bon culture du lieu de travail;"
good,"Eli Lilly and Company is similar to many Fortune 500 pharma companies. People don't leave good companies like Lilly, they leave because of poor people in management positions."
good,No comment about typical work day or what I have learned in the company I am just trying to skip this step on the website thank you very much and have a great day
good,"Talks of the desired transition toward Scrum and Team Lilly mentality, but in actuality remains steadfast to its management's prevailing bureaucratic cutthroat and backstabbing legacy mentality and practices covered up by the notion of being a conservative company that brings on more contractors than it even has employees so Lilly keeps its good name as it uses and abuse its contractors and abandons them without any method of appeal."
good,"Very conservative selling environment. Fewer opportunities for growth, especially if unwilling to move to Indianapolis. Pretty conservative in how they manage the business."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Eli Lilly and would have continued working there if our jobs were not outsourced in my opinion.  The job was competitive but not overly stressful the people were friendly and the overall environment was pleasant.
good,I was a contractor as an analytical chemist and even though the placement agency assured that there will be extension of the contract but usually that ends before or at the contract term
good,Was able to expand my skill set & work with great teams & feel like I was helping our customers. I worked for management that helped me expand my experience.
good,"Worked well, had a great mentor, Spent 3 summers there as a student and it was great experience that I still have interest in today. I still have contact with my mentor and he has continued to be a good source of inspiration."
good,"We start our day with proper plan to meet our customers from where we need to get the business,management is helpful and gives on time approval for scientific programs. I love my work place as everyday we can learn something new especially when we face any tough situation."
good,"Lilly is undergoing a lot of change and that is always hard.  New Sr. Management seems to manage only the bottom line and Wall Street, so long-term commitment to employees and their development is likely over.  Lots of stress."
good,"Entreprise basé sur la procédure "
good,"Lilly was a very good company to get started in the pharmaceutical industry.  Unfortunately, the industry is no longer what it was.  Can still make a good living."
good,Great people and environment.  Compensation and benefits excellent.  The work done by researchers and senior management is extremely groundbreaking. I was proud to contribute to the organization.
good,Opportunities to grow and develop were available. Culture was becoming more tense as reduction in force was occurring. Management was not always on the same page.
good,"An entry-level to senior administrative assistant at Eli Lilly and Company will be overworked, MAY become under-appreciated, and will definitely be put into a pool of 25 AAs, without the direct, 1:1 relationship with business partners or stability that some AAs crave.  Lilly will reduce their AA workforce by 25% starting Jan. 1, 2018."
good,"You will work with many smart and professional people in a very challenging market."
good,"Great culture, great products. Limited growth opportunity and slow promotion scale for candidates looking to really move within a company. Still would recommend to people for sure."
good,"This company is cutting is work force tremendously, but only on the ground floor. It is unbelievable how many managers, quality reps,  and engineers, but maintenance and operations are being sacrificed. Less people, but more responsibilities.

good,"Good trainers to teach about the products. Good products. Marketing was really not good. They could have done better in terms of marketing."
good,"I cannot and will not speak for Lilly as a whole, but the Animal care department could use some new management, from the Associate Veterinarian on down. The work environment was extremely negative. A lot of micromanagement and pitting associates against each other created an environment of unnecessary paranoia and stress."
good,"is a productive company, i learning a lot of a company, and a have more experience to my professional record, i recomended the company, is a great workplace"
good,Maintaining data and extracting it for use for customers was very interesting. Each day held a different challenge. Training end users on how to use various computer systems was very rewarding

good,"While working for Discovery Solutions, contracting at Elanco\Eli Lilly, the work environment was very well. The other tech were always around to help, and the testing of products was a great experience of it's own."
good,"Lilly es una empresa excelente, las posibilidades de desarrollo personal están presentes desde el primer día. Hay un ambiente muy bueno y los compañeros se vuelcan en ayudarte en lo que necesites. Lo mismo con los jefes, todos los que yo he tenido han sido de 10. El trabajo está bien, hay distintas actividades y poco a poco van entrenándote en todas para que adquieras conocimiento y tu día a día no se vuelva aburrido y repetitivo."

good,I worked very long hours and enjoyed this job.  There was alot of stress envolved and worked there longer than many.  There is a high turn over at Securitas.
good,"Diverse Place to work, there are all types of employees here that have a wide variety of skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with different people. The downside is there is not much room for career development if you are on the B-Path which is support fields. It is rare that a person crosses over to the professional path."
good,"It is a very good place to work if you are a cell biologist or molecular biologist. If there is a will then you are going to learn a lot from experienced staff. Managers are nice, pay is good, benefits are good. Eli-Lilly is going through tough times so job security will improve in coming years."
good,A wonderful collaborative team environment.  People work hard yet there is still time for work life balance. Very smart workforce.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside of my colleagues and learning from them. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day.
good,"Lilly è ai primi posti da alcuni nella classifica Great Place to Work. Queste è principalmente dovuto alla forte adesione ai valori su cui si basa il lavoro qui: ricerca dell' eccellenza, attenzione per le persone ed comportamento etico."
good,"Eli Lilly and Co. has been a very good employer.  I have been employed at this company for most of my career.  The work has been challenging with respect to troubleshooting development issues on scale up. As a production chemist for about half of my career, production problems and production mistakes were very challenging to solve.  I was very successful at recovering processes while in process.  Countless kilos of intermediate and products were saved from incineration over the years."

good,"Operador en el área de empaquetado de medicamentos."
good,"This company is a mobile workplace and many people work in solitary.  The hardest part of the job is managing all tasks at hand.  The benefits of working there are amazing (i.e. baseball games, several cafeterias, personal laptop, game systems)"
good,lots has changed since my time here.  I loved my time at Eli Lilly.  Work/Life balance was great and staff were happy.  They closed the manufacturing plant and it all changed.
good,For me a typical day at work is a day where I learn new things that will make me grow in both professionally and personally. So I can grow as a human.
good,"Eli Lilly is a great place to work. They have several opportunities for advancement and outstanding benefits. They were not that stable and very political, but overall, it was a great place to work."
good,"Learned the SAP system, management was good and co-workers were great; showing you the ins and outs and allowing you to learn.  Hardest part of the job was the culture of the company, Eli Lilly, not everyone, including management appreciate a contract person"
good,challenging work due to governmental constraints.  Most co-workers are very bright and hard-working ethical people
good,Best part of the job is that it's a clean environment.  Worse part is the parking!

good,"Technologically they were moving forward, replacing antiquated technology.  Unfortunately they reached a point where they were very focused on outsourcing all of their IT expertise, which is when I left."
good,"En estos casi 2 años he aprendido mucho de lo que es el mundo de las ventas. Detectar oportunidades (especialmente este es uno de mis puntos fuertes),elaborar la estrategia y plan de acción de la zona, hacer relación con los clientes, promocionar los productos,etc."
good,Lilly China is only doing medical affairs rather than clinical development. 
good,"Independently managed territory, time and budget.  Educated physicians, staff and pharmacies on products by conducting presentations and one on one time.  Utilize data to execute a strategic plan for optimal performance. Plan, organize direct and evaluate customer needs to meet patient needs. Establish and maintain an effective working relationships with co-workers, managers, physicians, pharmacists, and staff.  Conduct administrative duties by creating clear and concise reports in a timely manner. Met all deadlines. Train new representatives on administrative and territory duties.

good,A typical day consists of
good,Lilly has treated me well. A major reorganization will cause me to lose my job on 7/15/13 due to major patent expiries.
good,The organizational dynamics created a strong culture that at times made progress difficult due to a resistance to change.
good,Provided educational information and product samples to physicans. I spent much of my time learning about the various facets of mental illness and finding ways to convey that information to phyisicians. I had incredible co-workers who were willing to provide support when needed. All I can offer about management is that they can make your life wonderful or terrible. The best part of my job was the feeling I got when I knew information I provided ended up improving a patients life. The biggest challenge was managed care.
good,Loved working at Eli Lilly. It was an easy job that helped me advance my skills.
good,I sold neuroscience portfolio to specialist and primary care doctors.
good,"Can`t complain really. It was a part time job with good pay for me and I made some friends. Contract position, no problems, organizing and maintaining material sometimes with my own radio. I would do it again given the opportunity."
good,"Always learned new task, co-workers are fun to be around and management willing to help you at all time"
good,"Worked in a department that was always too busy to train me for the job properly.  Expected training to be better quality from this type of company.  Groups are very clicky at Lilly.  Everyone seems stressed and busy as they want you to do more with less ""Lean""."
good,"Se trabaja con cierta tranquilidad, libertad de horario con planificación de visitas y actividades por trimestre."
good,"Broadened my horizon, made me more structured at work and wider work experience as challenges was given such as handling several countries all at the same time, working with different people not just in Philippines but in other countries as well. Working with diverse culture and timezone to accomplish task at hand will increase your commitment and stand tall at challenges."
good,This is a good company to work for but I left due to medical reasons that I wasn't aware of until I started working for Lilly. I know that's kind of odd but I guess I'm sensitive to pressure changes and normally that wouldn't be a big deal but at Lilly it is. They have air lock chambers that you have to pass through in order to get to your area. Every time the pressure changed I would get light headed. So if you're sensitive to airplane flights because of the pressure change you may want to rethink taking this job.
good,I would have still been there if it wasn't for a manager who did not like that I spoke up for myself and that didn't like that.I hope this may be seen by someone that could help.
good,"Good place to work"
good,Esperienza  molto stimolante e produttiva . Ambiente di collaborazione tra colleghi.marketing fino al management . Trasparenza e Eticità
good,"I had a real growth in the company and was awarded lots of awards."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, agradável de trabalhar, gerencia qualificada."
good,"Working at Lilly for over a decade, I had some great supervisors and some really challenging ones. The support and opportunities that I received were highly dependent upon my immediate supervisor. Executive level leaders have been there for a long time so they are trying hard to clear out the old and make room for the new. Many previous employees are actually returned from when they left due to poor management or were reallocated."
good,"Eli Lilly provided an excellent opportunity for me to build a strong skill set in front-line sales. This included relationship building/management, targeting, research, data analytics, team building, collaboration, partnership management, etc. I was able to utilize my analytical skills to strengthen how I used my communication with business prospects, giving me a unique edge when I left the company to return to the non-profit sector as a front-line fundraiser."
good,I was a contractor employee at Eli Lilly therefore I did not have much contact with the company itself. The contract through Copyright Clearance Center saw us overseeing the research libraries within the facility.
good,"Eli Lily like so many companies doesn't view a contract employee as an employee. The value and costs that go into on-boarding and training a contract employee are never considered in the long-term. "
good,"Eli Lilly is a great place to work, as the majority of the employees demonstrate high ethics and character.  The only drawback is the location of the headquarters, which makes career advancement (usually requiring relocation) difficult."
good,"Eli Lilly is very dedicated to patient care, and puts it first and foremost."
good,when I hired on this place was great a family style atmosphere when I left it was more corporate and started to take benefits away. while the ceo still gets high pay and a high bonus
good,"Typically analyze business, plan your route and make sales calls. To have success it requires persistence and a marathon type approach. Urgency is also required once the opportunities for growth are uncovered. Change is expected."
good,"Max Super Speciality Hospital was my first organisation."
good,"Es una buena empresa para aprender el rubro farmacéutico, en general con buenos beneficios y buen trato"
good,"Typical day would consist of meetings and troubleshooting, investigations, and project implementations."
good,"I have worked at Eli Lilly and Company for 10 years and have overall enjoyed the ups and downs that have come with a pharmaceutical company.  I have had strong leadership and great developmental support.  Currently, the organization is flattening out.  This will lead to fewer opportunities to advance and meet both personal and professional goals."
good,durate mi estancia en la empresa eli desarrolle metodos de cotratacio mas rapidos pues hacer el papeleo y todos los requisitos de contratacion con muchos y muy extensos mas sin embargo cuando se tiene vocacion y gusto en esta area no queda mas que pasarla bien en recursos humanos y trabajar  con dedicacion y entusiasmo
good,"Bonne société. L'implémentation de nouveaux systèmes informatiques ont découlé sur les licenciements, réorganisation."
good,"Lilly is a company that made it's reputation based on a conservative, 'do it the right way' approach.  Unfortunately, this attempt bled into middle management as an excuse to push sales reps into practices that were ineffective/impractical for today's needs from a pharmaceutical sales representative.  I think that the desire to have a strong culture and pipeline are there, but leadership is lacking to a point where I can see this company merging/selling in order to keep its cash-flow."
good,"Eli Lilly is a good employer, but the cost for business is out of control."
good,"long-standing company with admirable Corporate Values"
good,"I started with Eli Lilly following graduation from college. I have always taken great pride in the company that I work for. I have enjoyed my time at Lilly and have created lifelong relationships and contacts. Lilly allowed me to pursue by ambition to be a results oriented sales representative, as well as be a mother to my 2 children. I would not change one thing about my career with Lilly. I have had the chance to blossom in the sales arena as well as create wonderful relationships with physicians, which in turn allowed them to successfully treat their patients."
good,"calling on cardiologists, pcp's, and hospitals"
good,Great company to gain needed experience within the pharma industry
good,"Having a set two week routing schedule, and prepare the night before which clients I would be seeing and plan a follow-up for the last visit if there were any concerns."
good,"Good place to work overall, and I am happy to be a part of the company.  The size of the company allows moving between different areas and department to continue career development."
good,"A lot of tasks that enrich you with experience "
good,For almost 20 years Lilly provided many career opportunities and experiences that allowed me to grow both personally and professionally. Every single day was for the patients.
good,"Interesting and good work culture"
good,"Lilly's a great company to work for, lots of perks and benefits and above average pay for the Midwest.  Be prepared to work hard and give your all.  The culture is nice and friendly."
good,"Great co-workers. Need more development opportunities, but is a great place to work. Good benefits but management needs to create better professional development."
good,It was an honor to work at a company dedicated to improving lives. It was an extremely fast paced environment.   I worked in the intellectual property handling a large amount of data entry; validation; research; process improvements; software upgrades; teaching and learning.
good,"Heavy workload"
good,This company has a lot of programs that will help you grow professionally and personally with opportunities to volunteer at home and abroad and professional development courses on an annual basis.
good,"I worked for 6 years in the financial service centre in Ireland. In this company they value their employees and they try to improve everyday always thinking about the employees. I gain great experience in an international environment, I left the job for personal circumstances but I would have loved to continue working in such a great environment."
good,"Company expanded at a great pace, however some hiring didnt have good amount of thought process involved.."
good,"I love meeting customers, I learn everyday something new about problems they come across and try to offer solutions"
good,"Company has rich history within the state of Indiana, one of the desired employers in the state.  Opportunities for advancement exist but on average take 7-10 years to move up.  While I was there, a significant external impact resulted in preferential advancements based on gender/ethnicity which discouraged/impaired advancement for others.  Great people, great work, I enjoyed making a difference for patients, and meeting and working with some of the finest people on the planet."
good,"It is a great company to work for, lots of culture and diverse people, great on site cafe and lots of perks for the employees, beautiful building to work in"
good,"A typical day depended on the role. "
good,"Large but bureaucratic company.  Don't expect to be able to do things your own way, as you have to follow set processes.  Consensus driven culture. Recent lay-offs."
good,"Typical day at work: Identify the customer route for that day and set up the order in which you will visit customers. Review any notes from the prior conversation while finding relevant product information that will answer any questions and concerns about products they deal with. "
good,"I saw permanent full-time employees receive the benefits and compensation for my work. Even though they tell you up-front fixed duration employees do not get hired, you still hold out hope that your performance would win out in your favor. Lilly banks on this in the relationship and they become the multifaceted winners."
good,"He obtenido un crecimiento personal y profesional, a traves de la implementacion cultural de la mejora continua."
good,"I've really enjoyed my short time here at Lilly.  I've been able to network with people outside of my function, join groups such as Women in Lilly Leadership, and for the most part have been made to feel like a valuable employee."
good,I personally liked my position and had an excellent manager.  Company is generous with benefits. 
good,"Ik werkte tijdens een overname periode van Novartis naar Elanco Animal Healthcare."
good,It has been truly a blessing to work with such a talented scientists everyday to solve difficult problems and determined to discover new medicines to the patients.
good,"très bon niveau de qualité, des GMP, bonnes opportunités pour intégrer des projets Corporate, amélioration continue en place"
good,"Cyclic jobs and redundancies are standard, so contracts do and will end with no continuation even when managers want to keep you."
good,"I feel as though the position I'm in doesn't involve the degree I've earned and isn't going to lead me to where I want to be. A very good company to work for, but just wasn't for me."
good,"Typical pharma culture of due diligence and integrity"
good,"Empresa com foco no resultado para o paciente, com o objetivo de levar melhorias na saúde de quem precisa."
good,"Great safety culture, unfortunately they did not have a very good path to help retain good employees. They rely too much on fixed duration employees and not enough on making investments in their people."
good,"I worked at Eli Lilly's through a high school program. It was probably the best work experience I could have ever had as a first job. An average day would include me restocking the printers, sorting mail, answering emails, and scheduling appointments. I also took on tasks from others throughout the building, so I do have experience with listening to requests and fulfilling them. I learned a lot of clerical information and about the business environment. I sat right next to my supervisor, which I was apprehensive about at first, but it worked out well in the end. She was never too hovering, but she was always there when I needed her. The workplace was full of diverse and nice people. There was always a smile on everyone's face. The hardest part of the job was taking on more than one large task at a time, but with time management and planning I was able to figure it out. The most enjoyable part of the job was the overall experience itself."
good,"Lilly is a great company. They even provide a long lead time on layoffs, allowing those effected time to look for the next step in their careers. I would not leave accept for the recent layoffs,company-wide."
good,"Good to work in the company not a problem. Management ok partiality goes around, likes and dislikes about person makes it hard to work. Workplace culture is ok, some fun activities is enjoyable."
good,"Pros: Great company overall.  Very good benefits and pay.  Excellent respect for family/work balance in most instances. "
good,"Great place to work for,  good management, Involved with lots of technology for in house and remote workers.   You have a chance to work up through management."
good,"Lilly is a scientifically-driven, progressive organization.  It truly values innovative thinking and rewards strategic-oriented initiatives.  It still has work to do in regards to breaking down the barriers of diversity but it is attempting to make strides in that area"
good,"Over all good experience and very good atmosphere to work with them. There were our client in IBM . "
good,"I've really enjoyed my time with Lilly, but I feel my expertise could bring more value to a more technologically innovative organization."
good,great atmosphere and people to work with chances to learn many new things in order to expand your knowledge and work experience
good,Unique environment where you accomplish good things with great people.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo,buena formación,cafe gratis,comida mala"

good,"Azienda di minuterie metalliche, un buon ambiente lavorativo e molto disponibili."
good,"trying to balance family life and work can become problematic being that thing shifts can change with very little notice or no notice at all. Overall they value their employees. I enjoyed my 15 yrs but with all the dept closings , job shortages happen"
good,"I would come in and start working on projects. These usually involved writing articles, interviewing employees, and emailing the right people. Other than that, there were a lot of meetings."
good,"•Achieved territory ranking in top 20% nationally. "
good,"Lilly is a good company to work for. I have had a great career with them. The past 5 years have been some of the most rewarding, personally and professionally. The dynamic of the company is great and I really do believe they really choose the industry's best to represent their company. My work week is full of planning, executing, and asessing, seeing customers, building trusting relationships, encouraging team members, and staying in contact with my manager. My direct DSM's were the best people to work for and I enjoyed any time I spent with them.  "
good,esperienza estremamente formativa dal punto di vista professionale e personale che mi ha insegnato a gestire opinion leader e mi ha dato sicurezza e spiccate capacità di public speaking
good,Diabetes Sales Specialist
good,Very conservative pharma company. Usually more restrictive in its selling environment versus other companies. Last few years has made solid movement to make changes quicker and respond faster to market conditions.
good,Overall an excellent place to work if you are in the right disease areas.  Pharma happens when patents expire and changing priorities happen but it has a wonderful culture that fosters learning.
good,"Working here was an experience.  The production hours took some time to get used to.  Working 12 hours days are rough for a family oriented person.  Other then that, a good company to work for"
good,"Good products and an exciting pipeline (when I worked there).  Overall culture was good, however, very conservative, risk averse and almost completely paralysed with redtape.  Globally, leadership was impressive.  However, too many examples of incompetent people in leadership/director roles in ANZ."
good,Competitive. Felt judged by w/n you are a full-time employee or a temporary employee. Most people were very friendly. Was a very productive environment.  Overall a nice place to work.
good,"The work life is balanced with recreative activity. Corporate life is good but the city life is boring."
good,"- All employees are really kind and very approachable."
good,Make sure you be yourself  always be on time and do the best you can  the jobs there are fairly easy and the people there are nice as well I loved working there when I was there
good,"Eli Lilly is an excellent company to work for.  The companies commitment to diversity and inclusion is what drew me to the company and it has continued to expand their inclusion programs and acknowledge the different cultures within the workforce."
good,"Viví el hecho de buscar no generar discriminación, ni racial, ni cultural, ni de genero, ni de posición religiosa o política como base para las oportunidades de aprendizaje, desarrollo y crecimiento dentro de la empresa partiendo de la base que su gente es su recurso mas importante. En un gran porcentaje del tiempo y de las actividades tanto laborales como de responsabilidad social Lilly trata de cuidar de su gente, sin embargo en ocasiones por la dimanica del negocio esa cercanía con la gente se pierde un poco y se pierde la esencia de tener como prioridad a la gente."
good,"Company is striving to reduce the average employee age through various channels. Culture is changing to be less focused on retaining talent. Changing benefit packages (e.g., pension system, early retirement packages, focus on campus recruiting)"
good,"I was on staff at Eli Lilly for almost 6 months for a 6 week contract. They recognized my skills and opted to keep me much longer than originally planned, expanding my role. The management team was excellent, and the experience was professional and friendly."
good,"This is a good place to work at because of all the great people that you will encounter while you are there, but management can sometimes be unfair, and as with all places there is favoritism. I think that this place is the first place where it is just EXTREMELY evident, so you have to just come in do your job, and don't let it affect you. Overall I honestly believe that it is a fantastic company, especially with all of the progress that has been made with all of the new medical treatments that have come from there."
good,Ok place to work but advancement difficult. Benefits ok but salary below industry standard in my work area.  Work life balance was ok would work there again if they stop laying people off left and right and get their act together
good,Engaging workshops for students and practical experiences in Biochemical department with hands on mentoring and laboratory procedure practices.  Paired summer internship program events aligned with in-department events and allow for involvement in both for a full experience and understanding of the company.
good,Worked in the distribution center as a summer gig.  Pretty nice for a college summer job with 10 hour days only Mon-Thurs.  Fri-Sun were always off.  Good pay for a college kid too.
good,"Lilly was my first job out of college.  The training was in depth, preparing me for my role, but also for my future outside of Lilly.  I am thankful for my job there."
good,"Typical corporate company with a lot of red tape to go through to get anything done.  However, employees are hard working and dedicated to research and helping patience."
good,"I enjoyed the culture and the people there for the past 25 years, it is fast paced and at time hard work. the new LEAN process that was implemented just before I retired is not good for the maintenance group because it reduced headcount and it made it even harder to manage an already large backlog of work."
good,"Highly ignorant of the real world.  Physicians do not see sale reps any more.  Yet, Lilly in its ignorance, does not accept reality.  And, in its ability to accept reality, it forces sales reps to lie on a daily basis."
good,"Great company, great career, currently trying to downsize and currently offering early retirement packages to many.  Good pipeline, great future.  They will recover from this downsizing."
good,"Lilly NY has a wonderful culture, a real community.  Not very stuffy corporate atmosphere.  The labs are modern and well outfitted.  Located in mid-town on East side close to top notch universities, great for collaboration."
good,"The team members are really nice.  They always have team building  events."

good,"A Empresa prioriza a qualidade dos medicamentos, possui bons salários e benefícios. O clima é agradável."
good,Lilly is a great place to work. Most of the jobs here are contracted out to Vendors. They usually last for three years or more. I would recommend Lilly to a friend.
good,"Great company to work for, however, many of the wonderful benefits this company had (such as tuition reimbursement or peer to peer rewarding) are gone."
good,"Excellent company."
good,"Good place for analytical scientists. strong method development group. excellent benefits. career advancement is not easy and one can get stagnated. large size groups and redundancy, because of which one can get cornered into highly specialized niches"
good,Empresa preocupada em melhorar a vida dos pacientes através da descoberta e inovação em produção de medicamentos de alta qualidade.
good,"Good work-life balance but very hard to move forward in a career path. Many career opportunities exist at Indianapolis headquarters but not at other locations. Salary is amazing for Indiana employees but not for other locations. Salary is based on Indiana cost of living, which is problematic if you work/live in a higher cost of living location. Promotions are very difficult to get and rarely happen. However, they do prefer to higher within as often as possible in order to retain talent. Many have been employees for 20+ years. Benefits are average; great dental, average medical, rough vision, FSA available. Average time-off policies.No increase in time-off until 10 years of service. 6% 401k match and every full-time employee participates in pension plan at 5 years of service. New CEO at time of this review so it is too early to provide feedback. The best part of working at Lilly are the employees. Everyone is very friendly and genuinely helps others to succeed. A real team environment. Lots of volunteer opportunities to help local community."
good,"amazing opportunity to polish my skills,"
good,"Great company with fantastic goals to help improve customer's lives.  However, it's not the same company Colonial Eli Lilly began.  It's not 'employee' focused like it used to be.  Employee's are a 'number' and disposable."
good,"There are many initiatives on diversity and inclusion as well as career progression. However, once certain levels are reached further career progression is limited. Overall, there is an emphasis on employee engagement and creating a positive work environment."
good,Work atmosphere is very good here.All the co-workers are very friendly and co-operative.Management is very friendly.The hardest part of the job is close deadlines.
good,Equipo de compañeros con amplia capacidad de trabajo y buenos conocimientos científicos.

good,"I work daily with engineers, owner users and maintenance staff providing plans to predict, prevent and maintain equipment and machines, while offering feedback to appropriate personnel to improve performance.  Always thorough with a strong attention to detail.  Constantly looking for ways to improve and promote quality.  Monitor my own work and junior staff to ensure quality and eliminate errors.  Ability to understand and carry out instructions furnished in oral, written or diagram form.  Have common sense reasoning with very strong problem solving capabilities.  Self-starter and natural born leader, working to promote a strong team environment with excellent customer service skills."
good,Great culture but too slow in making decisions. Nice place to work.

good,"Developed my carreer with Training/Learnings and coaching form the company."
good,"Both positions were very detailed; for the VP I scheduled travel accommodations, handled his calendar and set up meetings; I also typed letters & presentations as needed."
good,"Had reduction in staff. Took early retirement, since future was uncertain with the company. Co workers pretty great on the whole. Had decent wage and vacation time after 30 years. Stress was  sometimes high..but worth dealing with."
good,"Eli Lilly is a great company to work for with incredbile advancement opportunities.  The sales rep position is one of the best positions in the entire company.  The primary objective of a pharmaceutical representative is to build strong relationships with health care providers and to provide the HCP and their staff with ongoing education and relevant informaton, including solutions and resources that help the HCP reach their patient's treatment goal.  If you're looking to advance your success as a rep is largely contingent upon your ability to influence prescribing habits, how quickly you can connect and build relationships as well as how adept your District Sales Manager is at developing and leading people, how well they are able to help you establish and make connections with key managers within your district as well as with management inside corporate.     "
good,"Having a true entrepreneurial mindset is a goal of mine in sales. I have the power to make local-business decisions based upon the customer and market knowledge I have acquired. This will allow for me to anticipate and meet the needs of my customers, help patients and ultimately, drive business results."

good,"I spent nearly 25 years at Eli Lilly and Company and will be forever grateful for the opportunities I was given, the people I worked with, and the places I saw, while in their employ.  In large part, my experience at Lilly shaped who I have become."
good,"Provide  many opportunities to develop my personal and professional skills "
good,Lilly is still a great place to work despite the CEO. Focus on how Col. Eli Lilly wanted the company to be run. Should Promote based on most qualified for position not to meet a numbers game.
good,"i was on a contract so this posting may not apply versus regular employees.  My contract was supposed to be for 2 years, but all of the contract in my division were cancelled after 1 year."
good,Good experience overall. A wealth of opportunities and specialities. Best benefits and work/life balance. Company policies are working to foster a safer environment but policies have not yet matriculated throughout organization. Not all management meets quality leadership standards. Professional development not deeply prioritized. Room for improvement creating diverse work environment.

good,"A great place to work in Cork, very good management and a new office building."
good,"It was good whem I was there but I worked with a couple guys that were very difficult to work with. It could had been possible that they looked at me as a contract employee so they felt superior. It was said that other women had that position and they dealt with the same problem from these two. I resigned at that time, but I was not truly satisfied with that decision but I needed the peace.I felt belittled and I felt I could had been more productive during my training but I thought it was best. The supervision was good they did not put a lot of pressure on you , they wanted you to learn the job and be good at it. They offered many training classes and welcomed our input. Today I look back I really wish I had not resigned because I really liked that job it was very interesting. When I left the exit interview showed me how caring this company is, they wanted to make sure that I was not harassed or pushed out in any way, they made me feel special and appreciated. I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked Eli Lilly, A great place to work."
good,"Generally I think my experience at Eli Lilly and Company was positive overall.  I worked on interesting projects with dedicated smart co-workers. The level of science and integrity is top notch.  My managers gave me a lot of autonomy to perform my job.  The company prides itself on the numbers of female middle managers.  Many (but not all) of these women I reported to over the years were incompetent managers. Because Lilly is located in Indianapolis, people tend to stay with the company for a longer period of time than for East or West Coast pharma companies, resulting in a conservative, risk-adverse culture when it comes to embracing new ideas. There is a strong unconscious bias towards people with some background in Indiana (eg- went to college, grew up here) when it comes to getting plum work assignments and hence, promotions."
good,"In the ten years I worked with Lilly I had exceptional training, opportunity and advancement.  Most of all, I was able to impact the lives of patients and their families in a positive and meaningful way.  For that I am very grateful."
good,"It's an excellent place to work. Excellent emphasis in security daily to prevent / minimize accidents.  Sadly, since things in the island of Puerto Rico overall are lacking and jobs are steadily declining, the opportunities on this company or any other are scarce. You mostly work as a contractor for 3 years tops and since there´s no opportunity for a permanent position you have to go after your contract ends. According to what I've seen to mid 2018 year, the last person to get a permanent position was around 7 years ago, which is sad. The company is awesome, and I would love to be a permanent part of the team, but sadly that can´t be the case, because the island overall is badly affected by the recent economy changes in general, and  so are the companies in it."
good,"Started my career there and really was able to be exposed to all kinds of different functions early on. This gave me the appetite for R&D as well as commercial functions."
good,"Lilly offered a great corporate culture and work life balance.   There was minimal opportunity for advancement and minimal opportunity for compensation increase even with exceptional performance.  There was a great deal of ""busy"" work and time wasted on conference calls and not enough selling."

good,"užasné místo, ale stále je vše státní organizací a tak tabulkový plat ... ano, bohaté odměny, ale zavisí na dosaženém výdělání, dělám práci vysokoškoláka a komunikuji s doktory a profesory, ale mám jen maturitu a tak mi nikdo přidat nemůže, navíc po změně vedení v administrativě už mě to tam dál tak nemotivuje jako dříve"

good,A typical day involves learning. It also teach people how to wait patiently. i learned how to clam irate customer down by understanding their needs and wants.

El desarrollo lo lanzabamos a última hora del día para tener los datos por la mañana y decidir  por qué ruta íbamos a seguir la purificación. El trabajo tenía un cocnocimiento muy profundo de las técnicas cromatográfias como HPLC y SFC. Empleábamos detectores UV y masas por lo que sé reconocer ambos espectros. Igualmente teníamos que dar una calidad a estas muestras dependiendo del tipo de ensayo para el que fueran. Generalmente estábamos asegurando una pureza mayor del 95%."

good,"A typical work day includes making sales calls to physicians, providing them solutions to thier problems. "
good,"I try to see eight decision makers a day (not always possible in today's environment but I like to set goals for myself.)  Since I have been in my territory for so long and have built strong relationships, it is a little easier to do than for others in my industry.  There are 6 reps in my territory but, of the 3 products I market, I only share 1 product with 3 other people.  My ""team"" is fantastic.  We work tremendously well together as we have worked hard on creating that open/honest relationship where feedback is given and appreciated. "
good,Sell a variety of medications to physicians in your territory on a daily basis. Good commision if you perfrom well with a good work/life balance.

good,"I have been very lucky to have some of the same physicians and their staff for the past seven years even though my products, team members and managers have changed I have had the ability to not let any of that effect the relationships that I have built with my physicians.

good,I was pleased with my career at Lilly's and particularly happy with my last role there.  I was very disappointed when they move the work off-shore.  The disbursements/cash manager is a critical role for Lilly's and it certainly didn't make sense to transition this work away from Corp and away from the US.

good,"Fast Paced Working Environment. Often set back by various delays, so must adjust to ever-changing timelines. High potential for development within the Pharma industry and very motivating atmosphere to accomplish and do good work."
good,"My position was multitasking.  Setting up shipments.  Weekly spreadsheets updated.  Supporting my associate director daily with reports, researching, filing, greeting vendors, etc.  Updating training records.  Learning new software.  Hardest part of the job was to keep up in a timely fashion.  I enjoyed helping any co worker in the department."

good,it is very fun experience and great team to work with.  Good learning opportunities and lots of training. Good work like balance. Would recommend working there.

good,"Good company overall for working parents.  However, your job can be easily eliminated regardless of tenure or performance.  Human Resources is very helpful at assisting with placement into another role if openings are present.  It's 50/50 on getting an honest, development-focused manager.  Bonus structure is flawed and below industry norm."
good,"A typical day at work included meeting with my supervisor or one of my mentors and discussing the work to do for the day. A vast majority of the people were extremely friendly and were more than willing to help me or assist with anything I needed. The workplace was relaxed while still maintaining a business feel to it. Several intern events also kept you busy, however, sometimes it felt as though all the intern events cut into getting your work done."
good,Have learnt alot .. Work atmosphere is very challenging. management is great. Workplace culture is very good. Healthy relation with all my colleagues.

good,"great benefits, awesome co-workers, lots to learn"
good,"Lilly is currently in the midst of a transformation. Change is happening quickly and different part of the organizations are being impacted more than others. Strategically, the company has made some tough but necessary decisions. If pipeline delivers, Lilly should be in a position of power over the next 5-10 years relative to their competitors."

There are clear career path, competitive employee benefit and fulfillment with all kinds of opportunities and challenges."
good,This is an excellent company with a great team of people who are able to promote proven products.  Eli Lilly has an extensive portfolio and excellent leadership.

Aprendí de mis colegas el valor del trabajo en equipo y lo más difícil fué la separación de algunos compañeros de línea que se fueron a otros laboratorios. Lo que más me gustó es la confianza que le da la compañía a sus trabajadores, ya que no se tienen citas de contacto."

good,"I was doing MBA intern there. HR in the company was great, but project manager really depends. During my internship there, more than half of the time my project manager was not there. That limited my learning and chances to understand the company."

good,"-Not a busy typical work day"
good,"Excellent place to work. Management understands that Lilly meds are not appropriate for everone. Focused on positive patient outcomes. Providing solutions to physician/patient challenges is primary focus. Refreshing to be involved with ethical and moral company. Co-workers are very supportive and willing to assist reps that need help (ie. vacation, maternity, sickness, etc.). The hardest part of the job is giving effective and valuable info to a busy physician. Time is limited. Access is becoming increasingly difficult. Established relationships are a huge benefit. I  will say that one of the best parts of the job is the interaction with the office staff.  When you are able to assist them in some way to help a patient have a positive experience with one of your medications, nothing is more rewarding!"

good,"Everyday is different...never the same day twice. I have learned that building your skills and seeking knowledge will advance you within the company. My co-workers will step in when they can if you need help. The hardest part of the job is not having enough people on the team to cover the workload that is in our group which can make things very hectic. The most enjoyable part about my job is at the end the day, the patients are benefitting from what we do on a daily basis."
good,Career diversity is a given. Opportunity to develop and apply learning is standard. Intelligent and competent colleagues.

Then networking and leading meetings to deliver on projects. As all areas of Lilly are a matrix organization it is imperative to both understand the organization and work cross functionally across numerous functions to be successful. Management and culture can vary from one area of Lilly to another, for example in one business unit the operating mode was very exclusive ""need to know"" while others are much more inclusive."

However, I'm glad I only worked there through a summer program. Some of the employees are disgruntled, which in turn makes them step all over you. Because there are so many branches and employees, it was difficult to feel like you're more than just a number to them."
good,"Lilly has the best work environment.  They expect a lot out of their people but they give a lot in return.  They have fantastic facilities and put a focus on work/life balance."
good,"ImClone Systems was a great company to work for.  As large as the company was, most employees knew everyone they worked with or on the campus which helped to balance out job tasks and made for a much better day in the long run.  Even though the daily tasks were similar, there was always some small detail that was different which helped to make the job more enticing and kept the employees interested.

good,I retired from Lilly the people I generally encountered were good people.  The culture has changed as the organization has gotten younger.  The younger employees don't understand the culture and are much more self centered.  I left to avoid a confrontation with an immature director with less experience than me but was a good suck up.

I feel very positive about my training from Lilly in the diabetes disease state as well as continued training throughout my time with them.  The good part was that I didn't know my territory was extremely difficult and possibly the most difficult access territory in the country.  Since I didn't know any better, I didn't feel that this was a negative and I think that's one of the reasons I was as successful as I was throughout my time.  Many very well-qualified co-workers that are passionate about what they do and making a difference everyday.  "

good,"I was a summer intern with very little expectations. I thought I'd simply be given some low-risk project and end up enclosing myself in my own bubble. I was entirely wrong. Although my project was a simple proof-of-concept, it was meant to be as elegant, well designed and high functioning  as possible as to emphasize its potential value. Further, VPs, directors, managers, and mostly any co-worker will make themselves available for 1:1 time, regardless of ""status"". I never would have imagined that I'd be able to schedule 1:1 time with my senior directors as casually as I was encouraged, but the people in Lilly really make an effort to be there for you."
good,"Very productive learning experience. Some down time that could have been used elsewhere, but very enjoyable. Training needed to be available in a more useful manner."

good,"As a Summer Replacement Student, my responsibilities were mandated by my supervisor, who instructed my direct manager on my duties every week. I had a clear itinerary my whole time at Eli Lilly, and this was absolutely great for me as I never had a dull moment. The work felt meaningful as I had to contact personally many people in my lab area to glean their opinions on the work I was doing, and my work ultimately benefited the whole group. Coordinating the agendas of multiple coworkers proved to be the most challenging part of the job, as I had never had to make contact with so many people across a company as large as Eli Lilly. After working at Eli Lilly as a Summer Replacement Student, I learned some new lab techniques and improved interpersonal skills."

good,"Over my many years with Eli Lilly and Company I learned many daily life skills of how to become a successful professional employee.  I was given many opportunities to experience different departments alone with opportunities in community service.  The areas I have experienced start with marketing through manufacturing ending in distribution.  I also have support area experience in procurement and IT.  I was given a very worldly diverse education in a professional environment through this company and for that I am very grateful.   As the company changed so did the level of job security that I am greatly sadden to have experienced, but owe all my professional education to the company for which I am proud to say I was a third generation employee."
good,"Good place to work, with a lot of benefits and continuous learning, but is a very stressful environment."
good,good organisation.
good,"A sales rep at Eli Lilly is expected to work from 8-5 P.M. Monday thru Friday. Usually there is about 1-2 hours of work when you get home at night depending on e-mail volume and the products that you promote. The ongoing training that Lilly offers its employees is exceptional and ever changing. Like most companies, upward mobility has become very difficult because Branded drug patent expirations and lack of bringing new innovative medications to the marketplace. Sales forces have limited movement as well as management on a yearly basis. Overall, I think Lilly has excellent management and my co-workers in the 12 years with Lilly have been really honest and good people. The most difficult part of the job is getting face time with your customers on a daily basis. Interactions are often very short and more and more hospital system and offices have completely closed their doors to reps making it very hard to influence or change customers habits when it comes to how they choose which medication they feel is best for their patients. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with teammates that have very similar goals and challenges as you on a daily basis and finding ways to get the job done no matter what or how difficult the challenge may be."
good,Good core values and a very customer focused company.
good,Expensive resources with oportunities to explore different areas of interest in the pharama industry. Significant opporunites to interact on multidiciplanary teams.
good,"I had to produce reports that reached people I never met."
good,"I really enjoyed my internship in Lilly, Kinsale. As a summer student, my team leader and those working within the team could not have been more helpful. Any tasks that were provided, I was assured that if the work load was too much, there was always somebody to share it with if needed. The company hold mental and physical health and general safety in high regard and there are different campaigns every quarter, one of which I had the pleasure of being involved in."
good,"Great Career however, I felt it was impossible to climb any higher than I could and sort of felt pushed into retirement after completing almost 33 years. It has a great culture and I honestly think that Work/Life Balance is very important to the company."

good,Il posto di lavoro è molto piacevole e il personale sempre disponibile.

good,"My day ranged from a slow steady stream to ""I need to reprioritize again"".  I was able to develop my adminstrative skills to include project support.  The environment is social and my colleagues became like a family - with boundaries. The hardest part of the job was convincing our customers to be patient while we found the ""right"" training solution.  The most enjoyable part of the job was delivering a training solution to key stockholders. I also enjoyed lunching with my colleagues."

I met some absolutely fantastic chemists and lifelong friends there and I wouldn't change it for anything! I was, however, let go in a corporate reshuffle of the chemistry division (the group now is a shadow of what it was when I was there).

good,"The typical day at work is great. The people are amazing that work there. The management is extremely patient, knowledgable and considerate. It is east to learn a lot in a short amount of time at Eli Lilly."

This company is making a difference for patients and for the city of Indianapolis and all of the other communities in which it has employees. A high-class company.
good,"Respectable company to work for with a great work culture. Employees are very knowledgeable, nice, and helpful. Most enjoyable part is you can schedule your work week yourself and you are always going new places and meeting new people. Least enjoyable part is the job is like running your own business, so it requires work ""after the clock"". Typical day would be a conference call in the morning or evening, then drive to different offices talking to doctors about your product and their patients and leaving samples, then picking up lunch and taking it to an office and talking to the employees and doctors about your products, then coming home and doing expenses, inventory, emails, etc."

good,"Any day can run completely different then another. There are the tasks at hand that run in parallel with the given every day tasks. There can be requests that come in from various sources which involve being in different  places of the company campus. Sometimes it can be stressful prioritizing when given on short notice the tasks that are time sensitive. I have learned to try to be more open and ""stay loose"" to be able to adapt faster to unforeseen changes. Management sometimes doesn't know what the left hand is doing from the right hand. So I would have to logically make the decision.  The work place culture has become more diverse. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning that you have made people happy when you did something for them. Its nice when they give you ""recognition inspire rewards"" where you can get gifts."

good,"Even though there was always a sense of urgency to get work done, there was not nearly as much stress as you would expect. I believe that in most departments, management understood the difficulties we faced and did not have expectations that were not attainable. You don't find that at most large companies. They knew the talent was there, and people did their best and went beyond what was expected at times. Coworkers were always willing to help even when they really didn't have time to spare. Best place I have ever worked."

good,"I loved working at Eli Lilly and have worked 2 contracts there over the years. It's a great place if you like the corporate world. Personally I do so I ""thrived"" there. Unfortunately, some of the contract companies treat their employees like garbage. In almost 5 years there I only had ""one"" Lilly employee say anything about me being a ""Red Striper"". (Contractor badges has a stripe of red to quickly identify contractors.) Since most of IT were contractors, it wasn't a big deal. I'd go back in a second, but the contract companies are so bad and Lilly has a strict requirement of College Degrees. You probably need a degree to be a janitor. So it's a great place if you can get on there. But even if you have YEARS of experience, if you don't have a degree you'll never get hired. :-("
good,"Teamwork is great, very amicable place to work - each associate helps new comers in their departments to know the regulations, layout of the plant, introduces other associates that may be interfacing.  Management is very understanding and willing to work with new hires; there are walking trails for exercise, fun activities for special occasions, vendors brought in for lunches."

A week after I left, as there were only a few jobs left internally to apply for, another reallocation was announced.  Sad but where one door closes another is open somewhere for you to walk through.  Eli Lilly was a great place to work and the people were awesome.  I will miss it."

The only downside is ...they sometimes have reallocation and employees in certain departments have so much time to find another job within the company.  But it is part of the business if you've ever worked Pharma/Research.

good,"My typical day of work would start around 6:00 a.m. I handled the daily inbox for the Training and Development branch of HR at Eli Lilly. I started by prioritizing issues and requests from customers with Eli Lilly. I handled all urgent requests, then moved on to trouble shooting any issues that could have been potentially created by one of my processors. After getting through the emails that had come in overnight (we were global) I moved on to allocating work to all processors for the day and ensured that tasks were completed by the end of the work day. This included pulling raw data from a company specific data base and formatting into a ""daily sheet"" for each processor. I would then move on to any of my daily complex reporting and formatting in Excel. I also handled all reporting for Six Sigma and ECIA in Metrics that Matter. All research and trouble shooting was handled in SAP and Citrix/Leads. My team and co-workers including the Lilly Global Training Data Stewards always worked above and beyond to ensure compliance for Eli Lilly's employees and specific departments. The hardest part of my job is that I was a single mother and working, on average, 65 hours a week. The least amount of hours I logged was 50 and the most in one week was 98. I worked morning, night, and weekends and my time with my daughter was very limited. I developed an incredible skill set working at Eli Lilly.

good,"I absolutely loved my job working at lilly. It was a great place to work and the benefits were wonderful. It was very flexible depending on where you worked. I was fortunate to be able to work flex time when needed and that was great for me. I had to drive 2 hours to work and my manager was very understanding of my situation. I was allowed to come in late when the weather was bad, because I started my day at 5:00 in the morning so I was usually up at 2:00 am and left for work at 3:00 am."
good,"great people, great job, value the job greatly, fun environment"
good,"I was able to learn a great deal about the Pharma industry which gave me a greater appreciation of the drug development process. Departments there believe in getting the job done through a team environment. My co-workers were always willing to step in when necessary so that we can all meet common goals. Management was very supportive and always wanted you to be the ""best of the best"" through a continued learning environment. I enjoyed the flexibility and how Lilly paved the way for me to learn all that I did during my time there. The hardest part of the job was knowing that my time would soon come to an end due to the fix duration employee status because I loved what I did."
good,"I was hired as a clinical technical administrative assistant, which included regular administrative tasks and calendaring."
good,Internship spots are by word-of-mouth only. There were about 30 interns in summer 2019. Each intern was placed in a group based on where their skills fit best. Each intern had to prepare and give a research proposal presentation within the first month and a final research data presentation on their last week. Very high stress. Very high stakes.
good,"Easy to get the job done."
good,"A typical day at work for me was making sure food was prepped for the night dinner rush and for events and caterings. I learned how to make foods in-house and everything was homemade. Management was great and worked around my busy school schedule which I really appreciated. The workplace culture was great, everyone got along and worked together as a team to get things done. Probably the hardest thing about the job was filling in for the amount of people who called out and having to do some of the tasks they were supposed to do and ours."
